              "He concluded in a 1939 paper in the Annals of Mathematics that the idea was \u201cnot convincing\u201d and the phenomena did not exist \u201cin the real world.",
              "\u201d The unveiling of the first-ever picture of a black hole by the Event Horizon Telescope in April 2019, however, not only confirmed Einstein\u2019s original theory, but also provided indisputable proof that the gravitational monsters are, in fact, real.",
              "As described by American physicist John A.",
              "Wheeler, general relativity governs the nature of space-time, particularly how it reacts in the presence of matter: \u201cmatter tells space-time how to curve, and space-time tells matter how to move.",

              "In mathematics, singularities are interesting numerical solutions, but astrophysical singularities were, at the time, thought to be an abomination\u2014 there was no known mechanism that could produce them.",
              "Schwarzschild, however, persisted until his death in 1916, realizing that an astrophysical singularity would warp space-time so severely that even light would not be fast enough to get out of the space-time hole that the singularity would create.",

              "Though this was an interesting concept, there was no known mechanism that could create a singularity in nature, so the idea was largely overlooked.",
              "That was until 1935, when Indian astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar realized that, should a massive star run out of fuel, the sheer gravitational pressure of that mass would be concentrated to a point, causing space-time to collapse in on itself.",

              "And it wasn\u2019t until 1967, 12 years after Einstein\u2019s death in 1955, that these astrophysical singularities became known as \u201cblack holes\u201d\u2014a term coined by American physicist John A.",

              "In Schwarzschild's original paper, he put what we now call the event horizon at the origin of his coordinate system.",
              "In this paper he also introduced what is now known as the Schwarzschild radial coordinate (r in the equations above), as an auxiliary variable.",
              "In his equations, Schwarzschild was using a different radial coordinate that was zero at the Schwarzschild radius.",
              "A more complete analysis of the singularity structure was given by David Hilbert[13] in the following year, identifying the singularities both at r = 0 and r = rs.",
              "Although there was general consensus that the singularity at r = 0 was a 'genuine' physical singularity, the nature of the singularity at r = rs remained unclear.",
              "[14] In 1921 Paul Painleve\u0301 and in 1922 Allvar Gullstrand independently produced a metric, a spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's equations, which we now know is coordinate transformation of the Schwarzschild metric, Gullstrand\u2013Painleve\u0301 coordinates, in which there was no singularity at r = rs.",
              "They, however, did not recognize that their solutions were just coordinate transforms, and in fact used their solution to argue that Einstein's theory was wrong.",
              "In 1924 Arthur Eddington produced the first coordinate transformation (Eddington\u2013Finkelstein coordinates) that showed that the singularity at r = rs was a coordinate artifact, although he also seems to have been unaware of the significance of this discovery.",
              "Later, in 1932, Georges Lemai\u0302tre gave a different coordinate transformation (Lemai\u0302tre coordinates) to the same effect and was the first to recognize that this implied that the singularity at r = rs was not physical.",
              "In 1939 Howard Robertson showed that a free falling observer descending in the Schwarzschild metric would cross the r = rs singularity in a finite amount of proper time even though this would take an infinite amount of time in terms of coordinate time t.",
              "[14] In 1950, John Synge produced a paper[15] that showed the maximal analytic extension of the Schwarzschild metric, again showing that the singularity at r = rs was a coordinate artifact and that it represented two horizons.",
              "A similar result was later rediscovered by George Szekeres,[16] and independently Martin Kruskal.",
              "[17] The new coordinates nowadays known as Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates were much simpler than Synge's but both provided a single set of coordinates that covered the entire spacetime.",
              "However, perhaps due to the obscurity of the journals in which the papers of Lemai\u0302tre and Synge were published their conclusions went unnoticed, with many of the major players in the field including Einstein believing that the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was physical.",
              "[14] Synge's later derivation of the Szekeres-Kruskal metric solution,[18] which was motivated by a desire to avoid \"using 'bad' [Schwarzschild] coordinates to obtain 'good' [Szekeres-Kruskal] coordinates,\" has been generally under-appreciated in the literature, but was adopted by Chandrasekhar in his black hole monograph.",
              "[19] Real progress was made in the 1960s when the mathematically rigorous formulation cast in terms of differential geometry entered the field of general relativity, allowing more exact definitions of what it means for a Lorentzian manifold to be singular.",
              "This led to definitive identification of the r = rs singularity in the Schwarzschild metric as an event horizon, i.",

              "Since the Schwarzschild metric is expected to be valid only for those radii larger than the radius R of the gravitating body, there is no problem as long as R > rs.",
              "For ordinary stars and planets this is always the case.",
              "For example, the radius of the Sun is approximately 700000 km, while its Schwarzschild radius is only 3 km.",
              "The singularity at r = rs divides the Schwarzschild coordinates in two disconnected patches.",
              "The exterior Schwarzschild solution with r > rs is the one that is related to the gravitational fields of stars and planets.",

              "The singularity at r = rs is an illusion however;",
              "it is an instance of what is called a coordinate singularity.",
              "As the name implies, the singularity arises from a bad choice of coordinates or coordinate conditions.",

              "Using a different coordinate transformation one can then relate the extended external patch to the inner patch.",
              "[20] The case r = 0 is different, however.",
              "If one asks that the solution be valid for all r one runs into a true physical singularity, or gravitational singularity, at the origin.",
              "To see that this is a true singularity one must look at quantities that are independent of the choice of coordinates.",
              "One such important quantity is the Kretschmann invariant, which is given by At r = 0 the curvature becomes infinite, indicating the presence of a singularity.",
              "At this point the metric cannot be extended in a smooth manner (the Kretschmann invariant involves second derivatives of the metric), spacetime itself is then no longer well-defined.",
              "Furthermore, Sbierski [21] showed the metric cannot be extended even in a continuous manner.",
              "For a long time it was thought that such a solution was non-physical.",
              "However, a greater understanding of general relativity led to the realization that such singularities were a generic feature of the theory and not just an exotic special case.",
              "The Schwarzschild solution, taken to be valid for all r > 0, is called a Schwarzschild black hole.",
              "It is a perfectly valid solution of the Einstein field equations, although (like other black holes) it has rather bizarre properties.",
              "For r < rs the Schwarzschild radial coordinate r becomes timelike and the time coordinate t becomes spacelike.",
              "[22] A curve at constant r is no longer a possible worldline of a particle or observer, not even if a force is exerted to try to keep it there;",
              "this occurs because spacetime has been curved so much that the direction of cause and effect (the particle's future light cone) points into the singularity.",
              "[citation needed] The surface r = rs demarcates what is called the event horizon of the black hole.",
              "It represents the point past which light can no longer escape the gravitational field.",
              "Any physical object whose radius R becomes less than or equal to the Schwarzschild radius has undergone gravitational collapse and become a black hole.",
              "The Schwarzschild solution can be expressed in a range of different choices of coordinates besides the Schwarzschild coordinates used above.",

              "It should not, however, be confused with a gravity well.",
              "No ordinary (massive or massless) particle can have a worldline lying on the paraboloid, since all distances on it are spacelike (this is a cross-section at one moment of time, so any particle moving on it would have an infinite velocity).",
