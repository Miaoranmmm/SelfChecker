    "query": "What key cultural factors have influenced the development of French cuisine, and how have these elements contributed to its reputation as one of the world's most renowned culinary traditions?",
    "response": "That's a great question. French cuisine is one of the world's most renowned culinary traditions, and it has been influenced by many cultural factors over the centuries. Some of the key factors are:\n\n- **Geography**: France has a diverse landscape and climate, which allows for a variety of agricultural products and regional specialties. For example, the coastal regions are known for their seafood dishes, such as bouillabaisse and moules-frites, while the mountainous regions are famous for their cheese and charcuterie, such as raclette and saucisson[^4^]. France also has access to many imported ingredients from its former colonies, such as spices, coffee, chocolate, and exotic fruits[^3^].\n- **History**: France has a rich and turbulent history that has shaped its gastronomic identity. Some of the historical events that have influenced French cuisine are the medieval feudal system, which created a distinction between the lavish banquets of the nobility and the simple fare of the peasants[^2^]; the French Revolution, which abolished the guilds and allowed more chefs to open their own restaurants[^2^]; and the Napoleonic wars, which introduced new ingredients and techniques from other European countries[^2^].\n- **Art**: France is a hub of artistic expression and innovation, and this is reflected in its cuisine. French chefs have always valued presentation, creativity, and elegance in their dishes, and have experimented with different styles and methods over time. Some of the artistic movements that have influenced French cuisine are haute cuisine, which focused on refined and elaborate dishes in small portions[^2^]; nouvelle cuisine, which emphasized fresh and natural ingredients in light and simple dishes[^1^]; and molecular gastronomy, which applied scientific principles and techniques to create novel textures and flavors[^1^].\n- **Fashion**: France is also a fashion capital, and its cuisine follows the trends and tastes of its society. French cuisine is known for its sophistication and elegance, but also for its adaptability and diversity. French chefs have incorporated influences from other cuisines, such as Italian, Spanish, Asian, African, and Caribbean, to create fusion flavors that appeal to a global audience[^1^]. French cuisine also reflects the changing lifestyles and preferences of its people, such as vegetarianism, organic farming, and sustainability[^1^].\n\nThese are some of the key cultural factors that have influenced the development of French cuisine, and how they have contributed to its reputation as one of the world's most renowned culinary traditions.

              "Wheat and corn (maize) are the main grains, with other cereals, such as barley and oats, becoming progressively less important.",
              "There are few areas of the country where cereals are not grown, although the bulk of production originates in the Paris Basin and southwestern France, where both natural conditions and (in the former case) proximity to markets favour such activity.",
              "A considerable area (about one-seventh of the agricultural area), predominantly in western France, is also given over to forage crops, although the acreage has been shrinking since the early 1980s as dairy herds have been reduced in accordance with EU guidelines.",
              "In contrast, there has been a substantial increase in oilseed output;",
              "the area under cultivation has quadrupled since the early 1980s and now approaches one-tenth of agricultural land.",
              "Vines, fruits, and vegetables cover only a limited area but represent more than one-fourth of the total value of agricultural output.",
              "France is probably more famous for its wines than any other country in the world.",
              "Viticulture and wine making are concentrated principally in Languedoc-Roussillon and in the Bordeaux area, but production also occurs in Provence, Alsace, the Rho\u0302ne and Loire valleys, Poitou-Charentes, and the Champagne region.",
              "There has been a marked fall in the production of vin ordinaire, a trend related to EU policy, which favours an increase in the output of quality wines.",
              "Fruit production (mainly of apples, pears, and peaches) is largely concentrated in the Rho\u0302ne and Garonne valleys and in the Mediterranean region.",
              "Vegetables are also grown in the lower Rho\u0302ne and Mediterranean areas, but a large part of output comes from western France (Brittany) and the southwest and the northern re\u0301gion of Hauts-de-France, where sugar beets and potatoes are produced.",
              "Cattle raising occurs in most areas of the country (except in Mediterranean regions), especially in the more humid regions of western France.",
              "Animal-related production accounts for more than one-third of the total value of agricultural output.",
              "In general, herds remain small, although concentration into larger units is increasing.",
              "Overall, however, the number of cattle has been falling since the early 1980s, largely as a result of EU milk quotas.",
              "These have adversely affected major production areas such as Auvergne, Brittany, Basse-Normandie, Pays de la Loire, Rho\u0302ne-Alpes, Lorraine, Nord\u2013Pas-de-Calais, and Franche-Comte\u0301.",
              "One result has been an increasing orientation toward beef rather than dairy breeds, notably in the area of the Massif Central.",
              "The raising of pigs and poultry, frequently by intensive methods, makes up more than one-tenth of the value of agricultural output.",
              "Production is concentrated in the re\u0301gions of Brittany and Pays de la Loire, encouraged originally by the availability of by-products from the dairy industry for use as feed.",
              "Sheep raising is less important.",
              "Flocks graze principally in southern France on the western and southern fringes of the Massif Central, in the western Pyrenees, and in the southern Alps.",
              "Agriculture has changed in other ways.",
              "Farm structures have been modified substantially, and the number of holdings have been greatly reduced since 1955, numerous small farms disappearing.",
              "By the late 1990s there were fewer than 700,000 holdings, compared with more than 2,000,000 in the mid-1950s and more than 1,000,000 in the late 1980s.",
              "The average size of farms has risen considerably, to close to 100 acres (40 hectares).",
              "Large holdings are located primarily in the cereal-producing regions of the Paris Basin, while small holdings are most common in Mediterranean regions, the lower Rho\u0302ne valley, Alsace, and Brittany.",
              "Important technical changes have also occurred, ranging from the increased use of intermediate products such as fertilizers and pesticides to the widespread use of irrigation (nearly one-tenth of agricultural land is now irrigated) and the growth of crops within controlled environments, such as under glass or plastic canopies.",
              "Marketing systems have also been modified, as an increasing proportion of output is grown under contract.",
              "Together such changes have led to a remarkable increase in output of major agricultural products, but they have also resulted in a large reduction in the number of agricultural workers and the increased indebtedness of many farmers, and the related negative effects on the environment have given rise to the organic farming movement.",
              "With more than 57,000 square miles (148,000 square km) of woodland, France possesses one of the largest afforested areas in western Europe, offering direct employment to more than 80,000 people.",
              "Forested areas are unevenly distributed, with the majority lying to the east of a line from Bordeaux to the Luxembourg border.",
              "Aquitaine and Franche-Comte\u0301 have a particularly dense forest cover.",
              "This vast resource is, however, generally underexploited, partly because of the multitude of private owners, many of whom are uninterested in the commercial management of their estates.",
              "Less than one-fourth of the afforested area is controlled by the National Office of Forests.",
              "Despite the extent of France\u2019s coastlines and its numerous ports, the French fishing industry remains relatively small.",
              "Annual catches have averaged about 700,000 tons since the mid-1970s, and by the 21st century there were fewer than 16,500 fishermen.",
              "The industry\u2019s problems are related to its fragmented character and to inadequate modernization of boats and port facilities, as well as to overfishing and pollution.",
              "Activity is now concentrated in the port of Boulogne in Nord\u2013Pas-de-Calais and to a lesser degree in ports in Brittany such as Concarneau, Lorient, and Le Guilvinic.",
              "France is also known for its aquaculture, with activity increasing over recent years along the coastal waters of western France.",
              "Oyster beds are found particularly in the southwest, centred on Marennes-Ole\u0301ron."

              "With fish soup the most important ingredients, next to the fish of course, are the vegetables you use.",

              "Making a Bouillabaisse recipe can be a bit time-consuming to make, as it involves several steps like preparing the fish, making a broth, and cooking the vegetables.",
              "However, with a bit of practice and patience, it is definitely doable for home cooks at any skill level.",
              "Bouillabaisse is typically served with crusty bread, either plain or rubbed with garlic and topped with rouille, a garlicky mayonnaise.",
              "A crisp green salad or roasted vegetables can also make a great accompaniment.",
              "A dry white wine like a Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay, or even a Sancerre or a Chablis pairs well with Bouillabaisse, as it helps to balance the richness of the soup and complement the flavors of the fish and vegetables.",

              "The Alps, the majestic mountain chain that spans across France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Germany, are a paradise to visit and to live.",
              "It is one of the few places left to experience nature in its raw form, and places with zero noise from civilization.",
              "The Alps are a great place to hike, to bike, to ski, and to spend time with friends and family.",
              "After all the fun outdoor activities you will probably be very hungry and looking forward to some delicious Alpine comfort food.",
              "So, we put together a list of foods you should try while visiting the Alps.",
              "It will be pretty obvious just by looking at the first dishes listed below that the food in the Alps seems to follow a simple formula that mix and matches a few simple ingredients: cheese + potatoes + meat (charcuterie, ham, lardons, etc).",
              "At first sight they might look the same, but the differences in the cheeses that are used and the preparations make it dish distinct.",
              "And yes, we have included some ideas for foods to try that do not include cheese.",
              "One way to enjoy cheeses from the mountain cows is to make the traditional fondue.",
              "Fondue means \u201cmelted\u201d in French, and is made with 2 to 3 different cheeses depending on the recipe.",
              "You sit with your friends or family around a hot pot of melted cheese and dip pieces of bread.",
              "The challenge is not to drop your bread in the common cheese pot.",
              "Because it\u2019s a rich warm dish it is typically enjoyed in cooler weather, anytime in the winter and during cool summer nights after a hike.",
              "One of the customs in the Alps is to finish the fondue with an egg.",
              "The egg is dropped in the remaining cheese, mixed until cooked, and then you mix in the remaining chunks of bread.",
              "The fondue meal is usually served with sides of salad and charcuterie.",
              "The raclette is another popular way of enjoying melted cheese in the mountains, this time with more flexibility.",
              "In the fondue, the cheeses are picked in advance and everyone eats from the same pot.",
              "In the raclette, you also share a central heated device.",
              "In past times, people in the mountains used wood fires or coals, or gas, for the raclette, while nowadays the devices are mostly electric.",
              "The most common raclette device is the one with 6-8 small individual cheese melting containers.",
              "However in some restaurants, especially the ones that like to keep it old style, you will find the classic raclette device that hold an entire half wheel of cheese.",
              "There are specific raclette cheeses, in the mountains you can find a large variety \u2013 some are aged longer, some are from different regions, etc.",
              "Personally we like to add some non-raclette denominated cheese, as long as they melt nicely and taste great.",
              "Each person selects their choice of cheese slices and melts their own slice in their own container/holder.",
              "Once the cheese is melted, you pour it on top of potatoes.",
              "In addition to the potatoes, the raclette meal will usually include a refreshing lettuce salad, a selection of charcuterie, cornichons/olives, and bread.",
              "More melted cheese dishes?",
              "Welcome to the French Alps.",
              "The tartiflette is very similar to the raclette and fondue, but the mixing work is already done for you.",
              "Potatoes, lardons (French style bacon}, cre\u0300me fraiche, and Reblochon cheese are baked in the oven in a gratin casserole style dish.",
              "Tartiflette goes well with a refreshing lettuce salad, and the unique taste of the Reblochon makes it a dish whose flavor is hard to replicate without this ingredient.",
              "So especially if you are in the French Alps, where Reblochon can be found, give it a try.",
              "Tartiflette inspired dishes are very popular in the mountains;",
              "you can even find tartiflette pizza.",
              "It is tempting to think about the Reblochonade as the same dish as the tartiflette or very similar to a raclette meal, and that\u2019s okay, because the differences are minimal.",
              "Both dishes use the key ingredient, the Reblochon cheese, and almost the same ingredients.",
              "The reblochonade usually involves melting the Reblochon cheese in its own container and then pouring it over potatoes.",
              "Sometimes the potatoes are simply boiled and sliced.",
              "In some restaurants they have a device, which is more of contraption where you have one level to melt the cheese and another level where you can roast the potatoes.",
              "There are no lardons with the reblochonade (unlike the tartiflette), but you will likely have a side of charcuterie to satisfy that cheese + meat + potato combination.",
              "There is a lot of redundancy in some of these cheese based dishes.",
              "The boite chaude (translates as hot box) is a dish where the cheese is melted in its own container or in a small wooden container).",
              "This sounds very similar to the Reblochonade.",
              "The difference is that the cheese used is not Reblochon.",
              "The original dish was created using Mont D\u2019or cheese in the Swiss Alps, but some towns in the Alps will make it using one of their own local cheeses.",
              "It is served with (you guessed it) boiled potatoes, charcuterie, and a side salad.",
              "The diots are pronounced \u201cdyo\u201d, and in English the word can sound like a close word to something else \ud83d\ude42 The word diot means sausage, and its etymology comes from the old dialect in the Savoie region.",
              "There are different kinds of diots, some are smoked, some are cured and some are uncured, some are mixed with additional ingredients (mushrooms, herbs, cabbage, etc).",
              "The most popular way of preparing diots is with a wine sauce and they are usually served with potatoes or a gratin, like the gratin dauphinois, or with a special type of pasta also: the crozets.",
              "We\u2019ve also tried the diots in their own gratin style dish.",
              "Crozets are square-shaped little pastas made with buckwheat flour.",
              "They can cooked and served as you would regular pastas, or they can also be used in a dish called croziflette, which is like a tartiflette but made with the crozet pasta instead of potatoes.",
              "The gratin is a dish made in the oven, typically with potatoes or other vegetables.",
              "In French, gratin comes from the verb gratiner, which means to broil.",
              "The potato gratin dauphinois is a dish originating from the region of Dauphine\u0301, that comprises the surroundings of Grenoble.",
              "Some recipes don\u2019t include any cheese in the gratin, while others do.",
              "Some recipes are made with a mix of milk, eggs, garlic, and other use cream instead of milk/eggs.",
              "Whichever version you get to taste, the gratin dauphinois is one of the most traditional dishes of the Alps.",
              "Other variations of the gratin that we\u2019ve tried include the previously mentioned gratin made with the diot sausages, and one of Layla\u2019s favorites, a gratin made with cardoons.",
              "A cardoon is a vegetable that is related to the artichoke.",
              "It has exactly the same flavor as the artichoke heart, the difference is that it grows in a stalk form (like celery) and the stalks are used to cook.",
              "Salads are usually included as side dishes with many of the main meals in the Alps.",
              "As a side salad they\u2019re usually very simple, but refreshing and with a tasty dressing.",
              "You can also order entre\u0301e salads that are larger and more filling.",
              "Most restaurants will have their own salad creations, one of the most popular is the Salade Savoyarde \u2013 which usually includes lardons (uncured bacon pieces) , Beaufort cheese, and boiled egg.",
              "Some will also include tomatoes, olives, goat cheese toasts, etc.",
              "Given the local ingredients, you really won\u2019t get a bad salad in the Alps.",
              "Cured meats, including jambon de Savoie and saucisson, are must have sides for many Alpine dishes.",
              "They are also great to serve with an aperitif or as pre-dinner appetizer.",
              "They\u2019re also perfect for sandwiches, especially for a long hike, bike ride, or ski day.",
              "There are two main types of ham or jambon: cru and cuit.",
              "Jambon cru is cured and served cold.",
              "Jambon cuit is more similar to what we have in the US and can be used (when sliced very thinly) for sandwiches, but is also sliced thicker and cooked in pan to be served as part of a warm meal.",
              "Saucisson is a dry cured sausage.",
              "There are many variations, from the classic simple version to those that are mixed with herbs, spices, and more.",
              "Saucisson is delicious on its own, just remember to peel it before eating, but also works great on top of baguette slices, with a little bit of Alpine butter.",
              "When not eating one of the above delicacies, it is an experience in and of itself to taste cheeses on their own, for their unique flavor.",
              "It is remarkable that with only cow milk to start from, so many different varieties of cheeses can be produced.",
              "Some of our favorite cheeses from the French Alps include: Beaufort, Tomme de Savoie, Reblochon, goat cheeses (both fresh and aged), raclette cheese (try the classic and the goat cheese), and also tasty sheep cheeses.",
              "For a creamy blue cheese try the Blue de Bonneval from Savoie.",
              "Just like cheeses taste different from any other place in the world, the same goes for butter.",
              "Locally made mountain butter tastes like no other: quality milk makes quality butter.",
              "You can put it on tartines for breakfast, with bread and jam, you can cook with it.",
              "From nutritional quality to taste, not all butters are made the same.",
              "One of our favorite sandwich fillings includes Tomme de Savoie cheese, some local butter, a bit of mustard and charcuterie, that\u2019s all you need to make a true mountain sandwich.",
              "If you are lucky to find farmers\u2019 markets and local producers during your trip to the mountains, you\u2019ll want to taste some of the most amazing \u2014 and nutritious \u2014 eggs you will get a chance to eat.",
              "When we go to the Alps it\u2019s not uncommon to meet wild chickens on the village\u2019s main plaza, around a corner, between wild fields of grass and flowers.",
              "The term \u201cfree range chicken\u201d takes a whole new dimension compared to what animals do for the eggs you buy in your regular store.",
              "They live in nature, truly 100% free, feed naturally, reproduce naturally, and the result is mouthwatering eggs.",
              "The egg yolk\u2019s color is bright orange in the summer, simply from the food, the water, the sun, fresh air, and the freedom they enjoy.",
              "Whether you make a simple fried egg or order an omelet at a local restaurant, this is another reminder of how good an egg can taste.",
              "One of the things you\u2019ll notice when you visit villages in the mountains is that many people have a vegetable garden in their backyard.",
              "Usually they also have trees on their properties these trees typically are fruit producing.",
              "Once again, you\u2019ll need to go to the farmer\u2019s market to find local products, and particularly in the summer you can find amazing fruits and vegetables.",
              "There\u2019s a reason that potatoes are so popular in Alpine dishes, and the local ones are delicious.",
              "Another popular local crop includes lettuce and salad greens \u2013 with such freshness all you need is a good dressing.",
              "Other vegetables and fruits we see grown by the locals include leeks, peas, carrots, green beans, cabbage, chard, fresh herbs, raspberries, currants, plums, and more.",
              "Eating and cooking with these fresh ingredients will help balance out all cheese/meat dishes.",
              "When walking through mountains you may come across a variety of wild berries, our favorites are the wild strawberries and cherries.",
              "Especially alpine strawberries have an amazing taste, they grow typically on steep sides of trails, and their size is tiny, much smaller than the typical strawberry you find in store.",
              "Have an eye for spotting them.",
              "In the summer their red color stands out, and if you also know the shape of the strawberry leaves, once you see a cluster of leaves you have the hint that berries could be near that spot.",
              "It\u2019s a fun experience to look for them, pick them and eat them on the spot if you have kids.",
              "As a kid I loved it, and now we do this with our kids too.",
              "Finding wild cherries on a hike is one of those unexpected surprises.",
              "We found a wild cherry tree with the most beautiful small red cherries.",
              "We ate some on the spot, and luckily had an extra bag that we used as a container to bring some back to our apartment.",
              "Our intention was to make a tart, but they were gone too quickly.",
              "There is something special about cows enjoying nature and natural grass.",
              "The same applies to honey.",
              "The Alps feature some of the most scenic views, with endless fields of wildflowers growing in a perfect climate, sun exposure, and hydration.",
              "It\u2019s a bee\u2019s paradise, and one of the places where pesticides haven\u2019t made their way.",
              "I was in Savoie last month and discussed with one of the locals, who has hives and makes his own honey.",
              "He likes doing this to connect with the bees, to observe them live, and stay in touch with nature.",
              "We usually find the local honey at the local farmers\u2019 market and since our son is a huge honey fanatic we almost always bring some back with us.",
              "This list would not be complete without dessert.",
              "When I was a kid we lived with my grandmother for a few years in the town of Saint Jean de Maurienne.",
              "She used to make bugnes almost all the time.",
              "It was a quick and easy to do dessert that could be enjoyed with or without added sugar.",
              "The bugnes originate from Savoie, although some say it comes from Lyon.",
              "Regardless, Lyon is part of the Alps also, so in the grand scheme of things bugnes are from the Alps.",
              "You will find them on menus in some restaurants, or you can make them at home.",
              "One of the local restaurants in the village we visit makes a variation of bugnes that are called tourtons.",
              "They\u2019re a stuffed pastry and usually have a filling of apples, they\u2019re served sprinkled with sugar and with a side of blueberry jam.",
              "Another one of our favorite desserts in the Alps are berry tarts.",
              "Blueberry tart {tarte myrtilles} is usually found on most restaurant menus \u2013 bonus if it\u2019s served with genepi (an herbal liqueur) ice cream.",
              "Local bakeries always have a selection of berry tarts, made with local berries \u2013 especially in the summer, but go early because they sell out quickly.",
              "Wow, wow, wow.",
              "Thank you so, so much.",
              "I would love to visit and stay a while.",

              "For the purposes of comparison, today, annual consumption is 26 kilos per person.",
              "Maple sugar mould Maple sugar mould Was maple sugar a Native American contribution to the Canadien diet?",
              "It is clear that Aboriginal people harvested maple sap and made a kind of syrup.",
              "The Re\u0301collet Chrestien Leclerq provides us with the first description, in 1691, of transforming maple sap into syrup on the North American continent.",
              "The Aboriginal group involved (Mi\u2019kmaqs) reduced the sap by one-third, by boiling it in wood tubs or troughs, to get a reddish coloured syrup.",
              "Bark tub Bark tub The other means of obtaining maple syrup was by cold reduction.",
              "This consisted of collecting sap in bark receptacles and exposing it to freezing temperatures overnight.",
              "The water rose to the surface and froze.",
              "A syrup could be obtained after repeating this operation over several days.",
              "However, this method did not produce dry sugar.",
              "Could the pottery used by Native people withstand the heat required to make sugar?",
              "It is difficult to say.",
              "What is clear is that this pottery was quickly abandoned in favour of European iron and copper kettles.",
              "Should we accept what the Jesuit Charlevoix had to say about the Amerindians, who, he claimed \u201cdid not know how to make sugar as we taught them to do.",
              "They were content with boiling it two or three times to thicken it a bit\u201d?",
              "Food preservation took different forms depending on the time of year, the place, or the social or occupational situation.",
              "The winter cold was an excellent way of preserving meat and fish.",
              "Both in town and in the country, the attic could be used to freeze winter food provisions;",
              "everyone hoped that mild spells would be short.",
              "Country folk could improvise cold storage near their homes by burying pieces of ice in the ground or by building something resembling an ice cellar beneath their home.",
              "According to several other observers, food frozen in this way kept its flavour throughout the winter.",
              "A real ice cellar was the privilege of a few, such as the governor, religious communities or the butcher.",
              "Vegetables were preserved in underground root cellars.",
              "They kept well, although their flavour would begin to change by the end of winter.",
              "As for fruits, only apples seemed to keep well, except of course, fruits preserved in sugar.",
              "Salt was one of the most effective preservatives, and salting was frequently used for meat and fish.",
              "Smoking, the method widely used by most Aboriginal groups, was also a familiar technique in certain areas where the custom was to hang hams in the chimney.",
              "Finally, drying food did not appear to be a common practice in the colony, although some foods imported from France were shipped in dried form, such as artichokes and mushrooms. By the end of the 17th century, as European crops and livestock became well established, the Canadian colonists abandoned the native food stuffs they had borrowed from their Aboriginal neighbours.",
              "From that time on, their diet became decidedly French: it was centred on bread, soup and beef.",
              "Of the local resources, only fish, small quantities of game, native berries and herbs continued to be consumed.",
              "The British Conquest gradually changed these customs. The first item of change, the potato, was introduced in 1764, and spread to such an extent that half a century later the daily bread ration had diminished by half.",
              "A few decades later, tea became essential with its corollary, sugar, as the hot beverage was consumed very sweet, with a hint of milk, This clashed with earlier dietary customs, and explains the comparatively slow acceptance of tea by the Francophone community, since tea was abundantly available by 1760.",

              "The economic philosophy of mercantilism shaped European perceptions of wealth from the 1500s to the late 1700s.",
              "Mercantilism held that only a limited amount of wealth, as measured in gold and silver bullion, existed in the world.",
              "In order to gain power, nations had to amass wealth by mining these precious raw materials from their colonial possessions.",
              "During the age of European exploration, nations employed conquest, colonization, and trade as ways to increase their share of the bounty of the New World.",
              "Mercantilists did not believe in free trade, arguing instead that the nation should control trade to create wealth.",
              "In this view, colonies existed to strengthen the colonizing nation.",
              "Mercantilists argued against allowing their nations to trade freely with other nations, because that would mean exchanging bullion for goods.",
              "Spain\u2019s mercantilist ideas guided its economic policy.",
              "Every year, enslaved individuals or Native workers loaded shipments of gold and silver aboard Spanish treasure fleets that sailed from its American colonies for Spain.",
              "These ships groaned under the sheer weight of bullion, for the Spanish had found huge caches of silver and gold in the New World.",
              "In South America, for example, Spaniards discovered rich veins of silver ore in a mountain called Potosi\u0301 and founded a settlement of the same name there.",
              "Throughout the sixteenth century, Potosi\u0301 was a boomtown, attracting settlers from many nations as well as Native people from many different cultures.",
              "Colonial mercantilism, which was basically a set of protectionist policies designed to benefit the nation, relied on several factors: colonies rich in raw materials, cheap labor, colonial loyalty to the home government, and control of the shipping trade.",
              "Under this system, the colonies sent their raw materials, harvested by enslaved or Native workers, back to their mother country.",
              "The mother country sent back to the colonies finished materials of all sorts: textiles, tools, clothing.",
              "The colonists could purchase these goods only from their mother country;",
              "trade with other countries was forbidden.",
              "The 1500s and early 1600s also introduced the process of commodification to the New World.",
              "American silver, tobacco, and other items, which were used by Native peoples for ritual purposes, became European commodities with a monetary value that could be bought and sold.",
              "Before the arrival of the Spanish, for example, the Inca people of the Andes consumed chicha, a corn beer, for ritual purposes only.",
              "When the Spanish discovered chicha, they bought and traded for it, turning it into a commodity instead of a ritual substance.",
              "Commodification thus recast Native economies and spurred the process of early commercial capitalism.",
              "New World resources, from plants to animal pelts, held the promise of wealth for European imperial powers.",
              "As Europeans traversed the Atlantic, they brought with them plants, animals, and diseases that changed lives and landscapes on both sides of the ocean.",
              "These two-way exchanges between the Americas and Europe/Africa are known collectively as the Columbian Exchange.",
              "Figure 1.",
              "With European exploration and settlement of the New World, goods and diseases began crossing the Atlantic Ocean in both directions.",
              "This \u201cColumbian Exchange\u201d soon had global implications.",

              "Adriaen van Ostade, a Dutch artist, painted An Apothecary Smoking in an Interior in 1646.",
              "The large European market for American tobacco strongly influenced the development of some of the American colonies.",
              "Of all the commodities in the Atlantic World, sugar proved to be the most important.",
              "Indeed, sugar carried the same economic importance as oil does today.",
              "European rivals raced to create sugar plantations in the Americas and fought wars for control of some of the best sugar production areas.",
              "Although refined sugar was available in the Old World, Europe\u2019s harsher climate made sugarcane difficult to grow, and it was not plentiful.",
              "Columbus brought sugar to Hispaniola in 1493, and the new crop was growing there by the end of the 1490s.",
              "By the first decades of the 1500s, the Spanish were building sugar mills on the island.",
              "Over the next century of colonization, Caribbean islands and most other tropical areas became centers of sugar production.",
              "Though of secondary importance to sugar, tobacco achieved great value for Europeans as a cash crop as well.",
              "Native peoples had been growing it for medicinal and ritual purposes for centuries before European contact, smoking it in pipes or powdering it to use as snuff.",
              "They believed tobacco could improve concentration and enhance wisdom.",
              "To some, its use meant achieving an entranced, altered, or divine state\u2014entering a spiritual place.",
              "Tobacco was unknown in Europe before 1492, and it carried a negative stigma at first.",
              "The early Spanish explorers considered Natives\u2019 use of tobacco to be proof of their savagery and, because of the fire and smoke produced in the consumption of tobacco, evidence of the Devil\u2019s sway in the New World.",
              "Gradually, however, European colonists became accustomed to and even took up the habit of smoking, and they brought it across the Atlantic.",
              "As did the Indians, Europeans ascribed medicinal properties to tobacco, claiming that it could cure headaches and skin irritations.",
              "Even so, Europeans did not import tobacco in great quantities until the 1590s.",
              "At that time, it became the first truly global commodity;",
              "English, French, Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese colonists all grew it for the world market.",
              "Native peoples also introduced Europeans to chocolate, made from cacao seeds and used by the Aztec in Mesoamerica as currency.",
              "Mesoamerican Indians consumed unsweetened chocolate in a drink with chili peppers, vanilla, and a spice called achiote.",
              "This chocolate drink\u2014xocolatl\u2014was part of ritual ceremonies like marriage and an everyday item for those who could afford it.",
              "Chocolate contains theobromine, a stimulant, which may be why Native people believed it brought them closer to the sacred world.",
              "Spaniards in the New World considered drinking chocolate a vile practice;",
              "one called chocolate \u201cthe Devil\u2019s vomit.",
              "\u201d In time, however, they introduced the beverage to Spain.",
              "At first, chocolate was available only in the Spanish court, where the elite mixed it with sugar and other spices.",
              "Later, as its availability spread, chocolate gained a reputation as a love potion.",
              "The crossing of the Atlantic by plants like cacao and tobacco illustrates the ways in which the discovery of the New World changed the habits and behaviors of Europeans.",
              "Europeans changed the New World in turn, not least by bringing Old World animals to the Americas.",
              "On his second voyage, Christopher Columbus brought pigs, horses, cows, and chickens to the islands of the Caribbean.",
              "Later explorers followed suit, introducing new animals or reintroducing ones that had died out (like horses).",
              "With less vulnerability to disease, these animals often fared better than humans in their new home, thriving both in the wild and in domestication.",
              "Figure 3.",
              "English naturalist Sir Hans Sloane traveled to Jamaica and other Caribbean islands to catalog the flora of the new world.",
              "Just as pharmaceutical companies today scour the natural world for new drugs, Europeans traveled to America to discover new medicines.",
              "The task of cataloging the new plants found there helped give birth to the science of botany.",
              "Early botanists included the English naturalist Sir Hans Sloane, who traveled to Jamaica in 1687 and there recorded hundreds of new plants.",
              "Sloane also helped popularize the drinking of chocolate, made from the cacao bean, in England.",
              "Indians, who possessed a vast understanding of local New World plants and their properties, would have been a rich source of information for those European botanists seeking to find and catalog potentially useful plants.",
              "Enslaved Africans, who had a tradition of the use of medicinal plants in their Native land, adapted to their new surroundings by learning the use of New World plants through experimentation or from the Native inhabitants.",
              "Native peoples and Africans employed their knowledge effectively within their own communities.",
              "One notable example was the use of the peacock flower to induce abortions: Indian and enslaved African women living in oppressive colonial regimes are said to have used this herb to prevent the birth of children into slavery.",
              "Europeans distrusted medical knowledge that came from African or Native sources, however, and thus lost the benefit of this source of information.",
              "Europeans encountered New World animals as well.",
              "Because European Christians understood the world as a place of warfare between God and Satan, many believed the Americas, which lacked Christianity, were home to the Devil and his minions.",
              "The exotic, sometimes bizarre, appearances and habits of animals in the Americas that were previously unknown to Europeans, such as manatees, sloths, and poisonous snakes, confirmed this association.",
              "Over time, however, they began to rely more on observation of the natural world than solely on scripture.",
              "This shift\u2014from seeing the Bible as the source of all received wisdom to trusting observation or empiricism\u2014is one of the major outcomes of the era of early globalization.",
              "Figure 4.",
              "This sixteenth-century Aztec drawing shows the suffering of a typical victim of smallpox.",
              "Smallpox and other contagious diseases brought by European explorers decimated Indian populations in the Americas.",
              "Perhaps European colonization\u2019s single greatest impact on the North American environment was the introduction of disease.",
              "Microbes to which Indigenous inhabitants had no immunity led to death everywhere Europeans settled.",
              "Along the New England coast between 1616 and 1618, epidemics claimed the lives of 75 percent of the Native people.",
              "In the 1630s, half the Huron and Iroquois around the Great Lakes died of smallpox.",
              "As is often the case with disease, the very young and the very old were the most vulnerable and had the highest mortality rates.",
              "The loss of the older generation meant the loss of knowledge and tradition, while the death of children only compounded the trauma, creating devastating implications for future generations.",
              "In eastern North America, some Indigenous peoples interpreted death from disease as a hostile act.",
              "Some groups, including the Iroquois, engaged in raids or \u201cmourning wars,\u201d taking enemy prisoners in order to assuage their grief and replace the departed.",

              "You can view the transcript for \u201cColumbian Exchange\u201d here (opens in new window).",
              "While the Americas remained firmly under the control of Native peoples in the first decades of European settlement, conflict increased as colonization spread and Europeans placed greater demands upon the Native populations, including expecting them to convert to Christianity (either Catholicism or Protestantism).",

              "At the same time, European goods had begun to change Indian life radically.",
              "In the 1500s, some of the earliest objects Europeans introduced to Indians were glass beads, copper kettles, and metal utensils.",
              "Native people often adapted these items for their own use.",
              "For example, some cut up copper kettles and refashioned the metal for other uses, including jewelry that conferred status on the wearer, who was seen as connected to the new European source of raw materials.",
              "As European settlements grew throughout the 1600s, European goods flooded Native communities.",
              "Soon Native people were using these items for the same purposes as the Europeans.",
              "For example, many Native inhabitants abandoned their animal-skin clothing in favor of European textiles.",

              "Native peoples had always placed goods in the graves of their departed, and this practice escalated with the arrival of European goods.",

              "The popularity of beaver-trimmed hats in Europe, coupled with Indians\u2019 desire for European weapons, led to the overhunting of beaver in the Northeast.",
              "Soon, beavers were extinct in New England, New York, and other areas.",
              "With their loss came the loss of beaver ponds, which had served as habitats for fish as well as water sources for deer, moose, and other animals.",
              "Furthermore, Europeans introduced pigs, which they allowed to forage in forests and other wildlands.",
              "Pigs consumed the foods on which deer and other indigenous species depended, resulting in scarcity of the game Native peoples had traditionally hunted.",

              "Cereals remained the most important staple during the Early Middle Ages as rice was introduced to Europe late, with the potato first used in the 16th century, and much later for the wider population.",
              "Barley, oats, and rye were eaten by the poor while wheat was generally more expensive.",

              "A wide variety of freshwater and saltwater fish was also eaten, with cod and herring being mainstays among the northern populations.",
              "Slow and inefficient transports made long-distance trade of many foods very expensive (perishability made other foods untransportable).",
              "Because of this, the nobility's food was more prone to foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor;",
              "it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports.",

              "Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited conspicuous consumption among the nouveau riche.",

              "Meat, and animal products such as milk, cheese, butter, and eggs, were not allowed, and at times also fish.",
              "The fast was intended to mortify the body and invigorate the soul, and also to remind the faster of Christ's sacrifice for humanity.",
              "The intention was not to portray certain foods as unclean, but rather to teach a spiritual lesson in self-restraint through abstention.",

              "Even if most people respected these restrictions and usually made penance when they violated them, there were also numerous ways of circumventing them, a conflict of ideals and practice summarized by writer Bridget Ann Henisch: It is the nature of man to build the most complicated cage of rules and regulations in which to trap himself, and then, with equal ingenuity and zest, to bend his brain to the problem of wriggling triumphantly out again.",

              "Neither were there any restrictions against (moderate) drinking or eating sweets.",

              "[6] There are many accounts of members of monastic orders who flouted fasting restrictions through clever interpretations of the Bible.",
              "Since the sick were exempt from fasting, there often evolved the notion that fasting restrictions only applied to the main dining area, and many Benedictine friars would simply eat their fast day meals in what was called the misericord (at those times) rather than the refectory.",
              "[7] Newly-assigned Catholic monastery officials sought to amend the problem of fast evasion not merely with moral condemnations, but by making sure that well-prepared non-meat dishes were available on fast days.",
              "[4] Medieval society was highly stratified.",
              "In a time when famine was commonplace and social hierarchies were often brutally enforced, food was an important marker of social status in a way that has no equivalent today in most developed countries.",

              "Political power was displayed not just by rule, but also by displaying wealth.",
              "Refined nobles dined on fresh game seasoned with exotic spices, and displayed refined table manners.",
              "Rough laborers could make do with coarse barley bread, salt pork and beans and were not expected to display etiquette.",
              "Even dietary recommendations were different: the diet of the upper classes was considered to be as much a requirement of their refined physical constitution as a sign of economic reality.",
              "The digestive system of a lord was considered to be more refined than that of lower-class subordinates and therefore required finer foods.",
              "[8] In the late Middle Ages, the increasing wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy.",
              "This threatened to break down some of the symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes.",
              "The response came in two forms: literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class,[9] and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.",
              "[10] Animal parts were even assigned to different social classes.",
              "[11] Medical science of the Middle Ages had a considerable influence on what was considered healthy and nutritious among the upper classes.",
              "One's lifestyle\u2014including diet, exercise, appropriate social behavior, and approved medical remedies\u2014was the way to good health, and all types of food were assigned certain properties that affected a person's health.",
              "All foodstuffs were also classified on scales ranging from hot to cold and moist to dry, according to the four bodily humours theory proposed by Galen that dominated Western medical science from late Antiquity and throughout the Middle Ages.",
              "[12] Medieval scholars considered human digestion to be a process similar to cooking.",
              "The processing of food in the stomach was seen as a continuation of the preparation initiated by the cook.",
              "In order for the food to be properly \"cooked\" and for the nutrients to be properly absorbed, it was important that the stomach be filled in an appropriate manner.",
              "Easily digestible foods would be consumed first, followed by gradually heavier dishes.",
              "If this regimen were not respected it was believed that heavy foods would sink to the bottom of the stomach, thus blocking the digestion duct, so that food would digest very slowly and cause putrefaction of the body and draw bad humours into the stomach.",
              "It was also of vital importance that food of differing properties not be mixed.",
              "[13] Before a meal, the stomach would preferably be \"opened\" with an ape\u0301ritif (from Latin aperire, 'to open') that was preferably of a hot and dry nature: confections made from honey- or sugar-coated spices like ginger, caraway, and seeds of anise, fennel, or cumin, wine and sweetened fortified milk drinks.",
              "As the stomach had been opened, it should then be \"closed\" at the end of the meal with the help of a digestive, most commonly a drage\u0301e, which during the Middle Ages consisted of lumps of spiced sugar, or hypocras, a wine flavoured with fragrant spices, along with aged cheese.",
              "A meal would ideally begin with easily digestible fruit, such as apples.",
              "It would then be followed by vegetables such as cabbage, lettuce, purslane, herbs, moist fruits, and light meats, such as chicken or goat kid, with pottages and broths.",
              "After that came the \"heavy\" meats, such as pork and beef, as well as vegetables and nuts, including pears and chestnuts, both considered difficult to digest.",
              "It was popular, and recommended by medical expertise, to finish the meal with aged cheese and various digestives.",

              "e. moderately warm and moist.",
              "Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained to achieve a true mixture of all the ingredients.",
              "White wine was believed to be cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar.",
              "Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ.",
              "Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist.",
              "Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine.",

              "In times of grain shortages or outright famine, grains could be supplemented with cheaper and less desirable substitutes like chestnuts, dried legumes, acorns, ferns, and a wide variety of more or less nutritious vegetable matter.",
              "[54] One of the common constituents of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten.",
              "[55] Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices.",
              "Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar.",
              "Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries.",
              "Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk.",

              "S.)",
              "and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties.",
              "[57] The importance of bread as a daily staple meant that bakers played a crucial role in any medieval community.",
              "Bread consumption was high in most of Western Europe by the 14th century.",
              "Estimates of bread consumption from different regions are fairly similar: around 1 to 1.",
              "5 kilograms (2.",

              "Among the first town guilds to be organized were the bakers, and laws and regulations were passed to keep bread prices stable.",
              "The English Assize of Bread and Ale of 1266 listed extensive tables where the size, weight, and price of a loaf of bread were regulated in relation to grain prices.",
              "The baker's profit margin stipulated in the tables was later increased through successful lobbying from the London Baker's Company by adding the cost of everything from firewood and salt to the baker's wife, house, and dog.",
              "Since bread was such a central part of the medieval diet, swindling by those who were trusted with supplying the precious commodity to the community was considered a serious offense.",
              "Bakers who were caught tampering with weights or adulterating dough with less expensive ingredients could receive severe penalties.",
              "This gave rise to the \"baker's dozen\": a baker would give 13 for the price of 12, to be certain of not being known as a cheat.",
              "[58] Fruits were popular and could be served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common ingredient in many cooked dishes.",
              "[59] Since honey and sugar were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort.",
              "The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and grapes.",
              "Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and wild strawberries were more common.",
              "Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.",
              "[60] While grains were the primary constituent of most meals, vegetables such as cabbages, chard, onions, garlic, and carrots were common foodstuffs.",
              "Many of these were eaten daily by peasants and workers and were less prestigious than meat.",
              "Cookbooks, which appeared in the late Middle Ages and were intended mostly for those who could afford such luxuries, contained only a small number of recipes using vegetables as the main ingredient.",
              "The lack of recipes for many basic vegetable dishes, such as potages, has been interpreted not to mean that they were absent from the meals of the nobility, but rather that they were considered so basic that they did not require recording.",
              "[61] Carrots were available in many variants during the Middle Ages: among them a tastier reddish-purple variety and a less prestigious green-yellow type.",
              "Various legumes, like chickpeas, fava beans, and field peas were also common and important sources of protein, especially among the lower classes.",
              "With the exception of peas, legumes were often viewed with some suspicion by the dietitians advising the upper class, partly because of their tendency to cause flatulence but also because they were associated with the coarse food of peasants.",
              "The importance of vegetables to the common people is illustrated by accounts from 16th century Germany stating that many peasants ate sauerkraut from three to four times a day.",
              "[62] Common and often basic ingredients in many modern European cuisines like potatoes, kidney beans, cacao, vanilla, tomatoes, chili peppers, and maize were not available to Europeans until after 1492, after European contact with the Americas, and even then it often took considerable time, sometimes several centuries, for the new foodstuffs to be accepted by society at large.",
              "[63] Milk was an important source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat.",
              "It would mostly come from cows, but milk from goats and sheep was also common.",
              "Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly.",
              "Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down.",
              "[64] Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products because of the lack of technology to keep it from spoiling.",
              "On occasion it was used in upper-class kitchens in stews, but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk and almond milk was generally used in its stead.",
              "[65] Cheese was far more important as a foodstuff, especially for common people, and it has been suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes.",
              "[66] Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times.",
              "There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses.",
              "Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas.",
              "Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia.",
              "While most other regions used oil or lard as cooking fats, butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas.",
              "Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.",
              "[67] While all forms of wild game were popular among those who could obtain it, most meat came from domestic animals.",
              "Domestic working animals that were no longer able to work were slaughtered but not particularly appetizing and therefore were less valued as meat.",
              "Beef was not as common as today because raising cattle was labor-intensive, requiring pastures and feed, and oxen and cows were much more valuable as draught animals and for producing milk.",
              "Lamb and mutton were fairly common, especially in areas with a sizeable wool industry, as was veal.",
              "[68] Goat meat was consumed in some parts of medieval Europe.",
              "Far more common was pork, as domestic pigs required less attention and cheaper feed.",
              "Domestic pigs often ran freely even in towns and could be fed on just about any organic waste, and suckling pig was a sought-after delicacy.",
              "Just about every part of the pig was eaten, including ears, snout, tail, tongue, and womb.",
              "Intestines, bladder, and stomach could be used as casings for sausage or even illusion food such as giant eggs.",
              "Among the meats that today are rare or even considered inappropriate for human consumption are the hedgehog and porcupine, occasionally mentioned in late medieval recipe collections.",
              "[69] Rabbits remained a rare and highly prized commodity.",
              "In England, they were deliberately introduced by the 13th century and their colonies were carefully protected.",
              "[70] Further south, domesticated rabbits were commonly bred and raised both for their meat and fur.",
              "It is frequently and falsely claimed that they were of particular value for monasteries because newborn rabbits were allegedly declared fish (or at least not meat) by church officials, allowing them to be eaten during Lent.",
              "[71][72] A wide range of birds were eaten, including pheasants, swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, pigeons, larks, finches, and just about any other wild bird that could be captured in the wild.",
              "Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat.",
              "As today, ducks and geese had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the poultry equivalent of the pig.",
              "[73] The barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent.",
              "But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.",
              "[74] Meats were more expensive than plant foods and could be up to four times as expensive as bread.",
              "Fish was up to 16 times as costly, and was expensive even for coastal populations.",
              "This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and animal products like milk and eggs.",
              "It was only after the Black Death had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common even for poorer people.",
              "The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage, meaning that wages dramatically increased.",
              "It also left vast areas of farmland untended, making it available for pasture and putting more meat on the market.",
              "[75] Although less prestigious than other animal meats, and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days, seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations.",
              "\"Fish\" to the medieval person was also a general name for anything not considered a proper land-living animal, including marine mammals such as whales and porpoises.",
              "Also included were the beaver, due to its scaly tail and considerable time spent in water, and barnacle geese, due to the belief that they developed underwater in the form of barnacles.",
              "[76] Such foods were also considered appropriate for fast days, though the rather contrived classification of barnacle geese as fish was not universally accepted.",
              "The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II examined barnacles and noted no evidence of any bird-like embryo in them, and the secretary of Leo of Rozmital wrote a very skeptical account of his reaction to being served barnacle goose at a fish-day dinner in 1456.",
              "[77] Especially important was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea.",
              "The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, and it was one of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds.",
              "Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople.",
              "[78] While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked.",
              "Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water.",
              "A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels, and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days.",
              "Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most.",
              "Freshwater fish such as eel, pike, carp, bream, perch, lamprey, salmon, and trout were common.",
              "[79] While in modern times water is often drunk with a meal, in the Middle Ages concerns over purity, medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored, and alcoholic beverages were preferred.",
              "They were seen as more nutritious and beneficial to digestion than water, with the invaluable bonus of being less prone to putrefaction due to the alcohol content.",
              "Wine was consumed on a daily basis in most of France and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever grapes were cultivated.",
              "Further north it remained the preferred drink of the bourgeoisie and the nobility who could afford it, and far less common among peasants and workers.",
              "The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily beer or ale.",
              "[80] Juices, as well as wines, of a multitude of fruits and berries had been known at least since Roman antiquity and were still consumed in the Middle Ages: pomegranate, mulberry and blackberry wines, perry, and cider which was especially popular in the north where both apples and pears were plentiful.",
              "Medieval drinks that have survived to this day include prunelle\u0301 from wild plums (modern-day slivovitz), mulberry gin and blackberry wine.",
              "Many variants of mead have been found in medieval recipes, with or without alcoholic content.",
              "However, the honey-based drink became less common as a table beverage towards the end of the period and was eventually relegated to medicinal use.",
              "[81] Mead has often been presented as the common drink of the Slavs. This is partially true since mead bore great symbolic value at important occasions.",
              "When agreeing on treaties and other important affairs of state, mead was often presented as a ceremonial gift.",
              "It was also common at weddings and baptismal parties, though in limited quantity due to its high price.",
              "In medieval Poland, mead had a status equivalent to that of imported luxuries, such as spices and wines.",
              "[82] Kumis, the fermented milk of mares or camels, was known in Europe, but as with mead was mostly something prescribed by physicians.",
              "[83] Plain milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, being reserved for the very young or elderly, and then usually as buttermilk or whey.",
              "Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products because of the lack of technology to keep it from spoiling.",
              "[84] Tea and coffee, both made from plants found in the Old World, were popular in East Asia and the Muslim world during the Middle Ages.",
              "However, neither of these non-alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th centuries.",
              "[85] Wine was commonly drunk and was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice.",
              "According to Galen's dietetics it was considered hot and dry, but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down.",
              "Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially red wine) was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good blood and brighten the mood.",
              "[86] The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings.",
              "The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes.",
              "The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content.",
              "Common folk usually had to settle for a cheap white or rose\u0301 from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication.",
              "For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down vinegar (similar to Ancient Roman posca) would often be the only available choice.",
              "[87] The aging of high-quality red wine required specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product.",
              "Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation must have been a widespread problem.",
              "Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used.",
              "The 14th-century cookbook Le Viandier, describes several methods for salvaging spoiling wine;",
              "making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time.",
              "[88] Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians.",
              "Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome.",
              "Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar.",
              "These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and clare\u0301.",
              "By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.",
              "[89] While wine was the most common table beverage in much of Europe, this was not the case in the northern regions where grapes were not cultivated.",
              "Those who could afford it drank imported wine, but even for nobility in these areas it was common to drink beer or ale, particularly towards the end of the Middle Ages.",
              "In England, the Low Countries, northern Germany, Poland and Scandinavia, beer was consumed on a daily basis by people of all social classes and age groups.",
              "By the mid-15th century, barley, a cereal known to be somewhat poorly suited for breadmaking but excellent for brewing, accounted for 27% of all cereal acreage in England.",
              "[90] However, the heavy influence from Arab and Mediterranean culture on medical science (particularly due to the Reconquista and the influx of Arabic texts) meant that beer was often disfavoured.",
              "For most medieval Europeans, it was a humble brew compared with common southern drinks and cooking ingredients, such as wine, lemons and olive oil.",
              "Even comparatively exotic products like camel milk and gazelle meat generally received more positive attention in medical texts.",
              "Beer was just an acceptable alternative and was assigned various negative qualities.",
              "In 1256, the Sienese physician Aldobrandino described beer in the following way: But from whichever it is made, whether from oats, barley or wheat, it harms the head and the stomach, it causes bad breath and ruins the teeth, it fills the stomach with bad fumes, and as a result anyone who drinks it along with wine becomes drunk quickly;",
              "but it does have the property of facilitating urination and makes one's flesh white and smooth.",
              "[91] The intoxicating effect of beer was believed to last longer than that of wine, but it was also admitted that it did not create the \"false thirst\" associated with wine.",
              "Though less prominent than in the north, beer was consumed in northern France and the Italian mainland.",
              "Perhaps as a consequence of the Norman Conquest and the travelling of nobles between France and England, one French variant described in the 14th century cookbook Le Menagier de Paris was called godale (most likely a direct borrowing from the English 'good ale') and was made from barley and spelt, but without hops.",
              "In England there were also the variants poset ale, made from hot milk and cold ale, and brakot or braggot, a spiced honey ale prepared much like hypocras.",
              "[92] That hops could be used for flavoring beer had been known at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions.",
              "Before the widespread use of hops, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used.",
              "Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops, though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it, and the end result was much more variable.",
              "Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant.",
              "Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century;",
              "they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.",
              "[93] Before hops became popular as an ingredient, it was difficult to preserve this beverage for any time, so it was mostly consumed fresh.",
              "[94] It was unfiltered, and therefore cloudy, and likely had a lower alcohol content than the typical modern equivalent.",

              "By the High Middle Ages, breweries in the fledgling medieval towns of northern Germany began to take over production.",
              "Though most of the breweries were small family businesses that employed at most eight to ten people, regular production allowed for investment in better equipment and increased experimentation with new recipes and brewing techniques.",

              "It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000 tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages.",
              "The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.",
              "5 million people.",
              "[103] While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities;",
              "[104] turmeric provided a yellow substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered to Eleanor of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded.",
              "[105] Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal, and cubeb.",
              "Sugar, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities.",
              "[106] Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several different ones.",
              "Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger.",
              "[107] Common herbs such as sage, mustard, and parsley were grown and used in cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill, and fennel.",
              "Many of these plants grew throughout all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices.",
              "Mustard was particularly popular with meat dishes and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179) as poor man's food.",
              "While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring.",
              "Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.",
              "[108] Surviving medieval recipes frequently call for flavoring with a number of sour, tart liquids.",
              "Wine, verjuice (the juice of unripe grapes or fruits) vinegar and the juices of various fruits, especially those with tart flavors, were almost universal and a hallmark of late medieval cooking.",
              "In combination with sweeteners and spices, it produced a distinctive \"pungeant, fruity\" flavor.",
              "Equally common, and used to complement the tanginess of these ingredients, were (sweet) almonds.",
              "They were used in a variety of ways: whole, shelled or unshelled, slivered, ground and, most importantly, processed into almond milk.",
              "This last type of non-dairy milk product is probably the single most common ingredient in late medieval cooking and blended the aroma of spices and sour liquids with a mild taste and creamy texture.",
              "[109] Salt was ubiquitous and indispensable in medieval cooking.",
              "Salting and drying was the most common form of food preservation and meant that fish and meat in particular were often heavily salted.",
              "Many medieval recipes specifically warn against oversalting and there were recommendations for soaking certain products in water to get rid of excess salt.",
              "[110] Salt was present during more elaborate or expensive meals.",
              "The richer the host, and the more prestigious the guest, the more elaborate would be the container in which it was served and the higher the quality and price of the salt.",
              "Wealthy guests were seated \"above the salt\", while others sat \"below the salt\", where salt cellars were made of pewter, precious metals or other fine materials, often intricately decorated.",
              "The rank of a diner also decided how finely ground and white the salt was.",
              "Salt for cooking, preservation or for use by common people was coarser;",
              "sea salt, or \"bay salt\", in particular, had more impurities, and was described in colors ranging from black to green.",
              "Expensive salt, on the other hand, looked like the standard commercial salt common today.",
              "[111] The term \"dessert\" comes from the Old French desservir, 'to clear a table', literally 'to un-serve', and originated during the Middle Ages.",
              "It would typically consist of drage\u0301es and mulled wine accompanied by aged cheese, and by the Late Middle Ages could also include fresh fruit covered in honey, sugar, or syrup and boiled-down fruit pastes.",
              "Sugar, from its first appearance in Europe, was viewed as much as a drug as a sweetener;",
              "its long-lived medieval reputation as an exotic luxury encouraged its appearance in elite contexts accompanying meats and other dishes that to modern taste are more naturally savoury.",
              "There were a wide variety of fritters, cre\u0302pes with sugar, sweet custards and darioles, almond milk and eggs in a pastry shell that could also include fruit and sometimes even bone marrow or fish.",
              "[13] German-speaking areas had a particular fondness for krapfen: fried pastries and dough with various sweet and savory fillings.",
              "Marzipan in many forms was well-known in Italy and southern France by the 1340s, and is assumed to be of Arab origin.",
              "[112] Anglo-Norman cookbooks are full of recipes for sweet and savory custards, potages, sauces, and tarts with strawberries, cherries, apples, and plums. The English chefs also had a penchant for using flower petals such as roses, violets, and elder flowers.",
              "An early form of quiche can be found in Forme of Cury, a 14th-century recipe collection, as a Torte de Bry with a cheese and egg yolk filling.",
              "[113] Le Me\u0301nagier de Paris (\"Parisian Household Book\"), written in 1393, includes a quiche recipe made with three kinds of cheese, eggs, beet greens, spinach, fennel fronds, and parsley.",
              "[114] In northern France, a wide assortment of waffles and wafers was eaten with cheese and hypocras or a sweet malmsey as issue de table ('departure from the table').",
              "The ever-present candied ginger, coriander, aniseed and other spices were referred to as e\u0301pices de chambre ('parlor spices') and were taken as digestibles at the end of a meal to \"close\" the stomach.",
              "[115] Like their Muslim counterparts in Spain, the Arab conquerors of Sicily introduced a wide variety of new sweets and desserts that eventually found their way to the rest of Europe.",
              "Just like Montpellier, Sicily was once famous for its comfits, nougat candy (torrone, or turro\u0301n in Spanish) and almond clusters (confetti).",
              "From the south, the Arabs also brought the art of ice cream-making that produced sorbet and several examples of sweet cakes and pastries;",
              "cassata alla Siciliana (from Arabic qas'ah, the term for the terracotta bowl with which it was shaped), made from marzipan, sponge cake with sweetened ricotta, and cannoli alla Siciliana, originally cappelli di turchi ('Turkish hats'), fried, chilled pastry tubes with a sweet cheese filling.",
              "[116] Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a somewhat neglected field of study.",
              "Misconceptions and outright errors were quite common among historians, and are still present in as a part of the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era.",
              "Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices.",
              "[117] The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources.",
              "[118] Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it.",
              "The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate.",
              "The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, and thereby the reputation of the host, would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.",
              "[119] The common method of grinding and mashing ingredients into pastes and the many potages and sauces has been used as an argument that most adults within the medieval nobility lost their teeth at an early age, and hence were forced to eat nothing but porridge, soup and ground-up meat.",
              "This has been demonstrated to be an unfounded theory by historians such as Terence Scully.",
              "[120] The numerous descriptions of banquets from the later Middle Ages concentrated on the pageantry of the event rather than the minutiae of the food, which was not the same for most banqueters as those choice mets served at the high table.",
              "Banquet dishes were apart from mainstream of cuisine, and have been described as \"the outcome of grand banquets serving political ambition rather than gastronomy;",
              "today as yesterday\" by historian Maguelonne Toussant-Samat.",
              "[121] Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, compiled in the Middle Ages are among the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine.",
              "The first cookbooks began to appear towards the end of the 13th century.",
              "The Liber de Coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Cha\u0302lons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat.",
              "[122] Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish.",
              "Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.",
              "[123] The recipes were often brief and did not give precise quantities.",
              "Cooking times and temperatures were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire.",
              "At best, cooking times could be specified as the time it took to say a certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field.",
              "Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training, working their way up in the highly defined kitchen hierarchy.",
              "A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction.",
              "Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as Le Me\u0301nagier de Paris from the late 14th century.",
              "Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.",
              "[124] The repertory of housekeeping instructions laid down by manuscripts like the Me\u0301nagier de Paris also include many details of overseeing correct preparations in the kitchen.",
              "Towards the onset of the early modern period, in 1474, the Vatican librarian Bartolomeo Platina wrote De honesta voluptate et valetudine (\"On honorable pleasure and health\") and the physician Iodocus Willich edited Apicius in Zu\u0308rich in 1563.",
              "[125] High-status exotic spices and rarities like ginger, pepper, cloves, sesame, citron leaves and \"onions of Escalon\"[126] all appear in an eighth-century list of spices that the Carolingian cook should have at hand.",

              "Then I forgot and, although Amanda and I have certainly written about food's role in history since then, I haven't returned to my original idea\u2014until now.",
              "\"Occasional\" can mean once a year, right?",
              "Today's installment is inspired by the fact that it is Bastille Day, the celebration of French independence.",
              "I could have started with our own Independence Day, 10 days ago, since the Boston Tea Party of 1773 was a defining food-related moment in the run-up to the American Revolution.",
              "Although the term Tea Party has recently been co-opted by groups who oppose taxes in general, or who feel they are taxed too much (or for dubious purposes), the original Tea Partiers' complaint was against taxation\u2014including high tariffs on tea\u2014without representation in British Parliament.",
              "But food played an even larger role in the French Revolution just a few years later.",
              "According to Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People, by Linda Civitello, two of the most essential elements of French cuisine, bread and salt, were at the heart of the conflict;",
              "bread, in particular, was tied up with the national identity.",
              "\"Bread was considered a public service necessary to keep the people from rioting,\" Civitello writes.",
              "\"Bakers, therefore, were public servants, so the police controlled all aspects of bread production.\"",
              "If bread seems a trifling reason to riot, consider that it was far more than something to sop up bouillabaisse for nearly everyone but the aristocracy\u2014it was the main component of the working Frenchman's diet.",
              "According to Sylvia Neely's A Concise History of the French Revolution, the average 18th-century worker spent half his daily wage on bread.",
              "But when the grain crops failed two years in a row, in 1788 and 1789, the price of bread shot up to 88 percent of his wages.",
              "Many blamed the ruling class for the resulting famine and economic upheaval.",
              "On top of that, peasants resented the gabelle, a tax on salt that was particularly unfairly applied to the poor.",
              "Obviously, the causes of the revolution were far more complicated than the price of bread or unfair taxes on salt (just as the American Revolution was about more than tea tariffs), but both contributed to the rising anger toward the monarchy.",
              "The oft-repeated story about Marie Antoinette, queen of France at the time, responding to the news that her subjects had no bread with the line, \"Let them eat cake\" (actually, brioche) is probably not true\u2014or, if it is, she wasn't the first to speak the mal mots.",
              "The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau attributed the callous utterance to an unnamed princess in his 1766 Confessions, written when Antoinette was 10 years old and living in Austria.",
              "Nevertheless, the results of the popular uprising included the storming of the Bastille, a medieval fortress and prison in Paris, on July 14, 1789, and the eventual beheading of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette by the guillotine.",
              "Of course, food is influenced by history as much as vice-versa, and the French Revolution was no exception.",
              "The birth of the Republic of France laid the foundation for the modern restaurant to flourish.",
              "According to Larousse Gastronomique, the French culinary encyclopedia, although taverns, inns and cafe\u0301s had served food and drink to the public for centuries, the first restaurant as we know it was opened in around 1765 in Paris by a bouillon seller named Boulanger.",
              "At the time, clear soups such as those Boulanger sold were considered restorative;",
              "hence the term \"restaurant.\"",
              "However, as the encyclopedia explains, \"the first Parisian restaurant worthy of the name was the one founded by Beauvilliers in 1782 in the Rue de Richelieu, called the Grande Taverne de Londres.",
              "He introduced the novelty of listing the dishes available on a menu and serving them at small individual tables during fixed hours.\"",
              "Following the revolution, the abolition of the guild system that controlled who could be a butcher, baker or cheesemaker and how they did their jobs made it easier to open restaurants.",
              "Also, since so many aristocrats fled or were executed, their former cooks and servants had to find new employment.",
              "Paris became the center of the new restaurant scene, which, to some degree, it remains today.",

              "France gave birth to restaurants, but it was no civilized affair.",
              "In fact, today's restaurant business is actually a byproduct of the class warfare that arose during the French Revolution.",
              "Back in the Middle Ages, fine dining was a privilege enjoyed exclusively by feudal lords who had their own grand kitchens and personal chefs.",
              "The only commercial eateries for the masses were seedy roadside inns, where strangers crowded around mediocre buffets of tepid roasts and over-sauced legumes.",
              "But sometime in the 1760s, the merchant class of Paris developed a taste for healthy light broths known as restoratives, or restaurants.",
              "By the 1780s, this new Parisian \"health food\"A\u0302\u009d craze led to a handful of reputable dining halls, where customers could sit at individual tables and choose from a wide range of dishes.",
              "Ironically, the popularity of these restaurants grew at a time when the bulk of the French population couldn't afford bread.",
              "Decades of harsh winters and oppressive taxation had taken their toll on kitchen tables.",
              "Worse still, the greater part of the nation's tax dollars had gone to pay for the excesses of the aristocracy and monarchy.",
              "By 1789, the starving French masses could no longer be controlled.",
              "Looting and riots erupted throughout Paris, ushering in the French Revolution.",
              "Aristocrats fled to the countryside, leaving behind their highly skilled chefs and the fine wines from their cellars.",
              "Suddenly, unemployed cooks and abandoned bottles found their way to the city's eateries, and within a year, nearly 50 elegant restaurants had popped up in Paris.",
              "These epicurean temples catered to the new class of French deputies and businessmen and were featured in travelogues throughout Europe.",
              "As word of their deliciousness spread, Parisian restaurants became tourist attractions on par with Notre Dame.",
              "Admittedly, fine dining hit a rocky period during the Reign of Terror of 1793-94, when anyone suspected of ties to the aristocracy risked facing the guillotine.",
              "One unfortunate proprietor, Jean-FranA\u0303\u0083A\u0302\u00a7ois VA\u0303\u0083A\u0302\u00a9ry, hung a sign over his door that read, \"We welcome people of the best sort.\"",
              "A\u0302\u009d The elitist sentiment quickly landed him in prison.",
              "Still, VA\u0303\u0083A\u0302\u00a9ry was the exception.",
              "Most Parisian restaurants kept up a lively trade, their tables replete with fine hams and pA\u0303\u0083A\u0302\u00a2tA\u0303\u0083A\u0302\u00a9s.",
              "And most patrons felt safe enough within their walls to joke about Robespierre, the grandmaster of the Reign of Terror, and how he couldn't afford to send his spies there.",
              "In the end, many more Frenchmen dined out than could actually afford the experience.",
              "Oddly, it became almost commonplace for customers to steal knives and spoons.",
              "One waiter at the upscale restaurant Naudet's spotted a patron pocketing the flatware and politely handed him a bill that included \"Cutlery, 54 francs.\"",
              "A\u0302\u009d The customer paid up cheerfully, tut-tutting, \"How dear things are getting these days\"A\u0302\u00a6\"A\u0302\u009d But this only goes to show how far restaurants had come.",
              "In less than a century, fine dining went from being the exclusive privilege of people born with silver spoons in their mouths to a must-have for people who stole them.",

              "Legend has it that Napoleon's cook, known as Dunand, created the dish to celebrate the 1800 French victory over the Austrians at the battle of Marengo in northern Italy.",
              "Napoleon's custom was to eat nothing before a battle, but afterward, he was ravenously hungry.",
              "The cook was without the supply wagons, so he had to scrounge around to get a chicken, some crayfish, a handful of eggs, a few tomatoes and some garlic.",

              "He fried a ration of army bread along with the eggs, and the cooked crayfish were served on the plate as a garnish.",
              "The story goes that Napoleon liked this \"victory dish\" so well he wanted it prepared after every battle, and when Dunand later tried to substitute white wine for brandy, or delete the crayfish, Napoleon refused to eat it.",

              "When Food Changed History: The French Revolution",
              "Sections Lisa Bramen About a year ago, I started what I intended to be an occasional series about landmark food-related moments in history.",
              "Then I forgot and, although Amanda and I have certainly written about food's role in history since then, I haven't returned to my original idea\u2014until now.",
              "\"Occasional\" can mean once a year, right?",
              "Today's installment is inspired by the fact that it is Bastille Day, the celebration of French independence.",
              "I could have started with our own Independence Day, 10 days ago, since the Boston Tea Party of 1773 was a defining food-related moment in the run-up to the American Revolution.",
              "Although the term Tea Party has recently been co-opted by groups who oppose taxes in general, or who feel they are taxed too much (or for dubious purposes), the original Tea Partiers' complaint was against taxation\u2014including high tariffs on tea\u2014without representation in British Parliament.",
              "But food played an even larger role in the French Revolution just a few years later.",
              "According to Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People, by Linda Civitello, two of the most essential elements of French cuisine, bread and salt, were at the heart of the conflict;",
              "bread, in particular, was tied up with the national identity.",
              "\"Bread was considered a public service necessary to keep the people from rioting,\" Civitello writes.",
              "\"Bakers, therefore, were public servants, so the police controlled all aspects of bread production.\"",
              "If bread seems a trifling reason to riot, consider that it was far more than something to sop up bouillabaisse for nearly everyone but the aristocracy\u2014it was the main component of the working Frenchman's diet.",
              "According to Sylvia Neely's A Concise History of the French Revolution, the average 18th-century worker spent half his daily wage on bread.",
              "But when the grain crops failed two years in a row, in 1788 and 1789, the price of bread shot up to 88 percent of his wages.",
              "Many blamed the ruling class for the resulting famine and economic upheaval.",
              "On top of that, peasants resented the gabelle, a tax on salt that was particularly unfairly applied to the poor.",
              "Obviously, the causes of the revolution were far more complicated than the price of bread or unfair taxes on salt (just as the American Revolution was about more than tea tariffs), but both contributed to the rising anger toward the monarchy.",
              "The oft-repeated story about Marie Antoinette, queen of France at the time, responding to the news that her subjects had no bread with the line, \"Let them eat cake\" (actually, brioche) is probably not true\u2014or, if it is, she wasn't the first to speak the mal mots.",
              "The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau attributed the callous utterance to an unnamed princess in his 1766 Confessions, written when Antoinette was 10 years old and living in Austria.",
              "Nevertheless, the results of the popular uprising included the storming of the Bastille, a medieval fortress and prison in Paris, on July 14, 1789, and the eventual beheading of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette by the guillotine.",
              "Of course, food is influenced by history as much as vice-versa, and the French Revolution was no exception.",
              "The birth of the Republic of France laid the foundation for the modern restaurant to flourish.",
              "According to Larousse Gastronomique, the French culinary encyclopedia, although taverns, inns and cafe\u0301s had served food and drink to the public for centuries, the first restaurant as we know it was opened in around 1765 in Paris by a bouillon seller named Boulanger.",
              "At the time, clear soups such as those Boulanger sold were considered restorative;",
              "hence the term \"restaurant.\"",
              "However, as the encyclopedia explains, \"the first Parisian restaurant worthy of the name was the one founded by Beauvilliers in 1782 in the Rue de Richelieu, called the Grande Taverne de Londres.",
              "He introduced the novelty of listing the dishes available on a menu and serving them at small individual tables during fixed hours.\"",
              "Following the revolution, the abolition of the guild system that controlled who could be a butcher, baker or cheesemaker and how they did their jobs made it easier to open restaurants.",
              "Also, since so many aristocrats fled or were executed, their former cooks and servants had to find new employment.",
              "Paris became the center of the new restaurant scene, which, to some degree, it remains today.",

              "Haute cuisine represents the cooking and eating of carefully prepared food from regular and premium ingredients, prepared by specialists, and commissioned by those with the financial means to do so.",
              "It has had a long evolution through the monarchy and the bourgeoisie and their ability to explore and afford prepared dishes with exotic and varied flavors and looking like architectural wonders.",
              "Haute cuisine distinguished itself from regular French cuisine by what was cooked and served, by obtaining premium ingredients such as fruit out of season, and by using ingredients not typically found in France.",
              "[1] Trained kitchen staff was essential to the birth of haute cuisine in France, which was organized at the turn of the 20th century by August Escoffier into the brigade de cuisine.",
              "The extravagant presentations and complex techniques that came from these kitchens required ingredients, time, equipment, and therefore money.",
              "For this reason, early haute cuisine was accessible to a small demographic of rich and powerful individuals.",
              "Not only were professional chefs responsible for building and shaping haute cuisine, but their role in the cuisine was what differentiated it from regular French cuisine.",
              "[2] Haute cuisine is influenced by French cuisine with elaborate preparations and presentations that serves small, multiple courses prepared by a hierarchical kitchen staff, historically at the grand restaurants and hotels of Europe.",
              "The cuisine was very rich and opulent, with decadent sauces made out of butter, cream, and flour, the basis for many typical French sauces still in use today.",
              "[3] The 17th-century chef and writer La Varenne (1615-1678) marked a change from cookery as known in the Middle Ages, to somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations.",
              "Subsequently, Antonin Care\u0302me (1784-1833) also published works on cooking, and he simplified and codified an earlier and even more complex cuisine.",
              "Nineteenth-century French haute cuisine interacted with the development of fine dining in Britain.",
              "[4] Contrary to popular belief, Catherine de' Medici did not introduce Italian food to the French court to create haute cuisine.",
              "[5] Georges Auguste Escoffier is a central figure in the modernisation of haute cuisine as of about 1900, which became known as cuisine classique.",
              "These were simplifications and refinements of the early work of Care\u0302me, Jules Gouffe\u0301 and Urbain Dubois.",
              "It was practised in the grand restaurants and hotels of Europe and elsewhere for much of the 20th century.",
              "The major developments were to replace service a\u0300 la franc\u0327aise (serving all dishes at once) with service a\u0300 la russe (serving meals in courses) and to develop a system of cookery, based on Escoffier's Le Guide Culinaire, which formalized the preparation of sauces and dishes.",
              "In its time, it was considered the pinnacle of haute cuisine, and was a style distinct from cuisine bourgeoise (the cuisine of affluent city dwellers), the working-class cuisine of bistros and homes, and cuisines of the French provinces.",
              "The 1960s were marked by the appearance of nouvelle cuisine, as chefs rebelled from Escoffier's \"orthodoxy\" and complexity.",
              "Although the term nouvelle cuisine had been used in the past, the modern usage can be attributed to authors Andre\u0301 Gayot,[6] Henri Gault, and Christian Millau, who used nouvelle cuisine to describe the cooking of Paul Bocuse, Alain Chapel, Jean and Pierre Troisgros, Michel Gue\u0301rard, Roger Verge\u0301 and Raymond Oliver, many of whom were once students of Fernand Point.",
              "[7] In general, nouvelle cuisine puts an emphasis on natural flavours, so the freshest possible ingredients are used, preparation is simplified, heavy sauces are less common, as are strong marinades for meat, and cooking times are often reduced.",
              "Nouvelle cuisine was a movement towards conceptualism and minimalism and was a direct juxtaposition to earlier haute cuisine styles of cooking, which were much more extravagant.",
              "While menus were increasingly short, dishes used more inventive pairings and relied on inspiration from regional dishes.",
              "[7] Within 20 years, however, chefs began returning to the earlier style of haute cuisine, although many of the new techniques remained.",

              "The science of domestic and restaurant cooking has recently moved from the playground of a few interested amateurs into the realm of serious scientific endeavor.",
              "A number of restaurants around the world have started to adopt a more scientific approach in their kitchens,1\u20133 and perhaps partly as a result, several of these have become acclaimed as being among the best in the world.",
              "4,5 Today, many food writers and chefs, as well as most gourmets, agree that chemistry lies at the heart of the very finest food available in some of the world\u2019s finest restaurants.",
              "At least in the world of gourmet food, chemistry has managed to replace its often tarnished image with a growing respect as the application of basic chemistry in the kitchen has provided the starting point for a whole new cuisine.",
              "The application of chemistry and other sciences to restaurant and domestic cooking is thus making a positive impact in a very public arena which inevitably gives credence to the subject as a whole.",
              "As yet, however, this activity has been largely in the form of small collaborations between scientists and chefs.",
              "To date, little \u201cnew science\u201d has emerged, but many novel applications of existing science have been made, assisting chefs to produce new dishes and extend the range of techniques available in their kitchens.",
              "Little of this work has appeared in the scientific literature,2,3,6\u20139 but the work has received an enormous amount of media attention.",
              "A quick Google search will reveal thousands of news articles over the past few years;",
              "a very few recent examples can be found in China,(10) the United States,11,12 and Australia.",
              "(13) In this review we bring together the many strands of chemistry that have been and are increasingly being used in the kitchen to provide a sound basis for further developments in the area.",
              "We also attempt throughout to show using relevant illustrative examples how knowledge and understanding of chemistry can be applied to good effect in the domestic and restaurant kitchen.",
              "Our basic premise is that the application of chemical and physical techniques in some restaurant kitchens to produce novel textures and flavor combinations has not only revolutionized the restaurant experience but also led to new enjoyment and appreciation of food.",
              "Examples include El Bulli (in Spain) and the Fat Duck (in the United Kingdom), two restaurants that since adopting a scientific approach to cooking have become widely regarded as among the finest in the world.",
              "All this begs the fundamental question: why should these novel textures and flavors provide so much real pleasure for the diners?",
              "Such questions are at the heart of the new science of Molecular Gastronomy.",
              "The term Molecular Gastronomy has gained a lot of publicity over the past few years, largely because some chefs have started to label their cooking style as Molecular Gastronomy (MG) and claimed to be bringing the use of scientific principles into the kitchen.",
              "However, we should note that three of the first chefs whose food was \u201clabeled\u201d as MG have recently written a new manifesto protesting against this label.",
              "(14) They rightly contend that what is important is the finest food prepared using the best available ingredients and using the most appropriate methods (which naturally includes the use of \u201cnew\u201d ingredients, for example, gelling agents such as gellan or carageenan, and processes, such as vacuum distillation, etc.)",
              ".",
              "We take a broad view of Molecular Gastronomy and argue it should be considered as the scientific study of why some food tastes terrible, some is mediocre, some good, and occasionally some absolutely delicious.",
              "We want to understand what it is that makes one dish delicious and another not, whether it be the choice of ingredients and how they were grown, the manner in which the food was cooked and presented, or the environment in which it was served.",
              "All will play their own roles, and there are valid scientific enquiries to be made to elucidate the extent to which they each affect the final result, but chemistry lies at the heart of all these diverse disciplines.",
              "The judgment of the quality of a dish is a highly personal matter as is the extent to which a particular meal is enjoyed or not.",
              "Nevertheless, we hypothesize that there are a number of conditions that must be met before food becomes truly enjoyable.",
              "These include many aspects of the flavor.",
              "Clearly, the food should have flavor;",
              "but what conditions are truly important?",
              "Does it matter, for example, how much flavor a dish has;",
              "is the concentration of the flavor molecules important?",
              "How important is the order in which the flavor molecules are released?",
              "How does the texture affect the flavor?",
              "The long-term aims of the science of MG are not only to provide chefs with tools to assist them in producing the finest dishes but also to elucidate the minimum set of conditions that are required for a dish to be described by a representative group of individuals as enjoyable or delicious, to find ways in which these conditions can be met (through the production of raw materials, in the cooking process, and in the way in which the food is presented), and hence to be able to predict reasonably well whether a particular dish or meal would be delicious.",
              "It may even become possible to give some quantitative measure of just how delicious a particular dish will be to a particular individual.",
              "Clearly, this is an immense task involving many different aspects of the chemical sciences: from the way in which food is produced through the harvesting, packaging, and transport to market via the processing and cooking to the presentation on the plate and how the body and brain react to the various stimuli presented.",
              "MG is distinct from traditional Food Science as it is concerned principally with the science behind any conceivable food preparation technique that may be used in a restaurant environment or even in domestic cooking from readily available ingredients to produce the best possible result.",
              "Conversely, Food Science is concerned, in large measure, with food production on an industrial scale and nutrition and food safety.",
              "A further distinction is that although Molecular Gastronomy includes the science behind gastronomic food, to understand gastronomy it is sometimes also necessary to appreciate its wider background.",
              "Thus, investigations of food history and culture may be subjects for investigation within the overall umbrella of Molecular Gastronomy.",
              "Further, gastronomy is characterized by the fact that strong, even passionate feelings can be involved.",
              "Leading chefs express their own emotions and visions through the dishes they produce.",
              "Some chefs stick closely to tradition, while others can be highly innovative and even provocative.",
              "In this sense gastronomy can be considered as an art form similar to painting and music.",
              "In this review we begin with a short description of our senses of taste and aroma and how we use these and other senses to provide the sensation of flavor.",
              "We will show that flavor is not simply the sum of the individual stimuli from the receptors in the tongue and nose but far more complex.",
              "In fact, the best we can say is that flavor is constructed in the mind using cues taken from all the senses including, but not limited to, the chemical senses of taste and smell.",
              "It is necessary to bear this background in mind throughout the whole review so we do not forget that even if we fully understand the complete chemical composition, physical state, and morphological complexity of a dish, this alone will not tell us whether it will provide an enjoyable eating experience.",
              "In subsequent sections we will take a walk through the preparation of a meal, starting with the raw ingredients to see how the chemical make up of even the apparently simplest ingredients such as carrots or tomatoes is greatly affected by all the different agricultural processes they may be subjected to before arriving in the kitchen.",
              "Once we have ingredients in the kitchen and start to cut, mix, and cook them, a vast range of chemical reactions come into play, destroying some and creating new flavor compounds.",
              "We devote a considerable portion of the review to the summary of some of these reactions.",
              "However, we must note that complete textbooks have failed to capture the complexity of many of these, so all we can do here is to provide a general overview of some important aspects that commonly affect flavor in domestic and restaurant kitchens.",
              "In nearly all cooking, the texture of the food is as important as its flavor: the flavor of roast chicken is pretty constant, but the texture varies from the wonderfully tender meat that melts in the mouth to the awful rubber chicken of so many conference dinners.",
              "Understanding and controlling texture not only of meats but also of sauces, souffle\u0301s, breads, cakes, and pastries, etc.",
              ", will take us on a tour through a range of chemical and physical disciplines as we look, for example, at the spinning of glassy sugars to produce candy-floss.",
              "Finally, after a discussion of those factors in our food that seem to contribute to making it delicious, we enter the world of brain chemistry, and much of that is speculative.",
              "We will end up with a list of areas of potential new research offering all chemists the opportunity to join us in the exciting new adventures of Molecular Gastronomy and the possibility of collaborating with chefs to create new and better food in their own local neighborhoods.",
              "Who ever said there is no such thing as a free lunch?",
              "Before we begin to look in any detail at the chemistry of food production and preparation, we should take in a brief overview of the way in which we actually sense the food we eat.",
              "Questions such as what makes us enjoy (or not) any particular food and what it is that makes one meal better than another are of course largely subjective.",
              "Nonetheless, we all share the same, largely chemical based, set of senses with which to interpret the taste, aroma, flavor, and texture of the food.",
              "In this section we will explore these senses and note how they detect the various food molecules before, during, and even after we have consumed them.",
              "It is important to note at the outset that our experience of foods is mediated through all our senses: these include all the familiar senses (pain, touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell) as well as the perhaps less familiar such as chemesthesis.",
              "As we will see, our senses of sight and touch can set up expectations of the overall flavor of food which can be very hard to ignore.",
              "Try eating the same food using either high-quality china plates and steel or silver cutlery or paper plates and plastic cutlery;",
              "the food seems to taste better with the perceived quality of the utensils.",
              "Equally, the color of food can affect our perception of the flavor;",
              "try eating a steak dyed blue!",
              "However, among all the senses, the most significant for our appreciation of food remain the chemical senses which encompass taste, smell, and chemesthesis.",
              "These three distinct systems mediate information about the presence of chemicals in the environment.",
              "Taste or gustation detects chemical compounds dissolved in liquids using sensors mostly in the mouth.",
              "Smell or olfaction detects air-borne chemicals, both from the external world but also from the internalized compounds emitted from food in our oral cavity.",
              "Chemesthesis mediates information about irritants through nerve endings in the skin as well as other borders between us and the environments, including the epithelia in the nose, the eyes, and in the gut.",
              "Chemesthesis uses the same systems that inform us about touch, temperature, and pain.",
              "Specialized chemoreceptors on the tongue, palate, soft palate, and areas in the upper throat (pharynx and laryngopharynx) detect sensations such as bitter, for example, from alkaloids, salty from many ionic compounds, sour from most acids, sweet from sugars, and umami, or savory, from some amino acids and nucleotides.",
              "Each of these taste sensations probably evolved to provide information about foods that are particularly desirable (e.",
              "g., salt, sugar, amino acids) or undesirable (e.",
              "g., toxic alkaloids).",
              "The receptors reside in taste buds mostly located in fungiform, foliate, and circumvallate but not filiform papillae on the tongue.",
              "Taste buds, as the name indicates, are bud-shaped groups of cells.",
              "Tastants, the molecules being tasted, enter a small pore at the top of the taste bud and are absorbed on microvilli at taste receptor cells.",
              "In the past decade receptor proteins for bitter,15,16 sweet, and umami17\u201320 have all been identified.",
              "All these receptors are a subclass of the super family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and have been classified as T1R1, T1R2, T1R3, and T2Rs.",
              "The activation of GPCRs by external stimulus is the starting point of a succession of interactions between multiple proteins in the cell, leading to the release of chemical substances in the cell also called second messengers.",
              "Although the cellular signal cascade is a general pattern of GPCRs, the very large variety of each protein involved renders these mechanisms very complex so that they are under a good deal of ongoing investigation.",
              "Taste receptors share several structural homologies with the metabotropic glutamate receptors.",
              "These receptors are composed of two main domains linked by an extracellular cystein-rich domain: a large extracellular domain (ECD) also called the \u201cVenus Flytrap\u201d module, due to the similarity of mechanism by which this plant traps insects, containing the ligand binding site and a seven-transmembrane domain region.",
              "Moreover, as in the case of mGluRs, T1Rs assemble as dimers at the membrane and the composition of the heterodimers has been shown to be specific to the taste recognized.",
              "Heterodimers T1R2\u2212T1R3 are responsible for sweet sensing, whereas T1R1\u2212T1R3 are responsible for umami tasting.",
              "A large number of T2Rs have been shown to function as bitter taste receptors in heterologous expression assays, and several have distinctive polymorphisms that are associated with significant variations in sensitivity to selective bitter tastants in mice, chimpanzees, and humans.",
              "Receptors for sour and salty tastes are essentially ionic channels, but the identity of the salty receptor is still speculative and controversial.",
              "21,22 The hunt for a sour receptor has been narrowed down to a ionic channel of the type TRP, transient receptor potential.",
              "21,23 Undoubtedly, more receptor proteins for other nutritionally relevant molecules will be identified.",
              "For example, recently a specific fatty acid receptor, a multifunctional CD36 glycoprotein, has been demonstrated in rats.",
              "(24) While the taste receptors in the mouth detect small molecules dissolved in liquids, the receptors of the olfactory system detect molecules in the air.",
              "The range of receptors provides a wide sensitivity to volatile molecules.",
              "Some of the most potent thiols can be detected in concentrations as low as 6 \u00d7 107 molecules/mL air (2-propene-1-thiol), whereas ethanol requires around 2 \u00d7 1015 molecules/mL air.",
              "Thus, there are at least 8 orders of magnitude between our sensitivity to the most and least \u201csmelly\u201d molecules.",
              "The sensitivity of the sense of smell varies quite significantly between individuals.",
              "Not only do different people have different sensitivity to particular aromas, some people suffer anosmia, odor blindness to specific odorants.",
              "People can be trained to become sensitive to some odorants, such as for the unpleasant smelling androstenone.",
              "To complicate the picture further, the sense of smell develops during the human lifetime;",
              "we tend to lose sensitivity at an older age, especially after the seventh decade.",
              "(25) An odor is detected by sensors in the nose, the odorant receptors.",
              "The way these sensors recognize aroma molecules is by \u201ccombinatorial receptor codes\u201d, i.",
              "e., one odorant receptor recognizes a range of odorants and one odorant is recognized by a number of odorant receptors.",
              "(26) The distinct odor identity is created by the pattern of odorant receptors activated by the odorant\u2019s shape.",
              "Thus, slight changes in an odorant or even in its concentration can change the identity of an odorant.",
              "A well-known example relevant to food is the distinct perceptual difference between R-(\u2212)- and S-(+)-carvone, enantiomers only differing in the chirality of the compound.",
              "The two compounds are perceived as spearmint and caraway, respectively.",
              "However, by no means are all enantiomers perceived differently.",
              "For example, Laska and Tuuebner(27) have shown that among 10 different food-relevant enantiomers, subjects as a group were only capable of discriminating three: \u03b1-pinene, carvone, and limonene.",
              "Structures of some of these molecules are shown in Figure \u200bFigure11.",
              "Molecular structures of the enantiomers of limonene, \u03b1-pinene, and carvone.",
              "The enantiomers have distinct odor characteristics (quality and threshold), which are attributed to the enantiomeric configuration.",
              "R-(\u2212)-Carvone is the main consitutent in spearmint essential oil, and S-(+)-carvone is the main constituent in the essential oil of carraway and dill.",
              "R-(+)-Limonene is the main constituent of the volatile oils expressed from the fresh peel of Citrus spp.",
              "fruits.",
              "S-(\u2212)-limonene is present in the oil of fir and the needles and young twigs of Abies alba (Pinaceae).",
              "Linda Buck and Richard Axel were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 2004 for their discovery of \u201codorant receptors and the organization of the olfactory system\u201d.",
              "(28) Their work has shown that each olfactory neuron expresses only one type of odorant receptor.",
              "The odorant receptors belong to the GPCR 7TM-receptor family.",
              "(29) Through in situ hybridization of olfactory neurons in the epithelium of rats, they created an olfactory map.",
              "30,31 Around 1000 olfactory receptor cells, all of the same type, converge their nerve signals to distinct microdomains, glomeruli, in the olfactory bulb.",
              "This is the most direct link from the external world to the brain.",
              "From the olfactory bulb signals are relayed as patterns to other regions in the brain.",
              "Notably, there is a direct link to the amygdalae, important structures in the \u201climbic system\u201d, an evolutionary old part of the brain strongly involved in human emotions.",
              "Recent work has suggested that the amygdalae not only plays important roles in evaluating affective valence of stimuli but also seem to participate in the computation and representation of perceived intensity of smells and tastes.",
              "32,33 The olfactory system consists of other areas in the temporal and frontal parts of the brain.",
              "The orbitofrontal cortex is of particular importance for food behavior since nerve cells in this area play a large role in the computation of hedonic properties of smell stimuli and have also been implicated in the representation of flavors of foods.",
              "Smell- and taste-sensitive neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex are also typically modulated by satiety signals and thus play a major role in determining sensory-specific satiety: the effect that appreciation for a food eaten to satiety decreases without a similar decrease in the appreciation of other foods with other sensory characteristics.",
              "(34) Sensory scientists usually refer to smelling through the nostrils as \u201corthonasal perception\u201d, whereas the aroma compounds that gain access to the olfactory epithelium through the nasopharynx (i.",
              "e., molecules released in the mouth) are referred to as being perceived retronasally.",
              "The latter is often mistakenly referred to as taste by laymen.",
              "It should perhaps more correctly be referred to as flavor, although we prefer to think of flavor as the combination of the perception of taste in the mouth and retronasal aroma in the nose (see section below).",
              "It is one of the challenges for Molecular Gastronomy to develop an appropriate language that can be used by chefs, the general public, as well as the scientific community to describe the various ways we interpret the signals from our chemical senses.",
              "When eating a food the initial olfactory stimulation takes place as we smell the aroma of the food before the food is in the mouth.",
              "Thus, orthonasal perception is often said to be of the external world.",
              "In contrast, the aromas perceived retronasally are said to be of the oral cavity (the interior world).",
              "Small and colleagues(35) compared these two distinct pathways of delivering odorants and found different patterns of neural activation depending on whether the aroma compounds are delivered ortho- or retronasally.",
              "Further, a few experiments examined differences in perception of aromas delivered by the two pathways;",
              "these have rather variable results.",
              "In one study, Aubry and colleagues(36) found no overall difference in the ability of trained sensory panelists to describe a set of Burgundy wines.",
              "By contrast, other research examining the dose\u2212response behavior of flavor molecules ortho- and retronasally have revealed differences which depend strongly on the physical characteristics of the aroma compounds.",
              "(37) Much further work is needed before we will be able to understand the extent to which individuals perceive odor differently depending on whether they are delivered ortho- or retronasally;",
              "at his stage, all we can do is to note that it is likely that there will be a range of where the initial smell (the orthonasal stimulus) may be rather different from their \u201cflavor\u201d (the combination of the taste and retronasal stimulus).",
              "One such example that is well known to gourmets is that of the pungent smelling Durian fruit, which has, for most people, a very unpleasant (toilet-like) aroma when smelled orthonasally but, for many, a very pleasing flavor when in the mouth and the aroma is detected retronasally.",
              "As we have already noted, the overall \u201cflavor\u201d of a food is determined by the combination of many stimuli both in the mouth and nose.",
              "Most authors argue the important senses are those of taste, (retronasal) smell, as well as the less well-known, mouthfeel and chemesthesis.",
              "(38) In this section we will briefly review the sense of chemesthesis.",
              "In humans, sensory nerve endings from branches of the trigeminal nerve are found in the epithelia of the nose and oral cavity.",
              "Signals transmitted by these nerves are responsible for the pungency of foods, as exemplified in carbonated drinks, chili, ginger, mustard, and horseradish;",
              "accordingly, chemesthesis is also sometimes referred to as the \u201ctrigeminal sense\u201d.",
              "Hot spices are typical stimulants of trigeminal sensory nerve endings, but most chemicals will stimulate these nerve endings at sufficiently high physical concentration.",
              "Without pungency many foods would be bland;",
              "imagine horseradish without the heat or garlic with no bite.",
              "Clearly, the sense of chemesthesis must play a crucial role in our the evaluation of the palatability of any food.",
              "The sensation of oral pungency differs in many ways from the sense of taste.",
              "For example, pungency typically has a slow onset but can persist for prolonged periods, minutes to tens of minutes.",
              "This is contrary to the sense of taste, which is most intense for the few seconds the food is in the mouth.",
              "This difference in the temporal nature of pungency and taste is of great interest when considering of the palatability of foods and the overall satiety they provide.",
              "In many cases, the long-term effects of pungency will make foods both more palatable and more satiating.",
              "Further, the interesting temporal properties of trigeminal sensation may be exploited in the development of new gastronomic meals both for their ability to surprise on a short time scale (seconds) and for reasons of novelty.",
              "In the search of \u201cflavor principles\u201d, i.",
              "e., rules of thumb of which sensory attributes should be present in a good flavor, trigeminal stimulation certainly will play a large role.",
              "Szczesniak(39) succinctly defines of texture as \u201c.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "the sensory and functional manifestation of the structural, mechanical and surface properties of foods detected through the senses of vision, hearing, touch and kinesthetics\u201d.",
              "This definition clearly conveys the important point that texture is a sensory property and thus requires a perceiver.",

              "(345) The mere anticipation of novelty seems to recruit reward systems.(346) Novelty per se, of course, will not on its own guarantee a reward.",
              "It is easy to imagine novel foods which will generate a feeling of disgust rather than pleasure.",
              "Novel dishes with a clear relationship or reference to familiar dishes have in one recent experiment been shown to be appreciated more than those that do not.",
              "(347) As an integral part of molecular gastronomy studies of, presumably universal, principles of how to join different sensations in space and time to obtain optimal pleasure are central.",
              "The application of physics and chemistry to the study of the soft but very complex materials that make up foods, in conjunction with modern psychophysical and neurophysiological studies of pleasure and satiety, could both contribute to a deeper understanding of human reward systems as well as to development of new foodstuffs that could bring more pleasure and healthier lifestyles to the eater.",
              "For anyone who has read through all the preceding sections, it should be readily apparent that the overall effect of any individual foodstuff, let alone a complete dish or meal, is influenced by a diverse and complex set of factors that start with the production of the ingredients and via their processing, both physical and chemical, to produce aroma and tastant molecules as well as change the texture and color end as the food is eaten and digested with the sensations sent from all our senses to our brains, where we decide whether or not we enjoyed the experience and degree of pleasure imparted.",
              "Accordingly, if we are ever to be able to predict, a priori, how delicious a food might be, it will require serious collaborative efforts from scientists of all the chemical (and other) disciplines.",
              "As we have seen, some areas are much better understood than others.",
              "Some of the chemical reactions are generally well understood.",
              "Others, such as the Maillard reactions, are much well less understood;",
              "although general schemes exist, the full details of these reactions still remain far too complex to permit any complete description.",
              "We will later in this section outline some of the major challenges which we believe are possible to tackle in the short term as well as lay out a potential long-term strategy for the future development of Molecular Gastronomy as a scientific discipline in its own right.",
              "However, before we get carried away with grandiose schemes, we should return to a more basic and most important issue.",
              "We should address the question of why should the pursuit of all this research be worthwhile.",
              "Is Molecular Gastronomy necessary?",
              "To answer this question, we describe in the following sections a few aspects where MG may be able to make significant contributions in the near future.",
              "These range from questions that concern chefs and cooks, such as why do some food pairings enhance flavor while others can be quite unpleasant, to socially important issues such as how we might persuade people to adopt healthier diets and how we can encourage more youngsters to take up careers in the sciences.",
              "It is obvious that the extent to which individuals enjoy the food they eat depends on a number of factors related to the food itself as well as their own individual set of experiences and memories.",
              "It is also clear that given choice and opportunity individuals will tend to eat that which they enjoy.",
              "Thus, it should be possible, if we can gain a better understanding of how enjoyment relates to the food preparation itself, to influence the diet of individuals in a positive, more healthy, fashion.",
              "There is no inherent reason why high palatability should necessarily lead to a larger intake.",
              "One can easily argue that it is the other way around: if eating is as much an activity engaged in to obtain pleasure as it is a means to secure the necessary energy intake, high palatabilty in a meal will lead to a smaller energy intake because sufficient satisfaction is obtained with smaller portion sizes.",
              "If this could be demonstrated in a number of cases, so that \u201cquantity\u201d could be replaced by \u201cquality\u201d, it may become possible to encourage more appropriate eating behavior in an environment with high food availability.",
              "More work to investigate the existing anecdotal evidence that we eat and drink less of high-quality products than we do of more mediocre products could indeed provide evidence for such a possible replacement of \u201cquantity\u201d with \u201cquality\u201d.",
              "We think that Molecular Gastronomy is particularly well suited to make a contribution here because of the precise definition and high sensory quality of the foods we work with in Molecular Gastronomy.",
              "For example, particular sensory dimensions can be defined much more precisely by means of the methods used in Molecular Gastronomy.",
              "Experimenting with new physical and chemical methods which are used in Molecular Gastronomy kitchens and laboratories allows us to acquire many new insights about the individual senses\u2019 contribution to satisfaction and satiety.",
              "Along the way we will also need to develop new methods to quantify \u2018satisfaction\u2019, both psychophysically and neurophysiologically and by means of biochemical and neuropharmacological measurements.",
              "In this way one might hope that MG could also become a driver of development in the more psychological, neurological, and biochemical aspects of eating behavior.",
              "One area of some immediate potential is the investigation of the relationship between food complexity and satiety.",
              "In particular, by using highly palatable, real, and complete meals, rather than the more usual simple single food (such as fruit juices or yogurts) approaches, we believe it should be possible to make a direct impact on food choice and intake.",
              "Over the last 50 years the Western diet has changed enormously.",
              "For example, the British population eats less red meat, more poultry, and more processed food than 30 years ago.",
              "Although British Government statistics suggest that the consumption of fats, carbohydrates, and protein is falling and that of vegetable and fruit intake is increasing, there has still been a 10% rise in the incidence of obesity in the last 10 years.",
              "(348) Data from the United States suggest that a key determinant in the increase in obesity is consumption of processed and \u201cfast\u201d foods;",
              "higher weight is associated with more food eaten away from home.",
              "(349) In the United Kingdom about 30% of food expenditure is on food eaten outside the home.",
              "When eating out, people tend to consume larger portion sizes and more calories.",
              "(350) Accordingly, we should ask are there opportunities for Molecular Gastronomy to provide routes to improved diet and consequently through that the health of indivduals.",
              "Foods vary tremendously in their energy density.",
              "During eating we need to predict how much food to consume in order to satisfy current and future short-term needs.",
              "One possibility is that meal size is governed by a simple feedback mechanism such as a gut hormone that is released or reaches a critical level when enough energy has been absorbed.",
              "However, the system needs to be more adaptable because meal termination occurs well before a significant proportion of food is emptied from the stomach for absorption.",
              "(351) In part, we overcome this problem by learning to predict the likely consequences of consuming individual foods (for a review, see ref (352)).",
              "However, in addition to these food-specific associations, meal size also appears to be influenced by a range of other factors including food palatability,(353) serving size,(354) and the number of people present at a meal(355) irrespective of the specific food that is being consumed.",
              "Food complexity is not a straightforward concept and can be defined in many ways.",
              "If complexity is defined as the sensory experience, it might be argued that increasing flavor complexity could provide for increasing enjoyment and satiation.",
              "Conversely, it could be argued that highly processed foods, despite being potentially nutritionally less valuable, can also be extremely complex but in terms of their constituents rather than their flavors.",
              "For example, a simple pasta sauce prepared at home might contain olive oil, onion, garlic, tomato, tomato puree, and seasonings (salt, pepper, maybe some herbs), whereas a preprepared sauce might also contain sugar, modified maize starch, an acidity regulator such as citric acid, white wine vinegar, onion extract, and other nonspecified flavorings.",
              "In addition to the potential effect of flavor or constituent complexity on food intake and satiety, there is an additional dimension to the sensory experience of eating that is textural complexity and palatability.",
              "Controlling for taste quality, a lessened desire to eat \u201chard\u201d foods has been reported following consumption of a \u201chard\u201d lunch,(356) and other work suggests that satiety can be affected by somatosensory features (texture, feel, quality) in addition to taste quality.",
              "It is not at all clear how different complexities in food may contribute to food intake and satiety.",
              "On the basis of the above lines of evidence, it is at least possible that different aspects of food complexity play an important role in determining the satiating quality of foods and that the specific effect of complexity might be mediated via particular kinds of taste profiles.",
              "In recent years our affection for processed and manufactured foods has increased markedly.",
              "Yet, little is known about the complexity of these foods relative to \u2018home prepared\u2019 equivalents.",
              "By elucidating a role for complexity we may be better placed to explain the commonly held view that processed foods are overconsumed and regarded as unhealthy on this basis.",
              "Of course, this is a very simplistic approach to satiety and enjoyment of food;",
              "complexity is at best just one of many factors affecting our appreciation of the food we eat.",
              "Nevertheless, the role of sensory complexity has not been previously measured or explored with respect to pleasure, palatability, food intake, and satiety.",
              "It is therefore clear that the links between sensory complexity, on the one hand, and pleasure, palatability, food intake, and satiety, on the other, are areas worthy of a proper scientific investigation.",
              "Such a study could be an excellent opportunity for Molecular Gastronomy to demonstrate a societal useful role.",
              "While there are some models already in the literature that attempt to describe the heat transfer in food as it cooks, these are not, in general, of much utility for the domestic cook or the chef in a restaurant.",
              "However, these people are those who are most often in need of simply and clear guidance on the optimum temperature and time to cook particular foods.",
              "This situation provides a wealth of opportunities for research with the objective of producing straightforward to use models that can be used in the kitchen.",
              "For example, we can envisage a computer package that provided with the dimensions, type, and cut of a piece of meat can suggest a range of different cooking methods (times and temperatures and even temperature profiles) that will give a range of different textures, colors, and flavors in the finished product.",
              "Such a tool could prove invaluable in any busy kitchen.",
              "Such a system might be developed either from a purely theoretical standpoint or by a purely experimental approach.",
              "However, neither alone is likely to prove successful.",
              "The pure theory will find it hard to deal with the variability of meats, the different mass transport that will occur with different cuts, and the odd shapes and sizes of real pieces of meat.",
              "At the same time a purely empirical approach would involve the need to test such a large range of different examples that it is unlikely ever to provide for all the possible examples met in a real kitchen.",
              "It will only be through a combination of theory and experiment and collaborations between chefs and scientists working together that truly useful models and systems can be produced.",
              "However, it is not only in the area of meat cookery that predictive cooking models can prove useful;",
              "the whole area of gels and gelation (under what conditions will the diverse range of food-approved gelling agents actually form gels, what properties will these gels have, and how stable will they remain) is another area that is ripe for development of a detailed set of models.",
              "While much of this information is in the scientific literature, much is not and still needs to be discovered.",
              "For example, most phase diagrams of gelling systems are produced for just a single example of the gelling agent;",
              "other batches (or batches from a different source) are likely to have quite different molecular weights and distributions of molecular weights, making their gelling characteristics quite different.",
              "Formulating a schema which permits simple measurements (such as intrinsic viscosity) to be made and using these to predict gelling behavior in the kitchen would be another step forward.",
              "Another area where MG may be able to contribute significantly and directly to the kitchen is that of food pairings.",
              "Chefs continually search for novel and interesting food and flavor combinations.",
              "Currently much of this work is hit and miss, although a number of empirical models have started ot emerge and led to Web sites that offer suggested food pairings based on a concept of synergy between foods that contain similar components.",
              "It is interesting to note that here chefs are beginning to propose models that scientists should be able to test as MG develops.",
              "Molecular gastronomy attempts to bridge the gaps between work in physics and chemistry over technology and food preparation to sensory perception and pleasure.",
              "Within this framework there is ample space to experiment with well-known (and less well-known) perceptual effects in space and time.",
              "Under this heading, studies of \u201cflavor principles\u201d, in the most general sense of the phrase, are of great interest.",
              "Why do some foodstuffs go well with some others but not all?",
              "What are the not well-understood chemical and perceptual principles underlying these phenomena?",
              "Do \u201cflavor principles\u201d transcend \u201cfood cultures\u201d?",
              "Not such that the very same dishes should be highly appreciated all over the world but such that certain combinations of basic sensory perceptions would be enjoyed universally.",
              "Elucidation of these problems would not only be highly interesting from a scientific point of view but could potentially also make a major contribution to more appropriate eating behaviors worldwide.",
              "It is, however, not enough just to prepare food;",
              "we want to prepare the best and most delicious, nutritious, and healthy food we possibly can.",
              "However, how can we explain that the food really does taste good?",
              "How can we describe flavor?",
              "Is it possible to create a language of taste and flavor so that we understand how different people appreciate the same food differently?",
              "We have seen that the perception of flavor depends not only the taste and aroma molecules present in food but also on the way in which they are released in the mouth, which in turn depends on the individual eating the food.",
              "These are all hard questions and involve not only the scientific community but importantly chefs, cooks, and of course the public at large.",
              "Here are opportunities to engage the public directly in research.",
              "In sensory science much progress has been made in naming food characteristics and finding descriptions and reference materials for sensory perceptions.",
              "Furthermore, many studies have been made to describe relationships between physical/chemical stimuli in foods and perceptions, although mainly under strict laboratory-controlled conditions in a sensory laboratory.",
              "As we increase the communication between those who cook and those who are interested in the scientific basis of what happens as we cook (and consume) our food, so mutual benefits can arise.",
              "Chefs will persistently ask difficult questions that can lead to new research opportunities: why do some pairs of foods work so well together while others do not?",
              "Is there a way we can predict whether a particular pair of foods will make a \u201cgood\u201d flavor combination or food pairing?",
              "The fact that chefs have asked this question has led some to hypothesize that if a pair of foods share similar aroma molecules they make good combinations in a dish.",
              "Although nothing more than a simple hypothesis, the concept has gained considerable approval within the gastronomy community;",
              "there are now several Web sites devoted to trying to suggest food pairings based on detailed analyses of the major aroma compounds found in the ingredients.",
              "However, there is no hard evidence for or against such a simple model;",
              "here then is another area ripe for proper research, research that of necessity would involve tasting some very fine foods indeed!",
              "Then there is the question of how ingredients are perceived as being \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cartificial\u201d, such terms can have very different meanings to scientists and the general public.",
              "It seems obvious to most in the scientific community that if a food molecule is healthy to use and imparts desirable characteristics to a dish, then whether it is extracted from a fruit or synthesized in a laboratory should not matter at all.",
              "Here those practicing MG should perhaps engage with the public and help them understand that, for example, chocolate is a highly processed food that is far from the general public perception of a natural foodstuff \u201cnatural\u201d while the much maligned and often perceived as \u201cartificial\u201d monosodium glutamate (E621) occurs naturally in a wide range of foods from mother\u2019s milk and tomatoes to cheese.",
              "One area where Molecular Gastronomy is already having an impact is in schools.",
              "In the United Kingdom, chemistry classes now often take experimental examples from the world of food science.",
              "This has been much encouraged and enhanced as some of the finest chefs (especially Heston Blumenthal) have not only acknowledged the usefulness of chemistry in their own cooking but produced materials that can be used in schools.",

              "restaurants sprang up everywhere to feed them.",
              "And the food changed, too.",
              "The elaborate banquets of the ancien regime, in which whole animals were stuffed and dressed and placed all at the same time on the table, were replaced by dishes that were served by waiters from a platter \u2013 in the Russian style.",
              "The new restaurants embodied the changed times: a menu of choice, individual portions served to anyone who could pay.",
              "Democracy on a plate.",
              "Almost as soon as they had invented the restaurant, the French invented the restaurant scene.",
              "The first restaurant critic, Grimod de la Reynie\u0300re, wrote reviews in his gazette, the Gourmet\u2019s Almanac.",
              "By the time Napoleon had been defeated for the first time, in 1814, the almanac listed more than 300 restaurants in Paris.",
              "The lexicon of cuisine soon followed.",
              "Marie-Antoine Care\u0302me was the first celebrity chef, who cooked for kings and emperors, and wrote the code of French cooking, categorising the five great mother sauces (be\u0301chamel, espagnole, veloute\u0301, hollandaise and tomato) from which all others were derived.",
              "Later, Escoffier organised the restaurant kitchen into the strict hierarchy that still prevails today, from the commis chefs at the bottom, to the chefs de parties who oversee the different stations of meat or fish or cold starter, to the sous chef and the chef de cuisine.",
              "Meanwhile, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, a lawyer who coined the term gastronome, had made the intellectual leap: enjoying food was not just a pleasurable distraction, he argued, but a civilising art of existential import.",
              "As he once wrote: \u201cTell me what you eat and I\u2019ll tell you what you are.",
              "\u201d All the grammar and idiom of what we know and understand as \u201ca restaurant\u201d was developed by the French in the 19th century.",
              "The menu, the progression of canape\u0301s and hors d\u2019oeuvres followed by entre\u0301e, plat and dessert, the accompanying march of aperitif, wine, coffee, digestif.",
              "The way a Mai\u0302tre D (Mai\u0302tre d\u2019ho\u0302tel, or master of the house) welcomes guests, the formality of the waiters wearing traditional black tie.",
              "There was a specific pomp and performance to a restaurant, that was different to a diner or a pub or a taverna.",
              "In time, it would come to connote a sophistication that became seen as the special preserve of the French \u2013 and, for us rude mechanical Anglo-Saxons, the height of our aspirations.",
              "Through the 19th century, the restaurant flourished and evolved.",
              "The bistro was a cheerful neighbourhood place, often run by a husband and wife.",
              "Brasseries were brewery eateries brought to Paris by Alsatian refugees from the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, serving choucroute and draught beer.",
              "Bouillons were popular, working-class cafeterias that served cheap food in vast dining rooms that could seat hundreds at a time.",
              "There were dozens of bouillons in Paris between 1850-1950.",
              "Several were chains \u2013 the first restaurant groups, perhaps even the first fast-food joints \u2014 reaping economies of scale by sourcing in bulk and flipping tables as fast as a revolving door.",
              "By the time I got to Paris there was only one left, Chartier, in a forgotten corner of the ninth arrondissement.",
              "I used to go there often for the everyday classics: oeuf dur mayonnaise, carottes rape\u0301es, poulet-frites, te\u0302te de veau.",
              "It had nicotine-coloured walls and the chattery humidity of a winter lunchtime crowd, and I liked to imagine it was the kind of place where Orwell had washed dishes when he was down and out.",
              "During the Belle E\u0301poque, between the Franco-Prussian War and the next German invasion of France in 1914, Paris was the capital of the world.",
              "It embodied the breakneck speed and excitement of the times: cinema, Pasteur, the Eiffel Tower, aeroplanes, telephones, motor cars, impressionism, expressionism, cubism, Proust, Rimbaud, Diaghilev, art nouveau, haute couture and towering hats.",
              "Paris in the Belle E\u0301poque was zenith of style and taste;",

              "More than 100 years later, sometimes, as I would glance at a menu rich with foie gras, cream and beef, I would think they were consoling themselves by continuing to eat it.",
              "But by the time Lost Generation were carousing in its past glories in the 1920s, Paris was already living as a romanticised version of itself.",
              "AJ Liebling, later to become a war reporter covering D-Day and a famous New Yorker essayist, fell in love with French restaurants in his early 20s, even as plenty of older gourmets were lamenting that their heyday was over.",
              "For a long time after the second world war, no one noticed the decline of the French restaurant, partly because there was little competition.",
              "The British were boiling their vegetables to grey, and battering and frying everything else;",
              "the Americans were gelatinising salads and defrosting dinner.",
              "Chinese and Indian restaurants were still widely seen as cheap options (and still emulated the French with tablecloths and origami napkins), sushi was raw fish, and hardly anyone had been on holiday to Thailand or Morocco yet.",
              "In the 70s my parents \u2013 like other foodies at the time \u2013 planned whole trips around the puffed asterisk recommendations of the Michelin Guide.",
              "Le Guide Michelin was first published in 1900 to encourage the early motorists to visit restaurants in the provinces, and soon became the grand arbiter of French cuisine.",
              "Obscure, definitive, conjuring an image of a lonely, corpulent inspector able to swallow whole goose livers in one gulp, Michelin had the power of a king to award stars and turn around the fortunes of a restaurant.",
              "But it also became a leviathan that focused on one kind of restaurant \u2013 those with formal dining rooms, white tablecloths and serried ranks of waiters.",
              "By the 90s, people had begun to complain that Michelin was hidebound and tended to favour its favourites.",
              "Fernand Point died in 1955, but Michelin continued to award La Pyramide three stars out of respect to his widow, who continued to run the restaurant, for more than 30 years until her death in 1986.",

              "The bill was piled on to sky-high VAT \u2013 19.",

              "Michelin stars became increasingly expensive to maintain.",
              "In 1996, Pierre Gagnaire\u2019s three-star restaurant went bankrupt.",
              "In 2003 the chef Bernard Loiseau, in debt and losing customers, shot himself after hearing rumours that he was going to lose his third Michelin star.",
              "In the average French restaurant, in the everyday bistros, the situation was dire.",
              "Restaurant owners complained that it had become exorbitantly expensive to hire workers and almost impossible to fire them.",
              "The crisis grew.",
              "In 2010, a documentary expose\u0301 on French TV channel Canal Plus broadcast undercover footage from inside the giant warehouse of an industrial caterer showing restaurateurs piling frozen ready meals into giant shopping carts.",
              "By one estimation, 70% of restaurants were using pre-prepared or frozen ingredients or sauces.",
              "It was clear that restaurants could no longer afford to employ people to peel potatoes, chop carrots, mince garlic, pick through parsley and all the other time-consuming jobs at the bottom of the food chain.",
              "Much easier to just buy the pre-prepped version and reheat it.",
              "What I had noticed as gravied blandness had become a national scandal.",
              "The government intervened to save the French restaurant.",
              "In 2009, they reduced VAT (it went down to 5.",
              "5%, and is now at 10%) and a few years later introduced a new labelling system for restaurants, fait maison, made in-house, to indicate that dishes were freshly prepared.",
              "However, there were so many exemptions allowed \u2013 vegetables, except for potatoes, could be bought frozen, ready-peeled and chopped \u2013 that the designation was a pretty useless marker of quality.",
              "Conservation can breed conservatism.",
              "Over the decades, French cuisine has been increasingly codified.",
              "The system of appellation d\u2019origine contro\u0302le\u0301e, a governmental designation that creates legal labelling criteria for the provenance and quality of food products, was introduced in 1935 and now encompasses over 300 wines, 46 cheeses, and foods such as Puy lentils and Corsican honey.",
              "The famous Bresse chicken, with its tricolore colouring of blue feet, white feathers and red cockscomb, must be raised with a minimum of 10 sq metres of pasture per bird, finished and fattened on grain for two weeks and then killed at minimum age of four months and a minimum weight of 1.",
              "2kg, before it can be certified with a special metal ring around its dead leg stamped with the name of the producer.",
              "At the same time, France has developed exacting professional qualifications for its chefs, patissiers, bakers, butchers, charcutiers, chocolatiers.",
              "The CAP diploma (certificat d\u2019aptitude professionnelle, which also covers plumbers, electricians, hairdressers and other trades) \u2013 is almost a prerequisite to working in culinary fields.",
              "For example, you can bake and sell bread without a CAP diploma, but for the first three years, you are not allowed to put up a sign that says Boulangerie.",
              "These trades are further organised into professional guilds and confederations, each with their own criteria for inclusion.",
              "There is also a prestigious state competition open to many trades, from stonemasons to sommeliers.",
              "Over several days of tests, those few who are deemed by their peers in the profession to have qualified receive the title of un des meilleurs ouvriers \u2013 one of the best craftspeople in France \u2013 and earn the right to wear a tricoleur collar.",
              "(Just watch the 2009 documentary Kings of Pastry, to understand the rigour and tears and seriousness with which this distinction is won.",
              "The pastry event is held every four years, entry is by invitation and only three or four patissieres will be judged worthy to ascend to the ranks of Meilleur Ouvrier.)",
              "There are also many gastronomic associations that celebrate and preserve specific dishes and maintain the traditional versions of te\u0302te de veau, cassoulet, andouille, boudin and regional specialities such as the black figs of Caromb and cherries of Venasque.",
              "These associations confer and organise awards, badges, dinners, festivals and competitions.",
              "I once met two representatives of the Association to Safeguard the Oeuf Mayonnaise, who were very happy to explain, without any irony, the criteria for an excellent example of the form.",
              "\u201cIt depends on the eggs, their freshness, how well they are cooked, and then the nap of the mayonnaise must be perfect \u2013 it should cover the eggs and not fall down too easily.",
              "\u201d This is all a great celebration of a grand culinary legacy, but there is a danger of tradition being codified into obsolescence, creativity shackled by specifications and rules.",
              "There has always been a tension in French restaurant kitchens between tradition and innovation.",
              "In the late 60s, a young generation of chefs revolted against the old order, as the rupture between the old and the young in the violence and general strike of 1968 pushed change in restaurants, too.",
              "They rebelled against Care\u0302me\u2019s gluey, flour-thickened gravies and began to make sauces out of vegetables and herbs.",
              "This movement became known as nouvelle cuisine and was championed by a new guide that hoped to overthrow Michelin\u2019s regime.",
              "In 1973, its eponymous editors Henri Gault and Christian Millau issued their manifesto: \u201cDown with the old-fashioned image of the typical bon vivant, that puffy personage with his napkin tucked under his chin, his lips dripping veal stock .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "no more of those terrible brown sauces and white sauces, those espagnoles, those pe\u0301rigueux with truffles, those be\u0301chamels and mornays that have assassinated as many livers as they have covered indifferent foods.",
              "They are forbidden!",
              "\u201d Nouvelle cuisine focused on simplicity.",
              "At the forefront of the new cooking, the Troisgros Brothers\u2019 salmon with sorrel was as famous for its fresh acidity as it was for its pretty colours: pink and vivid green.",
              "For the first time, French chefs sent out dishes already carefully arranged on the plate.",
              "Gone were the table-side theatrics of flambe\u0301eing and carving, pressing whole duck carcasses in silver duck presses and quenelling sorbet;",
              "waiters were relegated to ferrying plates.",
              "But the plates were as pretty as a picture and, for the first time, chefs\u2019 cookbooks began to heavily feature glossy colour photographs.",
              "Nouvelle cuisine was as much as aesthetic revolution as it was a culinary one.",
              "There is much that modern chefs and their happy customers owe to the nouvelle cuisine movement \u2013 the art of plating, fish lightly cooked to opalescent instead of woolly, the liberal use of herbs \u2013 but at the time, plenty of people liked to laugh at the fussiness of the presentation and complained that the portions were too small.",
              "Innovations and the reactions to them have always been part of the kitchen table debate.",
              "In 1996, several well-known French chefs including Joe\u0308l Robuchon, of mashed-potato fame, and Alain Ducasse, probably the most famous French chef alive today, issued a manifesto denouncing the \u201cglobalisation of cuisine\u201d and innovation for its own sake.",
              "Eighteen months after the reactionary manifesto, opposing chefs of equal stature \u2013 known as the \u201cgroup of eight\u201d \u2013 fired back, rejecting nostalgia in favour of experimentation in the kitchen.",
              "It is tempting to draw a neat loop from culinary conservatism to culinary cul-de-sacs, but this isn\u2019t really fair.",
              "France has consistently produced extraordinary chefs cooking extraordinary food.",
              "This year, The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants, the list first published in 2002 that has largely replaced Michelin as a global guide to top restaurants, ranked Mirazur in the south of France as No 1.",
              "It\u2019s more the general mid-level restaurant culture that had got stuck, but in France, just like everywhere else, the internet has been breaking down frontiers and collapsing distances between trends and ideas and dishes.",
              "In the new global foodie zeitgeist, a younger generation of chefs are now establishing themselves in French kitchens.",
              "Increasingly, they have trained in restaurants in London, New York, Copenhagen or Barcelona.",
              "When I came back to Paris in 2014, after four years away, a new era was in full swing.",
              "The hip new places used jamo\u0301n Ibe\u0301rico, turmeric and yuzu in their dishes, eschewed tablecloths and had pared a new \u201cbistronomy\u201d movement back to bare wooden tabletops, small plates and handwritten menus that changed daily.",
              "Just as before, they were championed by a new restaurant guide, Le Fooding, founded in 2000, which, with its Anglo-ish name, illustrated a new openness to global influences.",
              "This was all very welcome, delicious and fun.",
              "But often it felt as if France was borrowing from other food cultures \u2013 there was a lot of raw-fish appetisers, main courses a la plancha, and the ubiquitous burrata \u2013 rather than reinventing or reinvigorating its own.",
              "For a long time, I felt as if good French food in Paris were the domain of a few almost prohibitively expensive, old-faithful restaurants, while the smattering of newer places were uber-chic and often booked up.",
              "The perfect bistro around the corner no longer seemed to exist.",
              "Of course, this is personal observation;",
              "everyone has their finds and their favorites.",
              "But where I live in Montmartre (a touristy area, it\u2019s true), the classic French restaurant where the locals go \u2013 a large, jolly place with great platters of fruits de mer and fleets of waiters \u2013 easily cost us well over \u20ac100 for two, without much wine or dessert.",
              "For many years, Chartier was my stand-by, and the only bouillon in Paris providing a cheap but hearty sit-down meal.",
              "Suddenly, in the past year or so, three others have opened.",
              "They have been so successful that their proprietors are planning to open more.",
              "Back to basics is proving popular.",
              "The Bouillon Pigalle opened in my neighbourhood a little over a year ago, an updated version of the genre.",
              "The space is modern and bright with clean lines, but the old, familiar style of decor has been respected;",
              "the banquettes are red and long baggage racks run above the tables, although these days people put their motorcycle helmets on them, not their hats.",
              "The young manager, Jean Christophe, told me that for the menu they had deliberately returned to nostalgia.",
              "\u201cThere are hamburgers and Caesar salad everywhere, but we can\u2019t find our cultural recipes.",
              "We thought: \u2018What can we do that reminds us of our grandmother\u2019s cooking?",
              "\u2019\u201d On the menu is celeri remoulade, herring in oil with potatoes, marrow bones, escargots, cauliflower cheese, boeuf bourguignon, pot-au-feu, blanquette de veau, roast chicken with frites.",
              "You can eat a starter, a main course, have a glass or two of wine and come out with change from a \u20ac20 note.",
              "The food is very good, but it\u2019s not going to stick in your memory, change the way you think about food, or make you hanker for a certain dish for years afterwards.",
              "Maybe we are now surrounded by so much variety and plenty that we have lost our ability to be amazed by food in the way my parents once were.",
              "Maybe what we think we remember about the glories of the French restaurant \u2013 because nostalgia is really a false memory, the longing for something that never really existed \u2013 is not really the meal, but the unexpected pleasure of the meal, the discovery of deliciousness.",
              "A\u0300 la recherche du temps perdu;",
              "the ability to be surprised by something we eat is a mouthful of madeleine that is long gone.",
              "Perhaps restaurants are less about the food than we think, and our relationship with them is more emotional and social than gustatory.",
              "When I asked a group of French restaurateurs what was the most important ingredient to a restaurant they answered, in unison, \u201cambiance\u201d \u2013 the feel of the place.",
              "The last time I had dinner at Bouillon Pigalle I watched people at tables talking, plotting, flirting, celebrating.",
              "There were old people, solo diners, tourist families, couples on a date.",
              "The tables are side-by-side so you rub elbows with your neighbour, pass the salt, swap menu advice, get chatting.",
              "I realised that this is the fun and flow of the French restaurant experience.",
              "The waiter brought another demi-carafe of wine, conversation sparked and hummed, one table sang happy birthday, another was laughing loudly.",
              "The French after all, are master purveyors of joie-de-vivre.",
              "At Bouillon Pigalle, the line is permanently out the door.",

              "The last momentous evolution of French food \u2013 Nouvelle Cuisine, spearheaded by Paul Bocuse in the 1970s \u2013 was in large part driven by the desire by chefs to create cuisine for which they themselves would be recognised, breaking from traditional dishes to make lighter, healthier and hyper-personalised dishes that challenged some of the rules of classic French cooking.",

              "But in April 2020, Ducasse, who had never offered a takeaway or delivery service before \u2013 or even considered it \u2013 launched Ducasse Chez Moi, an online delivery platform featuring a selection of dishes from his Paris restaurants including Champeaux and Spoon.",
              "As part of the shift, he also launched Naturaliste, an inexpensive, plant-forward delivery and takeaway restaurant in the kitchen of Aux Lyonnais, behind its shuttered dining room.",

              "The maitre d' was busy greeting customers at the takeaway window, taking orders for Naturaliste.",
              "For Ducasse, Covid-19 sped up France's next gastronomical evolution, which he says is marked by a profound desire for human contact, an interplay between global influence and local produce, the growing role of plant-based cuisine and a rapidly evolving consumer.",
