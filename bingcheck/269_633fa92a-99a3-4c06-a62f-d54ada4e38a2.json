    "query": "Can you explain the physics behind time travel, and what current research is being conducted to explore the feasibility and potential consequences of traveling through time?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. The physics of time travel is based on the idea that time and space are linked together by Einstein's theory of relativity[^2^] [^4^]. According to this theory, the faster you travel, the slower you experience time[^2^]. This means that if you could travel at the speed of light or near a very massive object, you could travel into the future[^2^] [^5^]. However, traveling into the past is much more difficult and controversial. Some physicists have proposed that certain geometries of spacetime or specific types of motion in space might allow time travel into the past if these geometries or motions were possible[^4^]. These include wormholes, rotating black holes, cosmic strings, and closed timelike curves[^4^]. However, these scenarios face many challenges and paradoxes, such as the grandfather paradox[^3^], which involves traveling back in time and killing your own grandfather, thereby preventing your own existence[^3^]. To avoid inconsistency, some circumstance will have to occur which makes you fail in this attempt to kill your grandfather[^3^]. This requires some implausible constraint on otherwise unrelated circumstances[^3^]. Some physicists have suggested that quantum mechanics might resolve some of these paradoxes by allowing for multiple histories or parallel universes[^6^], but this is still speculative and not well understood[^6^].\n\nAs for the current research on time travel, most of it is theoretical and mathematical, as there is no experimental evidence or technology that can test or enable time travel. Some of the active areas of research include exploring the properties and consequences of wormholes, black holes, cosmic strings, and closed timelike curves; investigating the compatibility of quantum mechanics and general relativity in the context of time travel; and developing new models and concepts of time travel that avoid or resolve paradoxes and inconsistencies. However, these research topics are very challenging and complex, and there is no consensus or certainty among physicists about whether time travel is possible or not.",

              "[2][3] Joseph Larmor (1897), at least for electrons orbiting a nucleus, wrote that individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [rest] system in the ratio: 1 \u2212 v 2 c 2 {\\textstyle {\\sqrt {1-{\\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}} .",
              "[4] Emil Cohn (1904) specifically related this formula to the rate of clocks.",
              "[5] In the context of special relativity it was shown by Albert Einstein (1905) that this effect concerns the nature of time itself, and he was also the first to point out its reciprocity or symmetry.",
              "[6] Subsequently, Hermann Minkowski (1907) introduced the concept of proper time which further clarified the meaning of time dilation.",
              "[7] Special relativity indicates that, for an observer in an inertial frame of reference, a clock that is moving relative to them will be measured to tick slower than a clock that is at rest in their frame of reference.",
              "This case is sometimes called special relativistic time dilation.",
              "The faster the relative velocity, the greater the time dilation between one another, with time slowing to a stop as one approaches the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s).",

              "Consider then, a simple vertical clock consisting of two mirrors A and B, between which a light pulse is bouncing.",
              "The separation of the mirrors is L and the clock ticks once each time the light pulse hits mirror A.",
              "In the frame in which the clock is at rest (see left part of the diagram), the light pulse traces out a path of length 2L and the period of the clock is 2L divided by the speed of light: From the frame of reference of a moving observer traveling at the speed v relative to the resting frame of the clock (right part of diagram), the light pulse is seen as tracing out a longer, angled path.",
              "Keeping the speed of light constant for all inertial observers requires a lengthening of the period of this clock from the moving observer's perspective.",
              "That is to say, as measured in a frame moving relative to the local clock, this clock will be running more slowly.",
              "Straightforward application of the Pythagorean theorem leads to the well-known prediction of special relativity: The total time for the light pulse to trace its path is given by: The length of the half path can be calculated as a function of known quantities as: Elimination of the variables D and L from these three equations results in: which expresses the fact that the moving observer's period of the clock \u0394 t \u2032 {\\displaystyle \\Delta t'} is longer than the period \u0394 t {\\displaystyle \\Delta t} in the frame of the clock itself.",
              "Because all clocks that have a common period in the resting frame should have a common period when observed from the moving frame, all other clocks\u2014mechanical, electronic, optical (such as an identical horizontal version of the clock in the example)\u2014should exhibit the same velocity-dependent time dilation.",
              "[17] Given a certain frame of reference, and the \"stationary\" observer described earlier, if a second observer accompanied the \"moving\" clock, each of the observers would perceive the other's clock as ticking at a slower rate than their own local clock, due to them both perceiving the other to be the one that is in motion relative to their own stationary frame of reference.",
              "Common sense would dictate that, if the passage of time has slowed for a moving object, said object would observe the external world's time to be correspondingly sped up.",
              "Counterintuitively, special relativity predicts the opposite.",
              "When two observers are in motion relative to each other, each will measure the other's clock slowing down, in concordance with them being in motion relative to the observer's frame of reference.",

              "[18] The reciprocity of the phenomenon also leads to the so-called twin paradox where the aging of twins, one staying on Earth and the other embarking on space travel, is compared, and where the reciprocity suggests that both persons should have the same age when they reunite.",
              "On the contrary, at the end of the round-trip, the traveling twin will be younger than the sibling on Earth.",

              "[41] Another approach involves a dense spinning cylinder usually referred to as a Tipler cylinder, a GR solution discovered by Willem Jacob van Stockum[42] in 1936 and Kornel Lanczos[43] in 1924, but not recognized as allowing closed timelike curves[44]: 21 until an analysis by Frank Tipler[45] in 1974.",

              "[46] A more fundamental objection to time travel schemes based on rotating cylinders or cosmic strings has been put forward by Stephen Hawking, who proved a theorem showing that according to general relativity it is impossible to build a time machine of a special type (a \"time machine with the compactly generated Cauchy horizon\") in a region where the weak energy condition is satisfied, meaning that the region contains no matter with negative energy density (exotic matter).",
              "Solutions such as Tipler's assume cylinders of infinite length, which are easier to analyze mathematically, and although Tipler suggested that a finite cylinder might produce closed timelike curves if the rotation rate were fast enough,[44]: 169 he did not prove this.",

              "[35]: 96 This result comes from Hawking's 1992 paper on the chronology protection conjecture, where he examines \"the case that the causality violations appear in a finite region of spacetime without curvature singularities\" and proves that \"there will be a Cauchy horizon that is compactly generated and that in general contains one or more closed null geodesics which will be incomplete.",
              "One can define geometrical quantities that measure the Lorentz boost and area increase on going round these closed null geodesics.",
              "If the causality violation developed from a noncompact initial surface, the averaged weak energy condition must be violated on the Cauchy horizon.\"",
              "[33] This theorem does not rule out the possibility of time travel by means of time machines with the non-compactly generated Cauchy horizons (such as the Deutsch-Politzer time machine) or in regions which contain exotic matter, which would be used for traversable wormholes or the Alcubierre drive and black hole.",

              "With the advent of general relativity it has been entertained by serious physicists.",
              "But, especially in the philosophy literature, there have been arguments that time travel is inherently paradoxical.",
              "The most famous paradox is the grandfather paradox: you travel back in time and kill your grandfather, thereby preventing your own existence.",
              "To avoid inconsistency some circumstance will have to occur which makes you fail in this attempt to kill your grandfather.",
              "Doesn\u2019t this require some implausible constraint on otherwise unrelated circumstances?",
              "We examine such worries in the context of modern physics.",
              "Modern physics strips away many aspects of the manifest image of time.",
              "Time as it appears in the equations of classical mechanics has no need for a distinguished present moment, for example.",
              "Relativity theory leads to even sharper contrasts.",
              "It replaces absolute simultaneity, according to which it is possible to unambiguously determine the time order of distant events, with relative simultaneity: extending an \u201cinstant of time\u201d throughout space is not unique, but depends on the state of motion of an observer.",
              "More dramatically, in general relativity the mathematical properties of time (or better, of spacetime)\u2014its topology and geometry\u2014depend upon how matter is arranged rather than being fixed once and for all.",
              "So physics can be, and indeed has to be, formulated without treating time as a universal, fixed background structure.",
              "Since general relativity represents gravity through spacetime geometry, the allowed geometries must be as varied as the ways in which matter can be arranged.",
              "Alongside geometrical models used to describe the solar system, black holes, and much else, the scope of variation extends to include some exotic structures unlike anything astrophysicists have observed.",
              "In particular, there are spacetime geometries with curves that loop back on themselves: closed timelike curves (CTCs), which describe the possible trajectory of an observer who returns exactly back to their earlier state\u2014without any funny business, such as going faster than the speed of light.",
              "These geometries satisfy the relevant physical laws, the equations of general relativity, and in that sense time travel is physically possible.",
              "Yet circular time generates paradoxes, familiar from science fiction stories featuring time travel:[1] The first two paradoxes were once routinely taken to show that solutions with CTCs should be rejected\u2014with charges varying from violating logic, to being \u201cphysically unreasonable\u201d, to undermining the notion of free will.",
              "Closer analysis of the paradoxes has largely reversed this consensus.",
              "Physicists have discovered many solutions with CTCs and have explored their properties in pursuing foundational questions, such as whether physics is compatible with the idea of objective temporal passage (starting with Go\u0308del 1949).",
              "Philosophers have also used time travel scenarios to probe questions about, among other things, causation, modality, free will, and identity (see, e.",

              "Attempts to change the past fail, and they fail, often tragically, in just such a way that they set the stage for the time traveler\u2019s self-defeating journey.",
              "The first question is whether there is an analog of the consistent story when it comes to physics in the presence of CTCs.",
              "As we will see, there is a remarkable general argument establishing the existence of consistent solutions.",
              "Yet a second question persists: why can\u2019t time-traveling Kurt kill his own grandfather?",
              "Doesn\u2019t the necessity of failures to change the past put unusual and unexpected constraints on time travelers, or objects that move along CTCs?",
              "The same argument shows that there are in fact no constraints imposed by the existence of CTCs, in some cases.",
              "After discussing this line of argument, we will turn to the palatability and further implications of such constraints if they are required, and then turn to the implications of quantum mechanics.",
              "Wheeler and Feynman (1949) were the first to claim that the fact that nature is continuous could be used to argue that causal influences from later events to earlier events, as are made possible by time travel, will not lead to paradox without the need for any constraints.",

              "e., negatives) have the opposite shades of gray from the objects they are pictures of.",
              "But since the object that comes out of the time machine is the developed film itself it we surely have a paradox.",
              "However, it does not take much thought to realize that there is no paradox here.",
              "What will happen is that a uniformly gray picture will emerge, which produces a developed film that has exactly the same uniform shade of gray.",
              "No matter what the sensitivity of the film is, as long as the dependence of the brightness of the developed film depends in a continuous manner on the brightness of the object being photographed, there will be a shade of gray that, when photographed, will produce exactly the same shade of gray on the developed film.",
              "This is the essence of Wheeler and Feynman\u2019s idea.",

              "By the time we come to stage \\(S_2\\) of the life of the film, it has been developed and is about to enter the time machine.",
              "Stage \\(S_3\\) occurs just after it exits the time machine and just before it is photographed.",
              "Stage \\(S_4\\) occurs after it has been photographed and before it starts fading away.",
              "Let us assume that the film starts out in stage \\(S_1\\) in some uniform shade of gray, and that the only significant change in the shade of gray of the film occurs between stages \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\).",
              "During that period it acquires a shade of gray that depends on the shade of gray of the object that was photographed.",
              "In other words, the shade of gray that the film acquires at stage \\(S_2\\) depends on the shade of gray it has at stage \\(S_3\\).",
              "The influence of the shade of gray of the film at stage \\(S_3\\), on the shade of gray of the film at stage \\(S_2\\), can be represented as a mapping, or function, from the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive), to the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive).",
              "Let us suppose that the process of photography is such that if one imagines varying the shade of gray of an object in a smooth, continuous manner then the shade of gray of the developed picture of that object will also vary in a smooth, continuous manner.",
              "This implies that the function in question will be a continuous function.",
              "Now any continuous function from the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) to the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) must map at least one number to itself.",
              "One can quickly convince oneself of this by graphing such functions.",
              "For one will quickly see that any continuous function \\(f\\) from \\([0,1]\\) to \\([0,1]\\) must intersect the line \\(x=y\\) somewhere, and thus there must be at least one point \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x)=x\\).",

              "The existence of such a fixed point implies a solution to the apparent paradox.",
              "Let us now be more general and allow color photography.",
              "One can represent each possible color of an object (of uniform color) by the proportions of blue, green and red that make up that color.",
              "(This is why television screens can produce all possible colors.)",
              "Thus one can represent all possible colors of an object by three points on three orthogonal lines \\(x, y\\) and \\(z\\), that is to say, by a point in a three-dimensional cube.",
              "This cube is also known as the \u201cCartesian product\u201d of the three line segments.",

              "What remains of the grandfather paradox in general relativistic time travel worlds is the fact that in some cases the states on edgeless spacelike surfaces are \u201coverconstrained\u201d, so that one has less than the usual freedom in specifying conditions on such a surface, given the time-travel structure, and in some cases such states are \u201cunderconstrained\u201d, so that states on edgeless space-like surfaces do not determine what happens elsewhere in the way that they usually do, given the time travel structure.",
              "There can also be mixtures of those two types of cases.",

              "If time travel entailed contradictions then the issue would be settled.",

              "It was certainly consistent with Aristotle\u2019s conception of water that it be homoiomerous, so this was, for him, a conceptual possibility.",
              "But if chemistry is right, Aristotle was wrong both about what water is like and what is possible for it.",
              "It can\u2019t be infinitely divided, even though no logical or conceptual analysis would reveal that.",
              "Similarly, even if all of our consistency conditions can be met, it does not follow that time travel is physically possible, only that some specific physical considerations cannot rule it out.",
              "The only serious proof of the possibility of time travel would be a demonstration of its actuality.",
              "For if we agree that there is no actual time travel in our universe, the supposition that there might have been involves postulating a substantial difference from actuality, a difference unlike in kind from anything we could know if firsthand.",
              "It is unclear to us exactly what the content of possible would be if one were to either maintain or deny the possibility of time travel in these circumstances, unless one merely meant that the possibility is not ruled out by some delineated set of constraints.",

              "This possibility was first discovered by Willem Jacob van Stockum in 1937[1] and later confirmed by Kurt Go\u0308del in 1949,[2] who discovered a solution to the equations of general relativity (GR) allowing CTCs known as the Go\u0308del metric;",
              "and since then other GR solutions containing CTCs have been found, such as the Tipler cylinder and traversable wormholes.",
              "If CTCs exist, their existence would seem to imply at least the theoretical possibility of time travel backwards in time, raising the spectre of the grandfather paradox, although the Novikov self-consistency principle seems to show that such paradoxes could be avoided.",
              "Some physicists speculate that the CTCs which appear in certain GR solutions might be ruled out by a future theory of quantum gravity which would replace GR, an idea which Stephen Hawking labeled the chronology protection conjecture.",
              "Others note that if every closed timelike curve in a given space-time passes through an event horizon, a property which can be called chronological censorship, then that space-time with event horizons excised would still be causally well behaved and an observer might not be able to detect the causal violation.",
              "[3] When discussing the evolution of a system in general relativity, or more specifically Minkowski space, physicists often refer to a \"light cone\".",
              "A light cone represents any possible future evolution of an object given its current state, or every possible location given its current location.",
              "An object's possible future locations are limited by the speed that the object can move, which is at best the speed of light.",
              "For instance, an object located at position p at time t0 can only move to locations within p + c(t1 \u2212 t0) by time t1.",
              "This is commonly represented on a graph with physical locations along the horizontal axis and time running vertically, with units of t {\\displaystyle t} for time and ct for space.",
              "Light cones in this representation appear as lines at 45 degrees centered on the object, as light travels at c t {\\displaystyle ct} per t {\\displaystyle t} .",
              "On such a diagram, every possible future location of the object lies within the cone.",
              "Additionally, every space location has a future time, implying that an object may stay at any location in space indefinitely.",
              "Any single point on such a diagram is known as an event.",
              "Separate events are considered to be timewise separated if they differ along the time axis, or spacewise separated if they differ along the space axis.",
              "If the object were in free fall, it would travel up the t-axis;",
              "if it accelerates, it moves across the x axis as well.",
              "The actual path an object takes through spacetime, as opposed to the ones it could take, is known as the worldline.",
              "Another definition is that the light cone represents all possible worldlines.",
              "In \"simple\" examples of spacetime metrics the light cone is directed forward in time.",
              "This corresponds to the common case that an object cannot be in two places at once, or alternately that it cannot move instantly to another location.",
              "In these spacetimes, the worldlines of physical objects are, by definition, timewise.",
              "However this orientation is only true of \"locally flat\" spacetimes.",
              "In curved spacetimes the light cone will be \"tilted\" along the spacetime's geodesic.",
              "For instance, while moving in the vicinity of a star, the star's gravity will \"pull\" on the object, affecting its worldline, so its possible future positions lie closer to the star.",
              "This appears as a slightly tilted lightcone on the corresponding spacetime diagram.",
              "An object in free fall in this circumstance continues to move along its local t {\\displaystyle t} axis, but to an external observer it appears it is accelerating in space as well\u2014a common situation if the object is in orbit, for instance.",
              "In extreme examples, in spacetimes with suitably high-curvature metrics, the light cone can be tilted beyond 45 degrees.",
              "That means there are potential \"future\" positions, from the object's frame of reference, that are spacelike separated to observers in an external rest frame.",
              "From this outside viewpoint, the object can move instantaneously through space.",
              "In these situations the object would have to move, since its present spatial location would not be in its own future light cone.",
              "Additionally, with enough of a tilt, there are event locations that lie in the \"past\" as seen from the outside.",
              "With a suitable movement of what appears to it its own space axis, the object appears to travel through time as seen externally.",
              "A closed timelike curve can be created if a series of such light cones are set up so as to loop back on themselves, so it would be possible for an object to move around this loop and return to the same place and time that it started.",
              "An object in such an orbit would repeatedly return to the same point in spacetime if it stays in free fall.",
              "Returning to the original spacetime location would be only one possibility;",
              "the object's future light cone would include spacetime points both forwards and backwards in time, and so it should be possible for the object to engage in time travel under these conditions.",
              "CTCs appear in locally unobjectionable exact solutions to the Einstein field equation of general relativity, including some of the most important solutions.",
              "These include: Some of these examples are, like the Tipler cylinder, rather artificial, but the exterior part of the Kerr solution is thought to be in some sense generic, so it is rather unnerving to learn that its interior contains CTCs.",
              "Most physicists feel that CTCs in such solutions are artifacts.",
              "[4] One feature of a CTC is that it opens the possibility of a worldline which is not connected to earlier times, and so the existence of events that cannot be traced to an earlier cause.",
              "Ordinarily, causality demands that each event in spacetime is preceded by its cause in every rest frame.",
              "This principle is critical in determinism, which in the language of general relativity states complete knowledge of the universe on a spacelike Cauchy surface can be used to calculate the complete state of the rest of spacetime.",
              "However, in a CTC, causality breaks down, because an event can be \"simultaneous\" with its cause\u2014in some sense an event may be able to cause itself.",
              "It is impossible to determine based only on knowledge of the past whether or not something exists in the CTC that can interfere with other objects in spacetime.",
              "A CTC therefore results in a Cauchy horizon, and a region of spacetime that cannot be predicted from perfect knowledge of some past time.",
              "No CTC can be continuously deformed as a CTC to a point (that is, a CTC and a point are not timelike homotopic), as the manifold would not be causally well behaved at that point.",
              "The topological feature which prevents the CTC from being deformed to a point is known as a timelike topological feature.",
              "The existence of CTCs would arguably place restrictions on physically allowable states of matter-energy fields in the universe.",
              "Propagating a field configuration along the family of closed timelike worldlines must, according to such arguments, eventually result in the state that is identical to the original one.",

              "as a possible approach towards disproving the existence of CTCs.",
              "While quantum formulations of CTCs have been proposed,[5][6] a strong challenge to them is their ability to freely create entanglement,[7] which quantum theory predicts is impossible.",
              "If Deutsch's prescription holds, the existence of these CTCs implies also equivalence of quantum and classical computation (both in PSPACE).",
              "[8] If Lloyd's prescription holds, quantum computations would be PP-complete.",
              "There are two classes of CTCs.",
              "We have CTCs contractible to a point (if we no longer insist it has to be future-directed timelike everywhere), and we have CTCs which are not contractible.",
              "For the latter, we can always go to the universal covering space, and reestablish causality.",
              "For the former, such a procedure is not possible.",

              "With Hawking's second option, on the other hand, the situation is more subtle.",

              "As described by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the \"many worlds\" interpretation of quantum theory sees all these various outcomes as occurring in different, \"parallel\" timelines.",
              "In this view, the grandfather paradox could be resolved if the time traveler starts out in a timeline where their grandfather lived long enough to have children, and then \u2014 after going back and killing their forebear \u2014 continue along a parallel time track in which they will never be born.",
              "(Stanford Encyclopedia has a more detailed look at why you can\u2019t jump back and forth between parallel timelines at will.)",

              "Deutsch showed that, while parallel timelines are normally incapable of interacting with each other, the situation changes in the vicinity of a closed time-like curve (CTC), when a wormhole curves back on itself.",
              "Here, just as the sci-fi writers imagined, the different timelines are able to cross over \u2014 so that when a CTC loops back into the past, it's the past of a different timeline.",
              "If that's proven, then you really could kill an infant grandparent without paradoxically eliminating yourself in the process.",

              "A key feature of Deutsch's theory is that the various probabilities have to be self-consistent.",
              "For instance, in the Queensland research example, if there's a 50:50 chance the particle travels back in time, then there must also be a 50:50 chance that the switch gets flipped to create that particle in the first place.",
              "In the absence of a time machine, the researchers set up an experiment involving a pair of photons, which they claimed was logically equivalent to a single photon traveling back in time to \"create\" itself.",

              "Recent experiments offer tentative support for time travel's feasibility\u2014at least from a mathematical perspective.",
              "The study cuts to the core of our understanding of the universe, and the resolution of the possibility of time travel, far from being a topic worthy only of science fiction, would have profound implications for fundamental physics as well as for practical applications such as quantum cryptography and computing.",
              "Closed timelike curves The source of time travel speculation lies in the fact that our best physical theories seem to contain no prohibitions on traveling backward through time.",
              "The feat should be possible based on Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes gravity as the warping of spacetime by energy and matter.",
              "An extremely powerful gravitational field, such as that produced by a spinning black hole, could in principle profoundly warp the fabric of existence so that spacetime bends back on itself.",
              "This would create a \"closed timelike curve,\" or CTC, a loop that could be traversed to travel back in time.",
              "Hawking and many other physicists find CTCs abhorrent, because any macroscopic object traveling through one would inevitably create paradoxes where cause and effect break down.",
              "In a model proposed by the theorist David Deutsch in 1991, however, the paradoxes created by CTCs could be avoided at the quantum scale because of the behavior of fundamental particles, which follow only the fuzzy rules of probability rather than strict determinism.",
              "\"It's intriguing that you've got general relativity predicting these paradoxes, but then you consider them in quantum mechanical terms and the paradoxes go away,\" says University of Queensland physicist Tim Ralph.",
              "\"It makes you wonder whether this is important in terms of formulating a theory that unifies general relativity with quantum mechanics.\"",
              "Experimenting with a curve Recently Ralph and his PhD student Martin Ringbauer led a team that experimentally simulated Deutsch's model of CTCs for the very first time, testing and confirming many aspects of the two-decades-old theory.",

              "Much of their simulation revolved around investigating how Deutsch's model deals with the \u201cgrandfather paradox,\u201d a hypothetical scenario in which someone uses a CTC to travel back through time to murder her own grandfather, thus preventing her own later birth.",

              "Deutsch's quantum solution to the grandfather paradox works something like this: Instead of a human being traversing a CTC to kill her ancestor, imagine that a fundamental particle goes back in time to flip a switch on the particle-generating machine that created it.",
              "If the particle flips the switch, the machine emits a particle\u2014the particle\u2014back into the CTC;",
              "if the switch isn't flipped, the machine emits nothing.",
              "In this scenario there is no a priori deterministic certainty to the particle's emission, only a distribution of probabilities.",
              "Deutsch's insight was to postulate self-consistency in the quantum realm, to insist that any particle entering one end of a CTC must emerge at the other end with identical properties.",
              "Therefore, a particle emitted by the machine with a probability of one half would enter the CTC and come out the other end to flip the switch with a probability of one half, imbuing itself at birth with a probability of one half of going back to flip the switch.",
              "If the particle were a person, she would be born with a one-half probability of killing her grandfather, giving her grandfather a one-half probability of escaping death at her hands\u2014good enough in probabilistic terms to close the causative loop and escape the paradox.",
              "Strange though it may be, this solution is in keeping with the known laws of quantum mechanics.",
              "In their new simulation Ralph, Ringbauer and their colleagues studied Deutsch's model using interactions between pairs of polarized photons within a quantum system that they argue is mathematically equivalent to a single photon traversing a CTC.",
              "\"We encode their polarization so that the second one acts as kind of a past incarnation of the first,\u201d Ringbauer says.",
              "So instead of sending a person through a time loop, they created a stunt double of the person and ran him through a time-loop simulator to see if the doppelganger emerging from a CTC exactly resembled the original person as he was in that moment in the past.",
              "By measuring the polarization states of the second photon after its interaction with the first, across multiple trials the team successfully demonstrated Deutsch's self-consistency in action.",
              "\"The state we got at our output, the second photon at the simulated exit of the CTC, was the same as that of our input, the first encoded photon at the CTC entrance,\" Ralph says.",
              "\"Of course, we're not really sending anything back in time but [the simulation] allows us to study weird evolutions normally not allowed in quantum mechanics.\"",
              "Those \"weird evolutions\" enabled by a CTC, Ringbauer notes, would have remarkable practical applications, such as breaking quantum-based cryptography through the cloning of the quantum states of fundamental particles.",
              "\"If you can clone quantum states,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,\u201d which comes in handy in quantum cryptography because the principle forbids simultaneously accurate measurements of certain kinds of paired variables, such as position and momentum.",
              "\"But if you clone that system, you can measure one quantity in the first and the other quantity in the second, allowing you to decrypt an encoded message.\"",
              "\"In the presence of CTCs, quantum mechanics allows one to perform very powerful information-processing tasks, much more than we believe classical or even normal quantum computers could do,\" says Todd Brun, a physicist at the University of Southern California who was not involved with the team's experiment.",
              "\"If the Deutsch model is correct, then this experiment faithfully simulates what could be done with an actual CTC.",
              "But this experiment cannot test the Deutsch model itself;",
              "that could only be done with access to an actual CTC.\"",
              "Alternative reasoning Deutsch's model isn\u2019t the only one around, however.",
              "In 2009 Seth Lloyd, a theorist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed an alternative, less radical model of CTCs that resolves the grandfather paradox using quantum teleportation and a technique called post-selection, rather than Deutsch's quantum self-consistency.",
              "With Canadian collaborators, Lloyd went on to perform successful laboratory simulations of his model in 2011.",
              "\"Deutsch's theory has a weird effect of destroying correlations,\" Lloyd says.",
              "\"That is, a time traveler who emerges from a Deutschian CTC enters a universe that has nothing to do with the one she exited in the future.",
              "By contrast, post-selected CTCs preserve correlations, so that the time traveler returns to the same universe that she remembers in the past.\"",
              "This property of Lloyd's model would make CTCs much less powerful for information processing, although still far superior to what computers could achieve in typical regions of spacetime.",
              "\"The classes of problems our CTCs could help solve are roughly equivalent to finding needles in haystacks,\" Lloyd says.",
              "\"But a computer in a Deutschian CTC could solve why haystacks exist in the first place.",

              "The other main issue is less practical, but more significant: it is the observation that time travel seems to contradict logic, in the form of time travel paradoxes.",
              "There are several types of such paradoxes, but the most problematic are consistency paradoxes.",
              "A popular trope in science fiction, consistency paradoxes happen whenever there is a certain event that leads to changing the past, but the change itself prevents this event from happening in the first place.",

              "They then reappear instantaneously among cowboys, knights or dinosaurs.",
              "What these films show is basically time teleportation.",
              "Scientists don\u2019t think this conception is likely in the real world, but they also don\u2019t relegate time travel to the crackpot realm.",
              "In fact, the laws of physics might allow chronological hopping, but the devil is in the details.",
              "Time traveling to the near future is easy: you\u2019re doing it right now at a rate of one second per second, and physicists say that rate can change.",
              "According to Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity, time\u2019s flow depends on how fast you\u2019re moving.",
              "The quicker you travel, the slower seconds pass.",
              "And according to Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, gravity also affects clocks: the more forceful the gravity nearby, the slower time goes.",

              "If a person were to hang out near the edge of a black hole, where gravity is prodigious, Goldberg says, only a few hours might pass for them while 1,000 years went by for someone on Earth.",
              "If the person who was near the black hole returned to this planet, they would have effectively traveled to the future.",
              "\u201cThat is a real effect,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cThat is completely uncontroversial.",
              "\u201d Going backward in time gets thorny, though (thornier than getting ripped to shreds inside a black hole).",
              "Scientists have come up with a few ways it might be possible, and they have been aware of time travel paradoxes in general relativity for decades.",
              "Fabio Costa, a physicist at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics, notes that an early solution with time travel began with a scenario written in the 1920s.",
              "That idea involved massive long cylinder that spun fast in the manner of straw rolled between your palms and that twisted spacetime along with it.",
              "The understanding that this object could act as a time machine allowing one to travel to the past only happened in the 1970s, a few decades after scientists had discovered a phenomenon called \u201cclosed timelike curves.",
              "\u201d \u201cA closed timelike curve describes the trajectory of a hypothetical observer that, while always traveling forward in time from their own perspective, at some point finds themselves at the same place and time where they started, creating a loop,\u201d Costa says.",
              "\u201cThis is possible in a region of spacetime that, warped by gravity, loops into itself.",
              "\u201d \u201cEinstein read [about closed timelike curves] and was very disturbed by this idea,\u201d he adds.",
              "The phenomenon nevertheless spurred later research.",
              "Science began to take time travel seriously in the 1980s.",
              "In 1990, for instance, Russian physicist Igor Novikov and American physicist Kip Thorne collaborated on a research paper about closed time-like curves.",
              "\u201cThey started to study not only how one could try to build a time machine but also how it would work,\u201d Costa says.",
              "Just as importantly, though, they investigated the problems with time travel.",
              "What if, for instance, you tossed a billiard ball into a time machine, and it traveled to the past and then collided with its past self in a way that meant its present self could never enter the time machine?",
              "\u201cThat looks like a paradox,\u201d Costa says.",
              "Since the 1990s, he says, there\u2019s been on-and-off interest in the topic yet no big breakthrough.",
              "The field isn\u2019t very active today, in part because every proposed model of a time machine has problems. \u201cIt has some attractive features, possibly some potential, but then when one starts to sort of unravel the details, there ends up being some kind of a roadblock,\u201d says Gaurav Khanna of the University of Rhode Island.",
              "For instance, most time travel models require negative mass\u2014and hence negative energy because, as Albert Einstein revealed when he discovered E = mc2, mass and energy are one and the same.",
              "In theory, at least, just as an electric charge can be positive or negative, so can mass\u2014though no one\u2019s ever found an example of negative mass.",
              "Why does time travel depend on such exotic matter?",
              "In many cases, it is needed to hold open a wormhole\u2014a tunnel in spacetime predicted by general relativity that connects one point in the cosmos to another.",
              "Without negative mass, gravity would cause this tunnel to collapse.",
              "\u201cYou can think of it as counteracting the positive mass or energy that wants to traverse the wormhole,\u201d Goldberg says.",
              "Khanna and Goldberg concur that it\u2019s unlikely matter with negative mass even exists, although Khanna notes that some quantum phenomena show promise, for instance, for negative energy on very small scales.",
              "But that would be \u201cnowhere close to the scale that would be needed\u201d for a realistic time machine, he says.",
              "These challenges explain why Khanna initially discouraged Caroline Mallary, then his graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, from doing a time travel project.",
              "Mallary and Khanna went forward anyway and came up with a theoretical time machine that didn\u2019t require negative mass.",
              "In its simplistic form, Mallary\u2019s idea involves two parallel cars, each made of regular matter.",
              "If you leave one parked and zoom the other with extreme acceleration, a closed timelike curve will form between them.",
              "Easy, right?",
              "But while Mallary\u2019s model gets rid of the need for negative matter, it adds another hurdle: it requires infinite density inside the cars for them to affect spacetime in a way that would be useful for time travel.",
              "Infinite density can be found inside a black hole, where gravity is so intense that it squishes matter into a mind-bogglingly small space called a singularity.",
              "In the model, each of the cars needs to contain such a singularity.",
              "\u201cOne of the reasons that there's not a lot of active research on this sort of thing is because of these constraints,\u201d Mallary says.",
              "Other researchers have created models of time travel that involve a wormhole, or a tunnel in spacetime from one point in the cosmos to another.",
              "\u201cIt's sort of a shortcut through the universe,\u201d Goldberg says.",
              "Imagine accelerating one end of the wormhole to near the speed of light and then sending it back to where it came from.",
              "\u201cThose two sides are no longer synced,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cOne is in the past;",
              "one is in the future.",
              "\u201d Walk between them, and you\u2019re time traveling.",
              "You could accomplish something similar by moving one end of the wormhole near a big gravitational field\u2014such as a black hole\u2014while keeping the other end near a smaller gravitational force.",
              "In that way, time would slow down on the big gravity side, essentially allowing a particle or some other chunk of mass to reside in the past relative to the other side of the wormhole.",
              "Making a wormhole requires pesky negative mass and energy, however.",
              "A wormhole created from normal mass would collapse because of gravity.",
              "\u201cMost designs tend to have some similar sorts of issues,\u201d Goldberg says.",
              "They\u2019re theoretically possible, but there\u2019s currently no feasible way to make them, kind of like a good-tasting pizza with no calories.",
              "And maybe the problem is not just that we don\u2019t know how to make time travel machines but also that it\u2019s not possible to do so except on microscopic scales\u2014a belief held by the late physicist Stephen Hawking.",
              "He proposed the chronology protection conjecture: The universe doesn\u2019t allow time travel because it doesn\u2019t allow alterations to the past.",
              "\u201cIt seems there is a chronology protection agency, which prevents the appearance of closed timelike curves and so makes the universe safe for historians,\u201d Hawking wrote in a 1992 paper in Physical Review D.",
              "Part of his reasoning involved the paradoxes time travel would create such as the aforementioned situation with a billiard ball and its more famous counterpart, the grandfather paradox: If you go back in time and kill your grandfather before he has children, you can\u2019t be born, and therefore you can\u2019t time travel, and therefore you couldn\u2019t have killed your grandfather.",
              "And yet there you are.",
              "Those complications are what interests Massachusetts Institute of Technology philosopher Agustin Rayo, however, because the paradoxes don\u2019t just call causality and chronology into question.",
              "They also make free will seem suspect.",
              "If physics says you can go back in time, then why can\u2019t you kill your grandfather?",
              "\u201cWhat stops you?",
              "\u201d he says.",
              "Are you not free?",
              "Rayo suspects that time travel is consistent with free will, though.",
              "\u201cWhat\u2019s past is past,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cSo if, in fact, my grandfather survived long enough to have children, traveling back in time isn\u2019t going to change that.",
              "Why will I fail if I try?",
              "I don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t have enough information about the past.",
              "What I do know is that I\u2019ll fail somehow.",
              "\u201d If you went to kill your grandfather, in other words, you\u2019d perhaps slip on a banana en route or miss the bus.",
              "\u201cIt's not like you would find some special force compelling you not to do it,\u201d Costa says.",
              "\u201cYou would fail to do it for perfectly mundane reasons.",
              "\u201d In 2020 Costa worked with Germain Tobar, then his undergraduate student at the University of Queensland in Australia, on the math that would underlie a similar idea: that time travel is possible without paradoxes and with freedom of choice.",
              "Goldberg agrees with them in a way.",
              "\u201cI definitely fall into the category of [thinking that] if there is time travel, it will be constructed in such a way that it produces one self-consistent view of history,\u201d he says.",

              "Time travel has been a staple of science fiction.",
              "With the advent of general relativity it has been entertained by serious physicists.",
              "But, especially in the philosophy literature, there have been arguments that time travel is inherently paradoxical.",
              "The most famous paradox is the grandfather paradox: you travel back in time and kill your grandfather, thereby preventing your own existence.",
              "To avoid inconsistency some circumstance will have to occur which makes you fail in this attempt to kill your grandfather.",
              "Doesn\u2019t this require some implausible constraint on otherwise unrelated circumstances?",
              "We examine such worries in the context of modern physics.",
              "Modern physics strips away many aspects of the manifest image of time.",
              "Time as it appears in the equations of classical mechanics has no need for a distinguished present moment, for example.",
              "Relativity theory leads to even sharper contrasts.",
              "It replaces absolute simultaneity, according to which it is possible to unambiguously determine the time order of distant events, with relative simultaneity: extending an \u201cinstant of time\u201d throughout space is not unique, but depends on the state of motion of an observer.",
              "More dramatically, in general relativity the mathematical properties of time (or better, of spacetime)\u2014its topology and geometry\u2014depend upon how matter is arranged rather than being fixed once and for all.",
              "So physics can be, and indeed has to be, formulated without treating time as a universal, fixed background structure.",
              "Since general relativity represents gravity through spacetime geometry, the allowed geometries must be as varied as the ways in which matter can be arranged.",
              "Alongside geometrical models used to describe the solar system, black holes, and much else, the scope of variation extends to include some exotic structures unlike anything astrophysicists have observed.",
              "In particular, there are spacetime geometries with curves that loop back on themselves: closed timelike curves (CTCs), which describe the possible trajectory of an observer who returns exactly back to their earlier state\u2014without any funny business, such as going faster than the speed of light.",
              "These geometries satisfy the relevant physical laws, the equations of general relativity, and in that sense time travel is physically possible.",
              "Yet circular time generates paradoxes, familiar from science fiction stories featuring time travel:[1] The first two paradoxes were once routinely taken to show that solutions with CTCs should be rejected\u2014with charges varying from violating logic, to being \u201cphysically unreasonable\u201d, to undermining the notion of free will.",
              "Closer analysis of the paradoxes has largely reversed this consensus.",
              "Physicists have discovered many solutions with CTCs and have explored their properties in pursuing foundational questions, such as whether physics is compatible with the idea of objective temporal passage (starting with Go\u0308del 1949).",
              "Philosophers have also used time travel scenarios to probe questions about, among other things, causation, modality, free will, and identity (see, e.",
              "g., Earman 1972 and Lewis\u2019s seminal 1976 paper).",
              "We begin below with Consistency, turning to the other paradoxes in later sections.",
              "A standard, stone-walling response is to insist that the past cannot be changed, as a matter of logic, even by a time traveler (e.",
              "g., Go\u0308del 1949, Clarke 1977, Horwich 1987).",
              "Adolph cannot both die and survive, as a matter of logic, so any scheme to alter the past must fail.",
              "In many of the best time travel fictions, the actions of a time traveler are constrained in novel and unexpected ways.",
              "Attempts to change the past fail, and they fail, often tragically, in just such a way that they set the stage for the time traveler\u2019s self-defeating journey.",
              "The first question is whether there is an analog of the consistent story when it comes to physics in the presence of CTCs.",
              "As we will see, there is a remarkable general argument establishing the existence of consistent solutions.",
              "Yet a second question persists: why can\u2019t time-traveling Kurt kill his own grandfather?",
              "Doesn\u2019t the necessity of failures to change the past put unusual and unexpected constraints on time travelers, or objects that move along CTCs?",
              "The same argument shows that there are in fact no constraints imposed by the existence of CTCs, in some cases.",
              "After discussing this line of argument, we will turn to the palatability and further implications of such constraints if they are required, and then turn to the implications of quantum mechanics.",
              "Wheeler and Feynman (1949) were the first to claim that the fact that nature is continuous could be used to argue that causal influences from later events to earlier events, as are made possible by time travel, will not lead to paradox without the need for any constraints.",
              "Maudlin (1990) showed how to make their argument precise and more general, and argued that nonetheless it was not completely general.",
              "Imagine the following set-up.",
              "We start off having a camera with a black and white film ready to take a picture of whatever comes out of the time machine.",
              "An object, in fact a developed film, comes out of the time machine.",
              "We photograph it, and develop the film.",
              "The developed film is subsequently put in the time machine, and set to come out of the time machine at the time the picture is taken.",
              "This surely will create a paradox: the developed film will have the opposite distribution of black, white, and shades of gray, from the object that comes out of the time machine.",
              "For developed black and white films (i.",
              "e., negatives) have the opposite shades of gray from the objects they are pictures of.",
              "But since the object that comes out of the time machine is the developed film itself it we surely have a paradox.",
              "However, it does not take much thought to realize that there is no paradox here.",
              "What will happen is that a uniformly gray picture will emerge, which produces a developed film that has exactly the same uniform shade of gray.",
              "No matter what the sensitivity of the film is, as long as the dependence of the brightness of the developed film depends in a continuous manner on the brightness of the object being photographed, there will be a shade of gray that, when photographed, will produce exactly the same shade of gray on the developed film.",
              "This is the essence of Wheeler and Feynman\u2019s idea.",
              "Let us first be a bit more precise and then a bit more general.",
              "For simplicity let us suppose that the film is always a uniform shade of gray (i.",
              "e., at any time the shade of gray does not vary by location on the film).",
              "The possible shades of gray of the film can then be represented by the (real) numbers from 0, representing pure black, to 1, representing pure white.",
              "Let us now distinguish various stages in the chronological order of the life of the film.",
              "In stage \\(S_1\\) the film is young;",
              "it has just been placed in the camera and is ready to be exposed.",
              "It is then exposed to the object that comes out of the time machine.",
              "(That object in fact is a later stage of the film itself).",
              "By the time we come to stage \\(S_2\\) of the life of the film, it has been developed and is about to enter the time machine.",
              "Stage \\(S_3\\) occurs just after it exits the time machine and just before it is photographed.",
              "Stage \\(S_4\\) occurs after it has been photographed and before it starts fading away.",
              "Let us assume that the film starts out in stage \\(S_1\\) in some uniform shade of gray, and that the only significant change in the shade of gray of the film occurs between stages \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\).",
              "During that period it acquires a shade of gray that depends on the shade of gray of the object that was photographed.",
              "In other words, the shade of gray that the film acquires at stage \\(S_2\\) depends on the shade of gray it has at stage \\(S_3\\).",
              "The influence of the shade of gray of the film at stage \\(S_3\\), on the shade of gray of the film at stage \\(S_2\\), can be represented as a mapping, or function, from the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive), to the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive).",
              "Let us suppose that the process of photography is such that if one imagines varying the shade of gray of an object in a smooth, continuous manner then the shade of gray of the developed picture of that object will also vary in a smooth, continuous manner.",
              "This implies that the function in question will be a continuous function.",
              "Now any continuous function from the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) to the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) must map at least one number to itself.",
              "One can quickly convince oneself of this by graphing such functions.",
              "For one will quickly see that any continuous function \\(f\\) from \\([0,1]\\) to \\([0,1]\\) must intersect the line \\(x=y\\) somewhere, and thus there must be at least one point \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x)=x\\).",
              "Such points are called fixed points of the function.",
              "Now let us think about what such a fixed point represents.",
              "It represents a shade of gray such that, when photographed, it will produce a developed film with exactly that same shade of gray.",
              "The existence of such a fixed point implies a solution to the apparent paradox.",
              "Let us now be more general and allow color photography.",
              "One can represent each possible color of an object (of uniform color) by the proportions of blue, green and red that make up that color.",
              "(This is why television screens can produce all possible colors.)",
              "Thus one can represent all possible colors of an object by three points on three orthogonal lines \\(x, y\\) and \\(z\\), that is to say, by a point in a three-dimensional cube.",
              "This cube is also known as the \u201cCartesian product\u201d of the three line segments.",
              "Now, one can also show that any continuous map from such a cube to itself must have at least one fixed point.",
              "So color photography can not be used to create time travel paradoxes either!",
              "Even more generally, consider some system \\(P\\) which, as in the above example, has the following life.",
              "It starts in some state \\(S_1\\), it interacts with an object that comes out of a time machine (which happens to be its older self), it travels back in time, it interacts with some object (which happens to be its younger self), and finally it grows old and dies.",
              "Let us assume that the set of possible states of \\(P\\) can be represented by a Cartesian product of \\(n\\) closed intervals of the reals, i.",
              "e., let us assume that the topology of the state-space of \\(P\\) is isomorphic to a finite Cartesian product of closed intervals of the reals.",
              "Let us further assume that the development of \\(P\\) in time, and the dependence of that development on the state of objects that it interacts with, is continuous.",
              "Then, by a well-known fixed point theorem in topology (see, e.",
              "g., Hocking & Young 1961: 273), no matter what the nature of the interaction is, and no matter what the initial state of the object is, there will be at least one state \\(S_3\\) of the older system (as it emerges from the time travel machine) that will influence the initial state \\(S_1\\) of the younger system (when it encounters the older system) so that, as the younger system becomes older, it develops exactly into state \\(S_3\\).",
              "Thus without imposing any constraints on the initial state \\(S_1\\) of the system \\(P\\), we have shown that there will always be perfectly ordinary, non-paradoxical, solutions, in which everything that happens, happens according to the usual laws of development.",
              "Of course, there is looped causation, hence presumably also looped explanation, but what do you expect if there is looped time?",
              "Unfortunately, for the fan of time travel, a little reflection suggests that there are systems for which the needed fixed point theorem does not hold.",
              "Imagine, for instance, that we have a dial that can only rotate in a plane.",
              "We are going to put the dial in the time machine.",
              "Indeed we have decided that if we see the later stage of the dial come out of the time machine set at angle \\(x\\), then we will set the dial to \\(x+90\\), and throw it into the time machine.",
              "Now it seems we have a paradox, since the mapping that consists of a rotation of all points in a circular state-space by 90 degrees does not have a fixed point.",
              "And why wouldn\u2019t some state-spaces have the topology of a circle?",
              "However, we have so far not used another continuity assumption which is also a reasonable assumption.",
              "So far we have only made the following demand: the state the dial is in at stage \\(S_2\\) must be a continuous function of the state of the dial at stage \\(S_3\\).",
              "But, the state of the dial at stage \\(S_2\\) is arrived at by taking the state of the dial at stage \\(S_1\\), and rotating it over some angle.",
              "It is not merely the case that the effect of the interaction, namely the state of the dial at stage \\(S_2\\), should be a continuous function of the cause, namely the state of the dial at stage \\(S_3\\).",
              "It is additionally the case that path taken to get there, the way the dial is rotated between stages \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) must be a continuous function of the state at stage \\(S_3\\).",
              "And, rather surprisingly, it turns out that this can not be done.",
              "Let us illustrate what the problem is before going to a more general demonstration that there must be a fixed point solution in the dial case.",
              "Forget time travel for the moment.",
              "Suppose that you and I each have a watch with a single dial neither of which is running.",
              "My watch is set at 12.",
              "You are going to announce what your watch is set at.",
              "My task is going to be to adjust my watch to yours no matter what announcement you make.",
              "And my actions should have a continuous (single valued) dependence on the time that you announce.",
              "Surprisingly, this is not possible!",
              "For instance, suppose that if you announce \u201c12\u201d, then I achieve that setting on my watch by doing nothing.",
              "Now imagine slowly and continuously increasing the announced times, starting at 12.",
              "By continuity, I must achieve each of those settings by rotating my dial to the right.",
              "If at some point I switch and achieve the announced goal by a rotation of my dial to the left, I will have introduced a discontinuity in my actions, a discontinuity in the actions that I take as a function of the announced angle.",
              "So I will be forced, by continuity, to achieve every announcement by rotating the dial to the right.",
              "But, this rotation to the right will have to be abruptly discontinued as the announcements grow larger and I eventually approach 12 again, since I achieved 12 by not rotating the dial at all.",
              "So, there will be a discontinuity at 12 at the latest.",
              "In general, continuity of my actions as a function of announced times can not be maintained throughout if I am to be able to replicate all possible settings.",
              "Another way to see the problem is that one can similarly reason that, as one starts with 12, and imagines continuously making the announced times earlier, one will be forced, by continuity, to achieve the announced times by rotating the dial to the left.",
              "But the conclusions drawn from the assumption of continuous increases and the assumption of continuous decreases are inconsistent.",
              "So we have an inconsistency following from the assumption of continuity and the assumption that I always manage to set my watch to your watch.",
              "So, a dial developing according to a continuous dynamics from a given initial state, can not be set up so as to react to a second dial, with which it interacts, in such a way that it is guaranteed to always end up set at the same angle as the second dial.",
              "Similarly, it can not be set up so that it is guaranteed to always end up set at 90 degrees to the setting of the second dial.",
              "All of this has nothing to do with time travel.",
              "However, the impossibility of such set ups is what prevents us from enacting the rotation by 90 degrees that would create paradox in the time travel setting.",
              "Let us now give the positive result that with such dials there will always be fixed point solutions, as long as the dynamics is continuous.",
              "Let us call the state of the dial before it interacts with its older self the initial state of the dial.",
              "And let us call the state of the dial after it emerges from the time machine the final state of the dial.",
              "There is also an intermediate state of the dial, after it interacts with its older self and before it is put into the time machine.",
              "We can represent the initial or intermediate states of the dial, before it goes into the time machine, as an angle \\(x\\) in the horizontal plane and the final state of the dial, after it comes out of the time machine, as an angle \\(y\\) in the vertical plane.",
              "All possible \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle\\) pairs can thus be visualized as a torus with each \\(x\\) value picking out a vertical circular cross-section and each \\(y\\) picking out a point on that cross-section.",
              "See figure 1.",
              "Figure 1 [An extended description of figure 1 is in the supplement.]",
              "Suppose that the dial starts at angle \\(i\\) which picks out vertical circle \\(I\\) on the torus.",
              "The initial angle \\(i\\) that the dial is at before it encounters its older self, and the set of all possible final angles that the dial can have when it emerges from the time machine is represented by the circle \\(I\\) on the torus (see figure 1).",
              "Given any possible angle of the emerging dial, the dial initially at angle \\(i\\) will develop to some other angle.",
              "One can picture this development by rotating each point on \\(I\\) in the horizontal direction by the relevant amount.",
              "Since the rotation has to depend continuously on the angle of the emerging dial, circle \\(I\\) during this development will deform into some loop \\(L\\) on the torus.",
              "Loop \\(L\\) thus represents all possible intermediate angles \\(x\\) that the dial is at when it is thrown into the time machine, given that it started at angle \\(i\\) and then encountered a dial (its older self) which was at angle \\(y\\) when it emerged from the time machine.",
              "We therefore have consistency if \\(x=y\\) for some \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) on loop \\(L\\).",
              "Now, let loop \\(C\\) be the loop which consists of all the points on the torus for which \\(x=y\\).",
              "Ring \\(I\\) intersects \\(C\\) at point \\(\\langle i,i\\rangle\\).",
              "Obviously any continuous deformation of \\(I\\) must still intersect \\(C\\) somewhere.",
              "So \\(L\\) must intersect \\(C\\) somewhere, say at \\(\\langle j,j\\rangle\\).",
              "But that means that no matter how the development of the dial starting at \\(I\\) depends on the angle of the emerging dial, there will be some angle for the emerging dial such that the dial will develop exactly into that angle (by the time it enters the time machine) under the influence of that emerging dial.",
              "This is so no matter what angle one starts with, and no matter how the development depends on the angle of the emerging dial.",
              "Thus even for a circular state-space there are no constraints needed other than continuity.",
              "Unfortunately there are state-spaces that escape even this argument.",
              "Consider for instance a pointer that can be set to all values between 0 and 1, where 0 and 1 are not possible values.",
              "That is, suppose that we have a state-space that is isomorphic to an open set of real numbers.",
              "Now suppose that we have a machine that sets the pointer to half the value that the pointer is set at when it emerges from the time machine.",
              "Figure 2 [An extended description of figure 2 is in the supplement.]",
              "Suppose the pointer starts at value \\(I\\).",
              "As before we can represent the combination of this initial position and all possible final positions by the line \\(I\\).",
              "Under the influence of the pointer coming out of the time machine the pointer value will develop to a value that equals half the value of the final value that it encountered.",
              "We can represent this development as the continuous deformation of line \\(I\\) into line \\(L\\), which is indicated by the arrows in figure 2.",
              "This development is fully continuous.",
              "Points \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle\\) on line \\(I\\) represent the initial position \\(x=I\\) of the (young) pointer, and the position \\(y\\) of the older pointer as it emerges from the time machine.",
              "Points \\(\\langle x,y\\rangle\\) on line \\(L\\) represent the position \\(x\\) that the younger pointer should develop into, given that it encountered the older pointer emerging from the time machine set at position \\(y\\).",
              "Since the pointer is designed to develop to half the value of the pointer that it encounters, the line \\(L\\) corresponds to \\(x=1/2 y\\).",

              "However, whether or not you call the constraints imposed by a given space-time on distributions of matter on certain space-like surfaces \u201cgenuine constraints\u201d, whether or not they can be considered lawlike, and whether or not they need to be explained, the existence of such constraints can still be used to argue that time travel worlds are so bizarre that it is implausible that our world or any world remotely like ours is a time travel world.",
              "Suppose that one is in a time travel world.",
              "Suppose that given the global space-time structure of this world, there are constraints imposed upon, say, the state of motion of a ball on some space-like surface when it is treated as a test particle, i.",
              "e., when it is assumed that the ball does not affect the metric properties of the space-time it is in.",
              "(There is lots of other matter that, via the Einstein equation, corresponds exactly to the curvature that there is everywhere in this time travel worlds.)",
              "Now a real ball of course does have some effect on the metric of the space-time it is in.",
              "But let us consider a ball that is so small that its effect on the metric is negligible.",
              "Presumably it will still be the case that certain states of this ball on that space-like surface are not compatible with the global time travel structure of this universe.",
              "This means that the actual distribution of matter on such a space-like surface can be extended into a space-time with closed time-like lines, but that certain counterfactual distributions of matter on this space-like surface can not be extended into the same space-time.",
              "But note that the changes made in the matter distribution (when going from the actual to the counterfactual distribution) do not in any non-negligible way affect the metric properties of the space-time.",
              "(Recall that the changes only effect test particles.)",
              "Thus the reason why the global time travel properties of the counterfactual space-time have to be significantly different from the actual space-time is not that there are problems with metric singularities or alterations in the metric that force significant global changes when we go to the counterfactual matter distribution.",
              "The reason that the counterfactual space-time has to be different is that in the counterfactual world the ball\u2019s initial state of motion starting on the space-like surface, could not \u201cmeet up\u201d in a consistent way with its earlier self (could not be consistently extended) if we were to let the global structure of the counterfactual space-time be the same as that of the actual space-time.",
              "Now, it is not bizarre or implausible that there is a counterfactual dependence of manifold structure, even of its topology, on matter distributions on spacelike surfaces.",
              "For instance, certain matter distributions may lead to singularities, others may not.",
              "We may indeed in some sense have causal power over the topology of the space-time we live in.",
              "But this power normally comes via the Einstein equations.",
              "But it is bizarre to think that there could be a counterfactual dependence of global space-time structure on the arrangement of certain tiny bits of matter on some space-like surface, where changes in that arrangement by assumption do not affect the metric anywhere in space-time in any significant way.",
              "It is implausible that we live in such a world, or that a world even remotely like ours is like that.",
              "Let us illustrate this argument in a different way by assuming that wormhole time travel imposes constraints upon the states of people prior to such time travel, where the people have so little mass/energy that they have negligible effect, via the Einstein equation, on the local metric properties of space-time.",
              "Do you think it more plausible that we live in a world where wormhole time travel occurs but it only occurs when people\u2019s states are such that these local states happen to combine with time travel in such a way that nobody ever succeeds in killing their younger self, or do you think it more plausible that we are not in a wormhole time travel world?",
              "[5] An alternative approach to time travel (initiated by Deutsch 1991) abstracts away from the idealized toy models described above.",
              "[6] This computational approach considers instead the evolution of bits (simple physical systems with two discrete states) through a network of interactions, which can be represented by a circuit diagram with gates corresponding to the interactions.",
              "Motivated by the possibility of CTCs, Deutsch proposed adding a new kind of channel that connects the output of a given gate back to its input\u2014in essence, a backwards-time step.",
              "More concretely, given a gate that takes \\(n\\) bits as input, we can imagine taking some number \\(i \\lt n\\) of these bits through a channel that loops back and then do double-duty as inputs.",
              "Consistency requires that the state of these \\(i\\) bits is the same for output and input.",
              "(We will consider an illustration of this kind of system in the next section.)",
              "Working through examples of circuit diagrams with a CTC channel leads to similar treatments of Consistency and Underdetermination as the discussion above (see, e.",

              "6).",
              "But the approach offers two new insights (both originally due to Deutsch): the Easy Knowledge paradox, and a particularly clear extension to time travel in quantum mechanics.",
              "A computer equipped with a CTC channel can exploit the need to find consistent evolution to solve remarkably hard problems. (This is quite different than the first idea that comes to mind to enhance computational power: namely to just devote more time to a computation, and then send the result back on the CTC to an earlier state.)",
              "The gate in a circuit incorporating a CTC implements a function from the input bits to the output bits, under the constraint that the output and input match the i bits going through the CTC channel.",
              "This requires, in effect, finding the fixed point of the relevant function.",
              "Given the generality of the model, there are few limits on the functions that could be implemented on the CTC circuit.",
              "Nature has to solve a hard computational problem just to ensure consistent evolution.",
              "This can then be extended to other complex computational problems\u2014leading, more precisely, to solutions of NP-complete problems in polynomial time (see Aaronson 2013: Chapter 20 for an overview and further references).",
              "The limits imposed by computational complexity are an essential part of our epistemic situation, and computers with CTCs would radically change this.",

              "By contrast with the earlier discussions of constraints in classical systems, they claim to show that time travel never imposes any constraints on the pre-time travel state of quantum systems. The essence of this account is as follows.",
              "[7] A quantum system starts in state \\(S_1\\), interacts with its older self, after the interaction is in state \\(S_2\\), time travels while developing into state \\(S_3\\), then interacts with its younger self, and ends in state \\(S_4\\) (see figure 10).",
              "Figure 10 [An extended description of figure 10 is in the supplement.]",
              "Deutsch assumes that the set of possible states of this system are the mixed states, i.",
              "e., are represented by the density matrices over the Hilbert space of that system.",
              "Deutsch then shows that for any initial state \\(S_1\\), any unitary interaction between the older and younger self, and any unitary development during time travel, there is a consistent solution, i.",
              "e., there is at least one pair of states \\(S_2\\) and \\(S_3\\) such that when \\(S_1\\) interacts with \\(S_3\\) it will change to state \\(S_2\\) and \\(S_2\\) will then develop into \\(S_3\\).",
              "The states \\(S_2, S_3\\) and \\(S_4\\) will typically be not be pure states, i.",
              "e., will be non-trivial mixed states, even if \\(S_1\\) is pure.",
              "In order to understand how this leads to interpretational problems let us give an example.",
              "Consider a system that has a two dimensional Hilbert space with as a basis the states \\(\\vc{+}\\) and \\(\\vc{-}\\).",
              "Let us suppose that when state \\(\\vc{+}\\) of the young system encounters state \\(\\vc{+}\\) of the older system, they interact and the young system develops into state \\(\\vc{-}\\) and the old system remains in state \\(\\vc{+}\\).",
              "In obvious notation: Similarly, suppose that: Let us furthermore assume that there is no development of the state of the system during time travel, i.",
              "e., that \\(\\vc{+}_2\\) develops into \\(\\vc{+}_3\\), and that \\(\\vc{-}_2\\) develops into \\(\\vc{-}_3\\).",
              "Now, if the only possible states of the system were \\(\\vc{+}\\) and \\(\\vc{-}\\) (i.",
              "e., if there were no superpositions or mixtures of these states), then there is a constraint on initial states: initial state \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) is impossible.",
              "For if \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) interacts with \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) then it will develop into \\(\\vc{-}_2\\), which, during time travel, will develop into \\(\\vc{-}_3\\), which inconsistent with the assumed state \\(\\vc{+}_3\\).",
              "Similarly if \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) interacts with \\(\\vc{-}_3\\) it will develop into \\(\\vc{+}_2\\), which will then develop into \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) which is also inconsistent.",
              "Thus the system can not start in state \\(\\vc{+}_1\\).",
              "But, says Deutsch, in quantum mechanics such a system can also be in any mixture of the states \\(\\vc{+}\\) and \\(\\vc{-}\\).",
              "Suppose that the older system, prior to the interaction, is in a state \\(S_3\\) which is an equal mixture of 50% \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) and 50% \\(\\vc{-}_3\\).",
              "Then the younger system during the interaction will develop into a mixture of 50% \\(\\vc{+}_2\\) and 50% \\(\\vc{-}_2\\), which will then develop into a mixture of 50% \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) and 50% \\(\\vc{-}_3\\), which is consistent!",
              "More generally Deutsch uses a fixed point theorem to show that no matter what the unitary development during interaction is, and no matter what the unitary development during time travel is, for any state \\(S_1\\) there is always a state \\(S_3\\) (which typically is not a pure state) which causes \\(S_1\\) to develop into a state \\(S_2\\) which develops into that state \\(S_3\\).",
              "Thus quantum mechanics comes to the rescue: it shows in all generality that no constraints on initial states are needed!",
              "One might wonder why Deutsch appeals to mixed states: will superpositions of states \\(\\vc{+}\\) and \\(\\vc{-}\\) not suffice?",
              "Unfortunately such an idea does not work.",
              "Suppose again that the initial state is \\(\\vc{+}_1\\).",
              "One might suggest that that if state \\(S_3\\) is one will obtain a consistent development.",
              "For one might think that when initial state \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) encounters the superposition it will develop into superposition and that this in turn will develop into as desired.",
              "However this is not correct.",
              "For initial state \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) when it encounters will develop into the entangled state In so far as one can speak of the state of the young system after this interaction, it is in the mixture of 50% \\(\\vc{+}_2\\) and 50% \\(\\vc{-}_2\\), not in the superposition So Deutsch does need his recourse to mixed states.",
              "This clarification of why Deutsch needs his mixtures does however indicate a serious worry about the simplifications that are part of Deutsch\u2019s account.",
              "After the interaction the old and young system will (typically) be in an entangled state.",
              "Although for purposes of a measurement on one of the two systems one can say that this system is in a mixed state, one can not represent the full state of the two systems by specifying the mixed state of each separate part, as there are correlations between observables of the two systems that are not represented by these two mixed states, but are represented in the joint entangled state.",
              "But if there really is an entangled state of the old and young systems directly after the interaction, how is one to represent the subsequent development of this entangled state?",
              "Will the state of the younger system remain entangled with the state of the older system as the younger system time travels and the older system moves on into the future?",
              "On what space-like surfaces are we to imagine this total entangled state to be?",
              "At this point it becomes clear that there is no obvious and simple way to extend elementary non-relativistic quantum mechanics to space-times with closed time-like curves: we apparently need to characterize not just the entanglement between two systems, but entanglement relative to specific spacetime descriptions.",
              "How does Deutsch avoid these complications?",
              "Deutsch assumes a mixed state \\(S_3\\) of the older system prior to the interaction with the younger system.",
              "He lets it interact with an arbitrary pure state \\(S_1\\) younger system.",
              "After this interaction there is an entangled state \\(S'\\) of the two systems. Deutsch computes the mixed state \\(S_2\\) of the younger system which is implied by this entangled state \\(S'\\).",
              "His demand for consistency then is just that this mixed state \\(S_2\\) develops into the mixed state \\(S_3\\).",
              "Now it is not at all clear that this is a legitimate way to simplify the problem of time travel in quantum mechanics.",
              "But even if we grant him this simplification there is a problem: how are we to understand these mixtures?",
              "If we take an ignorance interpretation of mixtures we run into trouble.",
              "For suppose that we assume that in each individual case each older system is either in state \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) or in state \\(\\vc{-}_3\\) prior to the interaction.",
              "Then we regain our paradox.",
              "Deutsch instead recommends the following, many worlds, picture of mixtures.",
              "Suppose we start with state \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) in all worlds.",
              "In some of the many worlds the older system will be in the \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) state, let us call them A-worlds, and in some worlds, B-worlds, it will be in the \\(\\vc{-}_3\\) state.",
              "Thus in A-worlds after interaction we will have state \\(\\vc{-}_2\\) , and in B-worlds we will have state \\(\\vc{+}_2\\).",
              "During time travel the \\(\\vc{-}_2\\) state will remain the same, i.",
              "e., turn into state \\(\\vc{-}_3\\), but the systems in question will travel from A-worlds to B-worlds.",
              "Similarly the \\(\\vc{+}\\) \\(_2\\) states will travel from the B-worlds to the A-worlds, thus preserving consistency.",
              "Now whatever one thinks of the merits of many worlds interpretations, and of this understanding of it applied to mixtures, in the end one does not obtain genuine time travel in Deutsch\u2019s account.",
              "The systems in question travel from one time in one world to another time in another world, but no system travels to an earlier time in the same world.",
              "(This is so at least in the normal sense of the word \u201cworld\u201d, the sense that one means when, for instance, one says \u201cthere was, and will be, only one Elvis Presley in this world.",

              "(See Wallace 2012 for a more sympathetic treatment, that explores several further implications of accepting time travel in conjunction with the many worlds interpretation.)",
              "We close by acknowledging that Deutsch\u2019s starting point\u2014the claim that this computational model captures the essential features of quantum systems in a spacetime with CTCs\u2014has been the subject of some debate.",
              "Several physicists have pursued a quite different treatment of evolution of quantum systems through CTC\u2019s, based on considering the \u201cpost-selected\u201d state (see Lloyd et al.",
              "2011).",
              "Their motivations for implementing the consistency condition in terms of the post-selected state reflects a different stance towards quantum foundations.",
              "A different line of argument aims to determine whether Deutsch\u2019s treatment holds as an appropriate limiting case of a more rigorous treatment, such as quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.",
              "For example, Verch (2020) establishes several results challenging the assumption that Deutsch\u2019s treatment is tied to the presence of CTC\u2019s, or that it is compatible with the entanglement structure of quantum fields.",
              "What remains of the grandfather paradox in general relativistic time travel worlds is the fact that in some cases the states on edgeless spacelike surfaces are \u201coverconstrained\u201d, so that one has less than the usual freedom in specifying conditions on such a surface, given the time-travel structure, and in some cases such states are \u201cunderconstrained\u201d, so that states on edgeless space-like surfaces do not determine what happens elsewhere in the way that they usually do, given the time travel structure.",
              "There can also be mixtures of those two types of cases.",
              "The extent to which states are overconstrained and/or underconstrained in realistic models is as yet unclear, though it would be very surprising if neither obtained.",
              "The extant literature has primarily focused on the problem of overconstraint, since that, often, either is regarded as a metaphysical obstacle to the possibility time travel, or as an epistemological obstacle to the plausibility of time travel in our world.",
              "While it is true that our world would be quite different from the way we normally think it is if states were overconstrained, underconstraint seems at least as bizarre as overconstraint.",
              "Nonetheless, neither directly rules out the possibility of time travel.",
              "If time travel entailed contradictions then the issue would be settled.",
              "And indeed, most of the stories employing time travel in popular culture are logically incoherent: one cannot \u201cchange\u201d the past to be different from what it was, since the past (like the present and the future) only occurs once.",
              "But if the only requirement demanded is logical coherence, then it seems all too easy.",
              "A clever author can devise a coherent time-travel scenario in which everything happens just once and in a consistent way.",
              "This is just too cheap: logical coherence is a very weak condition, and many things we take to be metaphysically impossible are logically coherent.",
              "For example, it involves no logical contradiction to suppose that water is not molecular, but if both chemistry and Kripke are right it is a metaphysical impossibility.",
              "We have been interested not in logical possibility but in physical possibility.",
              "But even so, our conditions have been relatively weak: we have asked only whether time-travel is consistent with the universal validity of certain fundamental physical laws and with the notion that the physical state on a surface prior to the time travel region be unconstrained.",
              "It is perfectly possible that the physical laws obey this condition, but still that time travel is not metaphysically possible because of the nature of time itself.",
              "Consider an analogy.",
              "Aristotle believed that water is homoiomerous and infinitely divisible: any bit of water could be subdivided, in principle, into smaller bits of water.",
              "Aristotle\u2019s view contains no logical contradiction.",
              "It was certainly consistent with Aristotle\u2019s conception of water that it be homoiomerous, so this was, for him, a conceptual possibility.",
              "But if chemistry is right, Aristotle was wrong both about what water is like and what is possible for it.",
              "It can\u2019t be infinitely divided, even though no logical or conceptual analysis would reveal that.",
              "Similarly, even if all of our consistency conditions can be met, it does not follow that time travel is physically possible, only that some specific physical considerations cannot rule it out.",
              "The only serious proof of the possibility of time travel would be a demonstration of its actuality.",
              "For if we agree that there is no actual time travel in our universe, the supposition that there might have been involves postulating a substantial difference from actuality, a difference unlike in kind from anything we could know if firsthand.",
              "It is unclear to us exactly what the content of possible would be if one were to either maintain or deny the possibility of time travel in these circumstances, unless one merely meant that the possibility is not ruled out by some delineated set of constraints.",

              "In 1991, David Deutsch[2] came up with a proposal for the time evolution equations, with special note as to how it resolves the grandfather paradox and nondeterminism.",
              "However, his resolution to the grandfather paradox is considered unsatisfactory to some people, because it states the time traveller reenters another parallel universe, and that the actual quantum state is a quantum superposition of states where the time traveller does and does not exist.",
              "He made the simplifying assumption that we can split the quantum system into a subsystem A external to the closed timelike curve, and a CTC part.",
