              "The continental Black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa limosa is a long-distance migratory bird that has undergone a considerable dietary shift over the past few decades.",
              "Historically, godwits fed on an animal-based diet, but currently, during the non-breeding period godwits feed almost exclusively on rice seeds.",
              "The latter diet may allow building up of their fuel stores for migration by significantly increasing de novo lipogenesis (DNL) activity.",
              "Here, we performed an experiment to investigate lipid flux and the abundance of key enzymes involved in DNL in godwits, during fasting and refueling periods at the staging site, while feeding on rice seeds or fly larvae.",
              "Despite no significant differences found in enzymatic abundance (FASN, ME1, ACC and LPL) in stored fat, experimental godwits feeding on rice seeds presented high rates of DNL when compared to fly-larvae fed birds (~35 times more) and fasted godwits (no DNL activity).",
              "The increase of fractional DNL in godwits feeding on a carbohydrate-rich diet can potentially be enhanced by the fasting period that stimulates lipogenesis.",
              "Although requiring further testing, these recent findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of avian fat accumulation during a fasting and refueling cycle and associated responses to habitat and dietary changes in a migratory species.",
              "Migratory animals need to adjust their physiology to accumulate high amounts of fat in preparation for migratory journeys1.",
              "In these species, the ability to store and mobilize fat stores efficiently is essential2.",
              "During the migratory cycle, birds experience different physiological states and fat compounds are mobilized (fasting) or stored (fueling or refueling)3,4.",
              "Migratory movements are mainly fuelled by the oxidation of fatty acids (FA) stored in the form of energy-rich triglycerides (TAG) in adipose tissue, which is delivered to muscles by the circulatory system3,4,5.",
              "Long-distance migration between breeding grounds, stopovers and non-breeding grounds is typically carried out in cycles of refueling at stopover areas and fasting while in flight or at stopover sites3.",
              "During migratory flights, birds require high fat stores acquired at staging areas6, and the ability to manage their energy supply constraints by using stores acquired at stopovers is crucial.",
              "Birds during migratory flight or induced fasting showed several similarities in terms of used energy sources, but showed different energy turnover rates, which is significantly higher in flying birds7.",
              "However, fasting can be used to simulate migratory flight if fasting time is not long enough to produce changes in body mass composition7.",
              "Most migrants currently face severe and rapid challenges regarding access to their traditional food sources, with many species increasingly using anthropogenic habitats with associated changes in their diet8,9,10.",
              "The physiological and metabolic adaptations involved in such dietary shifts regarding lipid accumulation and synthesis, in preparation for migratory flights, remain mostly unclear despite its fundamental role in the life-cycle of avian migrants.",
              "Recent evidence highlighted that not only the amount of fat stored but also FA composition influence bird migratory performance (reviewed11).",
              "FA chain length, degree of unsaturation, and placement of double bonds can all affect the rate of mobilization, transport, and oxidation of lipid reserves during flight, thus influencing overall flight endurance (e.",
              "g.12,13).",
              "Furthermore, higher levels of free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol in plasma results from the catabolism of fat stores in adipose tissue5.",
              "Although birds can alter the FA composition of their fat stores and the phospholipids in membranes through endogenous mechanisms or through diet12, they are unable to synthesize several important polyunsaturated FA (PUFAs) such as omega-3 and omega-6, which must be strictly derived from dietary sources12.",
              "Studies based on migrating waterbirds performing long non-stop flights have proposed that omega-3 PUFAs play a significant role in migratory performance by enhancing the aerobic capacity of flight muscles13.",
              "Migratory birds should therefore strive to include as much non-synthesisable PUFA as possible in their diet (the natural doping hypothesis)13.",
              "Some studies support the natural doping hypothesis as observed in refueling migratory semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) and in captive sedentary bobwhite quail (Collinus virginianus) that feed on a PUFA (e.",
              "g. DHA and EPA) rich diet, where the regulation of metabolic enzyme activity was influenced by the dietary FA14,15,16.",
              "However, Price and Guglielmo12 compared n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA diets in migratory white-throated sparrows Zonotrichia albicollis, and no correlations were found between either aerobic and oxidative enzymes, or DHA and EPA PUFAS in flight muscle phospholipids.",
              "These data indicate that upregulation of aerobic capacity is not diet-controlled, or that n-3 and n-6 PUFA can show a similar or no effect.",
              "Furthermore, yellow-rumped warblers Setophaga coronate supplemented with n-3 PUFA showed no effect of PUFA on their flight performance, contradicting the natural doping hypothesis17,18.",
              "Overall, some studies did not support the natural doping hypothesis, or the PUFA benefits on migratory performance12,17,18.",
              "Long distance flights demand intense muscular activity during a period of fasting, which may enhance the need to quickly re-fuel.",
              "According to Ramenofsky19, after a fasting period, lipogenesis increases rapidly and occurs primarily in the liver20,21, with several enzymes likely being crucial to this process both in the liver and in the adipose tissue.",
              "The acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthetase (FASN) are the main enzyme complexes involved in lipogenesis10.",
              "ACC is considered a key enzyme for lipogenesis as it promotes FA synthesis at high rates22,23,24, while FASN controls FA synthesis in lower lipogenesis rates10.",
              "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity is also important in lipid metabolism and this enzyme is known to be strictly regulated during the migratory cycle, mainly during early stages of refueling19.",
              "LPL\u2019s catalytic activity in the hydrolysis of triglycerides, on both muscle and adipose tissues, provides FFA resulting in fat storage.",
              "Some studies assumed that malic enzyme (ME1) is not involved in FA synthesis24, but Shah et al.",
              "25 found that ME1 activity increased in the liver during the pre-migratory phase.",
              "These enzymes may play a significant role in lipogenesis during migration, and therefore, assessing their expression patterns can help understand the metabolic pathways at play during fuelling and fasting cycles, which might differ according to dietary sources.",
              "Most shorebirds, specifically those that undertake long migrations by continuous powered flight, present a high capacity to store and rapidly use adipose fat on a strict annual schedule26,27,28, with many using stopover or staging sites to refuel between flights along their routes29.",
              "The black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa (henceforth, godwit) is a long-distance migrant that traditionally foraged in natural wetlands, where it fed mainly on animal prey30,31.",
              "However, in recent decades it has dramatically changed its feeding habits throughout its non-breeding period, particularly the Western European population (Limosa limosa limosa), relying on rice fields located in Iberia and West Africa32,33, where they feed on unharvested rice seeds.",
              "This population, therefore, is increasingly dependent on artificial wetlands throughout its non-breeding range, most of which are rice fields located in Iberia and West Africa33,34.",
              "Using deuterated water (2H2O) as a tracer for de novo lipogenesis (DNL), a recent study demonstrated the synthesis of FA from non-lipid precursors (such as carbohydrates), showing that godwits are able to increase their DNL rate when they feed on a poor lipidic dietary during the winter period34.",
              "In the present study, we mimicked a re-fuelling event using two different diets sources: fly larvae (traditional animal-based diet \u2013 20% fat, including omega-3) and rice seeds (current plant-based diet \u2212 2% fat and omega-3 free) in order to examine how dietary conditions may influence DNL rates.",
              "Using this approach, we aimed to understand whether the DNL in a migratory shorebird varies according to diet conditions.",
              "Furthermore, we measured the mRNA abundance in order to understand whether the godwits used different metabolic pathways during the re-fuelling phase, given the two different diets sources.",

              "Our data suggest that the extent of seasonal fat deposits corresponds with migratory tendency in these facultative taxa.",

              "In contrast, pine siskins, thought to be more variable in timing and initiation of nomadic movements, had smaller peaks in fat deposits during the migratory season, and the partial migrant American goldfinch and the resident house finch showed no peaks coincident with migratory periods.",
              "Within the red crossbills, those ecotypes that are closely associated with pine habitats showed larger peaks in fat deposits coincident with autumn migratory periods and had higher wing loading, whereas those ecotypes associated with spruces, Douglas-fir and hemlocks showed larger peaks coincident with spring migratory periods and lower wing loading.",
              "We conclude that population averages of fat deposits do reflect facultative migration strategies in these species, as well as the winter thermogenic challenges at the study locations.",
              "A difference in seasonal fattening and wing loading among red crossbill ecotypes is consistent with the possibility that they differ in their migratory biology, and we discuss these differences in light of crossbill reproductive schedules and phenologies of different conifer species.",

              "In the current edition of the journal Nature, this group demonstrates that the protein cryptochrome 4, found in birds\u2019 retinas, is sensitive to magnetic fields and could well be the long\u2010sought magnetic sensor.",

              "Oxford\u2019s Peter Hore and Oldenburg physicist Ilia Solov'yov performed quantum mechanical calculations supporting the idea that four of the 527 \u2013 known as tryptophans \u2013 are essential for the magnetic properties of the molecule.",

              "Ornithologists figured this out decades ago by putting birds in windowless, funnel-shaped cages with ink on the bottom.",
              "When the birds tried to escape, they left behind a trail of ink in the direction of their flight.",
              "Sure enough, migratory birds try to head north in the spring and south in the fall, in line with bird migration in the wild.",
              "They\u2019re picking up on Earth\u2019s magnetic field, Pinzon-Rodriguez said.",
              "Some theories of how birds sense this invisible magnetism are truly mind-bending.",
              "One theory based on quantum mechanics proposes that subtle changes in Earth\u2019s magnetic field can cause a chemical reaction \u2014 perhaps involving quantum entanglement \u2014 within light-sensing proteins called cryptochromes in the eyes of birds.",
              "Those reactions translate into some kind of visual cue, Kishkinev said, almost like a special pair of glasses that reveals contours of the magnetic field.",
              "An older theory is that birds have magnetic material in their beaks that functions as a compass, Kishkinev said \u2014 but despite their best efforts, scientists have yet to actually find that mechanism.",
              "A third idea, dating back to the 19th century, is that birds perceive the magnetic field through structures in their inner ear, which is what animals use to distinguish up from down and to sense acceleration.",
              "Again, these are all just theories, Kishkinev said.",
              "But no matter the mechanism, scientists are sure that birds are using Earth\u2019s magnetic field to travel.",
              "The mystery deepens when scientists consider that the planet\u2019s magnetic field isn\u2019t fixed \u2014 it moves.",
              "In fact, since 1831, the magnetic north pole has shifted more than 600 miles.",
              "(The magnetic poles have even reversed many times.)",
              "The slight movement of the magnetic poles made the new study possible, said Joe Wynn, the lead author and a researcher at Germany\u2019s Institut fu\u0308r Vogelforschung.",
              "If birds use the planet\u2019s magnetic field to return to their breeding sites, then it stands to reason a shifting field might mean that breeding sites shift, too.",
              "To find out, Wynn analyzed nearly 80 years of data on the Eurasian reed warbler that show where individual birds breed each spring.",
              "He then compared that information to changes in the magnetic field \u2014 specifically, how certain characteristics of the field are shifting, including its strength and inclination.",
              "Inclination, or dip angle, is the angle between the magnetic field and the surface of the Earth.",
              "Sure enough, he discovered that while birds usually arrive at the same site year after year, sometimes they\u2019re slightly off.",
              "And when they are, it\u2019s typically in the same direction that the inclination angle has moved.",
              "That suggests that the Eurasian warblers may be tracking inclination to navigate, Wynn said.",
              "(The researchers didn\u2019t find a strong correlation with changes in other characteristics of the magnetic field.)",
              "The angle of inclination can be thought of as a \u201cstop sign\u201d on a bird\u2019s journey north to breed, according to the researchers.",
              "They likely start their flight on a fixed course, Wynn said, and then once they sense an angle of inclination that matches what they\u2019ve sensed before, something inside their brain tells them to land, find a mate, and raise a family.",
              "Because the magnetic field moves, it\u2019s not the most precise map, Wynn said, but it\u2019s detectable around the world and guides migratory birds most of the way, perhaps within feet.",
              "Once they\u2019re in the vicinity, they likely use other senses \u2014 the sight of a familiar pond or favorite tree, for example \u2014 to find the right spot.",
              "Wynn\u2019s research into inclination angles doesn\u2019t tell the full story of how birds use the magnetic field to navigate.",
              "While the new study uses a massive trove of real-world data, the findings are based on a computer model and still need to be verified in a controlled experiment, Pinzon-Rodriguez said.",
              "Previous research by Kishkinev and others also suggests that birds can essentially pinpoint their location within a magnetic map of the world \u2014 which scientists call \u201ctrue navigation\u201d \u2014 even if they\u2019re displaced thousands of miles.",
              "Whereas inclination only signals when birds should stop, Wynn said, this research implies birds also know where they are in space.",
              "But humans may be making it harder for them to find their way, Pinzon-Rodriguez said.",
              "While Earth\u2019s magnetic field encompasses the entire planet, scientists suspect that humans are scrambling it locally through our electrical equipment, radio towers, and other technologies.",
              "European robins were unable to orient themselves in the presence of certain radio waves, for example, in a series of experiments published in 2014 in the journal Nature.",
              "\u201cThe effects of these weak electromagnetic fields are remarkable: They disrupt the functioning of an entire sensory system in a healthy higher vertebrate,\u201d Henrik Mouritsen, a biologist at the University of Oldenburg who led the study, said in a press release.",
              "It\u2019s not clear whether the interference is actually harming migratory birds like the Eurasian reed warbler in the wild, given that they use other tools to navigate too.",
              "But it shows just how profoundly humans impact the Earth, sometimes in invisible ways.",
              "Will you support Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism?",
              "Most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions.",
              "But when it comes to what we\u2019re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple reasons that we can't rely only on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.",
              "First, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy.",
              "We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.",
              "Second, we\u2019re not in the subscriptions business.",

              "How Migrating Birds Use Quantum Effects to Navigate",
              "April 1, 2022 14 min read New research hints at the biophysical underpinnings of their ability to use Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines to find their way to their breeding and wintering grounds By Henrik Mouritsen & Peter J.",
              "Hore Kyle Bean Imagine you are a young Bar-tailed Godwit, a large, leggy shorebird with a long, probing bill hatched on the tundra of Alaska.",
              "As the days become shorter and the icy winter looms, you feel the urge to embark on one of the most impressive migrations on Earth: a nonstop transequatorial flight lasting at least seven days and nights across the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand 12,000 kilometers away.",
              "It\u2019s do or die.",
              "Every year tens of thousands of Bar-tailed Godwits complete this journey successfully.",
              "Billions of other young birds, including warblers and flycatchers, terns and sandpipers, set out on similarly spectacular and dangerous migrations every spring, skillfully navigating the night skies without any help from more experienced birds.",
              "People have long puzzled over the seasonal appearances and disappearances of birds.",
              "Aristotle thought that some birds such as swallows hibernated in the colder months and that others transformed into different species\u2014redstarts turned into robins for the winter, he proposed.",
              "Only in the past century or so, with the advent of bird banding, satellite tracking and more widespread field studies, have researchers been able to connect bird populations that winter in one area and nest in another and show that some travel vast distances between the two locales every year.",
              "Remarkably, even juvenile long-haul travelers know where to go, and birds often take the same routes year after year.",
              "How do they find their way?",
              "Migrating birds use celestial cues to navigate, much as sailors of yore used the sun and stars to guide them.",
              "But unlike humans, birds also detect the magnetic field generated by Earth\u2019s molten core and use it to determine their position and direction.",
              "Despite more than 50 years of research into magnetoreception in birds, scientists have been unable to work out exactly how they use this information to stay on course.",
              "Recently we and others have made inroads into this enduring mystery.",
              "Our experimental evidence suggests something extraordinary: a bird\u2019s compass relies on subtle, fundamentally quantum effects in short-lived molecular fragments, known as radical pairs, formed photochemically in its eyes.",
              "That is, the creatures appear to be able to \u201csee\u201d Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines and use that information to chart a course between their breeding and wintering grounds.",
              "Migratory birds have an internal clock with an annual rhythm that tells them, among other things, when to migrate.",
              "They also inherit from their parents the directions in which they need to fly in the autumn and spring, and if the parents each have different genetically encoded directions, their offspring will end up with an intermediate direction.",
              "For example, if a southwest-migrating bird is crossed with a southeast-migrating bird, their offspring will head south when the time comes.",
              "But how do the young birds know which direction is southwest or south or southeast?",
              "They have at least three different compasses at their disposal: one allows them to extract information from the position of the sun in the sky, another uses the patterns of the stars at night, and the third is based on Earth\u2019s ever present magnetic field.",
              "In their first autumn, young birds follow inherited instructions such as \u201cfly southwest for three weeks and then south-southeast for two weeks.",
              "\u201d If they make a mistake or are blown off course, they are generally unable to recover because they do not yet have a functioning map that would tell them where they are.",
              "This is one of the reasons why only 30 percent of small songbirds survive their first migrations to their wintering grounds and back again.",
              "During its first migration a bird builds up a map in its brain that, on subsequent journeys, will enable it to navigate with an ultimate precision of centimeters over thousands of kilometers.",
              "Some birds breed in the same nest box and sleep on the same perch in their wintering range year after year.",
              "Equipped with this map, about 50 percent of adult songbirds make it back to their nesting site to breed every year.",
              "Migratory birds\u2019 navigational input comes from several senses\u2014mainly sight, smell and magnetoreception.",
              "By observing the apparent nighttime rotation of the stars around the North Star, the birds learn to locate north before they embark on their first migration, and an internal 24-hour clock allows them to calibrate their sun compass.",
              "Characteristic smells can help birds recognize places they have visited before.",
              "Scientists know a great deal about the detailed biophysical mechanisms of the birds\u2019 senses of sight and smell.",
              "But the inner workings of their magnetic compass have proved harder to understand.",
              "The magnetic direction sense in small songbirds that migrate at night is remarkable in several important respects.",
              "First, observations of caged birds exposed to carefully controlled magnetic fields show that their compass does not behave like the magnetized needle in a ship\u2019s compass.",
              "A bird detects the axis of the magnetic field and the angle it makes with Earth\u2019s surface, the so-called inclination compass.",
              "In laboratory experiments, inverting the magnetic field\u2019s direction so that it points in exactly the opposite direction has no effect on the bird\u2019s ability to orient correctly.",
              "Second, a bird\u2019s perception of Earth\u2019s magnetic field can be disrupted by extraordinarily weak magnetic fields that reverse their direction several million times per second.",
              "Last, even though songbirds fly at night under the dim light of the stars, their magnetic compass is light-dependent, hinting at a link between vision and magnetic sensing.",
              "In 1978, in an attempt to make sense of these features of avian magnetoreception, the late Klaus Schulten, then at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Go\u0308ttingen, Germany, put forth a remarkable idea: that the compass relies on magnetically sensitive chemical transformations.",
              "At first glance, this proposal seems preposterous because the energy available from Earth\u2019s magnetic field is millions of times too small to break, or even significantly weaken, the bonds between atoms in molecules.",
              "But Schulten was inspired by the discovery 10 years previously that short-lived chemical intermediates known as radical pairs have unique properties that make their chemistry sensitive to feeble magnetic interactions.",
              "Over the past 40 years researchers have conducted hundreds of lab studies of radical-pair reactions that are affected by the application of magnetic fields.",
              "To appreciate why radical pairs are so special, we need to talk about a quantum-mechanical property of the electron known as spin angular momentum, or \u201cspin\u201d for short.",
              "Spin is a vector with a direction as well as a magnitude, and it is often represented by an arrow, \u2191 or \u2193, for example.",
              "Particles with spin have magnetic moments, which is to say they behave like microscopic magnets.",
              "Most molecules have an even number of electrons arranged in pairs with opposed spins (\u21c5), which therefore cancel each other out.",
              "Radicals are molecules that have lost or gained an electron, meaning that they contain an odd, unpaired, electron and hence have a spin and a magnetic moment.",
              "When two radicals are created simultaneously by a chemical reaction (this is what we mean by radical pair), the two unpaired electrons, one in each radical, can have either antiparallel spins (\u21c5) or parallel spins (\u2191\u2191), arrangements known as singlet and triplet states, respectively.",
              "Immediately after a radical pair is created in a singlet state, internal magnetic fields cause the two electronic spins to undergo a complex quantum \u201cwaltz\u201d in which singlet turns into triplet and triplet turns back into singlet millions of times per second for periods of up to a few microseconds.",
              "Crucially, under the right conditions, this dance can be influenced by external magnetic fields.",
              "Schulten suggested that this subtle quantum effect could form the basis of a magnetic compass sense that might respond to environmental stimuli a million times weaker than would normally be thought possible.",
              "Research that we and others have carried out in recent years has generated fresh support for this hypothesis.",
              "To be useful, hypotheses need to explain known facts and make testable predictions.",
              "Two aspects of Schulten\u2019s proposed compass mechanism are consistent with what is known about the birds\u2019 compass: radical pairs are indifferent to exact external magnetic field reversals, and radical pairs are often formed when molecules absorb light.",
              "Given that the birds\u2019 magnetic compass is light-dependent, a prediction of Schulten\u2019s hypothesis is that their eyes play a part in the magnetic sensory system.",
              "About 10 years ago the research group of one of us (Mouritsen) at the University of Oldenburg in Germany found that a brain region called Cluster N, which receives and processes visual information, is by far the most active part of the brain when certain night-migrating birds are using their magnetic compass.",
              "If Cluster N is dysfunctional, research in migratory European Robins showed, the birds can still use their sun and star compasses, but they are incapable of orienting using Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "From experiments such as these, it is clear that the magnetic compass sensors are located in the birds\u2019 retinas.",
              "One early objection to the radical-pair hypothesis was that no one had ever shown that magnetic fields as tiny as Earth\u2019s, which are 10 to 100 times weaker than a fridge magnet, could affect a chemical reaction.",
              "To address this point, Christiane Timmel of the University of Oxford and her colleagues chose a molecule chemically unlike anything one would find inside a bird: one that contained an electron donor molecule linked to an electron acceptor molecule via a molecular bridge.",
              "Exposing the molecules to green light caused an electron to jump from the donor to the acceptor over a distance of about four nanometers.",
              "The radical pair that formed from this reaction was extremely sensitive to weak magnetic interactions, proving that it is indeed possible for a radical-pair reaction to be influenced by the presence of\u2014and, more important, the direction of\u2014an Earth-strength magnetic field.",
              "Schulten\u2019s hypothesis also predicts that there must be sensory molecules (magnetoreceptors) in the retina in which magnetically sensitive radical pairs can be created using the wavelengths birds need for their compass to operate, which another line of research had identified as light centered in the blue region of the spectrum.",
              "In 2000 he suggested that the necessary photochemistry could take place in a then recently discovered protein called cryptochrome.",
              "Cryptochromes are found in plants, insects, fish, birds and humans.",
              "They have a variety of functions, including light-dependent control of plant growth and regulation of circadian clocks.",
              "What makes them attractive as potential compass sensors is that they are the only known naturally occurring photoreceptors in any vertebrate that form radical pairs when they absorb blue light.",
              "Six types of cryptochromes have been found in the eyes of migratory birds, and no other type of candidate magnetoreceptor molecule has emerged in the past 20 years.",
              "Like all other proteins, cryptochromes are composed of chains of amino acids folded up into complex three-dimensional structures.",
              "Buried deep in the center of many cryptochromes is a yellow molecule called flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) that, unlike the rest of the protein, absorbs blue light.",
              "Embedded among the 500 or so amino acids that make up a typical cryptochrome is a roughly linear chain of three or four tryptophan amino acids stretching from the FAD out to the surface of the protein.",
              "Immediately after the FAD absorbs a blue photon, an electron from the nearest tryptophan hops onto the flavin portion of the FAD.",
              "The first tryptophan then attracts an electron from the second tryptophan and so on.",
              "In this way, the tryptophan chain behaves like a molecular wire.",
              "The net result is a radical pair made of a negatively charged FAD radical in the center of the protein and, two nanometers away, a positively charged tryptophan radical at the surface of the protein.",
              "In 2012 one of us (Hore), working with colleagues at Oxford, carried out experiments to test the suitability of cryptochrome as a magnetic sensor.",
              "The study used cryptochrome-1, a protein found in Arabidopsis thaliana, the plant in which cryptochromes had been discovered 20 years earlier.",
              "Using short laser pulses to produce radical pairs inside the purified proteins, we found that we could fine-tune their subsequent reactions by applying magnetic fields.",
              "This was all very encouraging, but, of course, plants don\u2019t migrate.",
              "We had to wait almost a decade before we could make similar measurements on a cryptochrome from a migratory bird.",
              "The first challenge was to decide which of the six bird cryptochromes to look at.",
              "We chose cryptochrome-4a (Cry4a), partly because it binds FAD much more strongly than do some of its siblings, and if there is no FAD in the protein, there will be no radical pairs and no magnetic sensitivity.",
              "Experiments in Oldenburg also showed that the levels of Cry4a in migratory birds are higher during the spring and autumn migratory seasons than they are during winter and summer when the birds do not migrate.",
              "Computer simulations performed by Ilia Solov\u2019yov in Oldenburg showed that European Robin Cry4a has a chain of four tryptophans\u2014one more than the Cry1 from Arabidopsis.",
              "Naturally, we wondered whether the extended chain had evolved to optimize magnetic sensing in migratory birds.",
              "Our next challenge was to get large amounts of highly pure robin Cry4a.",
              "Jingjing Xu, a Ph.",
              "D.",
              "student in Mouritsen\u2019s lab, solved it.",
              "After optimizing the experimental conditions, she was able to use bacterial cell cultures to produce samples of the protein with the FAD correctly bound.",
              "She also prepared versions of the protein in which each of the four tryptophans was replaced, one at a time, by a different amino acid so as to block electron hopping at each of the four positions along the chain.",
              "Working with these alternative versions of the protein would allow us to test whether the electrons are really jumping all the way along the tryptophan chain.",
              "We shipped these samples\u2014the first purified cryptochromes from any migratory animal\u2014to Oxford, where Timmel and her husband, Stuart Mackenzie, studied them using the sensitive laser-based techniques they had developed specifically for that purpose.",
              "Their research groups found that both the third and fourth tryptophan radicals at the end of the chain are magnetically sensitive when paired with the FAD radical.",
              "We suspect that the tryptophans work cooperatively for efficient magnetic sensing, biochemical signaling and direction finding.",
              "We also speculate that the presence of the fourth tryptophan might enhance the initial steps of signal transduction, the process by which nerve impulses encoding the magnetic field direction are generated and ultimately sent along the optic nerve to the brain.",
              "We are currently conducting experiments to identify the proteins that interact with Cry4a.",
              "One more cryptochrome finding deserves mention here.",
              "We compared robin Cry4a with the extremely similar Cry4a proteins from two nonmigratory birds, pigeons and chickens.",
              "The robin protein had the largest magnetic sensitivity, hinting that evolution might have optimized robin Cry4a for navigation.",
              "Although these experiments confirm that Cry4a has some of the properties required of a magnetoreceptor, we are still a long way from proving how migratory birds perceive Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines.",
              "One crucial next step is to determine whether radical pairs actually form in the eyes of migratory birds.",
              "The most promising way to test for radical pairs inside the birds\u2019 eyes was inspired by the work of chemists and physicists who, in the 1980s, showed that fluctuating magnetic fields alter the way radical-pair reactions respond to static magnetic fields.",
              "Their work predicted that a weak radio-frequency electromagnetic field, fluctuating with the same frequencies as the \u201csinglet-triplet waltz,\u201d might interfere with the birds\u2019 ability to use their magnetic compass.",
              "Thorsten Ritz of the University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues were the first to confirm this prediction in 2004.",
              "In 2007 Mouritsen began similar behavioral experiments in his lab in Oldenburg\u2014with intriguingly different results.",
              "During the spring and fall, birds that travel between nesting and wintering grounds exhibit a behavior called Zugunruhe, or migratory restlessness, as if they are anxious to get on their way.",
              "When caged, these birds usually use their magnetic compass to instinctively orient themselves in the direction in which they would fly in the wild.",
              "Mouritsen found that European Robins tested in wooden huts on his university\u2019s campus were unable to orient using their magnetic compass.",
              "He suspected that weak radio-frequency noise (sometimes called electrosmog) generated by electrical equipment in the nearby labs was interfering with the birds\u2019 magnetic compass.",
              "To confirm that electrosmog was the source of the problem, Mouritsen and his team lined the huts with aluminum sheets to block the stray radio frequencies.",
              "On nights when the shields were grounded and functioned properly, the birds oriented well in Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "On nights when the grounding was disconnected, the birds jumped in random directions.",
              "When tested in an unshielded wooden shelter typically used for horses some kilometers outside the city and well away from electrical equipment, the same birds had no trouble detecting the direction of the magnetic field.",
              "These results are significant on several fronts.",
              "If the radio-frequency fields affect the magnetic sensor and not, say, some component of the signaling pathway that carries nerve impulses to the brain, then they provide compelling evidence that a radical-pair mechanism underpins the bird\u2019s magnetic compass.",
              "The main competing hypothesis, for which there is currently much less support, proposes that magnetic iron\u2013containing minerals are the sensors.",
              "Any such particles that were large enough to align like a compass needle in Earth\u2019s magnetic field would be far too big to rotate in a much weaker field that reversed its direction millions of times per second.",
              "Furthermore, the radio-frequency fields that upset the birds\u2019 magnetic orientation are astonishingly weak, and we don\u2019t yet understand exactly how they could corrupt the directional information available from the much stronger magnetic field of Earth.",
              "It is also remarkable that the birds in the Oldenburg lab were disoriented much more effectively by broadband radio-frequency noise (randomly fluctuating magnetic fields with a range of frequencies) than by the single-frequency fields mostly used by Ritz and his collaborators.",
              "We hope that by subjecting migratory songbirds to bands of radio-frequency noise with different frequencies we will be able to determine whether the sensors really are FAD-tryptophan radical pairs or whether, as some other investigators have suggested, another radical pair might be involved.",
              "Many questions about the birds\u2019 magnetic compass remain, including whether the magnetic field effects on robin Cry4a observed in vitro also exist in vivo.",
              "We also want to see whether migratory birds with genetically suppressed Cry4a production are prevented from orienting using their magnetic compass.",
              "If we can prove that a radical-pair mechanism is behind the magnetic sense in vivo, then we will have shown that a biological sensory system can respond to stimuli several million times weaker than previously thought possible.",
              "This insight would enhance our understanding of biological sensing and provide new ideas for artificial sensors.",
              "Working to gain a full understanding of the inner navigation systems of migratory birds is not merely an intellectual pursuit.",
              "One consequence of the enormous distances migratory birds travel is that they face more acute threats to their survival than most species that breed and overwinter in the same place.",
              "It is more difficult to protect them from the harmful effects of human activity, habitat destruction and climate change.",
              "Relocating migratory individuals away from damaged habitats is rarely successful because the birds tend to instinctively return to those unlivable locales.",
              "We hope that by providing new and more mechanistic insights into the ways in which these extraordinary navigators find their way, conservationists will have a better chance of \u201ctricking\u201d migrants into believing that a safer location really is their new home.",
              "When you next see a small songbird, pause for a moment to consider that it might recently have flown thousands of kilometers, navigating with great skill using a brain weighing no more than a gram.",
              "The fact that quantum spin dynamics may have played a crucial part in its journey only compounds the awe and wonder with which we should regard these extraordinary creatures.",

              "Read the paper: Magnetic sensitivity of cryptochrome 4 from a migratory songbird Read the paper: Magnetic sensitivity of cryptochrome 4 from a migratory songbird There are currently two main hypotheses for how animals sense Earth\u2019s magnetic field1,4 (as well as some alternative hypotheses put forward in the past few years5,6).",
              "One proposes that, as an animal changes direction, crystals of the oxidized-iron compound magnetite (Fe3O4), located in its body and aligned with the field, exert a rotational force \u2014 called torque \u2014 on mechanoreceptors with which they are in physical contact.",
              "This might thereby signal changes in body alignment through the opening and closing of mechanoreceptor ion channels.",

              "1) proposes that, when cryptochrome proteins absorb photons of light and become \u2018photoexcited\u2019, they form magnetically sensitive chemical intermediates known as radical pairs.",
              "Variations in the yield of their reaction product (the form of the cryptochrome that contains a radical molecule called FADH\u2022) are thought to signal the animal\u2019s direction with respect to Earth\u2019s magnetic field7,8.",

              "Photoreceptor cells in the retina of the migratory European robin Erithacus rubecula contain a protein called ErCRY4, which binds to the molecule FAD.",

              "When ErCRY4\u2013FAD absorbs a photon of blue light, reactive molecules called radical pairs arise.",
              "These form through interactions between FAD and a tryptophan (Trp) amino-acid residue of ErCRY4, which supplies an electron.",
              "The radical pair is sensitive to Earth\u2019s magnetic field and oscillates rapidly between a singlet and a triplet state (which have different electron \u2018spin\u2019 states as indicated by the white arrows).",
              "The radical pair can generate ErCRY4\u2013FADH\u2022 (which is a long-lived reaction product hypothesized to trigger a sensory signalling cascade).",
              "Alternatively, ErCRY4 might return to its original form (ErCRY4\u2013FAD).",
              "Which outcome occurs is influenced by the state of the radical pair.",
              "If the bird changes direction, the change in the relative orientation of the magnetic field drives a shift in the proportions of the singlet and triplet states, potentially altering the yield of ErCRY4\u2013FADH\u2022.",
              "Xu et al.",
              "3 present data indicating that ErCRY4 fulfils the physical requirements needed for this magnetosensing mechanism.",
              "Cryptochromes are found both in animals and in plants, and are a type of protein known as a flavoprotein.",
              "Cryptochromes bind non-covalently to a molecule called a chromophore, such as FAD, which absorbs photons of blue light when in its fully oxidized state.",
              "In animals, cryptochrome proteins termed CRY1 and CRY2 are involved in the regulation of daily (circadian) rhythms9, and their expression levels in tissue typically cycle over the course of 24 hours.",
              "By contrast, the cryptochrome CRY4 lacks such signs of circadian cycling, suggesting that it has a different biological role, possibly that of magnetoreception10,11.",
              "CRY4 is found only in birds, fishes and amphibians, which are types of animal with well-documented magnetically guided behaviours.",
              "CRY4 has therefore emerged as the leading candidate for enabling cryptochrome-based magnetoreception in vertebrates.",
              "Previous analysis10 of chickens (Gallus gallus) and migratory European robins (Erithacus rubecula) indicates that CRY4 is located in the outer segments of two types of photoreceptor cell in the retina \u2014 double cones and long-wavelength single cones.",
              "This is an ideal location for receiving the light that would excite cryptochromes and thus aid magnetic sensing.",
              "Further evidence consistent with a possible role for CRY4 in magnetoreception is that its expression level in the robin retina rises as the migratory season approaches, whereas its level remains permanently low in non-migratory chickens10.",
              "A bird\u2019s migration decoded A bird\u2019s migration decoded Xu and colleagues\u2019 major advance is the demonstration that the version of CRY4 (dubbed ErCRY4) in the migratory European robin has a crucial property needed to sense Earth\u2019s magnetic field: the ability to form radical pairs that have high magnetic sensitivity.",
              "Radical pairs arise when the FAD bound to ErCRY4 is reduced (gains an electron) in the presence of light.",
              "Radicals contain an odd number of electrons, and a radical pair consists of two radicals that have been created simultaneously, usually by a chemical reaction.",
              "In ErCRY4, the radicals\u2019 odd electrons are supplied through sequential electron-hopping along a chain of three or four tryptophan amino-acid residues (termed TrpA to TrpD) that are located between FAD and the surface of the cryptochrome.",
              "In the case of FAD, the odd electron that arises from reduction in the presence of light makes the radicals intrinsically magnetic.",
              "This is because electrons behave as microscopic magnets, with a property that physicists call spin (typically symbolized by an arrow \u2191).",
              "In a molecule with an even number of electrons, the spins of each electron pair exactly cancel each other out, rendering the molecule non-magnetic.",
              "If the spins of the odd electrons in each of the two radicals in a radical pair are antiparallel (\u2193\u2191), the radical pair is said to occupy a singlet state, but when they are parallel (\u2191\u2191), the pair occupies a triplet state.",
              "When cryptochrome becomes photoexcited, it always forms a radical pair in the singlet state, but it doesn\u2019t stay that way for long.",
              "Owing to a quirk of quantum mechanics, the radical pair rapidly converts to the triplet state, and then continues to bounce between these two states millions of times per second.",
              "Each of these two states can produce a reaction product \u2014 the form of CRY4 that contains the radical FADH\u2022, which is the proposed signalling molecule for magnetoreception (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "But the singlet state can also revert to its oxidized, non-excited ground state, thereby reducing its relative contribution to the generation of reaction products.",
              "Thus, if the interconversion of the singlet and triplet states can be manipulated to change the relative amounts of time spent in each of the two states, so too can the yield of the reaction products be manipulated, because a greater fraction of time in the triplet state leads to a higher yield of reaction products.",
              "Foraging skills develop over generations in the wild Foraging skills develop over generations in the wild Herein lies the heart of the proposed cryptochrome-based magnetosensor: the relative amounts of time spent in the singlet and triplet states and the yield of reaction products are directly manipulated by the direction of Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "The interaction between a single ErCRY4 molecule and the field is, on its own, at least one million times too weak to create the radicals and influence their stability2, but the energy required is provided by the photon absorbed by FAD.",
              "However, for this to work at all, the radical pair must be sufficiently magnetically sensitive, and the reaction product must exist for long enough and have a sufficiently high yield to realistically act as a sensory signalling substance.",
              "In a tour de force of biophysical chemistry, Xu and colleagues used a wide range of techniques, such as spectroscopic methods and molecular-dynamics simulations, to show that all of these conditions are satisfied by ErCRY4, at least in vitro.",
              "Not only does ErCRY4 have a much higher magnetic sensitivity than do CRY4 proteins in non-migratory pigeons and chickens, but site-specific mutations of amino-acid residues in ErCRY4 also reveal that its TrpD is probably responsible for generating high and long-lasting (of greater-than-millisecond duration) yields of reaction products that would be needed for magnetosensory signalling.",
              "Although the evidence provided by Xu and colleagues is not definitive proof that ErCRY4 is the elusive magnetoreceptor in vivo, the authors have brought us ever closer to solving this abiding mystery of sensory biology.",

              "The mystery of how birds migrate long distances over land and sea is a step closer to being cracked.",
              "By studying robins, scientists have found clues to how birds sense the Earth's magnetic field.",
              "Just as you might reach for a magnetic compass to find which way is north or south, birds are thought to have an in-built \"living compass\".",
              "A chemical in the eye that is sensitive to magnetism could be proof of this theory, according to a new study.",
              "Peter Hore, professor of chemistry at the University of Oxford, said it could be that birds can \"see\" the Earth's magnetic field, although we don't know that for sure.",
              "\"We think we may have identified the molecule that allows small migratory songbirds to detect the direction of the Earth's magnetic field, which they undoubtedly can do, and use that information to help them navigate when they migrate thousands of kilometres,\" he told BBC News.",
              "For decades, scientists have been investigating how animals such as birds, sea turtles, fish and insects sense the Earth's magnetic field and use it to find their way.",
              "The European robin is a stalwart of studies into the in-built \"living compass\" birds may use to orient themselves using the Earth's magnetic field.",
              "One chemical contender is a molecule in the retina of the eye known as a cryptochrome.",
              "The Oxford team studied a purified form of the molecule in the lab to see whether it was fit for purpose as a magnetic sensor.",
              "They found it had the ability to form pairs of \"radicals\" that have high magnetic sensitivity.",
              "A radical is an atom or molecule that is highly chemically reactive.",
              "Prof Hore said the mechanism they have been investigating involves magnetically-sensitive chemical reactions initiated by light inside the bird's eyes - in their retinas, to be precise.",
              "\"It looks possible - and I would put it no stronger than that at the moment - that these highly-specialised chemical reactions could give the bird information about the direction of the Earth's magnetic field and in that way constitute a magnetic compass,\" he explained.",
              "It's thought that light striking the retina causes electrons to move within the cryptochrome molecule, triggering the production of a pair of short-lived high energy radicals, which act like microscopic magnets.",
              "The scientists caution that there is more work to do before they can be sure of the correct mechanism and the correct molecule.",
              "But they're heartened by the fact that the molecule is more magnetically-sensitive in robins than in birds such as chickens, that don't migrate.",
              "The robin is a familiar sight in many UK gardens, with most spending the winter in Britain.",

              "The mystery behind how birds navigate might finally be solved: it's not the iron in their beaks providing a magnetic compass, but a protein in their eyes that lets them \"see\" Earth's magnetic fields.",
              "These findings come courtesy of two papers - one studying robins, the other zebra finches.",
              "The fancy eye protein is called Cry4, and it's part of a class of proteins called cryptochromes - photoreceptors sensitive to blue light, found in both plants and animals.",
              "These proteins play a role in regulating circadian rhythms. There's also been evidence in recent years that, in birds, the cryptochromes in their eyes are responsible for their ability to orient themselves by detecting magnetic fields, a sense called magnetoreception.",
              "We know that birds can only sense magnetic fields if certain wavelengths of light are available - specifically, studies have shown that avian magnetoreception seems dependent on blue light.",
              "This seems to confirm that the mechanism is a visual one, based in the cryptochromes, which may be able to detect the fields because of quantum coherence.",

              "Their hypothesis was that the cryptochromes associated with magnetoreception should maintain constant reception over the circadian day.",
              "They found that, as expected for circadian clock genes, Cry1 and Cry2 fluctuated daily - but Cry4 expressed at constant levels, making it the most likely candidate for magnetoreception.",

              "\"We also found that Cry1a, Cry1b, and Cry2 mRNA display robust circadian oscillation patterns, whereas Cry4 shows only a weak circadian oscillation,\" the researchers wrote.",
              "But they made a couple of other interesting findings, too.",
              "The first is that Cry4 is clustered in a region of the retina that receives a lot of light - which makes sense for light-dependent magnetoreception.",
              "The other is that European robins have increased Cry4 expression during the migratory season, compared to non-migratory chickens.",
              "Both sets of researchers caution that more research is needed before Cry4 can be declared the protein responsible for magnetoreception.",
              "The evidence is strong, but it's not definitive, and both Cry1 and Cry2 have also been implicated in magnetoreception, the former in garden warblers and the latter in fruit flies.",
              "Observing birds with non-functioning Cry4 could help confirm the role it seems to play, while other studies will be needed to figure Cry1's role.",

              "Advertisement At least part of this ability is thought to lie in their eyes, because their magnetism sensing is disturbed in the absence of light.",
              "Mouritsen has previously shown that when birds are using their internal compass, the information is processed in the same parts of the brain that process vision.",

              "The team found that in the presence of light, electrons can jump between different parts of the molecule, and between it and another molecule called flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), ultimately leading to the production of a compound called CRY4-FADH*.",

              "Magnetic field effects on the coherent spin dynamics of light-induced radical pairs in cryptochromes are manifested as changes in the quantum yields of stabilized states of the protein that could initiate magnetic signalling, most probably through a change in the conformation of the C-terminal tail24.",

These include sensing the direction of the earth's magnetic field in migratory birds and the intensity of magnetic fields in insects and plants.",

              "An intriguing feature of the radical pair hypothesis in birds is the theoretical prediction that RF signals in the 1\u201310 MHz range should elicit the disruption of bird directional responses to the Earth\u2019s magnetic field13,14,15.",

              "Therefore since cryptochromes have been implicated in responses to static magnetic fields in organisms ranging from plants to humans, a prediction of the radical pair hypothesis is that RF magnetic fields could also affect cryptochrome responses.",

              "Blue light LEDs were used to illuminate the sample.",
              "To generate the RF field, a single loop Helmholtz coil was placed around the sample on a rotating axis, such that an RF field could be set in a direction that was either at a parallel or a perpendicular angle to the static magnetic field (see Methods).",

              "One proposes that, as an animal changes direction, crystals of the oxidized-iron compound magnetite (Fe3O4), located in its body and aligned with the field, exert a rotational force \u2014 called torque \u2014 on mechanoreceptors with which they are in physical contact.",

              "1) proposes that, when cryptochrome proteins absorb photons of light and become \u2018photoexcited\u2019, they form magnetically sensitive chemical intermediates known as radical pairs.",

              "When ErCRY4\u2013FAD absorbs a photon of blue light, reactive molecules called radical pairs arise.",
              "These form through interactions between FAD and a tryptophan (Trp) amino-acid residue of ErCRY4, which supplies an electron.",
              "The radical pair is sensitive to Earth\u2019s magnetic field and oscillates rapidly between a singlet and a triplet state (which have different electron \u2018spin\u2019 states as indicated by the white arrows).",
              "The radical pair can generate ErCRY4\u2013FADH\u2022 (which is a long-lived reaction product hypothesized to trigger a sensory signalling cascade).",

              "Which outcome occurs is influenced by the state of the radical pair.",
              "If the bird changes direction, the change in the relative orientation of the magnetic field drives a shift in the proportions of the singlet and triplet states, potentially altering the yield of ErCRY4\u2013FADH\u2022.",

              "Cryptochromes bind non-covalently to a molecule called a chromophore, such as FAD, which absorbs photons of blue light when in its fully oxidized state.",
              "In animals, cryptochrome proteins termed CRY1 and CRY2 are involved in the regulation of daily (circadian) rhythms9, and their expression levels in tissue typically cycle over the course of 24 hours.",
              "By contrast, the cryptochrome CRY4 lacks such signs of circadian cycling, suggesting that it has a different biological role, possibly that of magnetoreception10,11.",
              "CRY4 is found only in birds, fishes and amphibians, which are types of animal with well-documented magnetically guided behaviours.",
              "CRY4 has therefore emerged as the leading candidate for enabling cryptochrome-based magnetoreception in vertebrates.",
              "Previous analysis10 of chickens (Gallus gallus) and migratory European robins (Erithacus rubecula) indicates that CRY4 is located in the outer segments of two types of photoreceptor cell in the retina \u2014 double cones and long-wavelength single cones.",
              "This is an ideal location for receiving the light that would excite cryptochromes and thus aid magnetic sensing.",
              "Further evidence consistent with a possible role for CRY4 in magnetoreception is that its expression level in the robin retina rises as the migratory season approaches, whereas its level remains permanently low in non-migratory chickens10.",
              "A bird\u2019s migration decoded A bird\u2019s migration decoded Xu and colleagues\u2019 major advance is the demonstration that the version of CRY4 (dubbed ErCRY4) in the migratory European robin has a crucial property needed to sense Earth\u2019s magnetic field: the ability to form radical pairs that have high magnetic sensitivity.",
              "Radical pairs arise when the FAD bound to ErCRY4 is reduced (gains an electron) in the presence of light.",
              "Radicals contain an odd number of electrons, and a radical pair consists of two radicals that have been created simultaneously, usually by a chemical reaction.",
              "In ErCRY4, the radicals\u2019 odd electrons are supplied through sequential electron-hopping along a chain of three or four tryptophan amino-acid residues (termed TrpA to TrpD) that are located between FAD and the surface of the cryptochrome.",
              "In the case of FAD, the odd electron that arises from reduction in the presence of light makes the radicals intrinsically magnetic.",
              "This is because electrons behave as microscopic magnets, with a property that physicists call spin (typically symbolized by an arrow \u2191).",
              "In a molecule with an even number of electrons, the spins of each electron pair exactly cancel each other out, rendering the molecule non-magnetic.",
              "If the spins of the odd electrons in each of the two radicals in a radical pair are antiparallel (\u2193\u2191), the radical pair is said to occupy a singlet state, but when they are parallel (\u2191\u2191), the pair occupies a triplet state.",
              "When cryptochrome becomes photoexcited, it always forms a radical pair in the singlet state, but it doesn\u2019t stay that way for long.",
              "Owing to a quirk of quantum mechanics, the radical pair rapidly converts to the triplet state, and then continues to bounce between these two states millions of times per second.",
              "Each of these two states can produce a reaction product \u2014 the form of CRY4 that contains the radical FADH\u2022, which is the proposed signalling molecule for magnetoreception (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "But the singlet state can also revert to its oxidized, non-excited ground state, thereby reducing its relative contribution to the generation of reaction products.",
              "Thus, if the interconversion of the singlet and triplet states can be manipulated to change the relative amounts of time spent in each of the two states, so too can the yield of the reaction products be manipulated, because a greater fraction of time in the triplet state leads to a higher yield of reaction products.",
              "Foraging skills develop over generations in the wild Foraging skills develop over generations in the wild Herein lies the heart of the proposed cryptochrome-based magnetosensor: the relative amounts of time spent in the singlet and triplet states and the yield of reaction products are directly manipulated by the direction of Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "The interaction between a single ErCRY4 molecule and the field is, on its own, at least one million times too weak to create the radicals and influence their stability2, but the energy required is provided by the photon absorbed by FAD.",
              "However, for this to work at all, the radical pair must be sufficiently magnetically sensitive, and the reaction product must exist for long enough and have a sufficiently high yield to realistically act as a sensory signalling substance.",
              "In a tour de force of biophysical chemistry, Xu and colleagues used a wide range of techniques, such as spectroscopic methods and molecular-dynamics simulations, to show that all of these conditions are satisfied by ErCRY4, at least in vitro.",
              "Not only does ErCRY4 have a much higher magnetic sensitivity than do CRY4 proteins in non-migratory pigeons and chickens, but site-specific mutations of amino-acid residues in ErCRY4 also reveal that its TrpD is probably responsible for generating high and long-lasting (of greater-than-millisecond duration) yields of reaction products that would be needed for magnetosensory signalling.",
              "Although the evidence provided by Xu and colleagues is not definitive proof that ErCRY4 is the elusive magnetoreceptor in vivo, the authors have brought us ever closer to solving this abiding mystery of sensory biology.",

              "Migratory birds have an internal clock with an annual rhythm that tells them, among other things, when to migrate.",
              "They also inherit from their parents the directions in which they need to fly in the autumn and spring, and if the parents each have different genetically encoded directions, their offspring will end up with an intermediate direction.",
              "For example, if a southwest-migrating bird is crossed with a southeast-migrating bird, their offspring will head south when the time comes.",
              "But how do the young birds know which direction is southwest or south or southeast?",
              "They have at least three different compasses at their disposal: one allows them to extract information from the position of the sun in the sky, another uses the patterns of the stars at night, and the third is based on Earth\u2019s ever present magnetic field.",
              "In their first autumn, young birds follow inherited instructions such as \u201cfly southwest for three weeks and then south-southeast for two weeks.",
              "\u201d If they make a mistake or are blown off course, they are generally unable to recover because they do not yet have a functioning map that would tell them where they are.",

              "By observing the apparent nighttime rotation of the stars around the North Star, the birds learn to locate north before they embark on their first migration, and an internal 24-hour clock allows them to calibrate their sun compass.",

              "Scientists know a great deal about the detailed biophysical mechanisms of the birds\u2019 senses of sight and smell.",
              "But the inner workings of their magnetic compass have proved harder to understand.",
              "The magnetic direction sense in small songbirds that migrate at night is remarkable in several important respects.",
              "First, observations of caged birds exposed to carefully controlled magnetic fields show that their compass does not behave like the magnetized needle in a ship\u2019s compass.",
              "A bird detects the axis of the magnetic field and the angle it makes with Earth\u2019s surface, the so-called inclination compass.",
              "In laboratory experiments, inverting the magnetic field\u2019s direction so that it points in exactly the opposite direction has no effect on the bird\u2019s ability to orient correctly.",
              "Second, a bird\u2019s perception of Earth\u2019s magnetic field can be disrupted by extraordinarily weak magnetic fields that reverse their direction several million times per second.",
              "Last, even though songbirds fly at night under the dim light of the stars, their magnetic compass is light-dependent, hinting at a link between vision and magnetic sensing.",
              "In 1978, in an attempt to make sense of these features of avian magnetoreception, the late Klaus Schulten, then at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Go\u0308ttingen, Germany, put forth a remarkable idea: that the compass relies on magnetically sensitive chemical transformations.",
              "At first glance, this proposal seems preposterous because the energy available from Earth\u2019s magnetic field is millions of times too small to break, or even significantly weaken, the bonds between atoms in molecules.",
              "But Schulten was inspired by the discovery 10 years previously that short-lived chemical intermediates known as radical pairs have unique properties that make their chemistry sensitive to feeble magnetic interactions.",
              "Over the past 40 years researchers have conducted hundreds of lab studies of radical-pair reactions that are affected by the application of magnetic fields.",
              "To appreciate why radical pairs are so special, we need to talk about a quantum-mechanical property of the electron known as spin angular momentum, or \u201cspin\u201d for short.",
              "Spin is a vector with a direction as well as a magnitude, and it is often represented by an arrow, \u2191 or \u2193, for example.",
              "Particles with spin have magnetic moments, which is to say they behave like microscopic magnets.",
              "Most molecules have an even number of electrons arranged in pairs with opposed spins (\u21c5), which therefore cancel each other out.",
              "Radicals are molecules that have lost or gained an electron, meaning that they contain an odd, unpaired, electron and hence have a spin and a magnetic moment.",
              "When two radicals are created simultaneously by a chemical reaction (this is what we mean by radical pair), the two unpaired electrons, one in each radical, can have either antiparallel spins (\u21c5) or parallel spins (\u2191\u2191), arrangements known as singlet and triplet states, respectively.",
              "Immediately after a radical pair is created in a singlet state, internal magnetic fields cause the two electronic spins to undergo a complex quantum \u201cwaltz\u201d in which singlet turns into triplet and triplet turns back into singlet millions of times per second for periods of up to a few microseconds.",
              "Crucially, under the right conditions, this dance can be influenced by external magnetic fields.",
              "Schulten suggested that this subtle quantum effect could form the basis of a magnetic compass sense that might respond to environmental stimuli a million times weaker than would normally be thought possible.",
              "Research that we and others have carried out in recent years has generated fresh support for this hypothesis.",
              "To be useful, hypotheses need to explain known facts and make testable predictions.",
              "Two aspects of Schulten\u2019s proposed compass mechanism are consistent with what is known about the birds\u2019 compass: radical pairs are indifferent to exact external magnetic field reversals, and radical pairs are often formed when molecules absorb light.",
              "Given that the birds\u2019 magnetic compass is light-dependent, a prediction of Schulten\u2019s hypothesis is that their eyes play a part in the magnetic sensory system.",
              "About 10 years ago the research group of one of us (Mouritsen) at the University of Oldenburg in Germany found that a brain region called Cluster N, which receives and processes visual information, is by far the most active part of the brain when certain night-migrating birds are using their magnetic compass.",
              "If Cluster N is dysfunctional, research in migratory European Robins showed, the birds can still use their sun and star compasses, but they are incapable of orienting using Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "From experiments such as these, it is clear that the magnetic compass sensors are located in the birds\u2019 retinas.",
              "One early objection to the radical-pair hypothesis was that no one had ever shown that magnetic fields as tiny as Earth\u2019s, which are 10 to 100 times weaker than a fridge magnet, could affect a chemical reaction.",
              "To address this point, Christiane Timmel of the University of Oxford and her colleagues chose a molecule chemically unlike anything one would find inside a bird: one that contained an electron donor molecule linked to an electron acceptor molecule via a molecular bridge.",
              "Exposing the molecules to green light caused an electron to jump from the donor to the acceptor over a distance of about four nanometers.",
              "The radical pair that formed from this reaction was extremely sensitive to weak magnetic interactions, proving that it is indeed possible for a radical-pair reaction to be influenced by the presence of\u2014and, more important, the direction of\u2014an Earth-strength magnetic field.",
              "Schulten\u2019s hypothesis also predicts that there must be sensory molecules (magnetoreceptors) in the retina in which magnetically sensitive radical pairs can be created using the wavelengths birds need for their compass to operate, which another line of research had identified as light centered in the blue region of the spectrum.",
              "In 2000 he suggested that the necessary photochemistry could take place in a then recently discovered protein called cryptochrome.",
              "Cryptochromes are found in plants, insects, fish, birds and humans.",
              "They have a variety of functions, including light-dependent control of plant growth and regulation of circadian clocks.",
              "What makes them attractive as potential compass sensors is that they are the only known naturally occurring photoreceptors in any vertebrate that form radical pairs when they absorb blue light.",
              "Six types of cryptochromes have been found in the eyes of migratory birds, and no other type of candidate magnetoreceptor molecule has emerged in the past 20 years.",
              "Like all other proteins, cryptochromes are composed of chains of amino acids folded up into complex three-dimensional structures.",
              "Buried deep in the center of many cryptochromes is a yellow molecule called flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) that, unlike the rest of the protein, absorbs blue light.",
              "Embedded among the 500 or so amino acids that make up a typical cryptochrome is a roughly linear chain of three or four tryptophan amino acids stretching from the FAD out to the surface of the protein.",
              "Immediately after the FAD absorbs a blue photon, an electron from the nearest tryptophan hops onto the flavin portion of the FAD.",
              "The first tryptophan then attracts an electron from the second tryptophan and so on.",
              "In this way, the tryptophan chain behaves like a molecular wire.",
              "The net result is a radical pair made of a negatively charged FAD radical in the center of the protein and, two nanometers away, a positively charged tryptophan radical at the surface of the protein.",
              "In 2012 one of us (Hore), working with colleagues at Oxford, carried out experiments to test the suitability of cryptochrome as a magnetic sensor.",
              "The study used cryptochrome-1, a protein found in Arabidopsis thaliana, the plant in which cryptochromes had been discovered 20 years earlier.",
              "Using short laser pulses to produce radical pairs inside the purified proteins, we found that we could fine-tune their subsequent reactions by applying magnetic fields.",
              "This was all very encouraging, but, of course, plants don\u2019t migrate.",
              "We had to wait almost a decade before we could make similar measurements on a cryptochrome from a migratory bird.",
              "The first challenge was to decide which of the six bird cryptochromes to look at.",
              "We chose cryptochrome-4a (Cry4a), partly because it binds FAD much more strongly than do some of its siblings, and if there is no FAD in the protein, there will be no radical pairs and no magnetic sensitivity.",
              "Experiments in Oldenburg also showed that the levels of Cry4a in migratory birds are higher during the spring and autumn migratory seasons than they are during winter and summer when the birds do not migrate.",
              "Computer simulations performed by Ilia Solov\u2019yov in Oldenburg showed that European Robin Cry4a has a chain of four tryptophans\u2014one more than the Cry1 from Arabidopsis.",
              "Naturally, we wondered whether the extended chain had evolved to optimize magnetic sensing in migratory birds.",
              "Our next challenge was to get large amounts of highly pure robin Cry4a.",
              "Jingjing Xu, a Ph.",
              "D.",
              "student in Mouritsen\u2019s lab, solved it.",
              "After optimizing the experimental conditions, she was able to use bacterial cell cultures to produce samples of the protein with the FAD correctly bound.",
              "She also prepared versions of the protein in which each of the four tryptophans was replaced, one at a time, by a different amino acid so as to block electron hopping at each of the four positions along the chain.",
              "Working with these alternative versions of the protein would allow us to test whether the electrons are really jumping all the way along the tryptophan chain.",
              "We shipped these samples\u2014the first purified cryptochromes from any migratory animal\u2014to Oxford, where Timmel and her husband, Stuart Mackenzie, studied them using the sensitive laser-based techniques they had developed specifically for that purpose.",
              "Their research groups found that both the third and fourth tryptophan radicals at the end of the chain are magnetically sensitive when paired with the FAD radical.",
              "We suspect that the tryptophans work cooperatively for efficient magnetic sensing, biochemical signaling and direction finding.",
              "We also speculate that the presence of the fourth tryptophan might enhance the initial steps of signal transduction, the process by which nerve impulses encoding the magnetic field direction are generated and ultimately sent along the optic nerve to the brain.",
              "We are currently conducting experiments to identify the proteins that interact with Cry4a.",
              "One more cryptochrome finding deserves mention here.",
              "We compared robin Cry4a with the extremely similar Cry4a proteins from two nonmigratory birds, pigeons and chickens.",
              "The robin protein had the largest magnetic sensitivity, hinting that evolution might have optimized robin Cry4a for navigation.",
              "Although these experiments confirm that Cry4a has some of the properties required of a magnetoreceptor, we are still a long way from proving how migratory birds perceive Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines.",
              "One crucial next step is to determine whether radical pairs actually form in the eyes of migratory birds.",
              "The most promising way to test for radical pairs inside the birds\u2019 eyes was inspired by the work of chemists and physicists who, in the 1980s, showed that fluctuating magnetic fields alter the way radical-pair reactions respond to static magnetic fields.",
              "Their work predicted that a weak radio-frequency electromagnetic field, fluctuating with the same frequencies as the \u201csinglet-triplet waltz,\u201d might interfere with the birds\u2019 ability to use their magnetic compass.",
              "Thorsten Ritz of the University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues were the first to confirm this prediction in 2004.",
              "In 2007 Mouritsen began similar behavioral experiments in his lab in Oldenburg\u2014with intriguingly different results.",
              "During the spring and fall, birds that travel between nesting and wintering grounds exhibit a behavior called Zugunruhe, or migratory restlessness, as if they are anxious to get on their way.",
              "When caged, these birds usually use their magnetic compass to instinctively orient themselves in the direction in which they would fly in the wild.",
              "Mouritsen found that European Robins tested in wooden huts on his university\u2019s campus were unable to orient using their magnetic compass.",
              "He suspected that weak radio-frequency noise (sometimes called electrosmog) generated by electrical equipment in the nearby labs was interfering with the birds\u2019 magnetic compass.",
              "To confirm that electrosmog was the source of the problem, Mouritsen and his team lined the huts with aluminum sheets to block the stray radio frequencies.",
              "On nights when the shields were grounded and functioned properly, the birds oriented well in Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "On nights when the grounding was disconnected, the birds jumped in random directions.",
              "When tested in an unshielded wooden shelter typically used for horses some kilometers outside the city and well away from electrical equipment, the same birds had no trouble detecting the direction of the magnetic field.",
              "These results are significant on several fronts.",
              "If the radio-frequency fields affect the magnetic sensor and not, say, some component of the signaling pathway that carries nerve impulses to the brain, then they provide compelling evidence that a radical-pair mechanism underpins the bird\u2019s magnetic compass.",
              "The main competing hypothesis, for which there is currently much less support, proposes that magnetic iron\u2013containing minerals are the sensors.",
              "Any such particles that were large enough to align like a compass needle in Earth\u2019s magnetic field would be far too big to rotate in a much weaker field that reversed its direction millions of times per second.",
              "Furthermore, the radio-frequency fields that upset the birds\u2019 magnetic orientation are astonishingly weak, and we don\u2019t yet understand exactly how they could corrupt the directional information available from the much stronger magnetic field of Earth.",
              "It is also remarkable that the birds in the Oldenburg lab were disoriented much more effectively by broadband radio-frequency noise (randomly fluctuating magnetic fields with a range of frequencies) than by the single-frequency fields mostly used by Ritz and his collaborators.",
              "We hope that by subjecting migratory songbirds to bands of radio-frequency noise with different frequencies we will be able to determine whether the sensors really are FAD-tryptophan radical pairs or whether, as some other investigators have suggested, another radical pair might be involved.",
              "Many questions about the birds\u2019 magnetic compass remain, including whether the magnetic field effects on robin Cry4a observed in vitro also exist in vivo.",
              "We also want to see whether migratory birds with genetically suppressed Cry4a production are prevented from orienting using their magnetic compass.",
              "If we can prove that a radical-pair mechanism is behind the magnetic sense in vivo, then we will have shown that a biological sensory system can respond to stimuli several million times weaker than previously thought possible.",
              "This insight would enhance our understanding of biological sensing and provide new ideas for artificial sensors.",
              "Working to gain a full understanding of the inner navigation systems of migratory birds is not merely an intellectual pursuit.",
              "One consequence of the enormous distances migratory birds travel is that they face more acute threats to their survival than most species that breed and overwinter in the same place.",
              "It is more difficult to protect them from the harmful effects of human activity, habitat destruction and climate change.",
              "Relocating migratory individuals away from damaged habitats is rarely successful because the birds tend to instinctively return to those unlivable locales.",
              "We hope that by providing new and more mechanistic insights into the ways in which these extraordinary navigators find their way, conservationists will have a better chance of \u201ctricking\u201d migrants into believing that a safer location really is their new home.",
              "When you next see a small songbird, pause for a moment to consider that it might recently have flown thousands of kilometers, navigating with great skill using a brain weighing no more than a gram.",
              "The fact that quantum spin dynamics may have played a crucial part in its journey only compounds the awe and wonder with which we should regard these extraordinary creatures.",

              "Although some long-distance migrants evidently extract positional information from the general dipole field10,13 shown in (a), fine-scale variations are more complex than the general regional patterns because concentrations of ferromagnetic minerals in the Earth's crust often generate local field anomalies.",
              "Although these variations are typically less than 1% of the total field, their gradients (that is, the variation per distance) can be significantly greater than the gradients due to the main dipole field, and can also be aligned in a different direction.",
              "The larger gradients might be easier for a short-distance migrant or homing animal to detect, but the complexity of local magnetic contours indicates that any navigational strategies that exploit magnetic topography over these smaller spatial scales are likely to be site-specific, difficult to generalize and learned rather than inherited.",

              "For today's humans, this need is usually met through a GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS), which provides users with their geographical position and continuously computes the direction to a goal.",

              "These animals exploit positional information in the Earth's field in several different ways, and at least a few are able to learn the magnetic topography of the areas in which they live and so acquire 'magnetic maps' that facilitate navigation towards specific locations (Fig.",

              "Possible mechanisms of magnetoreception During the past three decades, a number of diverse mechanisms have been proposed that might provide the basis for detecting magnetic fields1,20.",
              "However, the most recent research has focused on three possibilities: ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION, magnetic field-dependent chemical reactions and BIOGENIC MAGNETITE.",

              "Therefore, if an electrically conductive bar moves through a magnetic field in any direction other than parallel to the field lines, positively and negatively charged particles migrate to opposite sides of the bar, resulting in a constant voltage that depends on the speed and direction of the bar's motion relative to the magnetic field.",
              "If the bar is immersed in a conductive medium that is stationary relative to the field, an electric circuit is formed and current flows through the medium and the bar.",
              "This principle, known as electromagnetic induction, provides a possible explanation for how elasmobranch fish (sharks, skates and rays) detect the Earth's magnetic field22,23.",
              "According to this hypothesis, jelly-filled canals on the fish, known as ampullae of Lorenzini, function as the conducting bars;",
              "the surrounding sea water functions as the motionless conducting medium, and the highly resistive and sensitive electroreceptors at the inner end of the ampullae detect the voltage drop of the induced current.",
              "However, several factors significantly complicate these simple models.",
              "First, the electroreceptors of elasmobranches cannot detect the steady fields that were originally thought to arise24.",
              "Second, the water surrounding marine fish is seldom motionless under natural conditions.",
              "Third, ocean currents are also conductors moving through the Earth's magnetic field, and so create electric fields of their own.",
              "Presumably, therefore, the animal must be able to determine which component of the total field that it experiences is attributable to its own motion and which is due to the motion of water22,25.",
              "In principle, these problems might be overcome if sharks derive magnetic field information from the oscillating electric fields that arise as the ampullae on their heads move back and forth during swimming25.",
              "Such fields should be distinguishable from fields caused by oceanic currents.",
              "Although sea water is a highly conductive medium, air is not.",
              "Therefore, birds and other terrestrial animals cannot accomplish magnetoreception by induction in the same way that has been proposed for electrosensitive marine fish.",
              "Although an induction-based system using an internal current loop (a closed circuit inside an animal) is theoretically possible, such a loop would need to rotate relative to the Earth's field21 and would probably also require a specialized internal transduction organ several millimeters in diameter26.",
              "The semicircular canals have some of the necessary features, but at present there is no evidence that magnetoreception occurs in the inner ear, and no likely alternative structure or site has been found in any animal26.",
              "Evidence for electromagnetic induction.",
              "Direct evidence that animals use electromagnetic induction to detect the Earth's magnetic field has not yet been obtained.",
              "Nevertheless, rays and sharks clearly have a highly sensitive electric sense with which they can detect the weak electric fields generated by the tissues of their prey27.",
              "This electrosensory system seems to be sufficiently sensitive to permit detection of the Earth's magnetic field28.",
              "Several studies have provided experimental or correlative evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that elasmobranches do perceive magnetic stimuli29,30,31,32,33.",
              "In some cases, however, it was impossible to determine precisely what the animals detected.",
              "For example, in a recent experiment captive sharks learned to approach an area of the tank for a food reward when a magnetic coil surrounding the tank was turned on33.",
              "Although this was interpreted as a response to the imposed magnetic field, an equally plausible explanation is that the crucial stimulus might have been the transient electric field that is generated whenever the current through a coil is turned on21.",
              "Similarly, rays have been conditioned to move towards a specific magnetic direction in an enclosure29, but whether the rays responded to the direction of the field per se, or instead to the presence of field anomalies, is debatable1,34.",
              "In a recent attempt to investigate the mechanism of magnetoreception in elasmobranch fish, rays were conditioned to respond to the presence or absence of magnetic field anomalies31,32.",
              "The conditioned response disappeared when small magnets were inserted into their nasal cavities, whereas inserting non-magnetic brass bars had no effect.",
              "These results have been interpreted as evidence against the electromagnetic induction hypothesis because induction should be unaffected by attached magnets that move in concert with the animal32.",
              "A crucial question is whether the movements of the magnets in the nasal cavities precisely matched movements of the electroreceptors on the flexible bodies of the fish, because if slight differences in motion occurred then a magnetoreception system based on induction might indeed have been affected.",
              "Whether elasmobranch fish rely on electromagnetic induction for magnetoreception or use an alternative mechanism remains unresolved.",
              "Chemical magnetoreception.",
              "A second proposed mechanism of magnetoreception involves chemical reactions that are modulated by Earth-strength magnetic fields.",
              "At first glance, it seems unlikely that fields as weak as the Earth's could influence any chemical reaction, let alone those in animals.",
              "After all, such reactions involve alterations in the energies of electrons, and the energy differences between different orbitals are many orders of magnitude too large for the Earth's field to transfer electrons directly from one orbital to another.",
              "In addition, at physiological temperatures the kinetic energy of biological molecules is 2 x 1011 times greater than the energy of the Earth's field and might, therefore, be expected to overwhelm any slight magnetic effect35.",
              "Nevertheless, weak magnetic fields might exert an influence on biological molecules and chemical reactions under at least some circumstances.",
              "Several ingenious mechanisms have been proposed and debated36,37,38,39, but the only hypothesis that has so far gained widespread acceptance as physically plausible is one that relies on chemical reactions involving pairs of radicals40,41.",
              "The proposed mechanism is that Earth-strength magnetic fields influence correlated spin states of paired radical ions3,37,42.",
              "Electron spins are largely unaffected by thermal noise, and so represent one of only a few molecular features that might plausibly be influenced by the Earth's field35.",
              "The putative process begins with an electron transfer from a donor molecule, A, to an acceptor molecule, B.",
              "This leaves each with an unpaired electron, the spins of which are either opposite (singlet state) or parallel (triplet state).",
              "Either way, the spins precess, meaning that the axis of rotation changes slowly in much the same way that a spinning top wobbles around a vertical axis as it slows down.",
              "This analogy is not precise, however, because electron spin can have only one of two orientations (up or down).",
              "The PRECESSION of the spins is caused by interactions with the local magnetic environment, which, in turn, is determined by the combined magnetic fields that are generated by the spins and orbital motions of unpaired electrons and magnetic nuclei, and any external field.",
              "Because the two electrons encounter slightly different magnetic forces, they precess at different rates.",
              "After a brief period of time, the electron that was transferred returns to the donor.",

              "Now, more than 50 years later, we still don\u2019t really understand how it works,\u201d says neuroscientist David Keays of the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna.",
              "Today, researchers are focusing on three possible ways that a magnetic sense could work.",
              "One idea involves a form of iron with magnetic properties, called magnetite, acting as a sort of compass within cells that rotates to align with the magnetic field.",

              "Though it is biologically possible \u2013 certain kinds of swimming bacteria use the iron mineral to orient themselves \u2013 evidence in higher animals remains elusive, with scattered reports that are not always reproducible.",
              "\u201cThe history of the magnetite literature in vertebrates is basically, \u2018I find magnetite here,\u2019 \u2018I find magnetite here,\u2019 \u2018I find magnetite here,\u2019 but it\u2019s not getting much further than that yet,\u201d says biologist Henrik Mouritsen, who investigates magnetoreception in European robins and blackcaps and coauthored a 2016 overview of the topic in the Annual Review of Biophysics.",
              "Mouritsen, of the University of Oldenburg in Germany, would like to test the magnetite hypothesis using a classic tool of biologists: Remove something from the animal and see what happens to its behavior.",
              "If magnetite is critical for navigation, destroying the magnetite-containing cells would affect the birds\u2019 ability to find their way.",
              "But for this research strategy to work, scientists need to know just where to find magnetite in the robins.",
              "And even if they find it, \u201cit\u2019s a long way from showing a cell contains iron to showing it\u2019s magnetite connected to nerve tissue that has any biological relevance,\u201d Mouritsen says.",
              "One major knock against the magnetite theory is that a bird\u2019s compass senses only the axis of the magnetic field and not its polarity, says chemist Peter Hore of the University of Oxford, a coauthor on the Annual Reviews paper.",
              "Unlike the compass needles used by people, which rely on the magnetic field\u2019s polarity to point toward the magnetic North Pole, birds know which direction the nearest pole is but can\u2019t distinguish between north and south.",
              "So when scientists invert the magnetic field in the lab, birds don\u2019t sense a change and continue to head in the same direction.",
              "But magnetite particles would respond to a flipped field by pointing in the opposite direction, just like a compass needle would.",
              "If birds were depending on magnetite, they would sense the change and turn around to head in the opposite direction.",
              "The eyes have it?",
              "The weight of evidence gathered by scientists tilts toward another idea known as the radical-pair hypothesis, Hore says.",
              "Mouritsen also favors this idea, which is based on a protein in birds\u2019 eyes called cryptochrome.",
              "When light hits cryptochrome, reactions within the protein generate a pair of molecules, called a radical pair.",
              "The two molecules in the pair each have an odd number of electrons, leaving each with a single, unpaired electron.",
              "These two extra electrons can have spins that are in the same (or parallel) direction, or in the opposite (antiparallel) direction, and they can also flip between these two states.",
              "According to the radical-pair hypothesis, Earth\u2019s magnetic field influences how likely the spins are to be parallel or antiparallel.",
              "How those spins are then translated into a compass isn\u2019t certain, but scientists suspect that in a biochemical reaction in the bird\u2019s eye, the two spin states could lead to different amounts of chemical products being made.",
              "The products could then influence signals sent from the bird\u2019s retina to its brain, making it aware of the magnetic field.",
              "A mechanism based on radical pairs instead of magnetite could potentially allow birds to detect magnetic fields, Keays agrees.",
              "But because the radical-pair system depends on light hitting birds\u2019 eyes, he thinks there is probably more than one mechanism at work.",
              "\u201cIt seems counterintuitive to have a light-dependent magnetic sensor when you are flying at night,\u201d he says.",
              "Or maybe the ears do Keays is testing a long-forgotten hypothesis, first proposed in 1882, that as a bird flies through Earth\u2019s magnetic field, tiny electric currents are generated in its ear.",
              "This would happen through electromagnetic induction, akin to how a magnet that moves through a coiled wire creates an electric current in the wire.",
              "Extremely sensitive receptors would pick up the small voltages induced in the bird\u2019s inner ear and send signals to the brain.",
              "Electromagnetic induction is thought to be plausible in sharks and skates, which can sense electric currents in seawater.",
              "That same electrosensory system could potentially function as a sort of biological wire in which currents could be induced, allowing the animals to sense Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "To test whether induction could work in a land animal like birds, Keays built a simple, scaled model of a pigeon\u2019s inner ear: a plastic tube filled with conductive fluid.",
              "When he put the model in a rotating magnetic field, sure enough, a small current was induced.",
              "Keays suspects the pigeon behavior of rapid head-turning to scan the environment during flight may also serve to boost the voltage in the birds\u2019 ears.",
              "He has also discovered a very sensitive electroreceptor in the pigeon\u2019s inner ear, which is exactly where it would be needed for induction to work.",
              "Though scientists in the field are finding many new and intriguing pieces of evidence, the definitive test that will finally reveal how birds \u201cfeel\u201d the magnetic field has yet to be devised, Hore says.",
              "\u201cWhat we need is a killer experiment that would have the power to show, once and for all, whether it really is radical pairs and whether it really is cryptochrome.",

              "Radicals contain an odd number of electrons, and a radical pair consists of two radicals that have been created simultaneously, usually by a chemical reaction.",
              "In ErCRY4, the radicals\u2019 odd electrons are supplied through sequential electron-hopping along a chain of three or four tryptophan amino-acid residues (termed TrpA to TrpD) that are located between FAD and the surface of the cryptochrome.",
              "In the case of FAD, the odd electron that arises from reduction in the presence of light makes the radicals intrinsically magnetic.",

              "When cryptochrome becomes photoexcited, it always forms a radical pair in the singlet state, but it doesn\u2019t stay that way for long.",
              "Owing to a quirk of quantum mechanics, the radical pair rapidly converts to the triplet state, and then continues to bounce between these two states millions of times per second.",
              "Each of these two states can produce a reaction product \u2014 the form of CRY4 that contains the radical FADH\u2022, which is the proposed signalling molecule for magnetoreception (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "But the singlet state can also revert to its oxidized, non-excited ground state, thereby reducing its relative contribution to the generation of reaction products.",
              "Thus, if the interconversion of the singlet and triplet states can be manipulated to change the relative amounts of time spent in each of the two states, so too can the yield of the reaction products be manipulated, because a greater fraction of time in the triplet state leads to a higher yield of reaction products.",
              "Foraging skills develop over generations in the wild Foraging skills develop over generations in the wild Herein lies the heart of the proposed cryptochrome-based magnetosensor: the relative amounts of time spent in the singlet and triplet states and the yield of reaction products are directly manipulated by the direction of Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "The interaction between a single ErCRY4 molecule and the field is, on its own, at least one million times too weak to create the radicals and influence their stability2, but the energy required is provided by the photon absorbed by FAD.",
              "However, for this to work at all, the radical pair must be sufficiently magnetically sensitive, and the reaction product must exist for long enough and have a sufficiently high yield to realistically act as a sensory signalling substance.",
              "In a tour de force of biophysical chemistry, Xu and colleagues used a wide range of techniques, such as spectroscopic methods and molecular-dynamics simulations, to show that all of these conditions are satisfied by ErCRY4, at least in vitro.",
              "Not only does ErCRY4 have a much higher magnetic sensitivity than do CRY4 proteins in non-migratory pigeons and chickens, but site-specific mutations of amino-acid residues in ErCRY4 also reveal that its TrpD is probably responsible for generating high and long-lasting (of greater-than-millisecond duration) yields of reaction products that would be needed for magnetosensory signalling.",

              "The magnetic field of the Earth provides animals that can sense it with navigational information: the vector indicates directions, and magnetic intensity and inclination, which decreases from the magnetic poles to the magnetic equator, and possibly also magnetic declination could be used as components of the navigational \u2018map\u2019.",

              "The avian magnetic compass seems to measure directions with an accuracy of about 3\u00b0 in the vertical [13] and at least 5\u00b0 in the horizontal [14].",
              "These properties of the avian magnetic compass caused Ritz and colleagues [15] to propose the radical pair model: upon absorption of a photon, radical pairs are formed, either as singlets with antiparallel spin or as triplets with parallel spin.",
              "The ratio between the two states depends on the orientation of the radical pair in the magnetic field and can thus mediate magnetic directions.",
              "The eye was suggested as the site of the receptive processes, because here light is available and, because of its more or less round form, receptors, aligned perpendicularly to its surface in ordered arrays, are covering all spatial directions.",
              "This would lead to a characteristic activation pattern on the retina that is centrally symmetric to the vector of the magnetic field;",
              "it can be spatially interpreted and thus indicate magnetic directions.",
              "As a receptor molecule, the authors suggested cryptochrome, a flavoprotein, because this is the only protein known in animals where absorption of photons leads to the formation of radical pairs [15,16].",
              "This model is in agreement with the known characteristics of the avian magnetic compass.",
              "Because the singlet/triplet ratio depends on the course of the field lines, but not on their polarity, it results in an inclination compass, as found in birds.",
              "The \u2018functional window\u2019 and its flexibility can also be explained: the activation pattern also depends on magnetic intensity;",
              "birds that experience a sudden change in intensity are faced with a novel pattern which might be confusing at first.",

              "Subjecting birds to radiofrequency fields, a diagnostic tool for radical pair processes [20], results in disorientation (figure 1c).",
              "This applies to migrants during migratory orientation [21\u201324] as well as to directionally trained non-migrants such as Domestic Chickens [25] and Zebra Finches [26].",
              "The Larmor frequency, that is, the frequency of the electron, proved most effective and disrupts orientation at very low intensities [27];",
              "this has been independently confirmed by [23,28].",
              "Reports of the opposite [24] are inconclusive because of methodological short-comings (use of metallic test cages that not only shield but also reflect and distort radiofrequency fields so that the conditions become undefined).",
              "The chromophore of cryptochrome is flavin (FAD), which undergoes a redox cycle: photon absorption reduces FAD to the semiquinone FADH\u00b0, forming a first radical pair with tryptophan.",
              "In a next step, FADH\u00b0 can be further photo-reduced to the fully reduced form FADH\u2212, which is then re-oxidized independently of light.",

              "In an immuno-histochemical study using a specific antiserum, Nie\u00dfner and colleagues [40] located Cry1a in the UVS/VS (SWS1) cones (ultraviolet/violet cones) in chickens and robins, with immuno-electron microscopy showing it positioned at the discs in the outer segment together with UV-opsin.",
              "An in vivo study showed that, in contrast to what Kutta and colleagues [41] assume, it is directly activated by light of the wavelengths that are absorbed by flavin [19].",
              "The UVS/VS cones have clear oil droplets that allow all wavelengths of light to pass [42];",
              "they are present all across the retina so that they can give rise to the activation pattern proposed by Ritz and colleagues [15] and mediate magnetic directions.",
              "Cry1b was located by immuno-histochemistry in the cytosol of ganglion cells, displaced ganglion cells and also in the inner segments of the photoreceptors [43\u201345], free as well as bound to membranes.",
              "In night-migrating birds, its expression varies with season and was much stronger during the migratory season when the birds were active during the night [45,46].",
              "A role in magnetoreception has been suggested [44], but, because the use of a magnetic compass is also shared by non-migrants and hence appears to be a general ability of birds, the seasonal changes seems to suggest another role, possibly involving the shift from diurnal activity to nocturnal Zugunruhe.",
              "Cryptochrome 2 was described by Bailey and colleagues [47], who identified it by its mRNA in a number of organs, among them the pineal and, in the eyes, in the photoreceptors and ganglion cells (see also [38]).",
              "It includes a sequence that suggests its location in the cell nucleus [39,43], which points to a possible role as a clock protein (e.",
              "g. [48]).",
              "Cryptochrome 4 was described in avian eyes by Watari and colleagues [49] using mRNA expression and immuno-histochemistry.",
              "With specific antisera, Gu\u0308nther and colleagues [50] could narrow down the location of Cry4 to the outer segments of the LWS (longwave-sensitive) single cones and of the double cones.",
              "It has recently been speculated that Cry4 may be involved in magnetoreception (e.",
              "g. [50,51]).",
              "In particular the location within the double cones prompted the suggestion of such a role of Cry4, because here the input of two adjacent receptors with the magneto-receptive molecules oriented in different directions could be compared to overcome problems by different light intensities and polarization [50,52].",
              "However, the principal cone is associated with an oil droplet that acts as a cut-off filter absorbing short wavelengths [42] and thus most of the wavelengths needed for cryptochrome photo-reduction.",
              "This, together with the gap junctions between the two cones, would interfere with a comparison.",
              "Hence such a role of Cry4 in the double cones in magnetoreception seems problematic.",
              "The Cry4 in the LWS single cones seems even less suitable for magnetoreception, because these cones contain a red oil droplet that transmits only long wavelengths that are not absorbed by cryptochrome.",
              "Qin and colleagues [53], based on genome-wide screenings, suggested an iron\u2013sulfur protein polymer, MagR, with an intrinsic magnetic moment, in combination with Cry4, as a magnetic sensor that combines ferrimagnetic and light-dependent features.",
              "This complex was found by antibodies to be most highly expressed in the retinal ganglion cell layer, and the inner and outer nuclear layer.",
              "Yet the assumptions about the magnetic moment\u2014it appears to be much weaker than assumed\u2014and the immuno-histological studies have been criticized (see [54]), and it is still unclear whether such a combined sensor is involved in magnetoreception.",
              "Altogether, the presently available evidence indicates Cry1a as the most likely receptor molecule for sensing directions.",
              "The observation that its gene expression shows a diurnal rhythm [51] does not speak against such a role, because it only indicates a rhythmic production in the inner segment, from where it has to be transported into the outer segment\u2014a parallel case to vision where the production of opsins also shows a diurnal pattern (e.",
              "g. [55,56]).",
              "Any activation pattern caused by the magnetic field in the retina must be transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain to be processed (see [57,58]).",
              "How singlet/triplet ratios could be transformed into a sensory signal for transmission to the brain is not yet known.",
              "Behavioural tests showed that, in adult birds, the magnetic compass is lateralized in favour of the right eye, which means that the respective information is processed predominantly in the left hemisphere of the brain [59\u201362].",
              "Migrants could use both eyes during their first autumn migration [63\u201365];",
              "the lateralization was found to develop between the first autumn and the first spring migration [65].",
              "In the beginning, it proved rather flexible, as it could be undone by covering the right eye for 11\u20442 h ([66];",
              "see also [67], where that eye was covered for more than 1 h before the tests started).",
              "This suggests that the lateralization is initially caused by asymmetric inhibitory interactions between the two hemispheres;",
              "when the right eye was covered short-term synaptic plasticity returned the ability of the left eye and the right hemisphere to process magnetic directional information.",
              "Yet the lateralization in favour of the right eye returned once the right eye could be used again [66].",
              "The centres in the brain where magnetic directional information is processed are still not entirely clear.",
              "Most probable candidates are areas associated with the visual system, yet it is still open whether the processing of magnetic information is an integrated part of vision or whether it is processed more or less independently as a sense of its own.",
              "The observation that covering the right eye could remove the lateralization only if meaningful magnetic information was available\u2014light alone proved insufficient [66]\u2014could be interpreted as suggesting the latter.",
              "An involvement of the thalamofugal pathway is suggested (e.",
              "g. [58,67,68]).",
              "Electrophysiological responses to changes in magnetic directions were recorded from direction-sensitive cells in the nucleus of the basal optic root (nBOR), a part of the accessary optic system, and from the stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale of the tectum opticum [69,70].",
              "Yet recent studies failed to find magnetic field-induced activity in the tectum opticum [71,72].",
              "Using neural activity markers, a part of the Wulst, cluster N, was identified as an area with considerable neural activity during migratory behaviour in night-migrating passerines when they had to rely on their magnetic compass [73].",
              "A follow-up study showed activity in cluster N during nocturnal activity, but not during the day, with a certain lateralization in favour of the right hemisphere.",
              "This was discussed in connection with night vision, but also as possibly being associated with processing magnetic directional information, although a difference in neuronal activity between a near-zero magnetic field and a changing magnetic field could not be observed [74].",
              "By neuronal tracing, cluster N was found to be connected with the retinal neurons via the visual thalamus by the thalamofugal pathway [58].",
              "Lesioning cluster N led to disorientation [75].",
              "However, when a day- and night-migrating passerine species, the Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis, was tested, cluster N did not show enhanced activity during daytime migration [75], so that it remains open whether cluster N is indeed involved in magnetoreception or whether it controls other aspects of nocturnal migratory activity (see [72,74]).",
              "Studies comparing the activity of neuronal markers in birds subjected to a static magnetic field and in birds subjected to a rotating magnetic field indicated a certain increase in a number of brain areas, with the most pronounced one in the dorsomedial rostral hippocampus and some effect in a part of the hyperpallium [76].",
              "Altogether, there are still a number of open questions about how a sensory signal is formed by the radical pair process, how the magnetic signal is separated from the visual information (see [77] for discussion) and about the brain areas where magnetic directional information is processed.",

              "To use declination and inclination, birds would have to record minute angular differences;",
              "additionally, these parameters require non-magnetic reference directions\u2014true (astronomical) North and gravity, respectively\u2014which would complicate their use.",

              "5 T pulse showed a marked deviation from their migratory direction [88,89], with the size and the direction of this deflection depending on how the pulse was applied [90,91].",
              "This suggests that the pulse did not silence the putative receptors altogether, but caused them to provide the birds with false information.",
              "The response to the pulse was restricted to experienced migrants that navigate towards an already familiar goal, whereas young birds on their first migration that fly innate courses were not affected [92].",
              "This finding and the observation that homing pigeons treated with such a pulse deviated from untreated controls at some (but not all) sites in greater distances from home [93,94] indicate that the pulse affects a receptor that provides birds with a magnetic component of the navigational \u2018map\u2019 (see also [95]).",
              "Apparently, the pulse changes the course to be pursued, while the magnetic inclination compass remains unaffected [92,96].",

              "These observations with caged migrants have a parallel in free-flying migrants: migrating birds caught at a stop-over site were treated with a pulse, released, and their departure directions were radio-tracked.",
              "Here, too, young birds on their first migration proved unaffected;",
              "adult migrants that departed within 10 days after pulse treatment were random, those that departed after 10 days were oriented in their normal migratory direction [97].",
              "The relative short duration of the pulse effect\u2014recovery of normal migratory orientation within about 10 days\u2014could be an indication for the size of the magnetite particles involved.",
              "If the magnetization of single-domain particles was altered by the pulse, a new magnetization would be just as stable as the original one, and a complete exchange of the magnetic particles within a time span of just 10 days seems rather unlikely.",
              "Clusters of superparamagnetic particles, on the other hand, would be disrupted by the pulse, but could later rearrange themselves [98].",
              "The observation that the pulse effect was not modified by an applied biasing field [99] could also by interpreted in favour of an involvement of superparamagnetic particles.",
              "The location and the structure of the magnetite-based receptors are still not entirely clear.",
              "After a number of studies had reported magnetic material in various places in the birds' head, attention focused on tiny iron-containing particles in the upper beak of pigeons.",
              "Electron-optical, magnetic remanence and micro-XANES (microscopic X-ray absorption near-edge structure) measurements identified clusters of superparamagnetic material [100\u2013103], consisting of magnetite (Fe(II)Fe(III)2O4) and maghemite (Fe(III)2O3) [104].",
              "Similar structures were also found in two species of migratory passerines and domestic chickens [104] so that they seemed to be a general feature of birds.",
              "Flei\u00dfner and colleagues [105,106] described specific subcellular structures of magnetite and maghemite in the dendrites of the ophthalmic branch, V1, of the trigeminal nerve.",
              "A theoretical analysis ascertained that the described structures could indeed provide the required magnetic information [107], while another analysis was not so sure [108].",
              "The location of magnetoreceptors in the skin of the upper beak was in agreement with the observation that anaesthesia of the skin of the upper beak with a local anaesthetic suppressed the effect of the pulse [109].",
              "Also, displaced homing pigeons with their beak anaesthetized were no longer confused in a strong magnetic anomaly;",
              "they left the site more rapidly, probably orienting by non-magnetic cues [110].",
              "Another phenomenon associated with magnetoreceptors in the upper beak is a certain behaviour that occurs under unnatural light conditions where the normal inclination compass appears to be disrupted, such as total darkness, intense near-monochromatic light, or when yellow light is added to short-wavelength light.",
              "In these situations, migratory birds show so-called \u2018fixed direction responses\u2019 (figure 1e), that is, they prefer directions that are different from their normal migratory direction, do not reverse between autumn and spring and turned out to be polar responses to the magnetic field (figure 1f).",
              "Anaesthesia of the skin of the upper beak abolished these responses and led to disoriented behaviour (figure 1h).",
              "Hence the \u2018fixed direction responses\u2019 were attributed to the magnetite-based receptors located there;",

              "However, in 2010, Keays and colleagues [112] declared the iron-containing cells in the beak described by Flei\u00dfner and colleagues [105,106] to be macrophages.",
              "Also, in contrast to the authors mentioned above, they failed to find magnetite in the upper beak;",
              "yet, they used the spinning field method [113], which works well for single domains, but not for superparamagnetic particles.",
              "The disruptive effect of anaesthetizing the skin of the upper beak was also questioned, as a recent study seemed to show that, in spite of anaesthesia, changing magnetic fields led to magnetically induced activity in parts of the trigeminal brainstem [114].",

              "The effect of the spray, according to the product information sheet, lasts only 15\u201320 min, whereas the magnetic treatment was applied for 90 min.",
              "And the applied stimuli were irregularly changing and in part unnaturally strong, up to more than twice the intensity of the local geomagnetic field, while all the other studies with the anaesthetic took place in the natural geomagnetic field.",
              "Engels and colleagues [114] assume that the previous observed effect of local anaesthesia was unspecific.",
              "This is highly unlikely, however, because the treatment had no effect when birds could use their inclination compass (figure 1d;",

              "The observation that magnetic stimuli had been found to be transmitted by the ophthalmic nerve (see below) suggests that the receptors lie in the area innervated by this nerve, and here the region of the upper beak, where superparamagnetic magnetite had been described, seemed a likely candidate.",
              "Also the behavioural findings with the local anaesthesia supported receptors in that location.",
              "But although a recent study again searched very intensively in that area for potential magnetite-based receptors, it failed to identify any structure that would qualify [114].",
              "In the mid-1980s, electrophysiological studies revealed responses to changes in the magnetic field recorded from the ophthalmic nerve of a passerine migrant, with about 15\u201320% of the spontaneously active units responding [122,123].",
              "These responses continued when the direction of the magnetic field was held constant, indicating that the information concerned magnetic intensity [124].",
              "Blocking the trigeminal nerve resulted in behavioural responses that indicate the transmission of magnetic intensity as navigational information.",

              "Later studies using immediate gene expression markers, ZENK, also revealed activity induced by magnetic stimuli in the trigeminal brainstem complex of passerine species and pigeons, in particular in the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus in the ascending tract and in the spinal trigeminal sensory nuclei [68,72,137].",
              "This is in agreement with the behavioural data of blocking the trigeminal nerve mentioned above.",
              "A study using cFos found magnetically induced activity in several parts of the brain of pigeons, among them the posterior vestibular nuclei, dorsal thalamus, hippocampus and the hyperpallium, which in part was attributed to receptors in the lagena, since the activity was reduced when the lagena was lesioned [138].",
              "Electrophysiological recordings from single units in the vestibular nuclei produced responses to direction, intensity and polarity of the magnetic field [139].",
              "The authors speculate that this may be the neural basis for a magnetic sense for navigation;",
              "yet a behavioural response to the magnetic field associated with the inner ear or the stato-acoustic nerve remains unknown.",
              "At present, the findings indicate that birds sense magnetic directions by radical pair processes in the eye, with the information mediated by the optic nerve, and probably magnetic intensity as a component of the navigational map by magnetite-based receptors in the region innervated by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve.",
              "A possible role of magnetite particles in the inner ear is unclear.",
              "Despite many successful studies in the last two decades, there are still a number of questions open, and there are several contradicting findings that have to be resolved.",
              "The primary processes of detecting directions\u2014if they follow the radical pair model\u2014appear to be largely understood, but how and where this information is transmitted and finally processed is still open.",
              "The sensing of a magnetic \u2018map\u2019 component is characterized by the striking discrepancy between the transmission of magnetic information in the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve being well documented by electrophysiology, neuronal activity markers and behavioural data, and the fact that any receptive structures in the area innervated by this nerve could not yet be securely identified.",
              "The magnetic stimuli used to identify structures processing magnetic information are not entirely unproblematic, because they have to be completely unnatural.",
              "They normally include rapid changes in direction as well as in magnetic intensity at an order of magnitude that never occurs in nature.",

              "We can only hope that in spite of the highly unnatural stimuli used the observed responses reflect the sensory apparatus realistically.",
              "We are only just beginning to understand the processing of magnetic information in the brain.",

              "Foraging skills develop over generations in the wild Foraging skills develop over generations in the wild Herein lies the heart of the proposed cryptochrome-based magnetosensor: the relative amounts of time spent in the singlet and triplet states and the yield of reaction products are directly manipulated by the direction of Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "The interaction between a single ErCRY4 molecule and the field is, on its own, at least one million times too weak to create the radicals and influence their stability2, but the energy required is provided by the photon absorbed by FAD.",
              "However, for this to work at all, the radical pair must be sufficiently magnetically sensitive, and the reaction product must exist for long enough and have a sufficiently high yield to realistically act as a sensory signalling substance.",
              "In a tour de force of biophysical chemistry, Xu and colleagues used a wide range of techniques, such as spectroscopic methods and molecular-dynamics simulations, to show that all of these conditions are satisfied by ErCRY4, at least in vitro.",
              "Not only does ErCRY4 have a much higher magnetic sensitivity than do CRY4 proteins in non-migratory pigeons and chickens, but site-specific mutations of amino-acid residues in ErCRY4 also reveal that its TrpD is probably responsible for generating high and long-lasting (of greater-than-millisecond duration) yields of reaction products that would be needed for magnetosensory signalling.",
              "Although the evidence provided by Xu and colleagues is not definitive proof that ErCRY4 is the elusive magnetoreceptor in vivo, the authors have brought us ever closer to solving this abiding mystery of sensory biology.",

              "It means that for the so-called \u2018light-dependent magnetoreception\u2019, in the strict sense, light is not needed for the receptive process itself\u2014this appears to run also in the dark.",

              "All cryptochromes appear to undergo the same redox cycle [9,19] (figure 1): in the course of photo-reduction and the following light-independent re-oxidation, radical pairs are generated, and these radical pairs react with the magnetic field [1].",
              "In most cases, however, any effect of the ambient (geo)magnetic field is irrelevant for the biological function of the cryptochromes, as they signal the presence and amount of light and entrain the circadian clock [9].",
              "When cryptochromes are controlling biological processes like, for example, hypocotyl growth and flowering in plants, the reactions during photo-reduction of FADox by blue light to the semiquinone FADH\u2022 are considered to be crucial (e.",

              "This is clearly not the case when magnetic directions are detected by birds [12,14,17,27]: here, blue and green light act synergistically, both causing the further photo-reduction of the semiquinone to the fully reduced FADH\u2013, which leads to the formation of the critical radical pair during re-oxidations.",
              "Many theoretical and experimental models of a cryptochrome-based magnetic compass in birds, analogous to the signalling mechanisms of cryptochrome considered in plants, discuss the radical pair FADH\u2022/Trp\u2022 generated during photo-reduction as being the one mediating magnetic directions (e.",

              "The involvement of a recently discovered TrpH\u2022 radical with a life time of up to 50 \u03bcs [35] seems highly unlikely, because the time required for magnetoreception clearly exceeds 100 ms. The specific processes involved in re-oxidation are still poorly understood and require further analysis.",
              "Sensing magnetic directions thus seems to be based on chemical properties that are common to all cryptochromes [9] (figure 1), yet in this case, the radical pair generated during re-oxidation appears to be crucial.",
              "A reason for relying on this radical pair could lie in the different nature of the task: instead of signalling the presence of light [9,20,29], cryptochrome has to provide information on directions.",
              "In view of the indications that the radical pair generated during re-oxidation could make the better magnetic sensor, it would not be surprising that natural selection had shaped the mechanism in a way that it makes use of the radical pair that is most suitable to solve the required task [6,21].",
              "Together with the location of Cry1a probably in ordered arrays at the discs in the outer segment of the UV/violet cone photoreceptors that are distributed all across the avian retina [16], this could represent a special adaptation to the birds' need for an efficient magnetic compass.",

              "It is known that external magnetic fields can influence the interconversion between these different spin states, which in turn could influence the reactivity of a particular molecule [33,34].",

              "According to the favored model, a long-lived radical pair is formed when light induces the transfer of electrons to this FAD moiety along a triad of tryptophan residues in the Cry molecule (Fig 2B) [31,36].",
              "Genetic studies in invertebrates have supported the role of Cry in magnetically sensitive behavior.",
              "For instance, Fedele and colleagues have shown that low frequency electromagnetic fields (300 \u03bcT, 50 Hz) shortened the circadian period and induced hyperactive behavior in Drosophila, which is abolished in the absence of Cry [37].",
              "Although these results indicate that Cry is required for magnetic fields to influence certain behaviors in flies, it is questionable whether these animals possess a true magnetic sense analogous to migratory birds.",
              "Furthermore, given that Crys are expressed in all major organs in birds and are known to play a role in regulating circadian phenotypes in vertebrates, it is currently unclear how specificity would arise with respect to magnetic information and how it would be distinguished from a circadian input [38,39].",
              "Moreover, we still don't know which cells are associated with a light-dependent chemical compass.",

              "While we have good reason to believe a radical-pair based magnetic sense exists, it is apparent that we still understand little with respect to the receptive cells, the molecules, and the downstream signaling cascade.",
              "Finally, the detection of magnetic fields might rely on accessory structures that convert the magnetic field into another stimulus.",
              "For instance, terrestrial vertebrates do not detect gravity directly, but rather rely on a bed of calcium carbonate otoliths which apply a force on a population of sensory hair cells [40]Similarly, the auditory system exploits a complex array of accessory structures that convert airborne sound pressure waves into gating spring tension on mechanosensitive ion channels in hair cells [41] As magnetism and electricity are inseparable, it is conceivable that a secondary structure might convert information about the Earth's magnetic field into an electric stimulus.",
              "This proposition, which reflects Faraday\u2019s law of electromagnetic induction, predicts that movement of an animal in a fixed magnetic field would induce an electromotive force in a conductor [42].",

              "However, it is conceivable that electromagnetic induction may also occur within the endolymph of the semicircular canals of birds, with hair cells on the periphery of the cupula functioning as electroreceptors [46] (Fig 2C).",
              "If a pigeon were to rotate its head around an axis in the plane of a semicircular canal, there will be no displacement of the endolymph but electromagnetic induction could occur.",
              "Conversely, rotation around an axis perpendicular to the plane of the semicircular canal would induce fluid flow and provide information with respect to angular momentum, but would not induce electromagnetic induction [46].",

              "It is conceivable that the sensitivity of such a magnetoreceptor could be tuned by manipulating the concentration of cations within the endolymph, thereby altering its conductivity.",
              "We have recently discovered an iron-rich organelle, the \"cuticulosome,\" which resides apically in avian hair cells and is composed primarily of ferritin nanoparticles [47].",
              "Intriguingly, this structure is associated structurally and molecularly with vesicular trafficking, prompting us to propose that it may regulate the concentration of iron within inner ear compartments.",
              "Although magnetosensation by electromagnetic induction was proposed as early as 1882 by the Frenchman Camille Viguier, there is limited behavioral, anatomical, physiological, or experimental data that directly supports it [48].",
              "Perhaps of most relevance is the work of Dickman and colleagues who have reported that cells within the vestibular nuclei of pigeons are responsive to magnetic stimuli of a particular inclination, polarity, and intensity [49,50].",
              "Given these data and the astonishing electrosensitivity of multiple different species on the planet, in our opinion, electromagnetic induction is an idea that deserves a closer look [51,52] (Box 2).",
              "It is astonishing that 50 years have passed since the seminal behavioral experiments of Wiltschko and colleagues, and still our mechanistic understanding of this sense remains rudimentary.",
              "Why is this the case?",
              "Firstly, it has to be acknowledged that in contrast to many other fields in sensory biology, experimental approaches in magnetoreception cannot be based on instinctive concepts.",
              "Humans lack (at the very least) an active perception of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "This complicates the design of experiments that aim to unravel specific aspects of the sensory modality, and compromises an experimenter's ability to detect obvious artifacts.",
              "Secondly, electrophysiological methods, which are widely used in sensory neurobiology, have limited utility with respect to the magnetic sense.",
              "The application of magnetic stimuli risks electromagnetic induction in a recording electrode, which makes the interpretation of electrophysiological data challenging.",
              "Thirdly, magnetic fields can freely penetrate biological tissue, and therefore magnetoreceptive systems could be located in any tissue in an animal\u2019s body, literally from head to toe [18]For those investigators exploring the magnetite-based hypothesis, this fact makes finding 20 nm-sized crystals a very challenging task [25].",
              "Fourthly, the field has not focused on a single \"model\" system that can be genetically modified with ease, permitting investigators to interrogate whether a particular molecule or cell type is involved in the magnetic sense.",
              "This reflects the fact that those animals that are best at detecting magnetic fields are phylogenetically diverse, migratory, and often difficult to maintain in a laboratory setting.",
              "Fifthly, whether they rely on conditional or instinctive readouts, the establishment of behavioral paradigms that assess magnetoreception are notoriously difficult.",
              "Anything from nT strength RF interference to the chosen perfume of experimenters can render an assay useless [35,53].",
              "Sixthly, there has been a major issue with independent replication in the field.",
              "This reflects the difficulty of the problem but also the importance of conducting all experiments in a controlled blinded fashion that are interpreted critically.",
              "Finally, it cannot be assumed that magnetoreception relies on a single receptor, or indeed a single mechanism.",
              "At conferences, Cry often faces magnetite on the scientific battlefield, but this conflict is illusionary.",
              "Selective pressure in diverse environments, from the oceans to the air, may have facilitated the evolution of a multiplicity of magnetoreceptors.",
              "This mystery might therefore have more than one solution.",
              "Let\u2019s imagine a laboratory situation in which a team of researchers aims to understand how vertebrates detect and use magnetic information.",
              "For such an endeavor to be successful, we think 2 things are imperative: (1) an interdisciplinary approach, and (2) a model system with a reliable magnetoreceptive assay that is amenable to genetic modification.",
              "If ever a scientific problem demanded the efforts of multiple disciplines, it is magnetoreception.",
              "It requires a knowledge of the physical sciences, increasingly at a quantal level, to understand the nature of the stimulus and appreciate how it can interact with biological matter.",
              "Expertise in the behavioral sciences is required to establish informative assays that exclude other sensory stimuli and enable investigators to ascertain what component of the magnetic field is influential.",
              "A detailed characterization of the neuroanatomical circuits is imperative if we are to understand where magnetic information is processed in the central nervous system.",
              "This will need to be coupled to physiological methods, such as calcium imaging, if we are to appreciate how this information is encoded and subsequently integrated with other sensory cues that are vital for navigation.",
              "The identification of the primary sensory cells, which has proved to be particularly difficult, will need a broad range of techniques including elemental analysis, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, live-cell imaging, and ablation studies.",
              "Whether the underlying mechanism relies on magnetite, light, or electromagnetic induction, it is likely that the problem will then coalesce around a particular intracellular signaling pathway or molecule.",
              "At this point, the critical question will be whether a particular protein is necessary and/or sufficient for magnetoreception.",
              "To establish an iron-clad causal relationship between a molecule and a behavioral output, genetic loss (or gain) of function studies will be necessary.",
              "With the advent of the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9) genome editing system, this is now a feasible option in almost any species that can be bred in captivity [54].",
              "Although the generation of germline genetic perturbations may still be time consuming due to the reproductive cycle of a particular species, the creation of somatic genetic perturbations by in ovo or in utero electroporation is realistic in the short term [55].",

              "The identity of the biological tissue responsible for sensing the field\u2019s direction, and the sensory mechanism that underpins this type of navigation, have remained an enigma.",
              "In migratory birds, the main contenders are magnetically sensitive proteins called cryptochromes, which are located in the retina2.",
              "However, proof has been lacking that these proteins truly possess the magnetic sensitivity and physical properties needed to detect Earth\u2019s extremely weak magnetic field.",
              "Writing in Nature, Xu et al.",
              "3 provide this proof in vitro, bringing us tantalizingly close to solving the mystery of magnetoreception.",
              "Read the paper: Magnetic sensitivity of cryptochrome 4 from a migratory songbird Read the paper: Magnetic sensitivity of cryptochrome 4 from a migratory songbird There are currently two main hypotheses for how animals sense Earth\u2019s magnetic field1,4 (as well as some alternative hypotheses put forward in the past few years5,6).",
              "One proposes that, as an animal changes direction, crystals of the oxidized-iron compound magnetite (Fe3O4), located in its body and aligned with the field, exert a rotational force \u2014 called torque \u2014 on mechanoreceptors with which they are in physical contact.",
              "This might thereby signal changes in body alignment through the opening and closing of mechanoreceptor ion channels.",
              "The other main hypothesis (Fig.",
              "1) proposes that, when cryptochrome proteins absorb photons of light and become \u2018photoexcited\u2019, they form magnetically sensitive chemical intermediates known as radical pairs.",
              "Variations in the yield of their reaction product (the form of the cryptochrome that contains a radical molecule called FADH\u2022) are thought to signal the animal\u2019s direction with respect to Earth\u2019s magnetic field7,8.",
              "These two proposed mechanisms are not mutually exclusive6 \u2014 indeed, migratory birds might possess both, using magnetite for their \u2018magnetic-map\u2019 sense (the ability to sense magnetic characteristics associated with a given location on Earth\u2019s surface) and cryptochromes for their magnetic-compass sense (which offers the animal a way to sense its direction relative to magnetic north)1,2.",

              "Photoreceptor cells in the retina of the migratory European robin Erithacus rubecula contain a protein called ErCRY4, which binds to the molecule FAD.",

              "When ErCRY4\u2013FAD absorbs a photon of blue light, reactive molecules called radical pairs arise.",
              "These form through interactions between FAD and a tryptophan (Trp) amino-acid residue of ErCRY4, which supplies an electron.",
              "The radical pair is sensitive to Earth\u2019s magnetic field and oscillates rapidly between a singlet and a triplet state (which have different electron \u2018spin\u2019 states as indicated by the white arrows).",
              "The radical pair can generate ErCRY4\u2013FADH\u2022 (which is a long-lived reaction product hypothesized to trigger a sensory signalling cascade).",
              "Alternatively, ErCRY4 might return to its original form (ErCRY4\u2013FAD).",
              "Which outcome occurs is influenced by the state of the radical pair.",
              "If the bird changes direction, the change in the relative orientation of the magnetic field drives a shift in the proportions of the singlet and triplet states, potentially altering the yield of ErCRY4\u2013FADH\u2022.",

              "3 present data indicating that ErCRY4 fulfils the physical requirements needed for this magnetosensing mechanism.",

              "Cryptochromes bind non-covalently to a molecule called a chromophore, such as FAD, which absorbs photons of blue light when in its fully oxidized state.",
              "In animals, cryptochrome proteins termed CRY1 and CRY2 are involved in the regulation of daily (circadian) rhythms9, and their expression levels in tissue typically cycle over the course of 24 hours.",
              "By contrast, the cryptochrome CRY4 lacks such signs of circadian cycling, suggesting that it has a different biological role, possibly that of magnetoreception10,11.",
              "CRY4 is found only in birds, fishes and amphibians, which are types of animal with well-documented magnetically guided behaviours.",
              "CRY4 has therefore emerged as the leading candidate for enabling cryptochrome-based magnetoreception in vertebrates.",
              "Previous analysis10 of chickens (Gallus gallus) and migratory European robins (Erithacus rubecula) indicates that CRY4 is located in the outer segments of two types of photoreceptor cell in the retina \u2014 double cones and long-wavelength single cones.",
              "This is an ideal location for receiving the light that would excite cryptochromes and thus aid magnetic sensing.",
              "Further evidence consistent with a possible role for CRY4 in magnetoreception is that its expression level in the robin retina rises as the migratory season approaches, whereas its level remains permanently low in non-migratory chickens10.",
              "A bird\u2019s migration decoded A bird\u2019s migration decoded Xu and colleagues\u2019 major advance is the demonstration that the version of CRY4 (dubbed ErCRY4) in the migratory European robin has a crucial property needed to sense Earth\u2019s magnetic field: the ability to form radical pairs that have high magnetic sensitivity.",
              "Radical pairs arise when the FAD bound to ErCRY4 is reduced (gains an electron) in the presence of light.",
              "Radicals contain an odd number of electrons, and a radical pair consists of two radicals that have been created simultaneously, usually by a chemical reaction.",
              "In ErCRY4, the radicals\u2019 odd electrons are supplied through sequential electron-hopping along a chain of three or four tryptophan amino-acid residues (termed TrpA to TrpD) that are located between FAD and the surface of the cryptochrome.",
              "In the case of FAD, the odd electron that arises from reduction in the presence of light makes the radicals intrinsically magnetic.",
              "This is because electrons behave as microscopic magnets, with a property that physicists call spin (typically symbolized by an arrow \u2191).",
              "In a molecule with an even number of electrons, the spins of each electron pair exactly cancel each other out, rendering the molecule non-magnetic.",
              "If the spins of the odd electrons in each of the two radicals in a radical pair are antiparallel (\u2193\u2191), the radical pair is said to occupy a singlet state, but when they are parallel (\u2191\u2191), the pair occupies a triplet state.",
              "When cryptochrome becomes photoexcited, it always forms a radical pair in the singlet state, but it doesn\u2019t stay that way for long.",
              "Owing to a quirk of quantum mechanics, the radical pair rapidly converts to the triplet state, and then continues to bounce between these two states millions of times per second.",
              "Each of these two states can produce a reaction product \u2014 the form of CRY4 that contains the radical FADH\u2022, which is the proposed signalling molecule for magnetoreception (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "But the singlet state can also revert to its oxidized, non-excited ground state, thereby reducing its relative contribution to the generation of reaction products.",
              "Thus, if the interconversion of the singlet and triplet states can be manipulated to change the relative amounts of time spent in each of the two states, so too can the yield of the reaction products be manipulated, because a greater fraction of time in the triplet state leads to a higher yield of reaction products.",
              "Foraging skills develop over generations in the wild Foraging skills develop over generations in the wild Herein lies the heart of the proposed cryptochrome-based magnetosensor: the relative amounts of time spent in the singlet and triplet states and the yield of reaction products are directly manipulated by the direction of Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "The interaction between a single ErCRY4 molecule and the field is, on its own, at least one million times too weak to create the radicals and influence their stability2, but the energy required is provided by the photon absorbed by FAD.",
              "However, for this to work at all, the radical pair must be sufficiently magnetically sensitive, and the reaction product must exist for long enough and have a sufficiently high yield to realistically act as a sensory signalling substance.",
              "In a tour de force of biophysical chemistry, Xu and colleagues used a wide range of techniques, such as spectroscopic methods and molecular-dynamics simulations, to show that all of these conditions are satisfied by ErCRY4, at least in vitro.",
              "Not only does ErCRY4 have a much higher magnetic sensitivity than do CRY4 proteins in non-migratory pigeons and chickens, but site-specific mutations of amino-acid residues in ErCRY4 also reveal that its TrpD is probably responsible for generating high and long-lasting (of greater-than-millisecond duration) yields of reaction products that would be needed for magnetosensory signalling.",
              "Although the evidence provided by Xu and colleagues is not definitive proof that ErCRY4 is the elusive magnetoreceptor in vivo, the authors have brought us ever closer to solving this abiding mystery of sensory biology.",

              "The direction of the magnetic field appears to be sensed via radical pair processes in the eyes, with the crucial radical pairs formed by cryptochrome.",
              "It is transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain, where parts of the visual system seem to process the respective information.",

              "the information is transmitted by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve to the trigeminal ganglion and the trigeminal brainstem nuclei.",
              "Yet in spite of considerable progress in recent years, many details are still unclear, among them details of the radical pair processes and their transformation into a nervous signal, the precise location of the magnetite-based receptors and the centres in the brain where magnetic information is combined with other navigational information for the navigational processes.",
              "The magnetic field of the Earth provides animals that can sense it with navigational information: the vector indicates directions, and magnetic intensity and inclination, which decreases from the magnetic poles to the magnetic equator, and possibly also magnetic declination could be used as components of the navigational \u2018map\u2019.",
              "Birds make use of the geomagnetic field in two ways: the vector provides them with a compass, and other parameters, probably magnetic intensity, appear to be an important component in the navigational \u2018map\u2019 for long-distance navigation.",
              "How birds sense these parameters is not yet completely understood, although numerous aspects of the receptive processes have been described in recent years.",

              "The avian magnetic compass seems to measure directions with an accuracy of about 3\u00b0 in the vertical [13] and at least 5\u00b0 in the horizontal [14].",
              "These properties of the avian magnetic compass caused Ritz and colleagues [15] to propose the radical pair model: upon absorption of a photon, radical pairs are formed, either as singlets with antiparallel spin or as triplets with parallel spin.",
              "The ratio between the two states depends on the orientation of the radical pair in the magnetic field and can thus mediate magnetic directions.",
              "The eye was suggested as the site of the receptive processes, because here light is available and, because of its more or less round form, receptors, aligned perpendicularly to its surface in ordered arrays, are covering all spatial directions.",
              "This would lead to a characteristic activation pattern on the retina that is centrally symmetric to the vector of the magnetic field;",
              "it can be spatially interpreted and thus indicate magnetic directions.",
              "As a receptor molecule, the authors suggested cryptochrome, a flavoprotein, because this is the only protein known in animals where absorption of photons leads to the formation of radical pairs [15,16].",
              "This model is in agreement with the known characteristics of the avian magnetic compass.",
              "Because the singlet/triplet ratio depends on the course of the field lines, but not on their polarity, it results in an inclination compass, as found in birds.",
              "The \u2018functional window\u2019 and its flexibility can also be explained: the activation pattern also depends on magnetic intensity;",
              "birds that experience a sudden change in intensity are faced with a novel pattern which might be confusing at first.",
              "The pattern retains its central symmetry to the magnetic vector, however, so that birds can learn to interpret it after a while.",

              "g. [17,18]) and is thus in agreement with the behavioural findings on the light dependency of compass orientation in birds (see also [19]).",

              "Subjecting birds to radiofrequency fields, a diagnostic tool for radical pair processes [20], results in disorientation (figure 1c).",
              "This applies to migrants during migratory orientation [21\u201324] as well as to directionally trained non-migrants such as Domestic Chickens [25] and Zebra Finches [26].",
              "The Larmor frequency, that is, the frequency of the electron, proved most effective and disrupts orientation at very low intensities [27];",
              "this has been independently confirmed by [23,28].",
              "Reports of the opposite [24] are inconclusive because of methodological short-comings (use of metallic test cages that not only shield but also reflect and distort radiofrequency fields so that the conditions become undefined).",
              "The chromophore of cryptochrome is flavin (FAD), which undergoes a redox cycle: photon absorption reduces FAD to the semiquinone FADH\u00b0, forming a first radical pair with tryptophan.",
              "In a next step, FADH\u00b0 can be further photo-reduced to the fully reduced form FADH\u2212, which is then re-oxidized independently of light.",

              "g. [29]), the second radical pair formed during re-oxidation is the one crucial for avian magnetoreception.",

              "Mo\u0308ller and colleagues [39] identified two splice products of the Cry1 gene, Cry1a and Cry1b, with different C-termini.",
              "In an immuno-histochemical study using a specific antiserum, Nie\u00dfner and colleagues [40] located Cry1a in the UVS/VS (SWS1) cones (ultraviolet/violet cones) in chickens and robins, with immuno-electron microscopy showing it positioned at the discs in the outer segment together with UV-opsin.",
              "An in vivo study showed that, in contrast to what Kutta and colleagues [41] assume, it is directly activated by light of the wavelengths that are absorbed by flavin [19].",
              "The UVS/VS cones have clear oil droplets that allow all wavelengths of light to pass [42];",
              "they are present all across the retina so that they can give rise to the activation pattern proposed by Ritz and colleagues [15] and mediate magnetic directions.",
              "Cry1b was located by immuno-histochemistry in the cytosol of ganglion cells, displaced ganglion cells and also in the inner segments of the photoreceptors [43\u201345], free as well as bound to membranes.",
              "In night-migrating birds, its expression varies with season and was much stronger during the migratory season when the birds were active during the night [45,46].",
              "A role in magnetoreception has been suggested [44], but, because the use of a magnetic compass is also shared by non-migrants and hence appears to be a general ability of birds, the seasonal changes seems to suggest another role, possibly involving the shift from diurnal activity to nocturnal Zugunruhe.",
              "Cryptochrome 2 was described by Bailey and colleagues [47], who identified it by its mRNA in a number of organs, among them the pineal and, in the eyes, in the photoreceptors and ganglion cells (see also [38]).",
              "It includes a sequence that suggests its location in the cell nucleus [39,43], which points to a possible role as a clock protein (e.",
              "g. [48]).",
              "Cryptochrome 4 was described in avian eyes by Watari and colleagues [49] using mRNA expression and immuno-histochemistry.",
              "With specific antisera, Gu\u0308nther and colleagues [50] could narrow down the location of Cry4 to the outer segments of the LWS (longwave-sensitive) single cones and of the double cones.",
              "It has recently been speculated that Cry4 may be involved in magnetoreception (e.",
              "g. [50,51]).",
              "In particular the location within the double cones prompted the suggestion of such a role of Cry4, because here the input of two adjacent receptors with the magneto-receptive molecules oriented in different directions could be compared to overcome problems by different light intensities and polarization [50,52].",
              "However, the principal cone is associated with an oil droplet that acts as a cut-off filter absorbing short wavelengths [42] and thus most of the wavelengths needed for cryptochrome photo-reduction.",
              "This, together with the gap junctions between the two cones, would interfere with a comparison.",
              "Hence such a role of Cry4 in the double cones in magnetoreception seems problematic.",
              "The Cry4 in the LWS single cones seems even less suitable for magnetoreception, because these cones contain a red oil droplet that transmits only long wavelengths that are not absorbed by cryptochrome.",
              "Qin and colleagues [53], based on genome-wide screenings, suggested an iron\u2013sulfur protein polymer, MagR, with an intrinsic magnetic moment, in combination with Cry4, as a magnetic sensor that combines ferrimagnetic and light-dependent features.",
              "This complex was found by antibodies to be most highly expressed in the retinal ganglion cell layer, and the inner and outer nuclear layer.",
              "Yet the assumptions about the magnetic moment\u2014it appears to be much weaker than assumed\u2014and the immuno-histological studies have been criticized (see [54]), and it is still unclear whether such a combined sensor is involved in magnetoreception.",
              "Altogether, the presently available evidence indicates Cry1a as the most likely receptor molecule for sensing directions.",
              "The observation that its gene expression shows a diurnal rhythm [51] does not speak against such a role, because it only indicates a rhythmic production in the inner segment, from where it has to be transported into the outer segment\u2014a parallel case to vision where the production of opsins also shows a diurnal pattern (e.",
              "g. [55,56]).",
              "Any activation pattern caused by the magnetic field in the retina must be transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain to be processed (see [57,58]).",
              "How singlet/triplet ratios could be transformed into a sensory signal for transmission to the brain is not yet known.",
              "Behavioural tests showed that, in adult birds, the magnetic compass is lateralized in favour of the right eye, which means that the respective information is processed predominantly in the left hemisphere of the brain [59\u201362].",
              "Migrants could use both eyes during their first autumn migration [63\u201365];",
              "the lateralization was found to develop between the first autumn and the first spring migration [65].",
              "In the beginning, it proved rather flexible, as it could be undone by covering the right eye for 11\u20442 h ([66];",
              "see also [67], where that eye was covered for more than 1 h before the tests started).",
              "This suggests that the lateralization is initially caused by asymmetric inhibitory interactions between the two hemispheres;",
              "when the right eye was covered short-term synaptic plasticity returned the ability of the left eye and the right hemisphere to process magnetic directional information.",
              "Yet the lateralization in favour of the right eye returned once the right eye could be used again [66].",
              "The centres in the brain where magnetic directional information is processed are still not entirely clear.",
              "Most probable candidates are areas associated with the visual system, yet it is still open whether the processing of magnetic information is an integrated part of vision or whether it is processed more or less independently as a sense of its own.",
              "The observation that covering the right eye could remove the lateralization only if meaningful magnetic information was available\u2014light alone proved insufficient [66]\u2014could be interpreted as suggesting the latter.",
              "An involvement of the thalamofugal pathway is suggested (e.",
              "g. [58,67,68]).",
              "Electrophysiological responses to changes in magnetic directions were recorded from direction-sensitive cells in the nucleus of the basal optic root (nBOR), a part of the accessary optic system, and from the stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale of the tectum opticum [69,70].",
              "Yet recent studies failed to find magnetic field-induced activity in the tectum opticum [71,72].",
              "Using neural activity markers, a part of the Wulst, cluster N, was identified as an area with considerable neural activity during migratory behaviour in night-migrating passerines when they had to rely on their magnetic compass [73].",
              "A follow-up study showed activity in cluster N during nocturnal activity, but not during the day, with a certain lateralization in favour of the right hemisphere.",
              "This was discussed in connection with night vision, but also as possibly being associated with processing magnetic directional information, although a difference in neuronal activity between a near-zero magnetic field and a changing magnetic field could not be observed [74].",
              "By neuronal tracing, cluster N was found to be connected with the retinal neurons via the visual thalamus by the thalamofugal pathway [58].",
              "Lesioning cluster N led to disorientation [75].",
              "However, when a day- and night-migrating passerine species, the Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis, was tested, cluster N did not show enhanced activity during daytime migration [75], so that it remains open whether cluster N is indeed involved in magnetoreception or whether it controls other aspects of nocturnal migratory activity (see [72,74]).",
              "Studies comparing the activity of neuronal markers in birds subjected to a static magnetic field and in birds subjected to a rotating magnetic field indicated a certain increase in a number of brain areas, with the most pronounced one in the dorsomedial rostral hippocampus and some effect in a part of the hyperpallium [76].",
              "Altogether, there are still a number of open questions about how a sensory signal is formed by the radical pair process, how the magnetic signal is separated from the visual information (see [77] for discussion) and about the brain areas where magnetic directional information is processed.",
              "Because of their spatial distribution, magnetic intensity, declination and inclination could serve as components of the navigational \u2018map\u2019.",
              "Here, rather small differences must be recorded.",
              "The response of homing pigeons to natural fluctuations of the geomagnetic field suggests a sensitivity in the range of about 20 nT (nanotesla) [78].",
              "To use declination and inclination, birds would have to record minute angular differences;",
              "additionally, these parameters require non-magnetic reference directions\u2014true (astronomical) North and gravity, respectively\u2014which would complicate their use.",

              "An indicator for the involvement of magnetic material is the response to treatments with a strong magnetic pulse\u2014strong enough to alter the magnetization of single-domain magnetite.",
              "Caged passerine migrants treated with a brief 0.",
              "5 T pulse showed a marked deviation from their migratory direction [88,89], with the size and the direction of this deflection depending on how the pulse was applied [90,91].",
              "This suggests that the pulse did not silence the putative receptors altogether, but caused them to provide the birds with false information.",
              "The response to the pulse was restricted to experienced migrants that navigate towards an already familiar goal, whereas young birds on their first migration that fly innate courses were not affected [92].",
              "This finding and the observation that homing pigeons treated with such a pulse deviated from untreated controls at some (but not all) sites in greater distances from home [93,94] indicate that the pulse affects a receptor that provides birds with a magnetic component of the navigational \u2018map\u2019 (see also [95]).",
              "Apparently, the pulse changes the course to be pursued, while the magnetic inclination compass remains unaffected [92,96].",
              "This is also supported by later studies where migrants were subjected to magnetically simulated displacements (see below).",
              "The effect of the pulse on the navigational system of migrants is short-lived, however: the deflection lasted only about 2\u20133 days;",
              "after this, the birds underwent a phase of disorientation, and about 10 days after the pulse treatment and later they again headed in their normal migratory direction [88].",
              "These observations with caged migrants have a parallel in free-flying migrants: migrating birds caught at a stop-over site were treated with a pulse, released, and their departure directions were radio-tracked.",
              "Here, too, young birds on their first migration proved unaffected;",
              "adult migrants that departed within 10 days after pulse treatment were random, those that departed after 10 days were oriented in their normal migratory direction [97].",
              "The relative short duration of the pulse effect\u2014recovery of normal migratory orientation within about 10 days\u2014could be an indication for the size of the magnetite particles involved.",
              "If the magnetization of single-domain particles was altered by the pulse, a new magnetization would be just as stable as the original one, and a complete exchange of the magnetic particles within a time span of just 10 days seems rather unlikely.",
              "Clusters of superparamagnetic particles, on the other hand, would be disrupted by the pulse, but could later rearrange themselves [98].",

              "Electron-optical, magnetic remanence and micro-XANES (microscopic X-ray absorption near-edge structure) measurements identified clusters of superparamagnetic material [100\u2013103], consisting of magnetite (Fe(II)Fe(III)2O4) and maghemite (Fe(III)2O3) [104].",
              "Similar structures were also found in two species of migratory passerines and domestic chickens [104] so that they seemed to be a general feature of birds.",

              "they left the site more rapidly, probably orienting by non-magnetic cues [110].",
              "Another phenomenon associated with magnetoreceptors in the upper beak is a certain behaviour that occurs under unnatural light conditions where the normal inclination compass appears to be disrupted, such as total darkness, intense near-monochromatic light, or when yellow light is added to short-wavelength light.",
              "In these situations, migratory birds show so-called \u2018fixed direction responses\u2019 (figure 1e), that is, they prefer directions that are different from their normal migratory direction, do not reverse between autumn and spring and turned out to be polar responses to the magnetic field (figure 1f).",
              "Anaesthesia of the skin of the upper beak abolished these responses and led to disoriented behaviour (figure 1h).",
              "Hence the \u2018fixed direction responses\u2019 were attributed to the magnetite-based receptors located there;",

              "Also, in contrast to the authors mentioned above, they failed to find magnetite in the upper beak;",
              "yet, they used the spinning field method [113], which works well for single domains, but not for superparamagnetic particles.",
              "The disruptive effect of anaesthetizing the skin of the upper beak was also questioned, as a recent study seemed to show that, in spite of anaesthesia, changing magnetic fields led to magnetically induced activity in parts of the trigeminal brainstem [114].",

              "And the applied stimuli were irregularly changing and in part unnaturally strong, up to more than twice the intensity of the local geomagnetic field, while all the other studies with the anaesthetic took place in the natural geomagnetic field.",
              "Engels and colleagues [114] assume that the previous observed effect of local anaesthesia was unspecific.",

              "The observation that magnetic stimuli had been found to be transmitted by the ophthalmic nerve (see below) suggests that the receptors lie in the area innervated by this nerve, and here the region of the upper beak, where superparamagnetic magnetite had been described, seemed a likely candidate.",
              "Also the behavioural findings with the local anaesthesia supported receptors in that location.",
              "But although a recent study again searched very intensively in that area for potential magnetite-based receptors, it failed to identify any structure that would qualify [114].",
              "In the mid-1980s, electrophysiological studies revealed responses to changes in the magnetic field recorded from the ophthalmic nerve of a passerine migrant, with about 15\u201320% of the spontaneously active units responding [122,123].",
              "These responses continued when the direction of the magnetic field was held constant, indicating that the information concerned magnetic intensity [124].",
              "Blocking the trigeminal nerve resulted in behavioural responses that indicate the transmission of magnetic intensity as navigational information.",
              "Treating the ophthalmic nerve with an anaesthetic suppressed the effect of the pulse in migrants: the birds continued in their migratory direction [125].",

              "Most interesting are studies where migrants were displaced, either in reality or virtually by simulating the magnetic field conditions of a distant region.",
              "The birds compensated for the displacement and changed their course accordingly [128,129];",
              "they could no longer do so when the trigeminal nerve was sectioned [130,131].",
              "These findings clearly show that the magnetic information transmitted by the trigeminal nerve is used for navigation over longer distances.",

              "Units in the trigeminal ganglion responded in a similar way to those in the trigeminal nerve [136].",
              "Later studies using immediate gene expression markers, ZENK, also revealed activity induced by magnetic stimuli in the trigeminal brainstem complex of passerine species and pigeons, in particular in the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus in the ascending tract and in the spinal trigeminal sensory nuclei [68,72,137].",
              "This is in agreement with the behavioural data of blocking the trigeminal nerve mentioned above.",
              "A study using cFos found magnetically induced activity in several parts of the brain of pigeons, among them the posterior vestibular nuclei, dorsal thalamus, hippocampus and the hyperpallium, which in part was attributed to receptors in the lagena, since the activity was reduced when the lagena was lesioned [138].",
              "Electrophysiological recordings from single units in the vestibular nuclei produced responses to direction, intensity and polarity of the magnetic field [139].",
              "The authors speculate that this may be the neural basis for a magnetic sense for navigation;",
              "yet a behavioural response to the magnetic field associated with the inner ear or the stato-acoustic nerve remains unknown.",
              "At present, the findings indicate that birds sense magnetic directions by radical pair processes in the eye, with the information mediated by the optic nerve, and probably magnetic intensity as a component of the navigational map by magnetite-based receptors in the region innervated by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve.",
              "A possible role of magnetite particles in the inner ear is unclear.",
              "Despite many successful studies in the last two decades, there are still a number of questions open, and there are several contradicting findings that have to be resolved.",
              "The primary processes of detecting directions\u2014if they follow the radical pair model\u2014appear to be largely understood, but how and where this information is transmitted and finally processed is still open.",
              "The sensing of a magnetic \u2018map\u2019 component is characterized by the striking discrepancy between the transmission of magnetic information in the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve being well documented by electrophysiology, neuronal activity markers and behavioural data, and the fact that any receptive structures in the area innervated by this nerve could not yet be securely identified.",
              "The magnetic stimuli used to identify structures processing magnetic information are not entirely unproblematic, because they have to be completely unnatural.",
              "They normally include rapid changes in direction as well as in magnetic intensity at an order of magnitude that never occurs in nature.",
              "The geomagnetic field is more or less stable and never undergoes sudden changes;",
              "temporal and spatial variations, as they are caused by rock magnetization in the ground, daily variations and magnetic storms, are minute.",
              "In contrast to most other sensory systems that evolved to detect changes in the environment, the magnetic compass system is built to extract information from a situation that never changes, and the receptors of the \u2018map\u2019 system must have evolved to detect very small and subtle gradual changes.",
              "We can only hope that in spite of the highly unnatural stimuli used the observed responses reflect the sensory apparatus realistically.",
              "We are only just beginning to understand the processing of magnetic information in the brain.",
              "For directions as well as intensity, a few regions are indicated, but where the more complex processes combining magnetic information with other relevant information for navigation take place is largely unknown, e.",
              "g. where directional information from the magnetic field is combined with directional information from the Sun and the stars, and where the magnetic component of the navigational map is integrated with the other components to allow the birds to determine their whereabouts and the compass course to the desired goal.",

              "Finally, a note of caution: the summary on magnetoreception reported here applies to birds only\u2014in particular, where the compass is concerned, it appears to reflect a special development of the birds.",

              "One is that magnetic fields pass freely through biological tissue.",

              "In addition, magnetoreceptors might be tiny and dispersed throughout a large volume of tissue2, or the transduction process might occur as a set of chemical reactions3, so that there is not necessarily any obvious organ or structure devoted to magnetoreception.",

              "Although some long-distance migrants evidently extract positional information from the general dipole field10,13 shown in (a), fine-scale variations are more complex than the general regional patterns because concentrations of ferromagnetic minerals in the Earth's crust often generate local field anomalies.",
              "Although these variations are typically less than 1% of the total field, their gradients (that is, the variation per distance) can be significantly greater than the gradients due to the main dipole field, and can also be aligned in a different direction.",
              "The larger gradients might be easier for a short-distance migrant or homing animal to detect, but the complexity of local magnetic contours indicates that any navigational strategies that exploit magnetic topography over these smaller spatial scales are likely to be site-specific, difficult to generalize and learned rather than inherited.",

              "For today's humans, this need is usually met through a GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS), which provides users with their geographical position and continuously computes the direction to a goal.",

              "All three mechanisms seem to be capable of detecting at least some elements of the Earth's field that might be used in assessing geographical location.",
              "To detect the inclination of field lines, an animal would presumably need to integrate information from its magnetoreception system with information from a gravity-sensing system.",
              "However, no theoretical barrier seems to preclude detection of magnetic inclination by a receptor system based on any of the mechanisms. By contrast, the different mechanisms are likely to have differing sensitivities to field intensity.",
              "Receptors based on single-domain or superparamagnetic magnetite might be able to detect very small changes in field intensity100, whereas the chemical and induction mechanisms probably cannot3,26.",
              "In the chemical models, the limitation is due to the small effect of field strength on the proposed reactions3,101.",
              "In induction models, difficulties arise because the animal would need to precisely determine both its own velocity and the magnitude of the background (passive) electrical fields in its environment.",
              "So, given the relatively small field changes that an animal using a magnetic map would probably need to detect102,103,104, a map sense based on intensity is unlikely to be mediated by a chemical or induction mechanism.",
              "Concluding remarks Three physically plausible mechanisms have been proposed that might underlie magnetoreception in animals.",
              "Recent advances are consistent with the hypothesis that a magnetic compass based on chemical magnetoreception exists in birds, and candidate magnetite-based receptors, possibly functioning in a magnetic map sense, have now been reported in both birds and fish.",
              "However, these findings should be viewed as tentative.",
              "Despite recent progress, primary magnetoreceptors have not been identified with certainty in any animal, and the mode or modes of transduction for the magnetic sense therefore remain unknown.",
              "Future progress might be expedited by two realizations.",
              "First, although magnetoreception research began with behavioural studies, such studies cannot, by themselves, elucidate transduction processes that occur at or below the cellular level.",
              "Sustained efforts to incorporate a wider range of modern neuroscience techniques into magnetoreception research are now needed \u2014 an undertaking that has perhaps just recently begun45,46,80,105,106,107,108,109.",
              "In parallel with this is the need to identify new model systems in which magnetoreception can be investigated.",
              "Migratory vertebrates, such as birds and sea turtles, have proved favourable for behavioural experiments, but they are not ideal for work in the realms of neurobiology, microscopy and genetics.",
              "The discovery that magnetic sensitivity exists in zebrafish110, the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster62,111 and in Tritonia diomedea, a mollusc with a simple nervous system107,108,109 might represent promising first steps in this direction.",
              "Although evidence for magnetoreception based on a radical pair mechanism is accumulating, critics have questioned the interpretation of several key results32.",
              "One unresolved issue involves changes in magnetic orientation behaviour that are elicited by different wavelengths and intensities of light.",
              "These have generally been interpreted as direct effects on magnetoreceptor function, but in some cases it is difficult to rule out an alternative possibility: that light instead affects physiological processes unrelated to magnetoreception, which, in turn, affect motivation32,112.",
              "Light-dependent effects on magnetic orientation behaviour vary greatly among species, and some are more difficult to reconcile with motivational changes than others.",
              "For example, it is difficult to explain in terms of motivation why a newt would choose to shift its orientation by 90\u00b0 when exposed to a specific type of monochromatic light61.",
              "However, in contrast to such clear directional shifts, many of the wavelength-dependent effects involve the disruption of orientation60, an outcome that might arise for various reasons.",
              "An animal in the lab, for example, might decide to search for shelter instead of trying to migrate when the world around it is illuminated in a strange and perhaps alarming way.",
              "In birds, seasonal migratory behaviour is intimately connected to light cycles and light perception.",
              "Migratory behaviour is triggered by photoperiod and, for night migrants, the motivation to begin the next leg of migration peaks at or near sunset.",
              "Given the complex interplay among light-dependent processes, biological rhythms, motivation and migration, an intriguing but largely unexplored possibility is that at least some light-dependent changes in magnetic orientation arise through effects on a circadian pacemaker system, which, in turn, influences the expression or timing of orientation behaviour.",
              "The entrainment of circadian rhythms has recently been shown to depend at least in part on the absorption of light by the photopigment melanopsin113.",
              "In vertebrates, melanopsin is found in the pineal gland and in the visual system, where it has been localized to a limited number of retinal ganglion cells114,115.",
              "The pigment is most sensitive to blue light116,117 and may have a blue\u2013yellow opponency mechanism via cone inputs118,119.",
              "Because such opponency often results in outcomes that vary with the spectral composition of light, these findings raise the possibility that different combinations of wavelengths and intensities might affect the pacemaker system in complex and unexpected ways.",
              "Finally, the apparent lateralization of the magnetic sense, discovered in magnetic orientation experiments in which one eye of birds was covered120, shows interesting parallels to the lateralization of the circadian pacemaker121,122.",
              "A first step towards investigating this possibility would be to measure melatonin levels during and after exposure to light environments that are known to affect magnetic orientation.",
              "Because melatonin peaks at night and provides a convenient assay for circadian rhythmicity, a finding that melatonin levels are unaffected by the different treatments would bolster the argument that the effects are specific to magnetoreception.",
              "If melatonin levels do change under some light regimes, then such changes could be replicated pharmacologically to investigate possible effects on orientation behaviour.",
              "Attempts to locate magnetite in animals have been impeded by several factors, the first of which is that the crystals are small (50 nm diameter) and difficult to resolve microscopically.",
              "In addition, iron oxides are common environmental and histological contaminants and can be by-products of various degenerative biological processes123.",
              "Many fixatives that preserve membranes also dissolve magnetite80, so it is difficult to visualize magnetite crystals and their cellular environment simultaneously.",
              "A potentially interesting approach that has not yet been attempted is the use of techniques from bioinformatics to search vertebrate genomic libraries for gene sequences involved in magnetite production, on the assumption that such sequences might have been conserved during evolution.",
              "Such an approach might be feasible, because if magnetite crystals are involved in magnetoreception, then they are probably formed through pathways that involve molecular enzymes and transporters.",
              "Moreover, these processes have now been extensively studied in magnetotactic bacteria, and the transporters and chelators involved have been sequenced73.",
              "Such an approach, if successful, might lead to improved methodologies for locating small clusters of magnetite crystals in animals.",

              "The Basics: How Birds Navigate When They Migrate",
              "Birds have a remarkable homing instinct, allowing them to return to the same area year after year, even when their migration takes them halfway around the world.",
              "How this remarkable feat is accomplished has been the topic of many studies.",
              "Research indicates that young birds that do not migrate with their parents have an innate knowledge of the direction and distance they should travel, but lack a specific goal.",
              "After it arrives at its wintering grounds, the young bird will select a winter range to which it imprints during that winter.",
              "After the first year the bird has the ability to return to the same area, even if blown off course during migration.",
              "Adults seem to have even more homing skills.",
              "Two classic experiments illustrate this point.",
              "Manx Shearwaters were flown by plane from their nesting island off the coast of Great Britain to two different locations.",
              "One group was released near Boston, MA, and another near Venice, Italy.",
              "Shearwaters do not fly over land so both groups must have taken an over water route, which would be especially convoluted from Venice.",
              "Both groups of birds returned to their nesting burrows within 14 days, covering approximately 250 miles per day.",
              "How they were able to achieve this remarkable return is not fully understood.",
              "In another experiment, several hundred White-crowned Sparrows were captured in their winter grounds near San Jose, California.",
              "One group was flown to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and released, while a second group was flown to Laurel, Maryland, and released.",
              "The following winter thirty-four of the birds were recaptured in the same 1/4 acre plot in California they had been captured in originally, presumably after having visited their northern breeding grounds during the summer.",
              "Homing pigeons have been used extensively as test subjects in order to develop a better understanding of migration and homing abilities.",
              "They have exhibited almost unbelievable navigation skills.",
              "In one noted experiment, German scientist Hans Wallraff transported homing pigeons to a very distant location.",
              "To ensure that the birds did not receive any external navigational information, they were transferred under stringent conditions.",
              "The pigeons were transported in closed, airtight cylinders and provided bottled air.",
              "Light was turned on and off at random times and loud white noise was played.",
              "The cylinders were enclosed in magnetic coils that provided a changing magnetic field.",
              "Finally, the cylinders were mounted on a tilting turntable connected to a computer that varied both the rotation and tilt of the cylinders.",
              "After release at the distant and completely unknown area, the birds were able to fly home to their roost, apparently without trouble (other than an initial case of nausea).",
              "The pigeons\u2019 ability to fly home from a totally strange and distant location indicates that somehow the birds have both an internal compass and an internal map.",
              "A compass by itself would not be helpful, since the bird would not know if it were north, south, east or west of its home.",
              "The question of how a bird has a map of a location to which it has never been before (and was transferred to under such isolated conditions in the above test) and the sense of the direction it must take to return home remains a puzzle.",
              "Some possible explanations have been proposed, as follows: How could a bird possibly have a map of places it has never been?",
              "One very surprising theory suggests that homing pigeons may use an olfactory map.",
              "Visualize a pigeon in its home loft with the smell of pine trees from one direction and the smell of an onion farm in another.",
              "If the bird moves closer to the pine trees, the odor of pine will presumably grow stronger while the odor of onions grows weaker.",
              "In theory, a gradient map of odors could be created that would provide some directional information, even if the pigeon were suddenly dropped into a new location.",
              "Floriano Papi and others from the University of Pisa initiated this theory and have some evidence that olfactory navigation may extend to a distance of 310 miles.",
              "This theory remains controversial.",
              "A second theory suggests that birds use the earth\u2019s magnetic field to obtain at least a partial map of its position.",
              "The earth\u2019s magnetic field becomes stronger as you travel away from the equator and toward the poles.",
              "In theory, a bird might be able to estimate its latitude based on the strength of the magnetic field.",
              "While the change in strength is very small from one location to the next, there is some indication that homing pigeons have the sensitivity to detect even tiny changes in the strength of the magnetic field.",
              "Even if true, this would provide only a limited indication of the bird\u2019s latitude.",
              "At this time there is no clear evidence that either of these theories is the complete story and the mapping skills of birds remains largely unexplained.",
              "The other half of the navigation requirement is the compass.",
              "The internal map provides a bird with the general location of where it is relative to its homing or migration goal and its internal compass guides its flight and keeps it on course.",
              "Migrating birds are apparently utilizing several different compasses.",
              "In 1951 Gustav Kramer discovered the sun compass.",
              "He performed his experiments by placing European Starlings in orientation cages and then used mirrors to shift the apparent location of the sun.",
              "In response, the birds shifted their migratory restlessness to match the compass direction indicated by the apparent new position of the sun.",
              "Further research revealed that the bird\u2019s sun compass is tied to its circadian rhythm.",
              "It seems birds have a time compensation ability to make allowances for changes in the sun\u2019s position over the course of the day.",
              "This theory is supported by another experiment in which pigeons were placed in a closed room with an altered cycle of light and dark.",
              "Over a period of a few days their circadian rhythm was reset.",
              "The birds were then released on a sunny day.",
              "Because their \u201cinternal clock\u201d had been reset, they misinterpreted the position of the sun and made a predictable error in their homing direction.",
              "The pigeons actually ignore the position of the sun relative to its position in the sky, relying on its azimuth direction, i.",
              "e. the compass direction at which a vertical line from the sun intersects the horizon.",
              "Further study has also revealed that pigeons have to learn the sun\u2019s path to use it in navigation.",
              "Young pigeons allowed to see the sun only in the morning lack the ability to use the sun for navigation in the afternoon.",
              "The sun compass plays a role in homing and may be used by birds that migrate during the day.",
              "Many songbird species, however, migrate at night.",
              "For many years scientist suspected that birds use the stars for navigation.",
              "In 1957 Franz and Eleanor Saur collected data from a series of experiments in which birds were placed inside an enclosed planetary dome.",
              "The Saurs were able to demonstrate that birds do use the stars for migration but not, as it turns out, in the way they thought.",
              "The common belief at the conclusion of the Saur experiments was that birds have a genetically coded map of the stars.",
              "In 1967 Cornell scientist Stephen Emlen used Indigo Buntings to prove that the actual story was a little different.",
              "Dr.",
              "Emlen also used a closed planetarium for his tests.",
              "He started by collecting young birds and then hand raising them in a lab.",
              "His research included the following: A.",
              "One group of birds was raised in a windowless room and was never exposed to a point source of light.",
              "B.",
              "A second group also never saw the sun but was exposed on alternate nights to a simulated night sky in the planetarium, with normal rotation around the North Star.",
              "C.",
              "A third group was also raised in a windowless room, but on alternate nights was exposed to a simulated night sky in the planetarium.",
              "In this case, the sky was manipulated to rotate about a different star, Betelgeuse.",
              "When the fall migration period started, the birds were released into a special cage inside the planetarium.",
              "Group A was placed in the planetarium under a normal fixed sky.",
              "The birds oriented themselves in random directions, showing no ability to recognize a southerly migration direction.",
              "Group B was placed in the planetarium with a normal rotation around the North Star.",
              "The birds oriented themselves away from the North Star, in the appropriate southern direction for migration.",
              "Group C was also placed into the planetarium.",
              "They had been raised with Betelgeuse as the central point of rotation.",
              "When exposed to a normal sky these birds oriented themselves away from Betelgeuse.",
              "This research indicates that young birds do not learn star patterns themselves but learn a north-south orientation from a rotational star pattern.",
              "Another German team did research with the European Robin in the early 1960s.",
              "In their tests, robins showing migratory restlessness were placed in covered cages to eliminate sun, star and other light clues.",
              "Despite the lack of visual clues, the robins were observed hopping in the correct migratory direction.",
              "As an additional refinement to the test, a Helmholtz coil was placed around the covered cages.",
              "The coil allowed the researchers to shift the direction of the earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "When the direction of the magnetic field was changed, the robins changed their hopping direction.",
              "Further research indicates that while birds can sense the north and south ends of a compass, they cannot tell the difference between the two.",
              "To determine which direction is north, the birds apparently have the capability to sense that the magnetic lines of force align toward the poles of the earth.",
              "They can also detect the dip in the lines of force as they approach the earth and, through some currently unknown method, seem to be able to detect and make navigational decisions based on the dip angle.",
              "Patterns of polarized light also appear to play a key role in navigation.",
              "Many of the nocturnal migrants start their flights at sunset or a little after.",
              "Birds apparently use the polarized light patterns to provide information on initial migratory flight directions.",
              "Birds that migrate during the day often follow, and may recognize, natural landforms such as mountain ranges, rivers, and lakes.",
              "There is some indication that birds use multiple compass methods and calibrate them against each other.",
              "Some species use one type of compass as the primary navigational aid while others rely on a different primary system.",
              "The complexity of migration and the skill with which it is accomplished is one of the many marvels that make birds so interesting to study.",

              "How Migrating Birds Use Quantum Effects to Navigate",
              "April 1, 2022 14 min read New research hints at the biophysical underpinnings of their ability to use Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines to find their way to their breeding and wintering grounds By Henrik Mouritsen & Peter J.",
              "Hore Kyle Bean Imagine you are a young Bar-tailed Godwit, a large, leggy shorebird with a long, probing bill hatched on the tundra of Alaska.",
              "As the days become shorter and the icy winter looms, you feel the urge to embark on one of the most impressive migrations on Earth: a nonstop transequatorial flight lasting at least seven days and nights across the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand 12,000 kilometers away.",
              "It\u2019s do or die.",
              "Every year tens of thousands of Bar-tailed Godwits complete this journey successfully.",
              "Billions of other young birds, including warblers and flycatchers, terns and sandpipers, set out on similarly spectacular and dangerous migrations every spring, skillfully navigating the night skies without any help from more experienced birds.",
              "People have long puzzled over the seasonal appearances and disappearances of birds.",
              "Aristotle thought that some birds such as swallows hibernated in the colder months and that others transformed into different species\u2014redstarts turned into robins for the winter, he proposed.",
              "Only in the past century or so, with the advent of bird banding, satellite tracking and more widespread field studies, have researchers been able to connect bird populations that winter in one area and nest in another and show that some travel vast distances between the two locales every year.",
              "Remarkably, even juvenile long-haul travelers know where to go, and birds often take the same routes year after year.",
              "How do they find their way?",
              "Migrating birds use celestial cues to navigate, much as sailors of yore used the sun and stars to guide them.",
              "But unlike humans, birds also detect the magnetic field generated by Earth\u2019s molten core and use it to determine their position and direction.",
              "Despite more than 50 years of research into magnetoreception in birds, scientists have been unable to work out exactly how they use this information to stay on course.",
              "Recently we and others have made inroads into this enduring mystery.",
              "Our experimental evidence suggests something extraordinary: a bird\u2019s compass relies on subtle, fundamentally quantum effects in short-lived molecular fragments, known as radical pairs, formed photochemically in its eyes.",
              "That is, the creatures appear to be able to \u201csee\u201d Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines and use that information to chart a course between their breeding and wintering grounds.",
              "Migratory birds have an internal clock with an annual rhythm that tells them, among other things, when to migrate.",
              "They also inherit from their parents the directions in which they need to fly in the autumn and spring, and if the parents each have different genetically encoded directions, their offspring will end up with an intermediate direction.",
              "For example, if a southwest-migrating bird is crossed with a southeast-migrating bird, their offspring will head south when the time comes.",
              "But how do the young birds know which direction is southwest or south or southeast?",
              "They have at least three different compasses at their disposal: one allows them to extract information from the position of the sun in the sky, another uses the patterns of the stars at night, and the third is based on Earth\u2019s ever present magnetic field.",
              "In their first autumn, young birds follow inherited instructions such as \u201cfly southwest for three weeks and then south-southeast for two weeks.",
              "\u201d If they make a mistake or are blown off course, they are generally unable to recover because they do not yet have a functioning map that would tell them where they are.",
              "This is one of the reasons why only 30 percent of small songbirds survive their first migrations to their wintering grounds and back again.",
              "During its first migration a bird builds up a map in its brain that, on subsequent journeys, will enable it to navigate with an ultimate precision of centimeters over thousands of kilometers.",
              "Some birds breed in the same nest box and sleep on the same perch in their wintering range year after year.",
              "Equipped with this map, about 50 percent of adult songbirds make it back to their nesting site to breed every year.",
              "Migratory birds\u2019 navigational input comes from several senses\u2014mainly sight, smell and magnetoreception.",
              "By observing the apparent nighttime rotation of the stars around the North Star, the birds learn to locate north before they embark on their first migration, and an internal 24-hour clock allows them to calibrate their sun compass.",
              "Characteristic smells can help birds recognize places they have visited before.",
              "Scientists know a great deal about the detailed biophysical mechanisms of the birds\u2019 senses of sight and smell.",
              "But the inner workings of their magnetic compass have proved harder to understand.",
              "The magnetic direction sense in small songbirds that migrate at night is remarkable in several important respects.",
              "First, observations of caged birds exposed to carefully controlled magnetic fields show that their compass does not behave like the magnetized needle in a ship\u2019s compass.",
              "A bird detects the axis of the magnetic field and the angle it makes with Earth\u2019s surface, the so-called inclination compass.",
              "In laboratory experiments, inverting the magnetic field\u2019s direction so that it points in exactly the opposite direction has no effect on the bird\u2019s ability to orient correctly.",
              "Second, a bird\u2019s perception of Earth\u2019s magnetic field can be disrupted by extraordinarily weak magnetic fields that reverse their direction several million times per second.",
              "Last, even though songbirds fly at night under the dim light of the stars, their magnetic compass is light-dependent, hinting at a link between vision and magnetic sensing.",
              "In 1978, in an attempt to make sense of these features of avian magnetoreception, the late Klaus Schulten, then at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Go\u0308ttingen, Germany, put forth a remarkable idea: that the compass relies on magnetically sensitive chemical transformations.",
              "At first glance, this proposal seems preposterous because the energy available from Earth\u2019s magnetic field is millions of times too small to break, or even significantly weaken, the bonds between atoms in molecules.",
              "But Schulten was inspired by the discovery 10 years previously that short-lived chemical intermediates known as radical pairs have unique properties that make their chemistry sensitive to feeble magnetic interactions.",
              "Over the past 40 years researchers have conducted hundreds of lab studies of radical-pair reactions that are affected by the application of magnetic fields.",
              "To appreciate why radical pairs are so special, we need to talk about a quantum-mechanical property of the electron known as spin angular momentum, or \u201cspin\u201d for short.",
              "Spin is a vector with a direction as well as a magnitude, and it is often represented by an arrow, \u2191 or \u2193, for example.",
              "Particles with spin have magnetic moments, which is to say they behave like microscopic magnets.",
              "Most molecules have an even number of electrons arranged in pairs with opposed spins (\u21c5), which therefore cancel each other out.",
              "Radicals are molecules that have lost or gained an electron, meaning that they contain an odd, unpaired, electron and hence have a spin and a magnetic moment.",
              "When two radicals are created simultaneously by a chemical reaction (this is what we mean by radical pair), the two unpaired electrons, one in each radical, can have either antiparallel spins (\u21c5) or parallel spins (\u2191\u2191), arrangements known as singlet and triplet states, respectively.",
              "Immediately after a radical pair is created in a singlet state, internal magnetic fields cause the two electronic spins to undergo a complex quantum \u201cwaltz\u201d in which singlet turns into triplet and triplet turns back into singlet millions of times per second for periods of up to a few microseconds.",
              "Crucially, under the right conditions, this dance can be influenced by external magnetic fields.",
              "Schulten suggested that this subtle quantum effect could form the basis of a magnetic compass sense that might respond to environmental stimuli a million times weaker than would normally be thought possible.",
              "Research that we and others have carried out in recent years has generated fresh support for this hypothesis.",
              "To be useful, hypotheses need to explain known facts and make testable predictions.",
              "Two aspects of Schulten\u2019s proposed compass mechanism are consistent with what is known about the birds\u2019 compass: radical pairs are indifferent to exact external magnetic field reversals, and radical pairs are often formed when molecules absorb light.",
              "Given that the birds\u2019 magnetic compass is light-dependent, a prediction of Schulten\u2019s hypothesis is that their eyes play a part in the magnetic sensory system.",
              "About 10 years ago the research group of one of us (Mouritsen) at the University of Oldenburg in Germany found that a brain region called Cluster N, which receives and processes visual information, is by far the most active part of the brain when certain night-migrating birds are using their magnetic compass.",
              "If Cluster N is dysfunctional, research in migratory European Robins showed, the birds can still use their sun and star compasses, but they are incapable of orienting using Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "From experiments such as these, it is clear that the magnetic compass sensors are located in the birds\u2019 retinas.",
              "One early objection to the radical-pair hypothesis was that no one had ever shown that magnetic fields as tiny as Earth\u2019s, which are 10 to 100 times weaker than a fridge magnet, could affect a chemical reaction.",
              "To address this point, Christiane Timmel of the University of Oxford and her colleagues chose a molecule chemically unlike anything one would find inside a bird: one that contained an electron donor molecule linked to an electron acceptor molecule via a molecular bridge.",
              "Exposing the molecules to green light caused an electron to jump from the donor to the acceptor over a distance of about four nanometers.",
              "The radical pair that formed from this reaction was extremely sensitive to weak magnetic interactions, proving that it is indeed possible for a radical-pair reaction to be influenced by the presence of\u2014and, more important, the direction of\u2014an Earth-strength magnetic field.",
              "Schulten\u2019s hypothesis also predicts that there must be sensory molecules (magnetoreceptors) in the retina in which magnetically sensitive radical pairs can be created using the wavelengths birds need for their compass to operate, which another line of research had identified as light centered in the blue region of the spectrum.",
              "In 2000 he suggested that the necessary photochemistry could take place in a then recently discovered protein called cryptochrome.",
              "Cryptochromes are found in plants, insects, fish, birds and humans.",
              "They have a variety of functions, including light-dependent control of plant growth and regulation of circadian clocks.",
              "What makes them attractive as potential compass sensors is that they are the only known naturally occurring photoreceptors in any vertebrate that form radical pairs when they absorb blue light.",
              "Six types of cryptochromes have been found in the eyes of migratory birds, and no other type of candidate magnetoreceptor molecule has emerged in the past 20 years.",
              "Like all other proteins, cryptochromes are composed of chains of amino acids folded up into complex three-dimensional structures.",
              "Buried deep in the center of many cryptochromes is a yellow molecule called flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) that, unlike the rest of the protein, absorbs blue light.",
              "Embedded among the 500 or so amino acids that make up a typical cryptochrome is a roughly linear chain of three or four tryptophan amino acids stretching from the FAD out to the surface of the protein.",
              "Immediately after the FAD absorbs a blue photon, an electron from the nearest tryptophan hops onto the flavin portion of the FAD.",
              "The first tryptophan then attracts an electron from the second tryptophan and so on.",
              "In this way, the tryptophan chain behaves like a molecular wire.",
              "The net result is a radical pair made of a negatively charged FAD radical in the center of the protein and, two nanometers away, a positively charged tryptophan radical at the surface of the protein.",
              "In 2012 one of us (Hore), working with colleagues at Oxford, carried out experiments to test the suitability of cryptochrome as a magnetic sensor.",
              "The study used cryptochrome-1, a protein found in Arabidopsis thaliana, the plant in which cryptochromes had been discovered 20 years earlier.",
              "Using short laser pulses to produce radical pairs inside the purified proteins, we found that we could fine-tune their subsequent reactions by applying magnetic fields.",
              "This was all very encouraging, but, of course, plants don\u2019t migrate.",
              "We had to wait almost a decade before we could make similar measurements on a cryptochrome from a migratory bird.",
              "The first challenge was to decide which of the six bird cryptochromes to look at.",
              "We chose cryptochrome-4a (Cry4a), partly because it binds FAD much more strongly than do some of its siblings, and if there is no FAD in the protein, there will be no radical pairs and no magnetic sensitivity.",
              "Experiments in Oldenburg also showed that the levels of Cry4a in migratory birds are higher during the spring and autumn migratory seasons than they are during winter and summer when the birds do not migrate.",
              "Computer simulations performed by Ilia Solov\u2019yov in Oldenburg showed that European Robin Cry4a has a chain of four tryptophans\u2014one more than the Cry1 from Arabidopsis.",
              "Naturally, we wondered whether the extended chain had evolved to optimize magnetic sensing in migratory birds.",
              "Our next challenge was to get large amounts of highly pure robin Cry4a.",
              "Jingjing Xu, a Ph.",

              "student in Mouritsen\u2019s lab, solved it.",
              "After optimizing the experimental conditions, she was able to use bacterial cell cultures to produce samples of the protein with the FAD correctly bound.",
              "She also prepared versions of the protein in which each of the four tryptophans was replaced, one at a time, by a different amino acid so as to block electron hopping at each of the four positions along the chain.",
              "Working with these alternative versions of the protein would allow us to test whether the electrons are really jumping all the way along the tryptophan chain.",
              "We shipped these samples\u2014the first purified cryptochromes from any migratory animal\u2014to Oxford, where Timmel and her husband, Stuart Mackenzie, studied them using the sensitive laser-based techniques they had developed specifically for that purpose.",
              "Their research groups found that both the third and fourth tryptophan radicals at the end of the chain are magnetically sensitive when paired with the FAD radical.",
              "We suspect that the tryptophans work cooperatively for efficient magnetic sensing, biochemical signaling and direction finding.",
              "We also speculate that the presence of the fourth tryptophan might enhance the initial steps of signal transduction, the process by which nerve impulses encoding the magnetic field direction are generated and ultimately sent along the optic nerve to the brain.",
              "We are currently conducting experiments to identify the proteins that interact with Cry4a.",
              "One more cryptochrome finding deserves mention here.",
              "We compared robin Cry4a with the extremely similar Cry4a proteins from two nonmigratory birds, pigeons and chickens.",
              "The robin protein had the largest magnetic sensitivity, hinting that evolution might have optimized robin Cry4a for navigation.",
              "Although these experiments confirm that Cry4a has some of the properties required of a magnetoreceptor, we are still a long way from proving how migratory birds perceive Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines.",
              "One crucial next step is to determine whether radical pairs actually form in the eyes of migratory birds.",
              "The most promising way to test for radical pairs inside the birds\u2019 eyes was inspired by the work of chemists and physicists who, in the 1980s, showed that fluctuating magnetic fields alter the way radical-pair reactions respond to static magnetic fields.",
              "Their work predicted that a weak radio-frequency electromagnetic field, fluctuating with the same frequencies as the \u201csinglet-triplet waltz,\u201d might interfere with the birds\u2019 ability to use their magnetic compass.",
              "Thorsten Ritz of the University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues were the first to confirm this prediction in 2004.",
              "In 2007 Mouritsen began similar behavioral experiments in his lab in Oldenburg\u2014with intriguingly different results.",
              "During the spring and fall, birds that travel between nesting and wintering grounds exhibit a behavior called Zugunruhe, or migratory restlessness, as if they are anxious to get on their way.",
              "When caged, these birds usually use their magnetic compass to instinctively orient themselves in the direction in which they would fly in the wild.",
              "Mouritsen found that European Robins tested in wooden huts on his university\u2019s campus were unable to orient using their magnetic compass.",
              "He suspected that weak radio-frequency noise (sometimes called electrosmog) generated by electrical equipment in the nearby labs was interfering with the birds\u2019 magnetic compass.",
              "To confirm that electrosmog was the source of the problem, Mouritsen and his team lined the huts with aluminum sheets to block the stray radio frequencies.",
              "On nights when the shields were grounded and functioned properly, the birds oriented well in Earth\u2019s magnetic field.",
              "On nights when the grounding was disconnected, the birds jumped in random directions.",
              "When tested in an unshielded wooden shelter typically used for horses some kilometers outside the city and well away from electrical equipment, the same birds had no trouble detecting the direction of the magnetic field.",
              "These results are significant on several fronts.",
              "If the radio-frequency fields affect the magnetic sensor and not, say, some component of the signaling pathway that carries nerve impulses to the brain, then they provide compelling evidence that a radical-pair mechanism underpins the bird\u2019s magnetic compass.",
              "The main competing hypothesis, for which there is currently much less support, proposes that magnetic iron\u2013containing minerals are the sensors.",
              "Any such particles that were large enough to align like a compass needle in Earth\u2019s magnetic field would be far too big to rotate in a much weaker field that reversed its direction millions of times per second.",
              "Furthermore, the radio-frequency fields that upset the birds\u2019 magnetic orientation are astonishingly weak, and we don\u2019t yet understand exactly how they could corrupt the directional information available from the much stronger magnetic field of Earth.",
              "It is also remarkable that the birds in the Oldenburg lab were disoriented much more effectively by broadband radio-frequency noise (randomly fluctuating magnetic fields with a range of frequencies) than by the single-frequency fields mostly used by Ritz and his collaborators.",
              "We hope that by subjecting migratory songbirds to bands of radio-frequency noise with different frequencies we will be able to determine whether the sensors really are FAD-tryptophan radical pairs or whether, as some other investigators have suggested, another radical pair might be involved.",
              "Many questions about the birds\u2019 magnetic compass remain, including whether the magnetic field effects on robin Cry4a observed in vitro also exist in vivo.",
              "We also want to see whether migratory birds with genetically suppressed Cry4a production are prevented from orienting using their magnetic compass.",
              "If we can prove that a radical-pair mechanism is behind the magnetic sense in vivo, then we will have shown that a biological sensory system can respond to stimuli several million times weaker than previously thought possible.",
              "This insight would enhance our understanding of biological sensing and provide new ideas for artificial sensors.",
              "Working to gain a full understanding of the inner navigation systems of migratory birds is not merely an intellectual pursuit.",
              "One consequence of the enormous distances migratory birds travel is that they face more acute threats to their survival than most species that breed and overwinter in the same place.",
              "It is more difficult to protect them from the harmful effects of human activity, habitat destruction and climate change.",
              "Relocating migratory individuals away from damaged habitats is rarely successful because the birds tend to instinctively return to those unlivable locales.",
              "We hope that by providing new and more mechanistic insights into the ways in which these extraordinary navigators find their way, conservationists will have a better chance of \u201ctricking\u201d migrants into believing that a safer location really is their new home.",
              "When you next see a small songbird, pause for a moment to consider that it might recently have flown thousands of kilometers, navigating with great skill using a brain weighing no more than a gram.",

              "Many birds travel from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere and back every year, following food resources and friendly climates.",
              "But how do seasonal migrants \u2014 and other birds such as seabirds undertaking lengthy oceanic foraging trips \u2014 find their way?",
              "Young birds from widely ranging species seem to hatch with genetic programming that gives them a basic idea of where they should head when the season changes, and many make their first migration without their parents to help.",
              "But as they fine-tune their routes via experience, they rely on a combination of techniques to navigate.",
              "The most essential are listed below.",
              "One of the simplest ways a bird can make sure it's on the right track \u2014 at least while migrating over land on a clear day \u2014 is to watch for familiar landmarks below.",
              "Some ornithologists believe that day-migrating birds keep an eye out for features such as rivers and mountain ranges, using them to plot a course.",
              "There's even evidence that night-migrating birds can fine-tune their course based on rivers as they near their destinations.",
              "But what about birds that don't have landmarks with which to navigate?",
              "Seabirds, for example, sometimes fly long distances over the featureless ocean.",
              "The remarkable answer is that some birds can follow their noses.",
              "For a 2017 study, researchers temporarily blocked the sense of smell of a group of seabirds called Scopoli's Shearwaters by washing their nasal passages with an otherwise harmless chemical called zinc sulfate.",
              "Then, they tracked the birds with GPS devices while they foraged off the coast of Spain, comparing them with shearwaters that could still smell.",
              "The test group continued to navigate effectively over land \u2014 but when they headed out to sea, they became disoriented, suggesting that scents fill in the gaps when landmarks aren't available.",
              "Not all birds have a great sense of smell \u2014 and if you migrate at night (as many songbirds do), landmarks might not help you much, either.",
              "When this is the case, it's time to turn to celestial navigation.",
              "In the 1960s, a father-and-son scientist team studying bird migration, John and Stephen Emlen, invented a clever method of studying whether birds oriented themselves using the stars.",
              "They placed captive birds experiencing seasonal \u201cmigratory restlessness\u201d in small cages with ink pads at their bottoms and lined the cages with paper funnels they dubbed \u201cEmlen funnels.",
              "\u201d As trapped birds attempted to take flight, their feet left ink marks on the paper-lined sides of the cage.",
              "To test whether the birds picked their direction based on the stars overhead, the Emlens placed caged Indigo Buntings in a planetarium where they could manipulate the location of celestial bodies.",
              "When they rotated the planetarium \u201csky\u201d so that \u201cnorth\u201d appeared in a different direction, the birds changed course accordingly, as indicated by their feet marks on the funnels \u2014 aligning themselves by the stars' locations.",
              "The rising and setting sun, of course, provide other major cues for direction-finding, and many studies have shown that birds use these markers as well.",
              "For example, a 2001 study used radar to track the changing trajectories of shorebirds heading south from the Arctic and found that the only way to explain certain quirks of their routes was to posit that they were following a \u201csun compass,\u201d with their direction shifting slightly as their internal clocks lost sync with local time over the long distances they traveled.",
              "It's not that hard to imagine finding your way by following a river, or the North Star, or even your nose.",
              "After all, we humans share the senses of sight and smell with birds.",
              "But bird migration also seems to rely on a sixth sense that we lack: the ability to feel Earth's magnetic field.",
              "Experiments to test this ability by manipulating the magnetic fields around birds in a laboratory, which date back to the 1960s, have shown that birds alter their direction according to changes in these fields.",
              "The question is, how?",
              "Some studies have claimed that tiny particles of a highly magnetic mineral called magnetite can be found in the upper bills of birds, including pigeons, helping them to navigate.",
              "Although this theory poses a potential answer, it remains controversial.",
              "Magnetite has since turned up in other locations in pigeons' bodies that don't seem as well-suited to be magnetic sensors.",
              "Similarly, the results of studies that have tried anesthetizing magnetite-containing areas to see how bird are affected have been inconsistent.",
              "In recent years, an alternative hypothesis has emerged.",
              "It posits that special proteins in birds' eyes can detect the orientation of Earth's magnetic field via effects best explained by quantum mechanics.",
              "Experiments have shown that birds' ability to detect magnetic fields is dependent on light, and it now seems that it may work via blue-light-sensitive proteins called cryptochromes.",
              "When a blue light photon hits a cryptochrome protein in a bird's eye, a special set of quantum particles called a \u201cradical pair\u201d is generated, which is super-sensitive to even faint variations in the surrounding magnetic field.",
              "The orientation of Earth's magnetic field affects the likelihood that the cryptochrome protein will end up in one of several possible states as a result.",
              "The \u201csignaling state\u201d of the protein determines which sort of signal is sent to the bird's brain, and the bird can combine this with other sensory input as it plots its course.",
              "If this is a little hard to wrap your mind around, don't worry \u2014 there's a reason quantum physics has a reputation for being perplexing.",
              "Regardless of how birds find their way \u2014 via landmarks, smell, the sun and stars, or a mysterious quantum-physics-based ability to sense magnetic fields \u2014 their journeys are inspiring.",

          "Although the existence of the sense can no longer be disputed, we understand little of the cells, molecules, and mechanisms that underlie it.",
          "Despite compelling behavioral evidence that this sense exists, the cells, molecules, and mechanisms that mediate sensory transduction remain unknown.",
          "We argue that solving this scientific mystery will require the development of new genetic tools in magnetosensitive species, coupled with an interdisciplinary approach that bridges physics, behavior, anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, and genetics.",
          "Research on magnetoreception in humans is very limited."

        "Different species of birds may use different mechanisms or combinations of mechanisms to sense the magnetic field.": [
          "The direction of the magnetic field appears to be sensed via radical pair processes in the eyes, with the crucial radical pairs formed by cryptochrome.",
          "Different animals might rely on different mechanisms. The magnetite hypothesis posits that crystals of the magnetic mineral magnetite transduce magnetic field energy into physical forces that can be detected by the nervous system.",
          "Magnetic intensity appears to be perceived by magnetite-based receptors in the beak region;",
          "Birds can use two kinds of information from the geomagnetic field for navigation: the direction of the field lines as a compass and probably magnetic intensity as a component of the navigational \u2018map\u2019."

        "Some birds might use cues like the sun, stars, landmarks, or smells to complement their magnetic sense during migration.": [
          "Some ornithologists believe that day-migrating birds keep an eye out for features such as rivers and mountain ranges, using them to plot a course.",
          "The rising and setting sun, of course, provide other major cues for direction-finding, and many studies have shown that birds use these markers as well.",
          "There's even evidence that night-migrating birds can fine-tune their course based on rivers as they near their destinations.",
          "By observing the apparent nighttime rotation of the stars around the North Star, the birds learn to locate north before they embark on their first migration, and an internal 24-hour clock allows them to calibrate their sun compass.",
          "Regardless of how birds find their way \u2014 via landmarks, smell, the sun and stars, or a mysterious quantum-physics-based ability to sense magnetic fields \u2014 their journeys are inspiring.",
          "Migrating birds use celestial cues to navigate, much as sailors of yore used the sun and stars to guide them."
