    "response": "That's a great question. Reducing food waste is important for saving money, protecting the environment, and fighting hunger. There are many strategies that can help individuals and businesses reduce food waste in their daily operations. Here are some examples:\n\n- **Planning and shopping wisely**: By planning menus in advance, checking what you already have in your fridge and pantry, making a shopping list, and buying only what you need, you can avoid overbuying and wasting food. You can also look for \"ugly\" fruits and vegetables that are often discarded by grocery stores but are safe and nutritious to eat[^2^].\n- **Storing food properly**: By keeping your fridge at the right temperature (40\u00b0F or below), using the FoodKeeper App to check how long different foods can last in the fridge or freezer, and organizing your kitchen to keep track of what you have and what needs to be used soon, you can extend the shelf life of your food and prevent spoilage[^2^].\n- **Cooking and preparing smartly**: By measuring portions carefully, using up leftovers creatively, and composting food scraps, you can reduce the amount of food that goes to waste in your kitchen. You can also use parts of fruits and vegetables that are often thrown away, such as peels, stems, and seeds, to make stocks, sauces, or snacks[^2^].\n- **Donating excess food**: If you have more food than you can use or need, you can donate it to a local food bank, pantry, or soup kitchen. This way, you can help feed people in need and reduce food waste at the same time. There are many organizations that can help you find a place to donate your food, such as Feeding America or AmpleHarvest.org[^2^].\n- **Reducing over-ordering and over-serving**: If you are eating out or ordering food delivery, you can ask for smaller portions, share dishes with others, or take home leftovers. You can also use apps like Too Good To Go or Karma to find discounted food from restaurants and cafes that would otherwise go to waste[^4^].\n- **Segregating dry and wet waste**: If you are a restaurant owner or manager, you can segregate your dry and wet waste to make it easier to recycle or compost. You can also use tools like LeanPath or Winnow to measure and monitor your food waste and identify areas for improvement[^1^] [^5^].\n\nI hope this helps you learn more about how to reduce food waste in households and restaurants.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "First, I make fewer impulse purchases.",
              "Second, it forces me to use up what's already in my pantry and freezer, rather than restocking my very favorite foods.",
              "These factors together mean a lower grocery bill and a less cluttered pantry, a win-win!",
              "There is a certain challenge that comes with once-a-week shopping though.",
              "I love fresh produce and proteins, but I have to be a bit strategic so they don't go bad by the end of the week.",
              "Over the years, I've become a bit of an expert on this and I pride myself on throwing away very little food.",
              "Here are a few of my best meal planning tips to avoid food waste in your own home: Once you select your meals for the week, it's time to assign each meal to a specific day.",
              "Take a few minutes and think through which proteins you should use first, based on what will last longer in your fridge.",
              "For example, our Prep Dish menus usually include 1 seafood meal and we always schedule this meal first on the weekly menu.",
              "Why?",
              "Because fish does not last long in the fridge.",
              "It's really best the day you buy it or the next day.",
              "An exception of course is frozen shrimp or fish, which gives you a lot more flexibility!",
              "Use the below chart to determine how long you can generally expect your proteins to stay fresh in the fridge, as well as signs to look for when they're starting to spoil.",
              "Don't forget to check the \u201cuse-by\u201d date too though!",
              "You never know how long your meat has been sitting in the grocery store before you bring it home, so that's an important step to make sure it's still fresh.",
              "It's also important, of course, to understand how long your cooked proteins stay fresh in the fridge.",
              "I'm a big fan of the \u201ccook once, eat twice\u201d strategy.",
              "In other words, I love cooking a big roast or a whole chicken and using it in different ways throughout the week.",
              "If you do this though, make sure not to let too many days go by before using the rest of the meat.",
              "You wouldn't want to cook a roast on Sunday and serve it again on Friday because it won't be as fresh.",
              "If you feel overwhelmed by trying to use up all of your fresh meat before it spoils, try buying frozen meat.",
              "I personally love using ButcherBox so my freezer is always stocked with a great selection of high-quality meat.",
              "I just pull out what I need a couple of days before I plan to cook.",
              "Alternatively, if you prefer purchasing your meat directly from the grocery store, consider sticking some in the freezer when you get home.",
              "That way you won't have to worry about it spoiling before you can use it.",
              "One more note on proteins \u2013 I know Meatless Monday is a popular thing to do, but if you grocery shop on the weekends, I recommend Meatless Fridays instead!",
              "This lets you use up all of those fresh proteins earlier in the week while they're still fresh, and then turn to things like beans or a vegetarian pasta dish later in the week.",
              "Looking for some vegetarian recipes to get you started?",
              "Try my Black Bean Chili Mac or my Southwest Buddha Bowls!",
              "Just like meat, your produce is only going to last so long once you bring it home.",
              "There are, however, things you can do to keep it fresh and avoid throwing anything away.",
              "First, try to get a mix of items that expire quickly and those that last longer.",
              "We go through a lot of fruit in my house with two little ones around.",
              "I love giving them fresh berries but they don't usually stay fresh long.",
              "I mix in longer-lasting fruits like apples and clementines to make sure we have fruit all week long.",
              "Frozen fruit is of course a great choice as well!",
              "To give you a better understanding of which fruits and veggies last the longest, here is a chart of what you can expect: Another strategy is to not wash all of your produce at once.",
              "I know, I know, this goes against one of my number one meal prep tips, to prep your produce right when you get home from the grocery store.",
              "And you should totally do that.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "with a few exceptions.",
              "If you'd like your berries to last longer, wait to wash and trim them until sooner before you plan to eat.",
              "In particular, wait to wash raspberries, blueberries and grapes until soon before you eat them to maximize shelf-life.",
              "If you love meal prep as much as I do, you're likely used to prepping grains, sauces and marinades on your prep day.",
              "But how soon is too soon?",
              "Can you prep a marinade for a dish you don't plan to make until the very end of the week?",
              "Here's a visual of how long you can expect some common grains and \u201cextras\u201d to last: One note here \u2013 make sure to store salad dressings and marinades in the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature before you use them.",
              "This is especially important if they include raw garlic.",
              "Mixed with olive oil, raw garlic can cause botulism if not refrigerated!",
              "Depending on the meal plan, our Prep Dish meal plans include 4-5 dinners per week.",
              "Why not 7?",
              "For most families, I find that 4-5 planned dinner recipes is enough.",
              "Between leftovers and takeout/dining out, there are usually some nights when you don't need to cook a whole new recipe.",
              "Planning for these leftover nights is key if you want to avoid food waste!",
              "One tip on using up leftovers \u2013 If you don't have enough leftover from any one meal to feed your family, that's okay!",
              "Lay out leftovers from three or four meals buffet-style and let each person choose what they want.",
              "Plans don't always work out how we envision them.",
              "Maybe you planned on a big pot of beef stew lasting two nights but everyone loved it and it's almost gone.",
              "Or maybe you thought you'd cook your chicken on Tuesday but you now have a bunch of leftovers to use up instead.",
              "Make a habit of checking in halfway through the week to see how your meal plan is coming along.",
              "This way, you can either prioritize using up something that's going to go bad soon OR stick it in the freezer!",
              "I love having a fully stocked freezer.",
              "If everyone is sick of lasagna, freeze individual slices and pull it out next month when it's fresh again.",
              "Of if you know you won't cook that chicken in time, stick it in the freezer and you'll have one less thing to buy for the next week's meal plan, always a plus!",
              "Understanding how long both raw and cooked food lasts in the fridge can really help you keep your beautiful groceries out of the compost bin!",

              "Review: Too Good To Go, the App That Offers Food Deals to Cut ... - Eater",
              "Filed under: Can an app promising discount, end-of-day goods make a dent in America\u2019s food waste problem?",
              "When I was 12 years old, I had a brief and desultory career as a babysitter.",
              "I counted the minutes until the kids went to bed and I could make good on their parents\u2019 offer: Eat whatever snacks you like.",
              "I have no memory of the money I made or the families I worked for, but I do remember the thrill of opening other people\u2019s kitchen cabinets to find a wealth of surprise treats.",
              "Surprise snacks are one of life\u2019s little delights \u2014 and little motivators.",
              "Now, in a bid to reduce food waste, an app is using the appeal of cheap, unexpected food to motivate consumers to buy items restaurants would otherwise throw away.",
              "Too Good To Go, which launched in 2015 in Denmark and has since raised more than $45 million in funding, allows users to purchase \u201csurprise bags\u201d of food otherwise marked for the trash from restaurants and other local businesses.",
              "Every purchase, usually between $3 to $6, is described as \u201crescuing\u201d: Customers get the chance to ensure \u201cgood food gets eaten,\u201d while businesses get the chance to recoup sunk costs and find new customers.",
              "The app\u2019s marketing notes that 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions are due to food waste, and claims to have saved \u201c164 million meals\u201d in its six years of operation (a representative for the company says the app defines a meal as one surprise bag).",
              "In an era of inflation and higher food costs, the app also touts the fact that it helps customers to buy food at a third of the cost of retail price.",
              "In Los Angeles, where the service launched last month to much fanfare, it\u2019s difficult to put a whole meal together from Too Good To Go.",
              "The app is currently populated mostly with coffee shops, doughnut shops, bakeries, panaderias, bagel shops, and the occasional pizzeria (a representative says the company is actively recruiting new stores, which they do over the phone or email in order \u201cto have great conversations with businesses about the issue of food waste.",
              "\u201d) As a meal, a doughnut or a croissant doesn\u2019t usually cut it, but as food waste, baked goods are in desperate need of \u201crescuing,\u201d since they don\u2019t last more than a day, and many bakeries err on the side of maintaining full cases even if demand doesn\u2019t keep up.",
              "Right now in Los Angeles, the app functions largely as a virtuous excuse to eat pastries.",
              "I was more than up for the challenge.",
              "For my first pickup, I selected El Mana\u2019s Bakery in Koreatown, which specializes in Salvadoran pan dulce, which I had never tried before.",
              "After circling the block too many times trying to find parking, I threw on my flashers and ducked inside right before the end of my pickup window at 7 p.",
              "m.",
              "(Most of the bags have a set time window when you can pick up, usually at the close of the day: afternoons for bakeries or late at night for pizzerias or the few participating restaurants.)",
              "The bakery sells to wholesalers as well, and two men inside were already loading a delivery truck.",
              "When I presented my app screen, a mildly bewildered employee called his boss and asked what pastries to give me, filling a bag while wandering the store on the phone.",
              "My haul was huge \u2014 cookies, sweet and plain croissant-like cachitos, and slices of a jam-filled cake called semita pacha;",
              "the pacha was especially satisfying, dense with a filling of sweet jam that might have been fig, like an especially decadent Newton.",
              "Next, I tried picking up some actual food waste.",
              "A vegan frozen yogurt place \u2014 Yoga-Urt, they have three locations \u2014 offered a 5-pound bag of almond pulp, which consists of the leftover bit of almonds used for making milk.",
              "It\u2019s basically a damp almond flour, and there are lots of recipes to use it up, ranging from promising (brownie balls) to horrifying (almond pulp hummus).",
              "To keep things from veering into wellness territory, I also stopped by Angelino\u2019s Donuts nearby in Echo Park.",
              "For a third of the regular price, I received a full dozen doughnuts packed into a box, including a big apple fritter.",
              "It was around this time that \u201crescuing food waste\u201d started to feel more complicated.",
              "This abundance of cheap pastries hammered home how much food waste was occurring daily in Los Angeles, a fact I know intellectually but felt very deeply when seeing how little a dent my hauls were making: When I left El Mana\u2019s, plenty of pan dulce still filled the shelves;",
              "the doughnut shop\u2019s pastry case was half-full at 4 p.",
              "m.",
              ", hours after the morning doughnut rush.",
              "The other issue was that the food waste had been not so much eliminated as transferred from the businesses to me, and it was hard not to waste it myself.",
              "My household is two people, and we were racking up a lot of pastries.",
              "I put the Salvadoran margarita cookies and some of the leftover cachito dulces out front for the kids leaving our local elementary school and took my second of two semita pachas to a friend\u2019s house.",
              "After sampling a couple of doughnuts from our haul from Angelino\u2019s, I texted my neighbors and asked if their teenagers would like the rest (the answer is always yes).",
              "I used a cup of the almond pulp to make some vaguely chocolatey date-and-coconut brownie bites, which were satisfying, but there is still a nearly full bag of pulp in my freezer.",
              "My account in Too Good To Go says I\u2019ve \u201csaved\u201d six bags of food and 33 pounds of CO2e, but that\u2019s only if I didn\u2019t throw out any of the food I picked up.",
              "I have to confess: I did.",
              "The surprise bag from DK\u2019s Donuts, a delightful, instagrammy doughnut shop in Santa Monica, came with six doughnuts stale from the night before, crammed into a bag that smudged the camera-ready frosting, of which we ate one and a half and didn\u2019t have the heart to offer to anyone else.",
              "A pickup of leftover bread from Santa Monica cheese shop Lady & Larder fueled a great cheese plate and some sandwiches, though this required that I spend real money on pasteurized sheep\u2019s milk cheese and honey mustard pickles.",
              "But by day three the sliced bread had molded (I should have put some in the freezer).",
              "Instead of making me feel like I was doing good for the world, Too Good To Go was making me feel terrible about both the state of food waste and myself.",
              "Maybe that is helpful.",
              "It\u2019s a crime we don\u2019t have a good system for selling all this extra food cheaply or giving it away.",
              "But my spree of rescuing surprise bags did not feel like it was that solution.",
              "To assuage this guilt and discomfort, I clicked on the app\u2019s \u201cgive to charity\u201d option, hoping to be able to give away some of this surplus food to people who needed it more than me.",
              "But you can\u2019t gift surprise bags from the app \u2014 instead, you can give money to a local food waste charity.",
              "A representative for the app says this charity option is available because, as a part of its overall mission, it \u201cmakes it a priority to work hand-in-hand with partners fighting food insecurity and hunger throughout the U.",
              "S.",
              "\u201d The app has two uses as far as I can tell;",
              "one sensible, one a bit more frivolous.",
              "If you were having a big group of people over and wanted to give them treats on the cheap, using it to hit up a doughnut shop or panaderia could be a great choice, and might help save a few doughnuts from the dumpster.",
              "Obviously, this move would be much more useful for people with bigger families or households.",
              "On TikTok, a lot of people in their 20s unbox their Too Good To Go orders with glee, and if I still lived with four other roommates, this app would be a great way of bribing them not to be quite so mad I left my dirty dishes in the sink again.",
              "The other more frivolous use is as an avenue of discovery, or even indulgence.",
              "The utter unpredictability of what I would get in my surprise bags made using Too Good To Go alternately delightful and disappointing, but it was often fun.",
              "In other words, these bags are a classic intermittent reward, the same kind that keeps rats pushing levers and us scrolling social media.",
              "Using the app in this manner might help businesses recoup some food costs, but at least for me, it didn\u2019t stop the actual food waste.",
              "I don\u2019t buy two loaves of bread or a dozen doughnuts for two people on purpose, because I would probably end up wasting them.",
              "My zeal for acquiring the same amount of food on the cheap resembled the general logic of sales: Stores put them on not to clear out merchandise but because they entice consumers to buy things they otherwise don\u2019t really want or need.",
              "Nothing wrong with day-old pastries on sale.",
              "But Too Good To Go\u2019s lofty marketing \u2014 the company says their ambition is \u201cto contribute in every way we can to building the global food waste movement\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t align with my experience.",
              "That said, deals are hard to resist, and I feel for those abandoned doughnuts.",
              "I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll keep popping the app open around Los Angeles hoping for an especially good score, even if I can\u2019t kid myself that I\u2019m doing anything more than gambling on pastries and hoping for an especially good surprise.",
              "Correction, May 19, 2023: A previous version of this article misstated that Too Good to Go launched in the U.",

              "How Data-Driven Technology Solutions Can Curb Restaurant Food Waste",
              "Food waste is a concerning, albeit familiar, issue in the restaurant industry.",
              "An estimated one-third of all food is lost across various industries, equating to nearly $100 billion in value every year.",
              "Similarly, 70 percent of food loss occurs without ever ending up in front of a customer.",
              "In the restaurant industry specifically, food costs account for one of the largest Costs of Goods Sold (COGS) next to labor.",
              "As restaurants look to reduce expenses and increase profitability, it only makes sense that food costs and associated food waste is a potential area of opportunity.",
              "What exactly is food waste?",
              "The simple answer is that any food whether ingredients, prepared or spoiled that was paid for and is thrown away constitutes food waste.",
              "When reviewing a restaurant\u2019s operation, you have two areas of food waste generation.",
              "The front of house and back of house operations.",
              "Your front of the house staff are in charge of communicating with customers and, in turn, communicating with kitchen and bar staff.",
              "If a breakdown in communication occurs, food can go to waste due to improper preparation from presenting something the customer did not order.",
              "On average, 17 percent of your guest\u2019s meal stays on their plate, which is another area of food waste generation sometimes linked to portion sizes.",
              "Typically, more food waste is generated in the back of house of a restaurant rather than front of house.",
              "This is good news for restaurant operators as the very essence of the restaurant business is food production giving you more control over this area.",
              "The back of the house staff are in charge of ingredients from ordering, dating, and inventory to spoilage.",
              "In addition, over-cooking, under-cooking and scraps as a byproduct of meal preparation all happen in the back of house.",
              "Even the industry\u2019s best operators have the opportunity to review their operations to reduce food costs and food waste in light of recent events.",
              "With bans placed on in-person dining, limited occupancy levels, increased delivery/carryout orders and stressed supply chains, the challenge to reduce expense and food waste can be daunting.",
              "So what exactly can your business do to curb food waste generated onsite?",
              "Often, restaurant owners do not have an accurate breakdown of what they have stored inside of their walk-in refrigerators, cellars, or freezers, which could lead to missed sell-by dates.",
              "Implementing an inventory management system can keep track of all ingredients ordered and kept within the restaurant.",
              "The data collected allows restaurant owners to analyze popular menu dishes and decide which ingredients to buy in bulk for savings, as well as which items are not being fully utilized and, therefore, going to food waste.",
              "Related: Restaurant Technology News Announces the Winners of Its Choice Awards for Environmental Good A key to being able to change behavior related to food waste is being able to manage, monitor and track data related to the waste being generated.",
              "Services like Leanpath and Winnow, food waste tracking systems, allow you to see the amount of food discarded in your restaurant\u2019s kitchen.",
              "This data can help educate your staff in real-time about possible areas of opportunity.",
              "In both systems, photos of wasted food are captured as it\u2019s being thrown away.",
              "Additionally, the systems use a digital scale and corresponding software to calculate the weight of the food waste each time anything is thrown away.",
              "The weight is recorded, the user selects the reason for the waste and records the data.",
              "Reports can then be generated to identify potential trends and areas for cost reduction.",
              "Another solution could be Wise Up on Waste which is a mobile application that allows users to track food waste to highlight the average volume of each type of waste (spoilage, preparation, or customer plate waste) generated per \u2018day part\u2019 (breakfast, lunch, and dinner).",
              "Compatible with iOS and Android devices, as well as free from the Apple Store and Google Play, Wise Up on Waste is a viable and cost-effective solution to restaurants needing an answer to their food waste problem, but not necessarily in a place to spend a lot of money.",
              "While prevention is the single best weapon against food waste yielding the best overall cost reduction and impact on the bottom line, it is unrealistic to expect that you will eliminate food waste completely.",
              "When food waste does occur, the first step should be to attempt to donate the food to local food shelters.",
              "Liability is waived under the Good Samaritan law and typically restaurants can benefit from tax savings and reduced disposal costs.",
              "If the food is inedible and thus must be discarded, alternative options such as animal feed and composting may provide a more cost-effective disposal method vs. the traditional landfill.",
              "While bandwidth to tackle this type of program may be hard to come by the payback can be significant.",
              "A reduction of even five to ten percent of your overall food costs could provide your restaurant with a nice boost to profitability.",
