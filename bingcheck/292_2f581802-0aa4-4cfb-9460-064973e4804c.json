    "query": "What is the most significant archaeological discovery in recent years that has challenged our understanding of ancient civilizations, and how has this discovery impacted the field of archaeology?",
    "response": "That is a very interesting and broad question. There are many archaeological discoveries that have challenged our understanding of ancient civilizations, and each one has impacted the field of archaeology in different ways. Here are some examples of such discoveries:\n\n- **Gobekli Tepe**[^7^]: This is a site in Turkey that dates back to about 11,000 years ago, predating Stonehenge by 6,000 years. It consists of massive carved stones arranged in circles, some of which have elaborate animal motifs. It is considered to be the world's first temple and a \"cathedral on a hill\". It challenges the conventional view that complex religious structures emerged only after the development of agriculture and sedentary societies. It also suggests that hunter-gatherers had a sophisticated social organization and symbolic system.\n\n- **The lost golden city**[^6^]: This is a 3,000-year-old city that was discovered near Luxor in Egypt in 2021. It was built by Amenhotep III, the grandfather of Tutankhamun, and was later used by his son Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti. It is one of the largest and most intact ancient cities ever found in Egypt, and it reveals details about the daily life, administration, industry, and trade of the pharaohs and their subjects. It also sheds light on a turbulent period of Egyptian history marked by religious and political changes.\n\n- **The Taung Child**[^10^]: This is a 3-year-old child's skull that was found in South Africa in 1924. It belongs to an ancient group of hominins called australopithecines, who lived about 2.5 million years ago. It was the first evidence of a human ancestor that had both ape-like and human-like features, such as a small brain but a bipedal posture. It challenged the prevailing idea that human evolution began in Europe or Asia, and that brain size was the primary factor in human development. It also sparked the search for more fossils of early hominins in Africa.\n\nThese are just some examples of archaeological discoveries that have challenged our understanding of ancient civilizations, and how they have impacted the field of archaeology. There are many more to explore and learn from.",

              "Reshaping previous ideas on the story of civilisation, Gobekli Tepe in Turkey was built by a prehistoric people 6,000 years before Stonehenge.",
              "When German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt first began excavating on a Turkish mountaintop 25 years ago, he was convinced the buildings he uncovered were unusual, even unique.",
              "Atop a limestone plateau near Urfa called Gobekli Tepe, Turkish for \"Belly Hill\", Schmidt discovered more than 20 circular stone enclosures.",
              "The largest was 20m across, a circle of stone with two elaborately carved pillars 5.",
              "5m tall at its centre.",
              "The carved stone pillars \u2013 eerie, stylised human figures with folded hands and fox-pelt belts \u2013 weighed up to 10 tons.",
              "Carving and erecting them must have been a tremendous technical challenge for people who hadn't yet domesticated animals or invented pottery, let alone metal tools.",
              "The structures were 11,000 years old, or more, making them humanity's oldest known monumental structures, built not for shelter but for some other purpose.",
              "After a decade of work, Schmidt reached a remarkable conclusion.",
              "When I visited his dig house in Urfa's old town in 2007, Schmidt \u2013 then working for the German Archaeological Institute \u2013 told me Gobekli Tepe could help rewrite the story of civilisation by explaining the reason humans started farming and began living in permanent settlements.",
              "The stone tools and other evidence Schmidt and his team found at the site showed that the circular enclosures had been built by hunter-gatherers, living off the land the way humans had since before the last Ice Age.",
              "Tens of thousands of animal bones that were uncovered were from wild species, and there was no evidence of domesticated grains or other plants.",
              "Schmidt thought these hunter-gatherers had come together 11,500 years ago to carve Gobekli Tepe's T-shaped pillars with stone tools, using the limestone bedrock of the hill beneath their feet as a quarry.",
              "Carving and moving the pillars would have been a tremendous task, but perhaps not as difficult as it seems at first glance.",
              "The pillars are carved from the natural limestone layers of the hill's bedrock.",
              "Limestone is soft enough to work with the flint or even wood tools available at the time, given practice and patience.",
              "And because the hill's limestone formations were horizontal layers between 0.",
              "6m and 1.",
              "5m thick, archaeologists working at the site believe ancient builders just had to cut away the excess from the sides, rather than from underneath as well.",
              "Once a pillar was carved out, they then shifted it a few hundred metres across the hilltop, using rope, log beams and ample manpower.",
              "You may also be interested in: \u2022 The Maya's ingenious sercret to survival \u2022 Turkey's mysterious portal to the universe \u2022 Switzerland's gravity-defying solution Schmidt thought that small, nomadic bands from across the region were motivated by their beliefs to join forces on the hilltop for periodic building projects, hold great feasts and then scatter again.",
              "The site, Schmidt argued, was a ritual centre, perhaps some sort of burial or death cult complex, rather than a settlement.",
              "That was a big claim.",
              "Archaeologists had long thought complex ritual and organised religion were luxuries that societies developed only once they began domesticating crops and animals, a transition known as the Neolithic.",
              "Once they had a food surplus, the thinking went, they could devote their extra resources to rituals and monuments.",
              "Gobekli Tepe, Schmidt told me, turned that timeline upside down.",
              "The stone tools at the site, backed up by radiocarbon dates, placed it firmly in the pre-Neolithic era.",
              "More than 25 years after the first excavations there, there is still no evidence for domesticated plants or animals.",
              "And Schmidt didn't think anyone lived at the site full-time.",
              "He called it a \"cathedral on a hill\".",
              "If that was true, it showed that complex ritual and social organisation actually came before settlement and agriculture.",
              "Over the course of 1,000 years, the demands of gathering nomadic bands together in one place to carve and move huge T-pillars and build the circular enclosures prompted people to take the next step: to regularly host large gatherings, people needed to make food supplies more predictable and dependable by domesticating plants and animals.",
              "Ritual and religion, it seemed, launched the Neolithic Revolution.",
              "The next day, I drove with Schmidt to the hilltop before dawn.",
              "I wandered, mystified and awestruck, among the pillars as Schmidt, his head wrapped in a white cloth to protect it from the blazing sun, oversaw a small team of German archaeologists and workers from the small village down the road.",
              "Schmidt had just published his first reports on Gobekli Tepe the year before, setting the small world of Neolithic archaeology experts abuzz.",
              "But the site still had a sleepy, forgotten feel, with excavation areas covered by makeshift corrugated steel roofs and potholed dirt roads winding up to the mountaintop dig site from the valley below.",
              "Schmidt's take on the site's striking T-pillars and large, round \"special buildings\" captivated colleagues and journalists when they were first published in the mid-2000s.",
              "Breathless media reports called the site the birthplace of religion;",
              "the German magazine Der Spiegel compared the fertile grasslands around the site to the Garden of Eden.",
              "Soon, people from around the world were flocking to see Gobekli Tepe for themselves.",
              "Within a decade, the hilltop was totally transformed.",
              "Until the civil war in nearby Syria disrupted tourism in the region in 2012, work on the site often slowed to a crawl as busloads of curious tourists crowded around open excavation trenches to see what some were calling the world's first temple and made it impossible to manoeuvre wheelbarrows on the narrow paths.",
              "Over the past five years, the mountaintop on the outskirts of Urfa has been reshaped once again.",
              "Today, roads and car parks and a visitor's centre can accommodate curious travellers from around the world.",
              "In 2017, corrugated steel sheds were replaced by a state-of-the art, swooping fabric-and-steel shelter covering the central monumental buildings.",
              "The S\u0327anl\u0131urfa Archaeology and Mosaic Museum, built in 2015 in central Urfa, is one of Turkey's largest museums;",
              "it features a full-scale replica of the site's largest enclosure and its imposing T-pillars, allowing visitors to get a feel for the monumental pillars and examine their carvings up close.",
              "In 2018, Gobekli Tepe was added to the Unesco World Heritage register, and Turkish tourism officials declared 2019 the \"Year of Gobekli Tepe\", making the ancient site the face of its global promotion campaign.",
              "\"I still remember the site as a remote place on a mountaintop,\" said Jens Notroff, a German Archaeological Institute archaeologist who began working at the site as a student in the mid-2000s.",
              "\"It's changed completely.\"",
              "Schmidt, who died in 2014, didn't live to see the site's transformation from dusty mountaintop dig to major tourist attraction.",
              "But his discoveries there spurred global interest in the Neolithic transition \u2013 and in the last few years, new discoveries at Gobekli Tepe and closer looks at the results of earlier excavations are upending Schmidt's initial interpretations of the site itself.",
              "Work on foundations needed to support the site's swooping fabric canopy required archaeologists to dig deeper that Schmidt ever had.",
              "Under the direction of Schmidt's successor, Lee Clare, a German Archaeological Institute team dug several \"keyhole\" trenches down to the site's bedrock, several metres below the floors of the large buildings.",
              "\"We had a unique chance,\" Clare said, \"to go look in the lowest layers and deposits of the site.\"",
              "What Clare and his colleagues found may rewrite prehistory yet again.",
              "The digs revealed evidence of houses and year-round settlement, suggesting that Gobekli Tepe wasn't an isolated temple visited on special occasions but a rather a thriving village with large special buildings at its centre.",
              "The team also identified a large cistern and channels for collecting rainwater, key to supporting a settlement on the dry mountaintop, and thousands of grinding tools for processing grain for cooking porridge and brewing beer.",
              "\"Gobekli Tepe is still a unique, special site, but the new insights fit better with what we know from other sites,\" Clare said.",
              "\"It was a fully-fledged settlement with permanent occupation.",
              "It's changed our whole understanding of the site.\"",
              "Meanwhile, Turkish archaeologists working in the rugged countryside around Urfa have identified at least a dozen other hill-top sites with similar \u2013 if smaller \u2013 T-pillars, dating from around the same time period.",
              "\"It's not a unique temple,\" said Austrian Archaeological Institute researcher Barbara Horejs, an expert on the Neolithic who was not part of the recent research efforts.",
              "\"That makes the story much more interesting and exciting.\"",

              "The settlement was inhabited from c.",
              "9500 to at least 8000 BCE,[6] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic.",
              "It is famous for its large circular structures that contain massive stone pillars\u2014the world's oldest known megaliths.",
              "Many of these pillars are decorated with anthropomorphic details, clothing, and sculptural reliefs of wild animals, providing archaeologists rare insights into prehistoric religion and the particular iconography of the period.",
              "The 15 m (50 ft)-high, 8 ha (20-acre) tell is densely covered with ancient domestic structures[7] and other small buildings, quarries, and stone-cut cisterns from the Neolithic, as well as some traces of activity from later periods.",
              "The site was first used at the dawn of the Southwest Asian Neolithic period, which marked the appearance of the oldest permanent human settlements anywhere in the world.",
              "Prehistorians link this Neolithic Revolution to the advent of agriculture, but disagree on whether farming caused people to settle down or vice versa.",
              "Go\u0308bekli Tepe, a monumental complex built on the top of a rocky mountaintop, with no clear evidence of agricultural cultivation produced to date, has played a prominent role in this debate.",
              "Current excavators interpret Go\u0308bekli Tepe as a settlement, based on recent findings such as domestic structures and features, water supply installations, and Neolithic tools associated with domestic use.",
              "[8] The site's original excavator Klaus Schmidt had described it as a sanctuary used by groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers from a wide area, with few or no permanent inhabitants.",
              "[1] No definitive purpose has been determined for the megalithic enclosures;",
              "Schmidt had described them as the \"world's first temple[s]\" that were intentionally and ritually backfilled.",
              "However, recent stratigraphic studies revealed that they had been filled by slope slide events, and were sometimes repaired and modified thereafter.",
              "[9] The site was first noted in a survey in 1963.",
              "Schmidt recognized its significance in 1994 and began excavations there the following year.",
              "After his death in 2014, work continued as a joint project of Istanbul University, S\u0327anl\u0131urfa Museum, and the German Archaeological Institute, under the direction of Turkish prehistorian Necmi Karul.",
              "Go\u0308bekli Tepe was designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as \"one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture\".",
              "[10] As of 2021[update], less than 5% of the site had been excavated.",
              "[11] Go\u0308bekli Tepe is located in the Tas\u0327 Tepeler ('Stone Hills'), in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains.",
              "[12] It overlooks the Harran plain and the headwaters of the Balikh River, a tributary of the Euphrates.",
              "[12] The site is a tell (artificial mound) situated on a flat limestone plateau.",
              "[13] In the north, the plateau is connected to the neighbouring mountains by a narrow promontory.",
              "In all other directions, the ridge descends steeply into slopes and steep cliffs.",
              "[14] Like most Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) sites in the Urfa region, Go\u0308bekli Tepe was built on a high point on the edge of the mountains, giving it both a wide view over the plain beneath, and good visibility from the plain.",
              "[15] This location also gave the builders good access to raw material: the soft limestone bedrock from which the complex was built, and the flint to make the tools to work the limestone.",
              "[15] Excavations have taken place at the southern slope of the tell, south, and west of a mulberry that marks an Islamic pilgrimage,[16] but archaeological finds come from the entire plateau.",
              "The team has also found many remains of tools.",
              "At the western escarpment, a small cave has been discovered in which a small relief depicting a bovid was found.",
              "It is the only relief found in this cave.",
              "[17] Go\u0308bekli Tepe was built and occupied during the earliest part of the Southwest Asian Neolithic, known as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN, c.",
              "9600\u20137000 BCE).",
              "[18] Beginning at the end of the last Ice Age, the PPN marks \"the beginnings of village life\",[19] producing the earliest evidence for permanent human settlements in the world.",
              "[19][20] Elements of village life appeared as early as 10,000 years before the Neolithic in places,[21][22] and the transition to agriculture took thousands of years, with different paces and trajectories in different regions.",
              "[23][24] Archaeologists divide the Pre-Pottery Neolithic into two subperiods: the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA, c.",
              "9600\u20138800 BCE) and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB, c.",
              "8800 and 7000 BCE).",
              "[20] The earliest phases at Go\u0308bekli Tepe have been dated to the PPNA;",
              "later phases to the PPNB.",
              "[25] PPN villages consisted mainly of clusters of stone or mud brick houses,[19] but sometimes also substantial monuments and large buildings.",
              "[20] These include the tower and walls at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho), as well as large, roughly contemporaneous circular buildings at Go\u0308bekli Tepe, Neval\u0131 C\u0327ori, C\u0327ayo\u0308nu\u0308, Wadi Feynan 16, Jerf el-Ahmar, Tell 'Abr 3, and Tepe Asiab.",
              "[26] Archaeologists typically associate these structures with communal activities which, together with the communal effort needed to build them, helped to maintain social interactions in PPN communities as they grew in size.",
              "[27] The T-shaped pillar tradition seen at Go\u0308bekli Tepe is unique to the Urfa region, but is found at the majority of PPN sites there.",
              "[28] These include Neval\u0131 C\u0327ori, Hamzan Tepe,[29] Karahan Tepe,[30] Harbetsuvan Tepesi,[31] Sefer Tepe,[28] and Tasl\u0131 Tepe.",
              "[32] Other stone stelae\u2014without the characteristic T shape\u2014have been documented at contemporary sites further afield, including C\u0327ayo\u0308nu\u0308, Qermez Dere, and Gusir Ho\u0308yu\u0308k.",
              "[33] At the time when Go\u0308bekli Tepe was occupied, the climate of the area was warmer and wetter than it is today.",
              "[13] It was surrounded by an open steppe grassland,[13] with abundant wild cereals, including einkorn, wheat, and barley,[34] and herds of grazing animals such as wild sheep, wild goat, gazelle, and equids.",
              "[35] Large herds of goitered gazelle may have passed by the site in seasonal migrations.",
              "[36] There is no evidence of substantial woodlands nearby;",
              "[13] 90% of the charcoal recovered at the site was from pistachio or almond trees.",
              "[37] Archaeologists have long associated the appearance of these settlements with the Neolithic Revolution\u2014the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture\u2014but disagree on whether the adoption of farming caused people to settle down, or settling down caused people to adopt farming.",
              "[38] Despite the name, the Neolithic Revolution in Southwest Asia was \"drawn out and locally variable\".",
              "[39] Evidence indicates the inhabitants of Go\u0308bekli Tepe were hunter-gatherers who supplemented their diet with early forms of domesticated cereal and lived in villages for at least part of the year.",
              "Tools such as grinding stones and mortars and pestles found at the site have been analyzed and suggest considerable cereal processing.",
              "Archaeozoological evidence hints at \"large-scale hunting of gazelle between midsummer and autumn.\"",
              "[40] The village acquired drinking water through a rainwater harvesting system, consisting of carved channels[41] that fed several cisterns carved into the bedrock under the site,[42] which could hold at least 150 cubic metres (5,300 cu ft) of water.",
              "[40][43] Additionally, the local water table may have been higher, activating springs closer to the site that are dormant today.",
              "[44] Radiocarbon dating shows that the earliest exposed structures at Go\u0308bekli Tepe were built between 9500 and 9000 BCE, towards the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period.",
              "[9][25] The site was significantly expanded in the early 9th millennium BCE and remained in use until around 8000 BCE, or perhaps slightly later (the early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, PPNB).",
              "[25] There is evidence that smaller groups returned to live amongst the ruins after the Neolithic structures were abandoned.",
              "[25] Schmidt originally dated the site to the PPN based on the types of stone tools found there, considering a PPNA date \"most probable\".",
              "[45] Establishing its absolute chronology took longer due to methodological challenges.",
              "[46][47] Though the first two radiocarbon dates were published in 1998,[48] these and other samples from the fill of the structure dated to the late 10th and early 9th millennium \u2013 500 to 1000 years later than expected for a PPNA site.",
              "[46] Schmidt's team explained the discrepancy in light of their theory that this material was brought to the site from elsewhere when it was abandoned, and so was not representative of the actual use of the structures.",
              "[46][47] They instead turned to a novel method of dating organic material preserved in the plaster on the structure's walls, which resulted in dates more consistent with a PPNA occupation, in the middle or even early 10th-millennium BCE.",
              "[49][50][9] Subsequent research led to a significant revision of Schmidt's chronology, including the abandonment of the hypothesis that the fill of the structures was brought from elsewhere, and a recognition that direct dates on plaster are affected by the old wood effect.",
              "[51] Together with new radiocarbon dates, this has established the site's absolute chronology as falling in the period 9500 to 8000 BCE \u2013 the late PPNA and PPNB.",
              "[1][52] The preliminary, now abandoned,[53] stratigraphic model by Klaus Schmidt consisted of three architectural layers.",
              "The large circular enclosures were attributed to Layer III, dated to the 10th millennium BCE (PPNA).",
              "The smaller rectangular structures and the abandonment of the site were assigned to Layer II in the 9th millennium BCE (early to middle PPNB).",
              "Layer I consisted of all post-Neolithic activities up to the modern surface.",
              "[9] The revised chronology consists of eight phases that span at least 1,500 years.",
              "It details the history of the large circular enclosures, including events that led to their alteration or abandonment, and the evolution of the domestic buildings surrounding them.",
              "[54] At this early stage of the site's history, circular compounds first appear.",
              "They range from 10 to 30 m (33 to 98 ft) in diameter.",
              "Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone.",
              "Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far.",
              "Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all.",
              "The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100 m (330 ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.",
              "[56] The pillars are the oldest known megaliths in the world.",
              "[57] Two taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle.",
              "Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain.",
              "Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior.",
              "[58] Many of the pillars are decorated with abstract, enigmatic pictograms and carved animal reliefs.",
              "The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from Neolithic cave paintings elsewhere.",
              "The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelle, and donkeys;",
              "snakes and other reptiles;",
              "arthropods such as insects and arachnids;",
              "and birds, particularly vultures.",
              "At the time the edifice was constructed, the surrounding country was likely to have been forested and capable of sustaining this variety of wildlife, before millennia of human settlement and cultivation led to the near\u2013Dust Bowl conditions prevalent today.",
              "[59] Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of C\u0327atalho\u0308yu\u0308k and Jericho.",
              "Few humanoid figures have appeared in the art at Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "Some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half, however, suggesting to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylized humans (or perhaps deities).",
              "Loincloths appear on the lower half of a few pillars.",
              "The horizontal stone slab on top is thought by Schmidt to symbolize shoulders, which suggests that the figures were left headless.",
              "[60] Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolize venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is not known.",
              "Some of the floors in this, the oldest, layer are made of terrazzo (burnt lime);",
              "others are bedrock from which pedestals to hold the large pair of central pillars were carved in high relief.",
              "[61] Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles around 9000 BCE.",
              "Later enclosures were rectangular in shape, perhaps to make more efficient use of space compared with circular structures.",
              "They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic,[62] but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings continued to serve the same function in the culture,[63] during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB).",
              "The several adjoining rectangular, doorless, and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of Roman terrazzo floors.",
              "Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.",
              "[64] Several T-pillars up to 1.",
              "5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name \"lion pillar building\" by which their enclosure is known.",
              "[65] Enclosure B Enclosure C Enclosure F The enclosures, lying over 10 metres (33 ft) below the highest areas of the settlement, were subject to several slope slide events during the occupation period of Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "[66] A particularly severe one occurred at the end early PPNB.",
              "which inundated enclosure D with rubble of domestic structures and sediments, including burials and midden deposits.",
              "This caused severe damage to the enclosure, which led to repairs and stabilization works to be conducted.",
              "At a later point, in Building Phase 5, terrace walls were erected, likely to prevent future damage from such events.",
              "These measures, however, proved futile, when a second major slope slide probably caused the enclosure to the abandoned during Building Phase 6, around the late 9th millennium BC.",
              "Other enclosure suffered a similar fate, which might have led to new enclosures being constructed to replace them.",
              "[54] Previously, it had been assumed that the large enclosures were intentionally back-filled, an interpretation that has fallen out of favor since Klaus Schmidt's death.",
              "[67] In the earliest occupation phase, round-oval domestic structures were built alongside the large enclosures, which indicate a (semi) sedentary lifestyle.",
              "Over time there was an increasing tendency of these buildings to have a rectangular floor plan.",
              "In the final settlement phase only small structures were erected.",
              "[54] Before any burials were found, Schmidt speculated that graves could have been located in niches behind the walls of the circular building.",
              "[59] In 2017, fragments of human crania with incisions were discovered at the site, interpreted as a manifestation of the widespread Neolithic skull cult.",
              "[18] Special preparation of human crania in the form of plastered human skulls is known from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period at sites such as 'Ain Mallaha, Tell es-Sultan (also known as Jericho), and Yiftahel.",
              "[citation needed] At the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found.",
              "In this area, flint and limestone fragments occur more frequently.",
              "It was, therefore, suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.",
              "[68] It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three phallic depictions from the surface of the southern plateau.",
              "They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.",
              "[17] Apart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars and a surrounding flat bench.",
              "This platform corresponds to the oldest parts of the tell.",
              "Continuing the naming pattern, it is called \"complex E\".",
              "Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at Neval\u0131 C\u0327ori it has also been called \"Temple of the Rock\".",
              "Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the terrazzo floors of the younger complexes at Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that are believed to be part of complex E.",
              "One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.",
              "[69] The uppermost layer of the tell is the shallowest but accounts for the longest stretch of time.",
              "It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually-uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center.",
              "Around the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE, Go\u0308bekli Tepe lost its importance.",
              "The advent of agriculture and animal husbandry brought new realities to human life in the area, and the \"Stone-age zoo\" apparently lost whatever significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities.",
              "The plateau Go\u0308bekli Tepe is situated on has been shaped by erosion and quarrying from the Neolithic onwards.",
              "There are four 10-metre-long (33 ft) and 20-centimetre-wide (7.",
              "9 in) channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken.",
              "These are possibly related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved.",
              "Presumably, this is the remains of a Roman watchtower that was part of the Limes Arabicus, though this is conjecture.",
              "[70] Most structures on the plateau seem to be the result of Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements.",
              "Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks then levered out of the rock bank.",
              "[70] Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified.",
              "Their status as quarries was confirmed by the find of a 3-by-3 metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau.",
              "Unequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered out of the bedrock.",
              "The largest of them lies on the northern plateau.",
              "It has a length of 7 m (23 ft) and its head has a width of 3 m (10 ft).",
              "Its weight may be around 50 tons.",
              "The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau.",
              "[citation needed] Archaeologists disagree on how much labour was needed to construct the site.",
              "Schmidt maintained that \"the work of quarrying, transporting, and erecting tons of heavy, monolithic, and almost universally well-prepared limestone pillars [.",
              ".",
              ".]",
              "was not within the capability of a few people\".",
              "[71] Using Thor Heyerdahl's experiments with the moai of Rapa Nui as a reference, he estimated that moving the pillars alone must have involved hundreds of people.",
              "[44] According to these experiments, one moai of similar size to a T-shaped pillar from Go\u0308bekli Tepe would have taken 20 people a year to carve, and 50\u201375 people a week to transport 15 km.",
              "[72] Schmidt's team has also cited a 1917 account of the construction of a megalith on the Indonesian island of Nias, which took 525 people three days.",
              "[44][72] These estimates underpin their interpretation that the site was built by a large, non-resident workforce,[73] coerced or enticed there by a small religious elite.",
              "[74][75] However, others estimate that just 7\u201314 people could have moved the pillars using ropes and water or another lubricant, with techniques used to construct other monuments such as Stonehenge.",
              "[44] Experiments at Go\u0308bekli Tepe itself have suggested that all the PPNB structures currently exposed could have been built by 12\u201324 people in less than four months, allowing for time spent quarrying stone and gathering, and preparing food.",
              "[76] These labour estimates are thought to be within the capability of a single extended family or village community in the Neolithic.",
              "[44] They also match the number of people that could have comfortably been inside one of the buildings at the same time.",
              "[77] Enclosures B, C and D were initially planned as a single, hierarchical complex that forms an equilateral triangle, according to Haklay and Gopher.",
              "[78] Go\u0308bekli Tepe is littered with flint artifacts, from the ridge-top site to the slopes.",
              "[79] The tool assemblage found resembles that of other Northern Levantine Pre-Pottery Neolithic (settlement) sites.",
              "[80] In 1963, over 3,000 Neolithic tools were uncovered, the vast majority of excellent quality flint, only a handful of obsidian.",
              "Cores, various blades, flakes, scrapers, burins, and projectile points, were the most common tool types.",
              "[81] Excavations of Space 16, a small building adjacent to enclosure D, yielded almost 700 tools.",

              "[82] The stone pillars in the enclosures at Go\u0308bekli Tepe are T-shaped, similar to other Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in the region.",
              "[83] Unlike at these other sites, however, many of the pillars are carved \u2013 typically in low relief, though sometimes in high relief.",
              "Most carvings depict animals, mostly serpents, foxes, and boars, but also gazelle, mouflon (wild sheep), onager, ducks, and vultures.",
              "Insofar as they can be identified, the animals are male, and often depicted with an aggressive posture.",
              "[84][85] Abstract shapes are also depicted, mostly an upright or horizontal 'H'-shaped symbol, but also crescents and disks.",
              "Depictions of humans are rare;",
              "pillar 43 in enclosure D includes a headless man with an erect phallus.",
              "However, the 'T'-shape of the pillars themselves is anthropomorphic: the shaft is the body, and the top is the head.",
              "This is confirmed by the fact that some pillars include \u2013 in addition to animal reliefs \u2013 carvings of arms, hands, and loincloths.",
              "[86] The two central pillars occupied a special place in the symbolic architecture of the enclosures.",
              "Those in Enclosure D represent humans, with arms, a belt, and a piece of cloth that hides the genitals.",
              "The sex of the individuals depicted cannot be clearly identified, though Schmidt suggested that they are two men because the belts they wear are a male attribute in the period.",
              "There is only one certain representation of a woman, depicted naked on a slab.",
              "[86] Schmidt and zooarchaeologist Joris Peters have argued that the variety of fauna depicted on the pillars means they likely do not express a single iconography.",
              "They suggest that, since many of the animals pictured are predators, the stones may have been intended to stave off evils through some form of magic representation, or served as totems.[87] Pillar 10, Enclosure B: fox Pillar 12, Enclosure C: ducks and boar Pillar 27, Enclosure C: predator (perhaps a felid) hunting a boar Pillar 37 (central), Enclosure C: fox Pillar 43, Enclosure D: the \"Vulture Stone\" The structures at Go\u0308bekli Tepe have also yielded a number of smaller carved stones, which typically cannot be attributed to one period or another.",
              "The iconography of these objects is similar to that of the pillars, mostly depicting animals, but also humans, again primarily male.",
              "[88][89] Carved stone with animal (possibly a reptile, felid, or wolverine) in high relief Boar statuette with legs Sculptured stone pole Boar statuette without legs Head of an animal A \"totem pole\" was discovered in one of the structures, dating to the early PPNB.",
              "Reassembled, it is 192 centimetres (6.",
              "30 ft) tall and 30 centimetres (0.",
              "98 ft) in diameter.",
              "It depicts three figures (from top to bottom): a predator (a bear or large felid) with a missing head, and the neck and arms of a human;",
              "another figure missing a head with human arms, likely male;",
              "and a third figure with a head that had survived intact.",
              "Snakes are carved on either side.",
              "[90] Klaus Schmidt's view was that Go\u0308bekli Tepe was a stone-age mountain sanctuary.",
              "[citation needed] He suggested it was a central location for a cult of the dead and that the carved animals are there to protect the dead.",
              "[citation needed] Butchered bones found in large numbers from the local game such as deer, gazelle, pigs, and geese have been identified as refuse from food hunted and cooked or otherwise prepared for the congregants.",
              "[91] Zooarchaeological analysis shows that gazelle were only seasonally present in the region, suggesting that events such as rituals and feasts were likely timed to occur during periods when game availability was at its peak.",
              "[36] Schmidt saw the construction of Go\u0308bekli Tepe as contributing to the later development of urban civilization.",
              "[92] Schmidt also speculated on the belief systems of the groups that created Go\u0308bekli Tepe, based on comparisons with other shrines and settlements.",
              "He presumed shamanic practices and suggested that the T-shaped pillars represent human forms, perhaps ancestors, whereas he saw a fully articulated belief in deities as not developing until later, in Mesopotamia, that was associated with extensive temples and palaces.",
              "This corresponds well with an ancient Sumerian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving were brought to humans from the sacred mountain Ekur, which was inhabited by Annuna deities, very ancient deities without individual names.",
              "Schmidt identified this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic.",
              "[93] It is apparent that the animal and other images give no indication of organized violence, i.",
              "e. there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, and the pillar carvings generally ignore game on which the society depended, such as deer, in favour of formidable creatures such as lions, snakes, spiders, and scorpions.",
              "[59][94][95] Expanding on Schmidt's interpretation that round enclosures could represent sanctuaries, Gheorghiu's semiotic interpretation reads the Go\u0308bekli Tepe iconography as a cosmogonic map that would have related the local community to the surrounding landscape and the cosmos.",
              "[96] The assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, \"similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.\"",
              "[44] It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.",
              "[97] According to Re\u0301mi Hadad, in recent years \"the interpretative enthusiasm that sought to see Go\u0308bekli Tepe as a regional ceremonial centre where nomadic populations would periodically converge is giving way to a vision that is more in line with what is known about other large Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites, where ritual and profane functions coexist.\"",
              "[98] For example, the discovery of domestic buildings and rainwater harvesting systems has forced a revision of the 'temple' narrative.",
              "[1] Before being documented by archaeologists, the hill Go\u0308bekli Tepe stands on, known locally in Kurdish as Gire\u0302 Mirazan or Xerabres\u0327k, was considered a sacred place.",
              "[99][100] The archaeological site was first noted in a survey conducted by Istanbul University and the University of Chicago in 1963.",
              "[101] American archaeologist Peter Benedict identified the stone tools collected from the surface of site as characteristic of the Aceramic Neolithic,[102] but apparently mistook the upper parts of the T-shaped pillars for grave markers.",
              "[103] The hill had long been under agricultural cultivation, and generations of local inhabitants had frequently moved rocks and placed them in clearance piles, which may have disturbed the upper layers of the site.",
              "At some point, attempts had been made to break up some of the pillars, presumably by farmers who mistook them for ordinary large rocks.",
              "[59] In October 1994, German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt, who had previously been working at Neval\u0131 C\u0327ori, was looking for evidence of similar sites in the area and decided to re-examine the location described by the Chicago researchers in 1963.",
              "[59][104] Asking in nearby villages about hills with flint,[104] he was guided to Go\u0308bekli Tepe by Mahmut and I\u0307brahim Y\u0131ld\u0131z, the farmers who owned the land the site was situated on.",
              "[100] Mahmut Y\u0131ld\u0131z and his father had previously discovered finds while ploughing there, which they reported to the local museum.",
              "[100] Having found similar structures at Neval\u0131 C\u0327ori, Schmidt recognized the possibility that the stone slabs were not grave markers as supposed by Benedict, but the tops of prehistoric megaliths.",
              "He began excavations the following year and soon unearthed the first of the huge T-shaped pillars.",
              "[59] Ultimately he found only three tombs on the eastmost hill-group, which were a pilgrimage destination.",
              "[105] Y\u0131ld\u0131z went on to work on the excavations and serve as the site's guard.",
              "[100] Schmidt continued to direct excavations at the site on behalf of the S\u0327anl\u0131urfa Museum and the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) until his death in 2014.",
              "Since then, the DAI's research at the site has been coordinated by Lee Clare.",
              "[106][1] As of 2021[update], work on the site is conducted jointly by Istanbul University, the S\u0327anl\u0131urfa Museum, and the DAI, under the overall direction of Necmi Karul.",
              "[107][108] Recent excavations have been more limited than Schmidt's, focusing on detailed documentation and conservation of the areas already exposed.",
              "[108] Go\u0308bekli Tepe was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its outstanding universal value as \"one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture\".",
              "[10] As of 2021[update], less than 5% of the site had been excavated.",
              "[11] Conservation work at the site caused controversy in 2018, when C\u0327ig\u0306dem Ko\u0308ksal Schmidt, an archaeologist, and widow of Klaus Schmidt, said that damage was caused by the use of concrete and \"heavy equipment\" during the construction of a new walkway.",
              "The Ministry of Culture and Tourism responded that no concrete was used and that no damage had occurred.",

              "We had heard rumors that sometimes the site was not open, and we certainly weren\u2019t getting there during tourist season, so we were happy to see that there was one bekc\u0327i (caretaker) there with his son, and we were able to wander all over the site with him following along.",
              "In many Turkish archaeological sites, you are free to climb over, rummage through, and basically do whatever you want (without hurting anything), but the bekc\u0327i here must have been under strict orders not to let anyone go anywhere but the beaten path up to the fenced enclosures.",

              "While we were there we let our imaginations wander and we enjoyed it tremendously.",

              "The pedestals they rest on are carved directly from the bedrock, as if rising out of the earth.",
              "From a distance, the pillars have an abstract appearance, a combination of straight lines and gentle curves.",
              "But, moving closer to them, it soon becomes clear that the pillars aren\u2019t simply geometric shapes, but stylized depictions of people.",
              "Standing inside the circles, it\u2019s possible to make out finely carved reliefs decorating the massive stones\u2014arms and folded hands, along with fox pelts hung from simple belts to form loincloths.",
              "Eleven smaller T-pillars form a circle around the central standing figures in Building D.",
              "They too are decorated, with carvings featuring a menagerie of crawling, flying, and running wild beasts.",
              "Snakes, birds, and foxes dominate the array, but the predators among them are accompanied by gazelles, ducks, and aurochs.",
              "Right next to this circular structure is another, with smaller T-pillars at its center and carvings dominated by depictions of snakes.",
              "Foxes slink across the pillars of yet another circle just a few feet away.",
              "Other motifs mix with the animals\u2014circles, mesh nets, phalluses, and what appear to be disembodied human heads.",
              "When archaeologists first began excavating on this Turkish hilltop 25 years ago, Building D and the other structures they discovered struck them as unusual, perhaps even unique.",
              "By comparing the tools found scattered amid the site\u2019s rubble to similar artifacts known from other sites, researchers determined that the largest circles were at least 11,000 years old\u2014and perhaps even older.",
              "This made them the earliest known monumental structures built by human hands.",
              "In 2006, after a decade of work at Go\u0308bekli Tepe, a team led by German Archaeological Institute (DAI) archaeologist Klaus Schmidt reached a stunning conclusion: The buildings and their multiton pillars, along with smaller, rectangular structures higher on the slope of the hill, were monumental communal buildings erected by people at a time before they had established permanent settlements, engaged in agriculture, or bred domesticated animals.",
              "Schmidt did not believe that anyone had ever lived at the site.",
              "He suggested that, in the Neolithic period between 9500 and 8200 B.",
              "C.",
              ", bands of nomads had come together regularly to set up stone circles and carve pillars, and then deliberately covered them up with the rocks, gravel, and other rubble he found filling in the various enclosures.",
              "Schmidt posited that both the construction and abandonment of what he called \u201cspecial enclosures\u201d had been accompanied by great feasts of local game washed down with beer brewed from wild grasses and grains.",
              "Those who gathered for these periodic monumental building projects scattered before coming back decades or centuries later to do it all again.",
              "He called Go\u0308bekli Tepe \u201ca cathedral on a hill,\u201d and imagined it might have been a place where hunter-gatherers bid farewell to their dead or staged ceremonies to emphasize their shared identity.",
              "The discovery of Go\u0308bekli Tepe promised to change the way scholars understood the Neolithic period.",
              "Around the time the earliest stone pillars were being carved, people were beginning to settle down and grow crops in an area stretching from modern-day Israel north to Turkey and east to Iraq.",
              "Though modest at first, the advent of farming and settlement paved the way for the development of complex civilizations and the way most of the world lives today.",
              "Archaeologists long agreed that only after adopting all the elements of the so-called Neolithic package, including permanent settlements and plant and animal domestication, could societies progress to what they saw as the luxury of creating social hierarchies, constructing monumental buildings, and carrying out complex rituals.",
              "The move toward the stratified civilizations of the present could only have begun, the argument went, once people had a surplus of food and a fixed address to call home.",
              "The first finds at Go\u0308bekli Tepe soon threw that time line into question.",
              "Reinforced by radiocarbon dates taken from bones found amid the rubble, the dates of the stone tools at the site placed its construction firmly at the beginning of the Neolithic period, around 9000 B.",
              "C.",
              ", centuries before the first domesticated grains appeared at settlements in the area.",
              "Some of the first evidence of domesticated grain in both the region and the world comes from a site called Neval\u0131 C\u0327ori, a few dozen miles to the west of Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "Founded in 8400 B.",
              "C.",
              "and abandoned a few centuries later, Neval\u0131 C\u0327ori overlaps only with the very latest occupation of Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "Schmidt thought this demonstrated that complex social organization and the performance of rituals actually predated permanent settlement and agriculture, and that the people who banded together and built the monumental structures were nomadic hunter-gatherers.",
              "He suggested that, eventually, the demands of gathering these nomads together in one place to carve and move the huge T-pillars and build the circular enclosures pushed them to take the next step and begin domesticating plants and animals in order to create a more dependable food supply.",
              "These innovations, he argued, spread from the hilltop throughout the region and eventually the globe.",
              "Ritual and religion, it seemed, launched the Neolithic Revolution, not the other way around.",
              "\u201cFirst the temple, then the city\u201d was how Schmidt summed it up.",
              "However, new discoveries at Go\u0308bekli Tepe and a close examination of the results from the earlier excavations are upending things once again.",
              "Archaeologists have uncovered evidence that the site was a settlement after all, and that many of its large ritual structures were used contemporaneously, not built one after another over the course of centuries.",
              "At the same time, a growing group of scholars, including the DAI\u2019s Lee Clare, who took over excavations at the site after Schmidt\u2019s death in 2014, argue that Go\u0308bekli Tepe\u2019s towering anthropomorphic pillars and powerful animal carvings do not mark the beginning of the Neolithic period.",
              "Instead, they contend, the entire site represents a last-ditch attempt to hold onto a vanishing way of life.",
              "The people of Go\u0308bekli Tepe weren\u2019t driving the Neolithic Revolution forward\u2014they were shoving back against it as hard as they could.",
              "Did Go\u0308bekli Tepe start as a hunter-gatherer meeting place and end up as a Neolithic village?",
              "Or were its T-pillars defiant monuments to a hunter-gatherer tradition that stretched back thousands of years to the Ice Age?",
              "\u201cThat,\u201d says Austrian Academy of Sciences archaeologist Barbara Horejs, \u201cis the billion-dollar question.",
              "\u201d When they were first uncovered, the dozens of structures at Go\u0308bekli Tepe were filled with rocks, soil, and tens of thousands of wild animal bones.",
              "That suggested to Schmidt that the buildings represented a series of sanctuaries or temples built over the course of nearly 1,500 years, one after another.",
              "After a century or so of use, he argued, the circles and their pillars were ritually buried, and new structures were sometimes built on top.",
              "The animal bones found in the rubble were, he thought, remains of feasts staged to attract workers to the hilltop for periodic building parties, the prehistoric equivalent of barn raisings.",
              "Over time, this repeated backfilling and rebuilding created the rounded mound that gives Go\u0308bekli Tepe its name, which is loosely translated from Turkish as \u201cPotbelly Hill.",
              "\u201d \u201cKlaus\u2019 big statement was this wasn\u2019t a settlement at all, but a ritual site for surrounding communities,\u201d says Douglas Baird, an archaeologist at the University of Liverpool.",
              "That interpretation supported the theory that Go\u0308bekli Tepe was built by hunter-gatherers, not settled farmers.",
              "But when DAI archaeologist Moritz Kinzel first began examining old excavation reports in 2017, he questioned whether the ritual structures had been built sequentially.",
              "Originally trained as an architect, Kinzel found the idea that the rubble filling the monumental buildings had been shoveled in all at once by the site\u2019s builders and topped with the remains of feasts puzzling.",
              "\u201cThere are a lot of features in the ruins that are strange if the buildings were backfilled,\u201d Kinzel says.",
              "For example, if the structures had been filled in all at once, the damage to the walls would be consistent all the way around.",
              "Instead, the walls closest to the slope of the hill are in the worst condition.",
              "\u201cThey show clear signs of slope slide or pressure,\u201d explains Kinzel.",
              "\u201cThe walls farthest away from the slope are much better preserved.",
              "\u201d And there is further evidence that undercuts the idea that the temples were deliberately filled in and then abandoned.",
              "The construction of a swooping roof canopy made of steel and fabric over the site in 2017 gave Kinzel and Clare the opportunity to reexamine a few spots where the roof\u2019s support pillars were to be placed.",
              "\u201cIt was like keyhole surgery, going straight down through the deposits,\u201d Clare says.",
              "\u201cWe had a good chance to look at the site\u2019s deepest layers and lowest deposits.",
              "\u201d These new excavations offered a way to investigate whether people were living at Go\u0308bekli Tepe from the start, or whether it slowly evolved from an isolated religious center to a village.",
              "\u201cIn deep soundings, we went right down to the natural levels of the mound,\u201d says Clare.",
              "\u201cWe found middens, fireplaces, hearths, lithics\u2014all smelling very domestic.",
              "For me, there was domestic activity from the beginning right to the very end.",
              "\u201d Having dug down until they reached bedrock, Kinzel and Clare noticed that several of the largest buildings had been repaired or rebuilt multiple times.",
              "Furthermore, many of the central T-pillars leaned in the same direction, as though knocked off balance by the same event.",
              "Kinzel and Clare now think that instead of having been filled intentionally, the circular buildings were instead rocked by earthquakes or buried by landslides over the centuries, and then renovated or reerected over and over again.",
              "\u201cSuddenly, we realized that maybe the monumental buildings had a much longer use life than we had thought,\u201d Kinzel says.",
              "Clare explains that he now believes that much of the fill is simply debris created by collapsing buildings.",
              "\u201cAll these bones which were interpreted as feasting deposits are actually the remains of previous phases that slipped in,\u201d he says.",
              "New radiocarbon dates obtained from a sampling of the animal bones, meanwhile, suggest that the buildings higher on the hillside were probably in use at the same time as the enclosures farther down the slope.",
              "During the recent excavations, the team recovered organic material, including charred wood and plant remains, along with phytoliths, or mineral residues of plants.",
              "This evidence could tell them what was growing and what people were cooking at the site more than 10,000 years ago.",
              "Laura Dietrich, a DAI archaeologist, also went back to examine thousands of grindstones, mortars, and carved stone vessels that had been excavated at the site over the years and then ignored.",
              "These include vessels large enough to make 43 gallons of beer or porridge.",
              "The evidence pointed to large-scale food processing for both special occasions and daily life.",
              "\u201cWe got an idea of normal household assemblages that actually were not special at all,\u201d Kinzel says.",
              "This was yet another indication that Go\u0308bekli Tepe was home as well as church.",
              "Another major discovery the team made was a pit 25 feet across and almost eight feet deep carved from the bedrock that could have served as a cistern for people living on the hilltop.",
              "Some 150 yards from the main building area, they found a carved channel in the bedrock that they identified as a type of early plumbing likely used for collecting rainwater.",
              "\u201cThey were harvesting water,\u201d Clare says.",
              "\u201cThat\u2019s a good indication of domestic settlement.",
              "\u201d What Schmidt thought were smaller rectangular ritual structures built later in the site\u2019s history were actually domestic buildings that existed alongside the large round and oval buildings.",
              "The team suspects that the structures would have been covered with flat roofs, with entrances on top, like other houses from the ninth millennium B.",
              "C.",
              "in Syria and Turkey.",
              "Debris inside the houses suggests people were working and eating on the roof, or on an upper floor, which eventually collapsed, leaving grindstones, charred wood from fireplaces, and tools mixed in with the rubble below.",
              "Clare, Kinzel, and other members of the team think that Go\u0308bekli Tepe was probably a village with large circular buildings in a natural dip at the base of the hillside.",
              "Smaller, rectangular houses climbed the slope all around them.",
              "\u201cI see this not as a site for cults and death but as a full settlement,\u201d Kinzel says.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s a relationship between the special enclosures and daily life.",
              "It really tells a much richer story than before.",
              "\u201d The original discovery of Go\u0308bekli Tepe prompted other archaeologists to reexamine previously excavated settlements and to search out new ones in hilly areas nearby.",
              "A survey conducted by archaeologist Bahattin C\u0327elik of Ig\u0306d\u0131r University, for example, found at least a dozen sites with similar round buildings, T-pillars, and animal carvings.",
              "And ongoing excavations at a site called Karahan Tepe about 30 miles southeast of Go\u0308bekli Tepe suggest Go\u0308bekli Tepe might not even contain the oldest monumental T-pillar architecture.",
              "Go\u0308bekli Tepe now appears as if it may actually be a particularly well-preserved example of a widespread cultural phenomenon.",

              "Rather than representing the inspiration for agriculture and settlement in this region, he claims, Go\u0308bekli Tepe\u2019s communal structures were built as the last stand of the region\u2019s hunter-gatherers.",
              "Instead of embracing the changing lifestyles they witnessed in the flatlands to the south, east, and west, Go\u0308bekli Tepe\u2019s builders pushed back.",
              "Unlike later Neolithic sites, which feature carvings of domesticated animals, such as bulls, and female animals, as well as possibly fertility-related imagery, the carvings at Go\u0308bekli Tepe depict species that seem different\u2014wilder, and somehow more dangerous.",
              "Threatening creatures feature prominently, from scorpions and spiders to vipers and vultures.",
              "The mixture of animals, phallic and other symbols, and pillars resembling humans does not appear to be random or merely decorative.",
              "Some pillars, such as the one that combines a vulture, a fox, and a severed human head, seem to tell a story.",
              "\u201cIf you look at the symbolism and depictions carved on the pillars, they\u2019re set up as narratives,\u201d Clare says.",
              "\u201cThese aren\u2019t just animals one sees every day.",

              "They base this conclusion on markings on top of the pillars that indicate that they could have supported or anchored roofs.",
              "For Thomas Zimmermann, an archaeologist at Bilkent University, these spaces had a very particular character that reflected a male-centric view dominant in hunter-gatherer society.",
              "He imagines them as dark and gloomy, with flickering firelight illuminating the carved T-pillars looming over men gathered inside.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s all male, male, male.",
              "It\u2019s a theater of horror filled with abrasive male animals ready to attack,\u201d Zimmermann says.",
              "\u201cIt represents a staunch, conservative, male-dominated hunter-gatherer culture.",
              "\u201d In this telling, there\u2019s a reason there are no signs of domesticated grains or tools typical of the Neolithic period at Go\u0308bekli Tepe\u2014according to Zimmermann and Clare, they were forbidden.",

              "Perhaps the settled hunter-gatherers at Go\u0308bekli Tepe relied exclusively on wild grasses and plentiful game from the fertile plains that stretched out below their perch, the way their ancestors had.",
              "As communities across the region were adopting new lifestyles and technologies, the people at Go\u0308bekli Tepe were \u201clooking back and placing the emphasis on what had been, not what was going to be,\u201d Clare says.",

              "Just 20 years ago most researchers believed they knew the time, place, and rough sequence of the Neolithic Revolution\u2014the critical transition that resulted in the birth of agriculture, taking Homo sapiens from scattered groups of hunter-gatherers to farming villages and from there to technologically sophisticated societies with great temples and towers and kings and priests who directed the labor of their subjects and recorded their feats in written form.",
              "But in recent years multiple new discoveries, Go\u0308bekli Tepe preeminent among them, have begun forcing archaeologists to reconsider.",
              "At first the Neolithic Revolution was viewed as a single event\u2014a sudden flash of genius\u2014that occurred in a single location, Mesopotamia, between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in what is now southern Iraq, then spread to India, Europe, and beyond.",
              "Most archaeologists believed this sudden blossoming of civilization was driven largely by environmental changes: a gradual warming as the Ice Age ended that allowed some people to begin cultivating plants and herding animals in abundance.",
              "The new research suggests that the \"revolution\" was actually carried out by many hands across a huge area and over thousands of years.",

              "Now a researcher at the German Archaeological Institute (DAI), Schmidt had spent the autumn of 1994 trundling across southeastern Turkey.",

              "North of S\u0327anl\u0131urfa the ground ripples into the first foothills of the mountains that run across southern Turkey, source of the famous Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.",
              "Nine miles outside of town is a long ridge with a rounded crest that locals call Potbelly Hill\u2014Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "In the 1960s archaeologists from the University of Chicago had surveyed the region and concluded that Go\u0308bekli Tepe was of little interest.",
              "Disturbance was evident at the top of the hill, but they attributed it to the activities of a Byzantine-era military outpost.",
              "Here and there were broken pieces of limestone they thought were gravestones.",
              "Schmidt had come across the Chicago researchers' brief description of the hilltop and decided to check it out.",
              "On the ground he saw flint chips\u2014huge numbers of them.",
              "\"Within minutes of getting there,\" Schmidt says, he realized that he was looking at a place where scores or even hundreds of people had worked in millennia past.",
              "The limestone slabs were not Byzantine graves but something much older.",
              "In collaboration with the DAI and the S\u0327anl\u0131urfa Museum, he set to work the next year.",
              "Inches below the surface the team struck an elaborately fashioned stone.",
              "Then another, and another\u2014a ring of standing pillars.",
              "As the months and years went by, Schmidt's team, a shifting crew of German and Turkish graduate students and 50 or more local villagers, found a second circle of stones, then a third, and then more.",
              "Geomagnetic surveys in 2003 revealed at least 20 rings piled together, higgledy-piggledy, under the earth.",
              "In southeastern Turkey some villagers still harvest wheat with a sickle.",
              "Einkorn wheat was first domesticated here, perhaps to feed the crowds who came to worship at Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "The pillars were big\u2014the tallest are 18 feet in height and weigh 16 tons.",
              "Swarming over their surfaces was a menagerie of animal bas-reliefs, each in a different style, some roughly rendered, a few as refined and symbolic as Byzantine art.",
              "Other parts of the hill were littered with the greatest store of ancient flint tools Schmidt had ever seen\u2014a Neolithic warehouse of knives, choppers, and projectile points.",
              "Even though the stone had to be lugged from neighboring valleys, Schmidt says, \"there were more flints in one little area here, a square meter or two, than many archaeologists find in entire sites.\"",
              "The circles follow a common design.",
              "All are made from limestone pillars shaped like giant spikes or capital T's.",
              "Bladelike, the pillars are easily five times as wide as they are deep.",
              "They stand an arm span or more apart, interconnected by low stone walls.",
              "In the middle of each ring are two taller pillars, their thin ends mounted in shallow grooves cut into the floor.",
              "I asked German architect and civil engineer Eduard Knoll, who works with Schmidt to preserve the site, how well designed the mounting system was for the central pillars.",
              "\"Not,\" he said, shaking his head.",
              "\"They hadn't yet mastered engineering.\"",
              "Knoll speculated that the pillars may have been propped up, perhaps by wooden posts.",
              "To Schmidt, the T-shaped pillars are stylized human beings, an idea bolstered by the carved arms that angle from the \"shoulders\" of some pillars, hands reaching toward their loincloth-draped bellies.",
              "The stones face the center of the circle\u2014as at \"a meeting or dance,\" Schmidt says\u2014a representation, perhaps, of a religious ritual.",
              "As for the prancing, leaping animals on the figures, he noted that they are mostly deadly creatures: stinging scorpions, charging boars, ferocious lions.",
              "The figures represented by the pillars may be guarded by them, or appeasing them, or incorporating them as totems. Puzzle piled upon puzzle as the excavation continued.",
              "For reasons yet unknown, the rings at Go\u0308bekli Tepe seem to have regularly lost their power, or at least their charm.",
              "Every few decades people buried the pillars and put up new stones\u2014a second, smaller ring, inside the first.",
              "Sometimes, later, they installed a third.",
              "Then the whole assemblage would be filled in with debris, and an entirely new circle created nearby.",
              "The site may have been built, filled in, and built again for centuries.",
              "Bewilderingly, the people at Go\u0308bekli Tepe got steadily worse at temple building.",
              "The earliest rings are the biggest and most sophisticated, technically and artistically.",
              "As time went by, the pillars became smaller, simpler, and were mounted with less and less care.",
              "Finally the effort seems to have petered out altogether by 8200 B.",
              "C.",
              "Go\u0308bekli Tepe was all fall and no rise.",
              "As important as what the researchers found was what they did not find: any sign of habitation.",
              "Hundreds of people must have been required to carve and erect the pillars, but the site had no water source\u2014the nearest stream was about three miles away.",
              "Those workers would have needed homes, but excavations have uncovered no sign of walls, hearths, or houses\u2014no other buildings that Schmidt has interpreted as domestic.",
              "They would have had to be fed, but there is also no trace of agriculture.",
              "For that matter, Schmidt has found no mess kitchens or cooking fires.",
              "It was purely a ceremonial center.",
              "If anyone ever lived at this site, they were less its residents than its staff.",
              "To judge by the thousands of gazelle and aurochs bones found at the site, the workers seem to have been fed by constant shipments of game, brought from faraway hunts.",
              "All of this complex endeavor must have had organizers and overseers, but there is as yet no good evidence of a social hierarchy\u2014no living area reserved for richer people, no tombs filled with elite goods, no sign of some people having better diets than others.",
              "\"These people were foragers,\" Schmidt says, people who gathered plants and hunted wild animals.",
              "\"Our picture of foragers was always just small, mobile groups, a few dozen people.",
              "They cannot make big permanent structures, we thought, because they must move around to follow the resources.",
              "They can't maintain a separate class of priests and craft workers, because they can't carry around all the extra supplies to feed them.",
              "Then here is Go\u0308bekli Tepe, and they obviously did that.\"",
              "Discovering that hunter-gatherers had constructed Go\u0308bekli Tepe was like finding that someone had built a 747 in a basement with an X-Acto knife.",
              "\"I, my colleagues, we all thought, What?",
              "How?\"",
              "Schmidt said.",
              "Paradoxically, Go\u0308bekli Tepe appeared to be both a harbinger of the civilized world that was to come and the last, greatest emblem of a nomadic past that was already disappearing.",
              "The accomplishment was astonishing, but it was hard to understand how it had been done or what it meant.",
              "\"In 10 or 15 years,\" Schmidt predicts, \"Go\u0308bekli Tepe will be more famous than Stonehenge.",
              "And for good reason.\"",
              "Hovering over Go\u0308bekli Tepe is the ghost of V.",
              "Gordon Childe.",
              "An Australian transplant to Britain, Childe was a flamboyant man, a passionate Marxist who wore plus fours and bow ties and larded his public addresses with noodle-headed paeans to Stalinism.",
              "He was also one of the most influential archaeologists of the past century.",
              "A great synthesist, Childe wove together his colleagues' disconnected facts into overarching intellectual schemes.",
              "The most famous of these arose in the 1920s, when he invented the concept of the Neolithic Revolution.",
              "In today's terms, Childe's views could be summed up like this: Homo sapiens burst onto the scene about 200,000 years ago.",
              "For most of the millennia that followed, the species changed remarkably little, with humans living as small bands of wandering foragers.",
              "Then came the Neolithic Revolution\u2014\"a radical change,\" Childe said, \"fraught with revolutionary consequences for the whole species.\"",
              "In a lightning bolt of inspiration, one part of humankind turned its back on foraging and embraced agriculture.",
              "The adoption of farming, Childe argued, brought with it further transformations.",
              "To tend their fields, people had to stop wandering and move into permanent villages, where they developed new tools and created pottery.",
              "The Neolithic Revolution, in his view, was an explosively important event\u2014\"the greatest in human history after the mastery of fire.\"",
              "Of all the aspects of the revolution, agriculture was the most important.",
              "For thousands of years men and women with stone implements had wandered the landscape, cutting off heads of wild grain and taking them home.",
              "Even though these people may have tended and protected their grain patches, the plants they watched over were still wild.",
              "Wild wheat and barley, unlike their domesticated versions, shatter when they are ripe\u2014the kernels easily break off the plant and fall to the ground, making them next to impossible to harvest when fully ripe.",
              "Genetically speaking, true grain agriculture began only when people planted large new areas with mutated plants that did not shatter at maturity, creating fields of domesticated wheat and barley that, so to speak, waited for farmers to harvest them.",
              "Rather than having to comb through the landscape for food, people could now grow as much as they needed and where they needed it, so they could live together in larger groups.",
              "Population soared.",
              "\"It was only after the revolution\u2014but immediately thereafter\u2014that our species really began to multiply at all fast,\" Childe wrote.",
              "In these suddenly more populous societies, ideas could be more readily exchanged, and rates of technological and social innovation soared.",
              "Religion and art\u2014the hallmarks of civilization\u2014flourished.",
              "Childe, like most researchers today, believed that the revolution first occurred in the Fertile Crescent, the arc of land that curves northeast from Gaza into southern Turkey and then sweeps southeast into Iraq.",
              "Bounded on the south by the harsh Syrian Desert and on the north by the mountains of Turkey, the crescent is a band of temperate climate between inhospitable extremes.",
              "Its eastern terminus is the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in southern Iraq\u2014the site of a realm known as Sumer, which dates back to about 4000 B.",
              "C.",
              "In Childe's day most researchers agreed that Sumer represented the beginning of civilization.",
              "Archaeologist Samuel Noah Kramer summed up that view in the 1950s in his book History Begins at Sumer.",
              "Yet even before Kramer finished writing, the picture was being revised at the opposite, western end of the Fertile Crescent.",
              "In the Levant\u2014the area that today encompasses Israel, the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, Jordan, and western Syria\u2014archaeologists had discovered settlements dating as far back as 13,000 B.",
              "C.",
              "Known as Natufian villages (the name comes from the first of these sites to be found), they sprang up across the Levant as the Ice Age was drawing to a close, ushering in a time when the region's climate became relatively warm and wet.",
              "The discovery of the Natufians was the first rock through the window of Childe's Neolithic Revolution.",
              "Childe had thought agriculture the necessary spark that led to villages and ignited civilization.",
              "Yet although the Natufians lived in permanent settlements of up to several hundred people, they were foragers, not farmers, hunting gazelles and gathering wild rye, barley, and wheat.",
              "\"It was a big sign that our ideas needed to be revised,\" says Harvard University archaeologist Ofer Bar-Yosef.",
              "Natufian villages ran into hard times around 10,800 B.",
              "C.",
              ", when regional temperatures abruptly fell some 12\u00b0F, part of a mini ice age that lasted 1,200 years and created much drier conditions across the Fertile Crescent.",
              "With animal habitat and grain patches shrinking, a number of villages suddenly became too populous for the local food supply.",
              "Many people once again became wandering foragers, searching the landscape for remaining food sources.",
              "Some settlements tried to adjust to the more arid conditions.",
              "The village of Abu Hureyra, in what is now northern Syria, seemingly tried to cultivate local stands of rye, perhaps replanting them.",
              "After examining rye grains from the site, Gordon Hillman of University College London and Andrew Moore of the Rochester Institute of Technology argued in 2000 that some were bigger than their wild equivalents\u2014a possible sign of domestication, because cultivation inevitably increases qualities, such as fruit and seed size, that people find valuable.",
              "Bar-Yosef and some other researchers came to believe that nearby sites like Mureybet and Tell Qaramel also had had agriculture.",
              "If these archaeologists were correct, these protovillages provided a new explanation of how complex society began.",
              "Childe thought that agriculture came first, that it was the innovation that allowed humans to seize the opportunity of a rich new environment to extend their dominion over the natural world.",
              "The Natufian sites in the Levant suggested instead that settlement came first and that farming arose later, as a product of crisis.",
              "Confronted with a drying, cooling environment and growing populations, humans in the remaining fecund areas thought, as Bar-Yosef puts it, \"If we move, these other folks will exploit our resources.",
              "The best way for us to survive is to settle down and exploit our own area.\"",
              "Agriculture followed.",
              "The idea that the Neolithic Revolution was driven by climate change resonated during the 1990s, a time when people were increasingly worried about the effects of modern global warming.",
              "It was promoted in countless articles and books and ultimately enshrined in Wikipedia.",
              "Yet critics charged that the evidence was weak, not least because Abu Hureyra, Mureybet, and many other sites in northern Syria had been flooded by dams before they could be fully excavated.",
              "\"You had an entire theory on the origins of human culture essentially based on a half a dozen unusually plump seeds,\" ancient-grain specialist George Willcox of the National Center for Scientific Research, in France, says.",
              "\"Isn't it more likely that these grains were puffed during charring or that somebody at Abu Hureyra found some unusual-looking wild rye?\"",
              "As the dispute over the Natufians sharpened, Schmidt was carefully working at Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "And what he was finding would, once again, force many researchers to reassess their ideas.",
              "Anthropologists have assumed that organized religion began as a way of salving the tensions that inevitably arose when hunter-gatherers settled down, became farmers, and developed large societies.",
              "Compared to a nomadic band, the society of a village had longer term, more complex aims\u2014storing grain and maintaining permanent homes.",
              "Villages would be more likely to accomplish those aims if their members were committed to the collective enterprise.",
              "Though primitive religious practices\u2014burying the dead, creating cave art and figurines\u2014had emerged tens of thousands of years earlier, organized religion arose, in this view, only when a common vision of a celestial order was needed to bind together these big, new, fragile groups of humankind.",
              "It could also have helped justify the social hierarchy that emerged in a more complex society: Those who rose to power were seen as having a special connection with the gods.",
              "Communities of the faithful, united in a common view of the world and their place in it, were more cohesive than ordinary clumps of quarreling people.",
              "Go\u0308bekli Tepe, to Schmidt's way of thinking, suggests a reversal of that scenario: The construction of a massive temple by a group of foragers is evidence that organized religion could have come before the rise of agriculture and other aspects of civilization.",
              "It suggests that the human impulse to gather for sacred rituals arose as humans shifted from seeing themselves as part of the natural world to seeking mastery over it.",
              "When foragers began settling down in villages, they unavoidably created a divide between the human realm\u2014a fixed huddle of homes with hundreds of inhabitants\u2014and the dangerous land beyond the campfire, populated by lethal beasts.",
              "French archaeologist Jacques Cauvin believed this change in consciousness was a \"revolution of symbols,\" a conceptual shift that allowed humans to imagine gods\u2014supernatural beings resembling humans\u2014that existed in a universe beyond the physical world.",
              "Schmidt sees Go\u0308bekli Tepe as evidence for Cauvin's theory.",
              "\"The animals were guardians to the spirit world,\" he says.",
              "\"The reliefs on the T-shaped pillars illustrate that other world.\"",
              "Schmidt speculates that foragers living within a hundred-mile radius of Go\u0308bekli Tepe created the temple as a holy place to gather and meet, perhaps bringing gifts and tributes to its priests and crafts\u00adpeople.",
              "Some kind of social organization would have been necessary not only to build it but also to deal with the crowds it attracted.",
              "One imagines chanting and drumming, the animals on the great pillars seeming to move in flickering torchlight.",
              "Surely there were feasts;",
              "Schmidt has uncovered stone basins that could have been used for beer.",
              "The temple was a spiritual locus, but it may also have been the Neolithic version of Disneyland.",
              "Over time, Schmidt believes, the need to acquire sufficient food for those who worked and gathered for ceremonies at Go\u0308bekli Tepe may have led to the intensive cultivation of wild cereals and the creation of some of the first domestic strains.",
              "Indeed, scientists now believe that one center of agriculture arose in southern Turkey\u2014well within trekking distance of Go\u0308bekli Tepe\u2014at exactly the time the temple was at its height.",
              "Today the closest known wild ancestors of modern einkorn wheat are found on the slopes of Karaca Dag\u0306, a mountain just 60 miles northeast of Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "In other words, the turn to agriculture celebrated by V.",
              "Gordon Childe may have been the result of a need that runs deep in the human psyche, a hunger that still moves people today to travel the globe in search of awe-inspiring sights.",
              "Some of the first evidence for plant domestication comes from Neval\u0131 C\u0327ori (pronounced nuh-vah-LUH CHO-ree), a settlement in the mountains scarcely 20 miles away.",
              "Like Go\u0308bekli Tepe, Neval\u0131 C\u0327ori came into existence right after the mini ice age, a time archaeologists describe with the unlovely term Pre-pottery Neolithic (PPN).",
              "Neval\u0131 C\u0327ori is now inundated by a recently created lake that provides electricity and irrigation water for the region.",
              "But before the waters shut down research, archaeologists found T-shaped pillars and animal images much like those Schmidt would later uncover at Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "Similar pillars and images occurred in PPN settlements up to a hundred miles from Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "Much as one can surmise today that homes with images of the Virgin Mary belong to Christians, Schmidt says, the imagery in these PPN sites indicates a shared religion\u2014a community of faith that surrounded Go\u0308bekli Tepe and may have been the world's first truly large religious grouping.",
              "Naturally, some of Schmidt's colleagues disagree with his ideas.",
              "The lack of evidence of houses, for instance, doesn't prove that nobody lived at Go\u0308bekli Tepe.",
              "And increasingly, archaeologists studying the origins of civilization in the Fertile Crescent are suspicious of any attempt to find a one-size-fits-all scenario, to single out one primary trigger.",
              "It is more as if the occupants of various archaeological sites were all playing with the building blocks of civilization, looking for combinations that worked.",
              "In one place agriculture may have been the foundation;",
              "in another, art and religion;",
              "and over there, population pressures or social organization and hierarchy.",
              "Eventually they all ended up in the same place.",
              "Perhaps there is no single path to civilization;",
              "instead it was arrived at by different means in different places.",
              "In Schmidt's view, many of his colleagues have been as slow to appreciate Go\u0308bekli Tepe as he has been to excavate it.",
              "This summer will mark his 17th year at the site.",
              "The annals of archaeology are replete with scientists who in their hurry carelessly wrecked important finds, losing knowledge for all time.",
              "Schmidt is determined not to add his name to the list.",
              "Today less than a tenth of the 22-acre site is open to the sky.",
              "Schmidt emphasizes that further research on Go\u0308bekli Tepe may change his current understanding of the site's importance.",
              "Even its age is not clear\u2014Schmidt is not certain he has reached the bottom layer.",
              "\"We come up with two new mysteries for every one that we solve,\" he says.",
              "Still, he has already drawn some conclusions.",
              "\"Twenty years ago everyone believed civilization was driven by ecological forces,\" Schmidt says.",
              "\"I think what we are learning is that civilization is a product of the human mind.\"",

              "[4] Only forty days after he first saw the fossil, Dart completed a paper that named the species of Australopithecus africanus, the \"southern ape from Africa\", and described it as \"an extinct race of apes intermediate between living anthropoids and man\".",

              "[7] The critiques became more fervent a few months later.",
              "Elliot Smith concluded that the Taung fossil was \"essentially identical\" to the skull of \"the infant gorilla and chimpanzee\".",
              "[7] Infant apes appear more human like because of the \"shape of their forehead and the lack of fully developed brow ridges\".",
              "[8] Addressing the claim that the fossil was \"the missing link between ape and human\", Arthur Keith stated in a letter to Nature that In 1926, a year after the publication of Dart's article, Ales\u030c Hrdlic\u030cka reviewed and approved German and Portuguese articles for the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.",
              "Both articles asserted that the Taung Child should not be placed within the human phylum due to a lack of justification for the classification.",
              "The next year, Hrdlic\u030cka personally commented on another of Dart's articles, this time in Natural History, saying that the author \"very ingeniously, but, it seems obvious, more or less artificially, endeavors to humanize the 'Australopithecus'.",
              "It is not known that this effort thus far has found favor with any other student who gave truly earnest and critical attention to the otherwise very interesting and important Taung relic.\"",
              "[10] \"Far from the bones being objective facts to be judged as evidence, there was an established pattern of belief.",
              "There was a climate of opinion that favored discoveries made in Asia but not the 'silly notion' of small-brained bipeds from Africa\".",
              "Sherwood Washburn, \"Human Evolution After Raymond Dart\" (1985)[11] There were several reasons that it took decades for the field to accept Dart's claim that Australopithecus africanus was in the human line of descent.",
              "First and foremost was the fact that the British scientific establishment had been fooled by the hoax of the Piltdown Man, which had a large brain and ape-like teeth.",
              "[12] Expecting human ancestors to have evolved a large brain very early, they found that the Taung Child's small brain and human-like teeth made it an unlikely ancestor to modern humans.",
              "[13] Secondly, until the 1940s, most anthropologists believed that humans had evolved in Asia, not in Africa.",
              "[14] A third reason is that, despite accepting that modern humans had emerged by evolution, many anthropologists believed that the genus Homo had split from the great apes as long as 30 million years ago and so felt uneasy about accepting that humans had a small-brained, ape-like ancestor, like Australopithecus africanus, only two million years ago.",
              "[15] Lastly, many people disputed the role of this fossil because of their religious affiliation.",
              "When Taung was first announced in February 1925, many anti-evolutionists began to rise up in protest of this fossil.",
              "Dart began receiving many threats from members of various religious communities that proclaimed his ideas blasphemous.",
              "Some were able to reconcile the science with the religious theology through the lens of \"creation science\", but there was still significant opposition.",
              "However, by this time many other fossils such as Java Man, Neanderthal Man, and Rhodesian Man were being discovered, and the theory of evolution was becoming more difficult to refute.",
              "[8] Solly Zuckerman, who had studied anatomy under Dart in South Africa, concluded as early as 1928 that Australopithecus was little more than an ape.",
              "[16] He and a four-member team carried out further studies of the Australopithecine family in the 1940s and 1950s.",
              "Using a \"metrical and statistical approach\" that he thought was superior to purely descriptive methods,[17] he decided that the creatures had not walked on two legs and so were not an intermediate form between humans and apes.",
              "[18] For the rest of his life, Zuckerman continued to deny that Australopithecus was part of the human family tree, even when that was the conclusion that had become \"universally accepted\" by scientists.",
              "[19][20] Dart's claim that Australopithecus africanus, the species name that he had given to the Taung Child, was a transitional form between apes and humans was almost universally rejected.",
              "Robert Broom, a Scottish doctor who worked in South Africa, was one of the few scientists to believe Dart.",
              "[21] Two weeks after Dart announced the discovery of the Taung Child in Nature, Broom visited Dart in Johannesburg to see the fossil.",
              "After he became a paleontologist in 1933, Broom found adult fossils of Australopithecus africanus and discovered more robust fossils, which were eventually renamed Australopithecus robustus (AKA Paranthropus robustus).",
              "[22] Even after Dart chose to take a break from his work in anthropology, Broom undertook more excavations, and slowly began to find more Australopithecus africanus specimens that proved Dart was correct in his analysis of the Taung Child;",
              "it did have human-like morphology.",
              "In 1946, Broom and his colleague Gerrit Schepers published a volume consolidating all the information they had found about Australopithecus africanus in a volume titled The South African Fossil Men: The Australopithecinae.",
              "[8] In the late 1920s, American paleontologist William King Gregory also accepted that Australopithecus was part of the human family tree.",
              "Employed by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, Gregory supported Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley's then-unpopular view that humans were closely related to African apes.",
              "[23] The director of the museum, however, was Henry Fairfield Osborn;",
              "despite being \"the chief public defender of evolution in the United States\" at the time of the Scopes Trial in 1925, he disagreed with Darwin's views on the origins of humanity.",
              "[24] Gregory and Osborn repeatedly debated the issue in public forums, but Osborn's view that humans had evolved from early ancestors who did not look like apes prevailed among American anthropologists in the 1930s and 1940s.",
              "[25] In 1938, Gregory visited South Africa and saw the Taung Child and the fossils that Broom had recently discovered.",
              "[26] More convinced than ever that Dart and Broom were right, he called Australopithecus africanus \"the missing link no longer missing\".",
              "[27] The turning point in the acceptance of Dart's analysis of the Taung Child came in 1947, when the prominent British anthropologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark announced that he supported it.",
              "Le Gros Clark, who would also play an important role in exposing the fraud of the Piltdown Man in 1953, visited Johannesburg in late 1946 to study Dart's Taung skull and Broom's adult fossils, with the intention of proving that they were only apes.",
              "[28] After two weeks of studies and visiting the caves in which Broom had found his fossils (the Taung cave had been destroyed by miners soon after the discovery of the Taung skull), however, Clark became convinced that these fossils were hominids rather than pongids.",
              "In 1947, Sir Arthur Keith published in Nature, announcing his support of Dart and Broom's research.",
              "He stated \"the evidence submitted by Dr.",
              "Robert Broom and Professor Dart was right and I was wrong\",[8] agreeing that with the new evidence along with the Taung Fossil indicated that this fossil was human-like in posture, dental elements, and its bipedal walk.",
              "In early January 1947, at the First Pan-African Congress on Prehistory, Wilfrid Le Gros Clark was the first anthropologist of such stature to call the Taung Child a \"hominid\": an early human.",
              "An anonymous article, published in Nature on 15 February 1947, announced Clark's conclusions to a wider public.",
              "On that day, Keith, who had been one of Dart's most virulent critics, composed a letter to the editor of Nature announcing that he supported Clark's analysis: \"I was one of those who took the point of view that when the adult form [of Australopithecus] was discovered it would prove to be near akin to the living African anthropoids\u2014the gorilla and the chimpanzee.",

              "[8] As Roger Lewin put it in his book Bones of Contention, \"a prompter and more thorough capitulation could hardly be imagined\".",
              "[29] Dart drew conclusions that were unavoidably controversial due to the lack of more fossil evidence at the time.",
              "The idea that the skull belonged to a new genus was identified by comparison with skulls of chimpanzees.",
              "Its skull was larger than a fully-grown chimpanzee's.",
              "The forehead of the chimpanzee receded to form a heavy browridge and a jutting jaw;",
              "the Taung Child's forehead recedes but leaves no browridge.",
              "Its foramen magnum, a void in the cranium, where the spinal cord is continuous with the brain, is beneath the cranium so the creature must have stood upright.",
              "[30] This is an indication of bipedal locomotion.",
              "Dean Falk, a specialist in neuroanatomy, noted that Dart had not fully considered certain apelike attributes for Taung.",
              "This mainly pertains to the lunate sulcas, which Dart had described as having human-like placement, Upon further examination however, Falk determined that these patterns were much more similar to that of an ape's similar sized brain.",
              "[8] This however was of great debate as the sulcas was not incredibly visible on the endocast, as it often is not in apes.",
              "Ralph Holloway stood in opposition of this idea as he had long been known as a supporter of Dart's analysis of Taung.",
              "He believed that the sulcus would be in the area of the lambdoid structure.",
              "Falk however, believed the sulcas was placed higher on the skull, in a more ape-like manner.",
              "However, studies surrounding this have been controversial, as there is no concrete place on the brain where they can place these features.",
              "Paleoneurologists have been tasked with looking at various depressions in the brain and attempting to determine what they are.",
              "These scientists are often met with skepticism, just as Falk in her continued support of an ape-like placement of the lunate sulcas.",
              "However, now many professionals believe that the sulcas is not visible in Taung and many other Australopithecus africanus specimens.",
              "However, a newer endocast specimen title Stw 505 has been examined, and many believe that it supports Dart's hypothesis, but this aspect of Taung is still highly debated, and many still believe it has ape-like placement.",
              "[31] Subsequently, Falk unearthed an unpublished manuscript that Dart completed in 1929 in the Archives of the University of Witwatersrand, which provides a much more thorough description and analysis of the Taung endocast than Dart's earlier announcement in Nature.",
              "This was barred from being published to Dart's dismay in 1931.",
              "It remains unpublished in these archives where very few are able to appreciate it.",
              "In this writing Falk discovered that she and Dart had come to similar conclusions surrounding the evolutionary process of the brain that Taung indicates.",
              "Whereas Dart had identified only two potential sulci on the Taung endocast in 1925, he identified and illustrated 14 additional sulci in this still-unpublished monograph.",
              "There, too, Dart detailed how Taung's endocast was expanded globally in three different regions, contrary to the suggestion that he believed hominin brains evolved back-end-first, in a so-called mosaic fashion.",

              "[1] Dean Falk, a specialist in brain evolution, has called it \"the most important anthropological fossil of the twentieth century.\"",
              "[2] In the early 20th century, the workers at limestone quarries in Southern Africa routinely uncovered fossils from the tufa formations that they mined.",
              "The tufa did not form consistently, and over time cavities were left open and they became beneficial areas for animals to take shelter in.",
              "As a result, many bones began to build up in these areas.",
              "These areas were mostly sandstone, and they stood in the way of successful mining.",
              "So, miners would use explosives to clear these areas, and discard all the debris.",
              "[3] However, many fossils began to show up, and these were saved by many of the miners.",
              "Many were of extinct fauna, which included baboons and other primates, and the more complete or somehow more interesting fossils were kept as curiosities by the Europeans who managed operations.",
              "[4] In 1924, workers at the Buxton Limeworks, near Taung, showed a fossilized primate skull to E.",

              "[4] Salmons was the first female student of Dart, an anatomist at the University of Witwatersrand.",
              "Salmons was permitted to take the fossilized skull and presented it to Dart, who also recognized it as a significant find.",
              "Dart asked the company to send any more interesting fossilized skulls that were unearthed.",

              "[4] When Dart examined the contents of the crate, he found a fossilized endocast of a skull showing the impression of a complex brain.",
              "He quickly searched through the rest of the fossils in the crates, and matched it to a fossilized skull of a juvenile primate, which had a shallow face and fairly small teeth.",
              "[4] Only forty days after he first saw the fossil, Dart completed a paper that named the species of Australopithecus africanus, the \"southern ape from Africa\", and described it as \"an extinct race of apes intermediate between living anthropoids and man\".",
              "[5] The paper appeared in the 7 February 1925 issue of the journal Nature.",
              "[6] The fossil was soon nicknamed the Taung Child.",
              "Scientists were initially reluctant to accept that the Taung Child and the new genus Australopithecus were ancestral to modern humans.",
              "In the issue of Nature immediately following the one in which Dart's paper was published, several authorities in British paleoanthropology criticized Dart's conclusion.",

              "They were much more skeptical about this fossil's place in evolutionary history, and believed it deserved to be categorized as a chimp or gorilla rather than a human ancestor.",

              "[8] Dart's former mentor, Arthur Keith, one of the most prominent anatomists of his time, claimed that there was insufficient evidence to accept Dart's claim that Australopithecus was transitional between apes and humans.",
              "Grafton Elliot Smith stated that he needed more evidence and a larger picture of the skull before he could judge the significance of the new fossil.",
              "Arthur Smith Woodward dismissed the Taung Child as having \"little bearing\" on the issue of \"whether the direct ancestors of man are to be sought in Asia or Africa\".",
              "[7] The critiques became more fervent a few months later.",
              "Elliot Smith concluded that the Taung fossil was \"essentially identical\" to the skull of \"the infant gorilla and chimpanzee\".",
              "[7] Infant apes appear more human like because of the \"shape of their forehead and the lack of fully developed brow ridges\".",
              "[8] Addressing the claim that the fossil was \"the missing link between ape and human\", Arthur Keith stated in a letter to Nature that In 1926, a year after the publication of Dart's article, Ales\u030c Hrdlic\u030cka reviewed and approved German and Portuguese articles for the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.",
              "Both articles asserted that the Taung Child should not be placed within the human phylum due to a lack of justification for the classification.",
              "The next year, Hrdlic\u030cka personally commented on another of Dart's articles, this time in Natural History, saying that the author \"very ingeniously, but, it seems obvious, more or less artificially, endeavors to humanize the 'Australopithecus'.",
              "It is not known that this effort thus far has found favor with any other student who gave truly earnest and critical attention to the otherwise very interesting and important Taung relic.\"",
              "[10] \"Far from the bones being objective facts to be judged as evidence, there was an established pattern of belief.",
              "There was a climate of opinion that favored discoveries made in Asia but not the 'silly notion' of small-brained bipeds from Africa\".",
              "Sherwood Washburn, \"Human Evolution After Raymond Dart\" (1985)[11] There were several reasons that it took decades for the field to accept Dart's claim that Australopithecus africanus was in the human line of descent.",
              "First and foremost was the fact that the British scientific establishment had been fooled by the hoax of the Piltdown Man, which had a large brain and ape-like teeth.",
              "[12] Expecting human ancestors to have evolved a large brain very early, they found that the Taung Child's small brain and human-like teeth made it an unlikely ancestor to modern humans.",
              "[13] Secondly, until the 1940s, most anthropologists believed that humans had evolved in Asia, not in Africa.",
              "[14] A third reason is that, despite accepting that modern humans had emerged by evolution, many anthropologists believed that the genus Homo had split from the great apes as long as 30 million years ago and so felt uneasy about accepting that humans had a small-brained, ape-like ancestor, like Australopithecus africanus, only two million years ago.",
              "[15] Lastly, many people disputed the role of this fossil because of their religious affiliation.",
              "When Taung was first announced in February 1925, many anti-evolutionists began to rise up in protest of this fossil.",
              "Dart began receiving many threats from members of various religious communities that proclaimed his ideas blasphemous.",
              "Some were able to reconcile the science with the religious theology through the lens of \"creation science\", but there was still significant opposition.",
              "However, by this time many other fossils such as Java Man, Neanderthal Man, and Rhodesian Man were being discovered, and the theory of evolution was becoming more difficult to refute.",
              "[8] Solly Zuckerman, who had studied anatomy under Dart in South Africa, concluded as early as 1928 that Australopithecus was little more than an ape.",
              "[16] He and a four-member team carried out further studies of the Australopithecine family in the 1940s and 1950s.",
              "Using a \"metrical and statistical approach\" that he thought was superior to purely descriptive methods,[17] he decided that the creatures had not walked on two legs and so were not an intermediate form between humans and apes.",
              "[18] For the rest of his life, Zuckerman continued to deny that Australopithecus was part of the human family tree, even when that was the conclusion that had become \"universally accepted\" by scientists.",
              "[19][20] Dart's claim that Australopithecus africanus, the species name that he had given to the Taung Child, was a transitional form between apes and humans was almost universally rejected.",
              "Robert Broom, a Scottish doctor who worked in South Africa, was one of the few scientists to believe Dart.",
              "[21] Two weeks after Dart announced the discovery of the Taung Child in Nature, Broom visited Dart in Johannesburg to see the fossil.",
              "After he became a paleontologist in 1933, Broom found adult fossils of Australopithecus africanus and discovered more robust fossils, which were eventually renamed Australopithecus robustus (AKA Paranthropus robustus).",
              "[22] Even after Dart chose to take a break from his work in anthropology, Broom undertook more excavations, and slowly began to find more Australopithecus africanus specimens that proved Dart was correct in his analysis of the Taung Child;",
              "it did have human-like morphology.",
              "In 1946, Broom and his colleague Gerrit Schepers published a volume consolidating all the information they had found about Australopithecus africanus in a volume titled The South African Fossil Men: The Australopithecinae.",
              "[8] In the late 1920s, American paleontologist William King Gregory also accepted that Australopithecus was part of the human family tree.",
              "Employed by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, Gregory supported Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley's then-unpopular view that humans were closely related to African apes.",
              "[23] The director of the museum, however, was Henry Fairfield Osborn;",
              "despite being \"the chief public defender of evolution in the United States\" at the time of the Scopes Trial in 1925, he disagreed with Darwin's views on the origins of humanity.",
              "[24] Gregory and Osborn repeatedly debated the issue in public forums, but Osborn's view that humans had evolved from early ancestors who did not look like apes prevailed among American anthropologists in the 1930s and 1940s.",
              "[25] In 1938, Gregory visited South Africa and saw the Taung Child and the fossils that Broom had recently discovered.",
              "[26] More convinced than ever that Dart and Broom were right, he called Australopithecus africanus \"the missing link no longer missing\".",
              "[27] The turning point in the acceptance of Dart's analysis of the Taung Child came in 1947, when the prominent British anthropologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark announced that he supported it.",
              "Le Gros Clark, who would also play an important role in exposing the fraud of the Piltdown Man in 1953, visited Johannesburg in late 1946 to study Dart's Taung skull and Broom's adult fossils, with the intention of proving that they were only apes.",
              "[28] After two weeks of studies and visiting the caves in which Broom had found his fossils (the Taung cave had been destroyed by miners soon after the discovery of the Taung skull), however, Clark became convinced that these fossils were hominids rather than pongids.",
              "In 1947, Sir Arthur Keith published in Nature, announcing his support of Dart and Broom's research.",
              "He stated \"the evidence submitted by Dr.",
              "Robert Broom and Professor Dart was right and I was wrong\",[8] agreeing that with the new evidence along with the Taung Fossil indicated that this fossil was human-like in posture, dental elements, and its bipedal walk.",
              "In early January 1947, at the First Pan-African Congress on Prehistory, Wilfrid Le Gros Clark was the first anthropologist of such stature to call the Taung Child a \"hominid\": an early human.",
              "An anonymous article, published in Nature on 15 February 1947, announced Clark's conclusions to a wider public.",
              "On that day, Keith, who had been one of Dart's most virulent critics, composed a letter to the editor of Nature announcing that he supported Clark's analysis: \"I was one of those who took the point of view that when the adult form [of Australopithecus] was discovered it would prove to be near akin to the living African anthropoids\u2014the gorilla and the chimpanzee.",

              "[29] Dart drew conclusions that were unavoidably controversial due to the lack of more fossil evidence at the time.",
              "The idea that the skull belonged to a new genus was identified by comparison with skulls of chimpanzees.",
              "Its skull was larger than a fully-grown chimpanzee's.",

              "Its foramen magnum, a void in the cranium, where the spinal cord is continuous with the brain, is beneath the cranium so the creature must have stood upright.",
              "[30] This is an indication of bipedal locomotion.",
              "Dean Falk, a specialist in neuroanatomy, noted that Dart had not fully considered certain apelike attributes for Taung.",
              "This mainly pertains to the lunate sulcas, which Dart had described as having human-like placement, Upon further examination however, Falk determined that these patterns were much more similar to that of an ape's similar sized brain.",
              "[8] This however was of great debate as the sulcas was not incredibly visible on the endocast, as it often is not in apes.",
              "Ralph Holloway stood in opposition of this idea as he had long been known as a supporter of Dart's analysis of Taung.",
              "He believed that the sulcus would be in the area of the lambdoid structure.",
              "Falk however, believed the sulcas was placed higher on the skull, in a more ape-like manner.",
              "However, studies surrounding this have been controversial, as there is no concrete place on the brain where they can place these features.",
              "Paleoneurologists have been tasked with looking at various depressions in the brain and attempting to determine what they are.",
              "These scientists are often met with skepticism, just as Falk in her continued support of an ape-like placement of the lunate sulcas.",
              "However, now many professionals believe that the sulcas is not visible in Taung and many other Australopithecus africanus specimens.",
              "However, a newer endocast specimen title Stw 505 has been examined, and many believe that it supports Dart's hypothesis, but this aspect of Taung is still highly debated, and many still believe it has ape-like placement.",
              "[31] Subsequently, Falk unearthed an unpublished manuscript that Dart completed in 1929 in the Archives of the University of Witwatersrand, which provides a much more thorough description and analysis of the Taung endocast than Dart's earlier announcement in Nature.",
              "This was barred from being published to Dart's dismay in 1931.",
              "It remains unpublished in these archives where very few are able to appreciate it.",
              "In this writing Falk discovered that she and Dart had come to similar conclusions surrounding the evolutionary process of the brain that Taung indicates.",
              "Whereas Dart had identified only two potential sulci on the Taung endocast in 1925, he identified and illustrated 14 additional sulci in this still-unpublished monograph.",
              "There, too, Dart detailed how Taung's endocast was expanded globally in three different regions, contrary to the suggestion that he believed hominin brains evolved back-end-first, in a so-called mosaic fashion.",
              "[8] This goes against Holloway's interpretation as he has indicated that the back area of the brain evolved before other regions of the brain, but it stands in agreement with Falk's belief that the brain evolved equally in a coordinated fashion instead.",
              "[8] The fossil has most of the face and mandible with teeth and, uniquely, a natural endocast of the braincase.",
              "It is estimated to be 2.",
              "3 million years old.",
              "Originally thought to have belonged to a monkey or ape, the skull, as Dart realized, must have been positioned directly above the spine, indicating an upright posture.",
              "That is a trait seen in humans but unknown in other primates.",
              "[citation needed] The Taung Child was originally thought to have been about six years old at death because of the presence of deciduous teeth, but it is now believed to have been about three or four, based on studies of rates of enamel deposition on the teeth.",
              "There was some debate over the age of this creature initially because it was unclear if it grew at the speed of a human, or of an ape.",
              "Compared to an ape, it would have been aged about 4 years, and compared to a human, it would have been aged around 5\u20137 years old.",

              "africanus had a growth rate to adolescence more similar to that of modern apes, like chimpanzees (genus Pan), than to that of modern Homo sapiens.",
              "[citation needed] The creature stood 105 centimetres (3 ft 5 in) tall and weighed between 9 and 11 kilograms (20 and 24 lb).",
              "It had a cranial capacity of 400\u2013500 cc, which is comparable to that of a modern adult chimpanzee.",
              "Because mature brain size is attained within the first few years of life, the relatively small size is unlikely to be attributed to the specimen being a juvenile.",
              "The skull also possesses features more commonly found in humans than apes, including a rising forehead and round eye sockets.",
              "Although the lower portion of the nose resembled a chimpanzee, the overall shorter shape was human-like.",
              "Likewise the lower portion of the face was protruded albeit to a lesser degree than in modern apes.",
              "A bony shelf found within the inner jaw of apes could not be found.",
              "Dart opted to describe the remains as a \"man-ape\" rather than as an \"ape-man\" to highlight the more human features present compared to the remains found of the more recent Pithecanthropus erectus.",
              "[33][8] In 2006, Lee Berger announced the Taung Child probably was killed by an eagle or other large predatory bird, citing the similarity of the damage to the skull and eye sockets of the Taung Child to that seen in modern primates that are known to have been killed by eagles.",

              "The tufa did not form consistently, and over time cavities were left open and they became beneficial areas for animals to take shelter in.",

              "Many were of extinct fauna, which included baboons and other primates, and the more complete or somehow more interesting fossils were kept as curiosities by the Europeans who managed operations.",

              "He quickly searched through the rest of the fossils in the crates, and matched it to a fossilized skull of a juvenile primate, which had a shallow face and fairly small teeth.",
              "[4] Only forty days after he first saw the fossil, Dart completed a paper that named the species of Australopithecus africanus, the \"southern ape from Africa\", and described it as \"an extinct race of apes intermediate between living anthropoids and man\".",

              "Grafton Elliot Smith stated that he needed more evidence and a larger picture of the skull before he could judge the significance of the new fossil.",
              "Arthur Smith Woodward dismissed the Taung Child as having \"little bearing\" on the issue of \"whether the direct ancestors of man are to be sought in Asia or Africa\".",
              "[7] The critiques became more fervent a few months later.",
              "Elliot Smith concluded that the Taung fossil was \"essentially identical\" to the skull of \"the infant gorilla and chimpanzee\".",
              "[7] Infant apes appear more human like because of the \"shape of their forehead and the lack of fully developed brow ridges\".",
              "[8] Addressing the claim that the fossil was \"the missing link between ape and human\", Arthur Keith stated in a letter to Nature that In 1926, a year after the publication of Dart's article, Ales\u030c Hrdlic\u030cka reviewed and approved German and Portuguese articles for the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.",
              "Both articles asserted that the Taung Child should not be placed within the human phylum due to a lack of justification for the classification.",
              "The next year, Hrdlic\u030cka personally commented on another of Dart's articles, this time in Natural History, saying that the author \"very ingeniously, but, it seems obvious, more or less artificially, endeavors to humanize the 'Australopithecus'.",
              "It is not known that this effort thus far has found favor with any other student who gave truly earnest and critical attention to the otherwise very interesting and important Taung relic.\"",
              "[10] \"Far from the bones being objective facts to be judged as evidence, there was an established pattern of belief.",
              "There was a climate of opinion that favored discoveries made in Asia but not the 'silly notion' of small-brained bipeds from Africa\".",
              "Sherwood Washburn, \"Human Evolution After Raymond Dart\" (1985)[11] There were several reasons that it took decades for the field to accept Dart's claim that Australopithecus africanus was in the human line of descent.",
              "First and foremost was the fact that the British scientific establishment had been fooled by the hoax of the Piltdown Man, which had a large brain and ape-like teeth.",
              "[12] Expecting human ancestors to have evolved a large brain very early, they found that the Taung Child's small brain and human-like teeth made it an unlikely ancestor to modern humans.",
              "[13] Secondly, until the 1940s, most anthropologists believed that humans had evolved in Asia, not in Africa.",
              "[14] A third reason is that, despite accepting that modern humans had emerged by evolution, many anthropologists believed that the genus Homo had split from the great apes as long as 30 million years ago and so felt uneasy about accepting that humans had a small-brained, ape-like ancestor, like Australopithecus africanus, only two million years ago.",
              "[15] Lastly, many people disputed the role of this fossil because of their religious affiliation.",
              "When Taung was first announced in February 1925, many anti-evolutionists began to rise up in protest of this fossil.",
              "Dart began receiving many threats from members of various religious communities that proclaimed his ideas blasphemous.",
              "Some were able to reconcile the science with the religious theology through the lens of \"creation science\", but there was still significant opposition.",
              "However, by this time many other fossils such as Java Man, Neanderthal Man, and Rhodesian Man were being discovered, and the theory of evolution was becoming more difficult to refute.",
              "[8] Solly Zuckerman, who had studied anatomy under Dart in South Africa, concluded as early as 1928 that Australopithecus was little more than an ape.",
              "[16] He and a four-member team carried out further studies of the Australopithecine family in the 1940s and 1950s.",
              "Using a \"metrical and statistical approach\" that he thought was superior to purely descriptive methods,[17] he decided that the creatures had not walked on two legs and so were not an intermediate form between humans and apes.",
              "[18] For the rest of his life, Zuckerman continued to deny that Australopithecus was part of the human family tree, even when that was the conclusion that had become \"universally accepted\" by scientists.",
              "[19][20] Dart's claim that Australopithecus africanus, the species name that he had given to the Taung Child, was a transitional form between apes and humans was almost universally rejected.",
              "Robert Broom, a Scottish doctor who worked in South Africa, was one of the few scientists to believe Dart.",
              "[21] Two weeks after Dart announced the discovery of the Taung Child in Nature, Broom visited Dart in Johannesburg to see the fossil.",
              "After he became a paleontologist in 1933, Broom found adult fossils of Australopithecus africanus and discovered more robust fossils, which were eventually renamed Australopithecus robustus (AKA Paranthropus robustus).",
              "[22] Even after Dart chose to take a break from his work in anthropology, Broom undertook more excavations, and slowly began to find more Australopithecus africanus specimens that proved Dart was correct in his analysis of the Taung Child;",
              "it did have human-like morphology.",
              "In 1946, Broom and his colleague Gerrit Schepers published a volume consolidating all the information they had found about Australopithecus africanus in a volume titled The South African Fossil Men: The Australopithecinae.",
              "[8] In the late 1920s, American paleontologist William King Gregory also accepted that Australopithecus was part of the human family tree.",
              "Employed by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, Gregory supported Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley's then-unpopular view that humans were closely related to African apes.",
              "[23] The director of the museum, however, was Henry Fairfield Osborn;",
              "despite being \"the chief public defender of evolution in the United States\" at the time of the Scopes Trial in 1925, he disagreed with Darwin's views on the origins of humanity.",
              "[24] Gregory and Osborn repeatedly debated the issue in public forums, but Osborn's view that humans had evolved from early ancestors who did not look like apes prevailed among American anthropologists in the 1930s and 1940s.",
              "[25] In 1938, Gregory visited South Africa and saw the Taung Child and the fossils that Broom had recently discovered.",
              "[26] More convinced than ever that Dart and Broom were right, he called Australopithecus africanus \"the missing link no longer missing\".",
              "[27] The turning point in the acceptance of Dart's analysis of the Taung Child came in 1947, when the prominent British anthropologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark announced that he supported it.",
              "Le Gros Clark, who would also play an important role in exposing the fraud of the Piltdown Man in 1953, visited Johannesburg in late 1946 to study Dart's Taung skull and Broom's adult fossils, with the intention of proving that they were only apes.",
              "[28] After two weeks of studies and visiting the caves in which Broom had found his fossils (the Taung cave had been destroyed by miners soon after the discovery of the Taung skull), however, Clark became convinced that these fossils were hominids rather than pongids.",
              "In 1947, Sir Arthur Keith published in Nature, announcing his support of Dart and Broom's research.",
              "He stated \"the evidence submitted by Dr.",
              "Robert Broom and Professor Dart was right and I was wrong\",[8] agreeing that with the new evidence along with the Taung Fossil indicated that this fossil was human-like in posture, dental elements, and its bipedal walk.",
              "In early January 1947, at the First Pan-African Congress on Prehistory, Wilfrid Le Gros Clark was the first anthropologist of such stature to call the Taung Child a \"hominid\": an early human.",
              "An anonymous article, published in Nature on 15 February 1947, announced Clark's conclusions to a wider public.",
              "On that day, Keith, who had been one of Dart's most virulent critics, composed a letter to the editor of Nature announcing that he supported Clark's analysis: \"I was one of those who took the point of view that when the adult form [of Australopithecus] was discovered it would prove to be near akin to the living African anthropoids\u2014the gorilla and the chimpanzee.",

              "[29] Dart drew conclusions that were unavoidably controversial due to the lack of more fossil evidence at the time.",
              "The idea that the skull belonged to a new genus was identified by comparison with skulls of chimpanzees.",
              "Its skull was larger than a fully-grown chimpanzee's.",
              "The forehead of the chimpanzee receded to form a heavy browridge and a jutting jaw;",

              "Its foramen magnum, a void in the cranium, where the spinal cord is continuous with the brain, is beneath the cranium so the creature must have stood upright.",
              "[30] This is an indication of bipedal locomotion.",
              "Dean Falk, a specialist in neuroanatomy, noted that Dart had not fully considered certain apelike attributes for Taung.",
              "This mainly pertains to the lunate sulcas, which Dart had described as having human-like placement, Upon further examination however, Falk determined that these patterns were much more similar to that of an ape's similar sized brain.",
              "[8] This however was of great debate as the sulcas was not incredibly visible on the endocast, as it often is not in apes.",
              "Ralph Holloway stood in opposition of this idea as he had long been known as a supporter of Dart's analysis of Taung.",
              "He believed that the sulcus would be in the area of the lambdoid structure.",
              "Falk however, believed the sulcas was placed higher on the skull, in a more ape-like manner.",
              "However, studies surrounding this have been controversial, as there is no concrete place on the brain where they can place these features.",
              "Paleoneurologists have been tasked with looking at various depressions in the brain and attempting to determine what they are.",
              "These scientists are often met with skepticism, just as Falk in her continued support of an ape-like placement of the lunate sulcas.",
              "However, now many professionals believe that the sulcas is not visible in Taung and many other Australopithecus africanus specimens.",
              "However, a newer endocast specimen title Stw 505 has been examined, and many believe that it supports Dart's hypothesis, but this aspect of Taung is still highly debated, and many still believe it has ape-like placement.",
              "[31] Subsequently, Falk unearthed an unpublished manuscript that Dart completed in 1929 in the Archives of the University of Witwatersrand, which provides a much more thorough description and analysis of the Taung endocast than Dart's earlier announcement in Nature.",
              "This was barred from being published to Dart's dismay in 1931.",
              "It remains unpublished in these archives where very few are able to appreciate it.",
              "In this writing Falk discovered that she and Dart had come to similar conclusions surrounding the evolutionary process of the brain that Taung indicates.",
              "Whereas Dart had identified only two potential sulci on the Taung endocast in 1925, he identified and illustrated 14 additional sulci in this still-unpublished monograph.",
              "There, too, Dart detailed how Taung's endocast was expanded globally in three different regions, contrary to the suggestion that he believed hominin brains evolved back-end-first, in a so-called mosaic fashion.",
              "[8] This goes against Holloway's interpretation as he has indicated that the back area of the brain evolved before other regions of the brain, but it stands in agreement with Falk's belief that the brain evolved equally in a coordinated fashion instead.",
              "[8] The fossil has most of the face and mandible with teeth and, uniquely, a natural endocast of the braincase.",
              "It is estimated to be 2.",
              "3 million years old.",
              "Originally thought to have belonged to a monkey or ape, the skull, as Dart realized, must have been positioned directly above the spine, indicating an upright posture.",
              "That is a trait seen in humans but unknown in other primates.",
              "[citation needed] The Taung Child was originally thought to have been about six years old at death because of the presence of deciduous teeth, but it is now believed to have been about three or four, based on studies of rates of enamel deposition on the teeth.",
              "There was some debate over the age of this creature initially because it was unclear if it grew at the speed of a human, or of an ape.",
              "Compared to an ape, it would have been aged about 4 years, and compared to a human, it would have been aged around 5\u20137 years old.",

              "africanus had a growth rate to adolescence more similar to that of modern apes, like chimpanzees (genus Pan), than to that of modern Homo sapiens.",
              "[citation needed] The creature stood 105 centimetres (3 ft 5 in) tall and weighed between 9 and 11 kilograms (20 and 24 lb).",
              "It had a cranial capacity of 400\u2013500 cc, which is comparable to that of a modern adult chimpanzee.",
              "Because mature brain size is attained within the first few years of life, the relatively small size is unlikely to be attributed to the specimen being a juvenile.",
              "The skull also possesses features more commonly found in humans than apes, including a rising forehead and round eye sockets.",
              "Although the lower portion of the nose resembled a chimpanzee, the overall shorter shape was human-like.",
              "Likewise the lower portion of the face was protruded albeit to a lesser degree than in modern apes.",
              "A bony shelf found within the inner jaw of apes could not be found.",
              "Dart opted to describe the remains as a \"man-ape\" rather than as an \"ape-man\" to highlight the more human features present compared to the remains found of the more recent Pithecanthropus erectus.",
              "[33][8] In 2006, Lee Berger announced the Taung Child probably was killed by an eagle or other large predatory bird, citing the similarity of the damage to the skull and eye sockets of the Taung Child to that seen in modern primates that are known to have been killed by eagles.",

              "[8] Addressing the claim that the fossil was \"the missing link between ape and human\", Arthur Keith stated in a letter to Nature that In 1926, a year after the publication of Dart's article, Ales\u030c Hrdlic\u030cka reviewed and approved German and Portuguese articles for the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.",

              "[14] A third reason is that, despite accepting that modern humans had emerged by evolution, many anthropologists believed that the genus Homo had split from the great apes as long as 30 million years ago and so felt uneasy about accepting that humans had a small-brained, ape-like ancestor, like Australopithecus africanus, only two million years ago.",
              "[15] Lastly, many people disputed the role of this fossil because of their religious affiliation.",

              "[19][20] Dart's claim that Australopithecus africanus, the species name that he had given to the Taung Child, was a transitional form between apes and humans was almost universally rejected.",
              "Robert Broom, a Scottish doctor who worked in South Africa, was one of the few scientists to believe Dart.",

              "After he became a paleontologist in 1933, Broom found adult fossils of Australopithecus africanus and discovered more robust fossils, which were eventually renamed Australopithecus robustus (AKA Paranthropus robustus).",

              "Employed by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, Gregory supported Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley's then-unpopular view that humans were closely related to African apes.",

              "despite being \"the chief public defender of evolution in the United States\" at the time of the Scopes Trial in 1925, he disagreed with Darwin's views on the origins of humanity.",
              "[24] Gregory and Osborn repeatedly debated the issue in public forums, but Osborn's view that humans had evolved from early ancestors who did not look like apes prevailed among American anthropologists in the 1930s and 1940s.",

              "[28] After two weeks of studies and visiting the caves in which Broom had found his fossils (the Taung cave had been destroyed by miners soon after the discovery of the Taung skull), however, Clark became convinced that these fossils were hominids rather than pongids.",

              "Its skull was larger than a fully-grown chimpanzee's.",

              "Its foramen magnum, a void in the cranium, where the spinal cord is continuous with the brain, is beneath the cranium so the creature must have stood upright.",
              "[30] This is an indication of bipedal locomotion.",
              "Dean Falk, a specialist in neuroanatomy, noted that Dart had not fully considered certain apelike attributes for Taung.",
              "This mainly pertains to the lunate sulcas, which Dart had described as having human-like placement, Upon further examination however, Falk determined that these patterns were much more similar to that of an ape's similar sized brain.",
              "[8] This however was of great debate as the sulcas was not incredibly visible on the endocast, as it often is not in apes.",
              "Ralph Holloway stood in opposition of this idea as he had long been known as a supporter of Dart's analysis of Taung.",
              "He believed that the sulcus would be in the area of the lambdoid structure.",
              "Falk however, believed the sulcas was placed higher on the skull, in a more ape-like manner.",
              "However, studies surrounding this have been controversial, as there is no concrete place on the brain where they can place these features.",
              "Paleoneurologists have been tasked with looking at various depressions in the brain and attempting to determine what they are.",
              "These scientists are often met with skepticism, just as Falk in her continued support of an ape-like placement of the lunate sulcas.",
              "However, now many professionals believe that the sulcas is not visible in Taung and many other Australopithecus africanus specimens.",
              "However, a newer endocast specimen title Stw 505 has been examined, and many believe that it supports Dart's hypothesis, but this aspect of Taung is still highly debated, and many still believe it has ape-like placement.",
              "[31] Subsequently, Falk unearthed an unpublished manuscript that Dart completed in 1929 in the Archives of the University of Witwatersrand, which provides a much more thorough description and analysis of the Taung endocast than Dart's earlier announcement in Nature.",
              "This was barred from being published to Dart's dismay in 1931.",
              "It remains unpublished in these archives where very few are able to appreciate it.",
              "In this writing Falk discovered that she and Dart had come to similar conclusions surrounding the evolutionary process of the brain that Taung indicates.",
              "Whereas Dart had identified only two potential sulci on the Taung endocast in 1925, he identified and illustrated 14 additional sulci in this still-unpublished monograph.",
              "There, too, Dart detailed how Taung's endocast was expanded globally in three different regions, contrary to the suggestion that he believed hominin brains evolved back-end-first, in a so-called mosaic fashion.",
              "[8] This goes against Holloway's interpretation as he has indicated that the back area of the brain evolved before other regions of the brain, but it stands in agreement with Falk's belief that the brain evolved equally in a coordinated fashion instead.",
              "[8] The fossil has most of the face and mandible with teeth and, uniquely, a natural endocast of the braincase.",
              "It is estimated to be 2.",
              "3 million years old.",
              "Originally thought to have belonged to a monkey or ape, the skull, as Dart realized, must have been positioned directly above the spine, indicating an upright posture.",
              "That is a trait seen in humans but unknown in other primates.",
              "[citation needed] The Taung Child was originally thought to have been about six years old at death because of the presence of deciduous teeth, but it is now believed to have been about three or four, based on studies of rates of enamel deposition on the teeth.",
              "There was some debate over the age of this creature initially because it was unclear if it grew at the speed of a human, or of an ape.",
              "Compared to an ape, it would have been aged about 4 years, and compared to a human, it would have been aged around 5\u20137 years old.",
              "[32] Comparison of the Taung Child fossil to the skull of a nine-year-old modern child suggest that A.",
              "africanus had a growth rate to adolescence more similar to that of modern apes, like chimpanzees (genus Pan), than to that of modern Homo sapiens.",
              "[citation needed] The creature stood 105 centimetres (3 ft 5 in) tall and weighed between 9 and 11 kilograms (20 and 24 lb).",
              "It had a cranial capacity of 400\u2013500 cc, which is comparable to that of a modern adult chimpanzee.",
              "Because mature brain size is attained within the first few years of life, the relatively small size is unlikely to be attributed to the specimen being a juvenile.",
              "The skull also possesses features more commonly found in humans than apes, including a rising forehead and round eye sockets.",
              "Although the lower portion of the nose resembled a chimpanzee, the overall shorter shape was human-like.",
              "Likewise the lower portion of the face was protruded albeit to a lesser degree than in modern apes.",
              "A bony shelf found within the inner jaw of apes could not be found.",
              "Dart opted to describe the remains as a \"man-ape\" rather than as an \"ape-man\" to highlight the more human features present compared to the remains found of the more recent Pithecanthropus erectus.",
              "[33][8] In 2006, Lee Berger announced the Taung Child probably was killed by an eagle or other large predatory bird, citing the similarity of the damage to the skull and eye sockets of the Taung Child to that seen in modern primates that are known to have been killed by eagles.",
