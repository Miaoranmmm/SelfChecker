    "response": "That's a great question. Cancer research is a very active and dynamic field, and there are many breakthroughs happening every year. Some of the most significant ones in recent years include:\n\n- The use of **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning** to improve cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment[^5^] [^2^]. For example, AI-based risk profiling can help detect breast cancer early, and AI technology can analyze X-rays to identify cancers in remote areas[^5^].\n- The development of **precision oncology**, which involves studying the genetic and molecular characteristics of individual tumors and tailoring personalized treatments based on them[^5^] [^6^]. This can reduce the harm to healthy cells and the side effects of general treatments like chemotherapy[^5^].\n- The discovery of new ways to **engineer immune cells** to fight cancer, such as using cells from healthy donors to target and destroy blood cancer cells[^6^], or using cells from patients' own blood to target solid tumors[^6^].\n- The advancement of **DNA sequencing** technology to reveal new clues about the causes and evolution of cancer[^5^] [^6^]. For example, scientists have sequenced the DNA of more than 12,000 cancer tumors to identify new mutations and potential targets for therapy[^5^].\n- The invention of new **blood tests** that can predict how cancer will spread or respond to treatment[^2^] [^3^] [^6^].

              "Previous image Next image While mammograms are currently the gold standard in breast cancer screening, swirls of controversy exist regarding when and how often they should be administered.",
              "On the one hand, advocates argue for the ability to save lives: Women aged 60-69 who receive mammograms, for example, have a 33 percent lower risk of dying compared to those who don\u2019t get mammograms. Meanwhile, others argue about costly and potentially traumatic false positives: A meta-analysis of three randomized trials found a 19 percent over-diagnosis rate from mammography.",
              "Even with some saved lives, and some overtreatment and overscreening, current guidelines are still a catch-all: Women aged 45 to 54 should get mammograms every year.",
              "While personalized screening has long been thought of as the answer, tools that can leverage the troves of data to do this lag behind.",
              "This led scientists from MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning and Health to ask: Can we use machine learning to provide personalized screening?",
              "Out of this came Tempo, a technology for creating risk-based screening guidelines.",
              "Using an AI-based risk model that looks at who was screened and when they got diagnosed, Tempo will recommend a patient return for a mammogram at a specific time point in the future, like six months or three years.",
              "The same Tempo policy can be easily adapted to a wide range of possible screening preferences, which would let clinicians pick their desired early-detection-to-screening-cost trade-off, without training new policies.",
              "The model was trained on a large screening mammography dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and was tested on held-out patients from MGH as well as external datasets from Emory, Karolinska Sweden, and Chang Gung Memorial hospitals.",
              "Using the team\u2019s previously developed risk-assessment algorithm Mirai, Tempo obtained better early detection than annual screening while requiring 25 percent fewer mammograms overall at Karolinska.",
              "At MGH, it recommended roughly a mammogram a year, and obtained a simulated early detection benefit of roughly four-and-a-half months better.",
              "\u201cBy tailoring the screening to the patient's individual risk, we can improve patient outcomes, reduce overtreatment, and eliminate health disparities,\u201d says Adam Yala, a PhD student in electrical engineering and computer science, MIT CSAIL affiliate, and lead researcher on a paper describing Tempo published Jan.",
              "13 in Nature Medicine.",
              "\u201cGiven the massive scale of breast cancer screening, with tens of millions of women getting mammograms every year, improvements to our guidelines are immensely important.",
              "\u201d Early uses of AI in medicine stem back to the 1960s, where many refer to the Dendral experiments as kicking off the field.",
              "Researchers created a software system that was considered the first expert kind that automated the decision-making and problem-solving behavior of organic chemists.",
              "Sixty years later, deep medicine has greatly evolved drug diagnostics, predictive medicine, and patient care.",
              "\u201cCurrent guidelines divide the population into a few large groups, like younger or older than 55, and recommend the same screening frequency to all the members of a cohort.",
              "The development of AI-based risk models that operate over raw patient data give us an opportunity to transform screening, giving more frequent screens to those who need it and sparing the rest,\u201d says Yala.",
              "\u201cA key aspect of these models is that their predictions can evolve over time as a patient\u2019s raw data changes, suggesting that screening policies need to be attuned to changes in risk and be optimized over long periods of patient data.",
              "\u201d Tempo uses reinforcement learning, a machine learning method widely known for success in games like Chess and Go, to develop a \u201cpolicy\u201d that predicts a followup recommendation for each patient.",
              "The training data here only had information about a patient\u2019s risk at the time points when their mammogram was taken (when they were 50, or 55, for example).",
              "The team needed the risk assessment at intermediate points, so they designed their algorithm to learn a patient\u2019s risk at unobserved time points from their observed screenings, which evolved as new mammograms of the patient became available.",
              "The team first trained a neural network to predict future risk assessments given previous ones.",
              "This model then estimates patient risk at unobserved time points, and it enables simulation of the risk-based screening policies.",
              "Next, they trained that policy, (also a neural network), to maximize the reward (for example, the combination of early detection and screening cost) to the retrospective training set.",
              "Eventually, you\u2019d get a recommendation for when to return for the next screen, ranging from six months to three years in the future, in multiples of six months \u2014 the standard is only one or two years.",
              "Let\u2019s say Patient A comes in for their first mammogram, and eventually gets diagnosed at Year Four.",
              "In Year Two, there\u2019s nothing, so they don\u2019t come back for another two years, but then at Year Four they get a diagnosis.",
              "Now there's been two years of gap between the last screen, where a tumor could have grown.",
              "Using Tempo, at that first mammogram, Year Zero, the recommendation might have been to come back in two years.",
              "And then at Year Two, it might have seen that risk is high, and recommended that the patient come back in six months, and in the best case, it would be detectable.",
              "The model is dynamically changing the patient\u2019s screening frequency, based on how the risk profile is changing.",
              "Tempo uses a simple metric for early detection, which assumes that cancer can be caught up to 18 months in advance.",
              "While Tempo outperformed current guidelines across different settings of this assumption (six months, 12 months), none of these assumptions are perfect, as the early detection potential of a tumor depends on that tumor's characteristics.",
              "The team suggested that follow-up work using tumor growth models could address this issue.",
              "Also, the screening-cost metric, which counts the total screening volume recommended by Tempo, doesn't provide a full analysis of the entire future cost because it does not explicitly quantify false positive risks or additional screening harms. There are many future directions that can further improve personalized screening algorithms. The team says one avenue would be to build on the metrics used to estimate early detection and screening costs from retrospective data, which would result in more refined guidelines.",
              "Tempo could also be adapted to include different types of screening recommendations, such as leveraging MRI or mammograms, and future work could separately model the costs and benefits of each.",
              "With better screening policies, recalculating the earliest and latest age that screening is still cost-effective for a patient might be feasible.",
              "\u201cOur framework is flexible and can be readily utilized for other diseases, other forms of risk models, and other definitions of early detection benefit or screening cost.",
              "We expect the utility of Tempo to continue to improve as risk models and outcome metrics are further refined.",

              "A prominent example comes from a randomized controlled trial involving more than 80,000 women undergoing mammography screening for breast cancer, in which AI-supported mammography reading outperformed radiologist reading by a ratio of 1.",

              "Even the analysis of retinal images for the detection of extraocular diseases such as stroke or Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2014 an approach which, to some, might sound like science-fiction \u2014 has shown promising results6.",
              "The accuracy metrics of the algorithm used by Cao et al.",
              "2 are superior to those of several acknowledged screening methods such as Pap smears for cervical cancer or mammography for breast cancer7,8.",
              "This makes it tempting to call for integration of this specific method into large-scale screening efforts \u2014 by either offering non-contrast abdominal CT to specific population groups or applying the tool to non-contrast CT performed for other reasons (not related to cancer screening).",
              "However, the findings2 also illustrate some of the challenges faced by AI-based screening studies, and these need to be considered before conclusive recommendations can be made.",
              "The idea of applying AI-based screening to images acquired for other purposes, such as during visits to emergency departments or routine checkups, is appealing owing to the potential for synergy and cost reduction.",
              "However, the success of a screening method hinges on the detection of the disease in the early stages and the related amenability to curative treatment.",
              "Accuracy must always be specifically considered in this context, for each cancer type and population group under study.",
              "This is highly relevant for pancreatic cancer, owing to the poor prognosis in advanced stages of the disease.",

              "False-positive findings startle patients and entail costly and often invasive further diagnostic measures.",
              "Accurate informed consent of patients is therefore paramount, and the possible consequences of a positive, but also a negative, finding on AI-based screening must be well explained.",
              "In addition, some patients might be reluctant to have their data assessed by an AI tool rather than a human, even in the presence of compelling data, owing to a general skepticism about AI9.",
              "Lastly, the value of any screening method for cancer lies in reducing all-cause mortality10.",

              "The study by Cao et al.",

              "Any definitive conclusion on the utility of the method would thus be premature, as AI-based screening should be evaluated with the same rigor as conventional screening \u2014 using randomized controlled trials to compare the approach with a valid comparator with regard to all-cause mortality.",
              "Notwithstanding these challenges, it is possible to envision a future in which AI is used to combine information from routine imaging with information on clinical history11, and even with individual online search trends and use of social media (as has been shown for disease outbreaks)12 \u2014 for the prediction and early detection of challenging-to-treat diseases such as pancreatic cancer (Fig.",

              "But the gene changes in the cancer cells might be different from one person to another, even if they have the same type of cancer.",

              "In these cases, the person might meet with a certified genetic counselor and consider having genetic testing.",
              "The testing can show if they have an inherited gene change that puts them at a higher risk for certain types of cancer.",
              "If so, the doctor might recommend screening and other tests (often at a younger age than usual) to help find cancer early, or they might prescribe medicines or suggest healthy habits that might help lower the person's cancer risk.",

              "Many clinical trials are done with people who have specific types of cancer.",

              "And precision medicine clinical trials are often available only at larger cancer centers.",
              "This means sometimes the chances for taking part in a clinical trial might be limited for some people.",
              "Even when precision medicine is already available outside of a clinical trial, it might not always be used as well as it could be.",
              "For example: It's important to ask questions and know all options that are available to you.",

              "Much work is ongoing to better understand and treat this group of diseases.",
              "The general defining feature of cancer is accumulated cell mutation, which manifests as tumors with uncontrolled growth.",
              "However, cancer is a complex, extremely heterogeneous condition.",

              "Despite this complexity and variability, most types of cancer are treated with the same generic therapies.",
              "There are four main types of standard cancer treatments: surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy7.",
              "Some individuals will only require one treatment, but most often, a combination of treatments is used to tackle the resistant nature of cancer.",
              "Surgery can be used when there are solid tumors that have not metastasized and are located in accessible areas of the body;",
              "however, many cancers do metastasize, so more aggressive treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, are needed.",

              "Notably, the effectiveness of these treatments depends on many individual factors, such as the type, stage, and location of the cancer as well as the patient\u2019s age and overall health.",
              "This suggests that several personal factors should be considered before selecting a cancer treatment.",
              "Another class of cancer treatments that have paved the way to more specific and effective therapies is immunotherapy, which harnesses a patients\u2019 own immune system to fight cancer.",
              "Immunotherapy treatments include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, vaccines, and adoptive cell transfer, most prominently in the form of hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies10.",
              "Adoption of immunotherapy has steered the field of cancer treatment toward the concept of precision and personalized medicine (PPM), in which therapy selection is tailored to each individual.",
              "Over the past decade it has become increasingly clear that no two patients\u2019 cancers are exactly the same, and hence, may have variable responses to generic treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation11.",

              "Companion diagnostics (CDx) help identify which treatments will be most effective for a specific patient\u2019s tumor, and novel cell therapies are used to target the cancer with minimal damage to healthy tissues, making the PPM model more effective and safer.",
              "There also exists a growing category of PPM products called companion diagnostics (CDx), which are molecular assays that measure levels of proteins, genes, or specific mutations to reveal a specific, efficacious therapy for an individual\u2019s condition15.",
              "Some examples include Dako Denmark\u2019s HERCEPTEST and HER2 FISH PharmDx Kit, which determine HER2 protein and gene overexpression in fixed breast, metastatic gastric, or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma tissues16.",

              "The FDA has shown support in the PPM approach with their approval of these and other technologies since 1998, when the drug trastuzumab was approved for the treatment of HER2 receptor positive breast cancer18.",
              "Furthermore, the enactment of the Precision Medicine Initiative in 2015 has also pushed the PPM field forward, by requiring the FDA to develop new platforms to evaluate PPM diagnostics and therapies19.",
              "It is clear that integrating a PPM perspective into cancer research and treatment could result in major improvements in fighting cancer, especially due to its complexity and interpatient variability.",

              "A few examples of the uses of PPM include determining genetic predisposition to a disease, identifying patient groups for clinical trials, and identifying individuals that are more likely to respond well to a specific therapy.",
              "The completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP) gave scientists the ability to read and interpret an individual\u2019s genetic code and to identify genetic predispositions to certain diseases.",

              "Certainly, the identification of disease-specific genetic variants and biomarkers that can be exploited is an important undertaking, but the enormity of the work, time, and cost involved should not be understated.",
              "Furthermore, the costs of performing genetic analysis for every patient ahead of first line therapies is currently unrealistic, despite the fact that technology continues to lower sequencing costs.",
              "Another promising approach is using metabolomics to determine how a patient will metabolize specific therapeutics.",
              "This approach is more direct and efficient in providing meaningful information compared to other omics approaches, since many pharmaceuticals are metabolized by just a few proteins in the liver and many adverse drug reactions can be traced back to variations in these enzymes.",

              "As the aforementioned studies have demonstrated, identifying responders or nonresponders can result in cost savings during both drug development and clinical use of pharmaceuticals.",
              "While this potential savings is promising, the real question is if healthcare spending will actually be decreased through the use of these tools.",
              "Many supporters say yes, but skeptics point out that by stratifying patients and targeting therapies, the pharmaceutical companies are shrinking their available market share, which could result in a price increase to offset reduced volume.",
              "This means that this strategy is only economically beneficial in markets with pricing flexibility, where buyers and sellers are able to negotiate on price.",
              "Pricing flexibility will vary based on payer\u2019s price sensitivity, which is highly dependent on disease area.",
              "Not only is pricing flexibility a requirement to make this approach economically attractive, but the underlying pathophysiological principles of the targeted disease must be understood.",
              "This leaves conditions like psychiatric disorders, which carry a great societal and healthcare burden, out of the current scope of PPM, as they are currently too poorly understood to benefit from the approach163.",
              "While PPM may hold great potential to reduce costs in the long run, it is unclear who foots the bill in the interim.",
              "Currently there are very few instances of private insurance companies or government payers providing reimbursement for broad-based genomic testing and analysis.",
              "Insurance companies and payers rely on mountains of outcome-based data to determine what they will cover.",
              "Payers are hesitant to support new and untested treatments without overwhelming evidence that they will be effective.",
              "As PPM is a new and emerging field, a sufficient level of data and evidence has not been accumulated to support widespread reimbursement for such treatments in the eyes of the payers.",
              "The amount of evidence is growing, however, and some payers are catching on.",
              "In December 2015, Foundation Medicine announced that they had reached an agreement with UnitedHealthcare, one of the largest private insurance companies in the United States, on their genomic profiling assay166,167.",
              "UnitedHealthcare agreed to reimburse the use of the genomic profiling assay for patients with metastatic stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer.",
              "This move has been described as a critical first step toward bringing genomic profiling into the standard treatment of care for metastatic cancers.",
              "While it is a positive move toward wider adoption, both in terms of indications and payers, the greatest industry shift toward PPM will likely come when Medicare adopts a reimbursement policy for PPM treatments.",
              "Medicare represents the largest single payer in the United States, comprising 20% of total national health expenditures in 2015156,168.",
              "As such, many private insurance companies use Medicare to benchmark their own coverages.",
              "When and if Medicare adds increased coverages for broad genomic assays as a part of standard treatment, other insurance companies would surely follow.",
              "On the surface, a PPM approach holds great potential benefit to both the pharmaceutical industry and patients.",
              "However, with the complexities of the existing healthcare environment, involving drug developers, regulators, clinicians, and payers, the immediate and lasting benefits are not as clear.",
              "Trends toward outcome- and value-based pricing and reimbursement models greatly increase the financial value of PPM.",
              "This type of model will require collaboration between regulatory agencies and industry to develop and shape adjusted drug development and approval processes.",
              "Additionally, collaboration and willingness of payers to adopt these approaches is critical to make PPM economically viable and beneficial for patients and the industry as a whole.",
              "Tied into the economic considerations of PPM are the ethical considerations.",
              "With the added power of harnessing large amounts of medical data comes the heavy responsibility of protecting and distributing it correctly.",
              "The medical field is now poised to move from a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to a PPM method of treating patients based on the individuality of this information.",
              "However, this comes at a cost, as some patients may be at a disadvantage due to a shift in allocation of resources throughout the healthcare system.",
              "There are also issues related to implementation and control of data.",
              "Clinicians may have to reach an agreement with insurance companies and researchers that allows for providing the best possible treatment while also protecting patient privacy.",
              "Generating genetic information and linking it to patient outcome will aid researchers and clinicians immensely, but it also means that the practice of informed consent will need to be substantially updated169.",
              "Some have suggested the development of \u201ctranslational ethics\u201d that involves the patients as much as possible in the research and clinical processes.",
              "One successful study, CARPEM, formed a patient committee group tasked with designing a pamphlet explaining the informed consent process in a patient-friendly manner170.",
              "Others have suggested updating the \u201csocial contract\u201d between clinicians, researchers, patients, and society as a whole171.",
              "Since patients are the stakeholders who will benefit the most from advances in PPM, involving them as much as possible may be the best strategy for moving forward.",
              "This review has focused on cancer for the sake of brevity, but it is easy to imagine how similar issues would apply to psychiatric disorders or autoimmune diseases.",
              "Regardless of the clinical application, as the field of PPM advances, standard ethical practices surrounding clinical medicine and research will need to be updated.",
              "Overall, the promise of PPM is exciting and inspiring, and it has the potential to transform the way in which cancer is effectively treated.",
              "As a result of PPM, if omics testing is performed prior to treatment, patients would be less likely to experience adverse side effects from a treatment that is ultimately ineffective, for example, chemotherapy, and, rather, would only spend time and resources on personalized, effective treatments.",
              "The incentive for pharmaceutical industries would be to develop more effective drugs that have a greater chance of being approved, albeit for a smaller population172.",
              "This shift toward a more tailored treatment experience would benefit patients to a great extent in the long run.",
              "Making this a reality, however, requires many key players \u2014 physicians, insurance companies, and regulators \u2014 to come together for the benefit of the patient.",
              "These players each have their own compelling reasons for resisting this transition to PPM, including needing enough evidence to support new strategies or concern about the profitability of disease prevention.",
              "Regulators are caught between physicians, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies and must decide which agencies are responsible for modifying the rules in the new era of PPM.",
              "Ultimately, it may be up to patients to push for these changes since they stand to benefit the most172.",
              "While it is important to recognize the promise and potential of PPM, it is also important to ask whether the lofty goals proposed by advocates are realistic.",
              "Will we actually be able to treat each patient individually?",
              "The answer is almost certainly not, but we may be able to treat subpopulations more effectively.",
              "Moreover, depending on how the costs to cover the implementation of PPM are distributed, who will truly benefit from it?",
              "The answer is, in the short term, probably only those with private insurance and enough disposable income will be able to afford additional genetic tests172.",
              "Additionally, even if healthcare based on PPM was equally accessible to all, it might not reach those who need it most.",
              "Instead of focusing on improving clinical care, it has been posited that we should be working to remedy the social structures that prevent disadvantaged groups from leading healthier lives.",
              "This may in fact be the best way to improve population health since income is one of the most significant determinants of health outcomes173.",
              "The PPM field has grown and matured tremendously since the milestone achievement of sequencing an entire human genome in 2003.",

              "More than 80% of children diagnosed with ALL that arises in B cells, the predominant type of pediatric ALL, will be cured by intensive chemotherapy.",

              "Like all cancer treatments, CAR T-cell therapies can cause severe side effects, including a mass die-off of antibody-producing B cells and infections.",
              "One of the most frequent and serious side effects is cytokine release syndrome (CRS).",
              "As part of their immune-related duties, T cells release cytokines, chemical messengers that help stimulate and direct the immune response.",
              "In the case of CRS, the infused T cells flood the bloodstream with cytokines, causing serious side effects, including dangerously high fevers and precipitous drops in blood pressure.",
              "In some cases, severe CRS can be fatal.",
              "Ironically, CRS is considered an \"on-target\" effect of CAR T-cell therapy\u2014that is, its presence demonstrates that T cells are at work in the body.",
              "Generally, patients with the most extensive amount of cancer in their bodies are more likely to experience severe CRS from CAR T cells, Dr.",
              "Kochenderfer explained.",
              "In many patients, both children and adults, mild forms of CRS can be managed with standard supportive therapies, including steroids.",
              "And as researchers have gained more experience with CAR T-cell therapy, they've discovered ways to better manage the more serious cases of CRS.",
              "A big part of that management is the drug tocilizumab (Actemra).",
              "This drug, initially used to treat inflammatory conditions like juvenile arthritis, blocks the activity of IL-6, a cytokine that is often secreted in large amounts by T cells and macrophages.",
              "The other side effect of particular concern with CAR T-cell therapies is neurologic effects, including severe confusion, seizure-like activity, and impaired speech.",
              "The precise cause of these neurologic side effects (also called immune effector cell\u2013associated neurotoxicity syndrome, or ICANS) is still unclear.",

              "Brudno said.",
              "One approach is the prophylactic use of tocilizumab and low-dose steroids.",

              "Other treatments for ICANS are being investigated.",
              "Smaller studies, for example, have found that anakinra (Kineret), which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, may help prevent severe ICANS in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapies.",
              "One more idea for protecting against severe CRS and ICANS is to modify the CARs themselves, Dr.",
              "Brudno explained.",
              "In a small clinical trial of adults with lymphoma, for example, patients treated with a \u201cremodeled\u201d CD-19-targeted CAR T cell developed at NCI had far fewer severe neurologic side effects than historically seen with the original form of the same CAR.",
              "Research on CAR T cells is continuing at a swift pace, including hundreds of ongoing clinical trials.",
              "Part of this expansion is a product of researchers having identified additional antigens on tumor cells that might be good targets for CAR T cells.",
              "Although CD19 and BCMA are the only antigens for which there are FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapies, CAR T-cell therapies have been developed that target other antigens commonly found in blood cancers, including therapies that target multiple antigens at one time.",
              "But what about the use of CAR T cells to treat solid tumors, like brain, breast, or kidney cancer?",

              "Despite these obstacles, researchers continue to try to find ways to use CAR T cells to treat solid tumors.",

              "Much of this research is still in its early days, but some CAR NK cell therapies are already being tested in small clinical trials.",
              "And not only is the source of T cells and the type of immune cell being reconsidered, but so is where the therapies are actually made.",

              "Scientists engineer potent immune cells for &#39;off-the-shelf&#39; cancer ...",
              "UCLA scientists have developed a new method to engineer more powerful immune cells that can potentially be used for \"off-the-shelf\" cell therapy to treat challenging cancers.",
              "\"Off-the-shelf\" cell therapy, also known as allogenic therapy, uses immune cells derived from healthy donors instead of patients.",
              "The approach can bring cell therapies, like chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, to more patients in a timelier manner, which is one of the major barriers in getting these life-saving treatments to patients.",
              "\"Time is often of the essence when it comes to treating people with advanced cancers,\" said Lili Yang, associate professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics and member of the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.",
              "\"Currently, these types of therapies need to be tailored to the individual patient.",
              "We have to extract white blood cells from a patient, genetically engineer the cells and then re-infuse them back into the patient.",
              "This process can take weeks to months and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to treat each patient.\"",
              "This new approach, described in Nature Communications, is a crucial step toward developing more effective cell therapies that have a lower cost and wait that can be mass-produced and shipped to hospitals around the world, making CAR-T cell therapy more affordable and accessible to a broader range of patients.",
              "For the study, Yang and her team focused on gamma delta T cells, an immune cell known for its ability to target a wide array of cancers -- including solid tumors -- without causing graft-versus-host disease, a common complication in allogeneic cell therapies.",
              "While gamma delta T cell-based treatments have been studied before, they have had limited clinical success due to donor variability, short-lived persistence and cancer cells' ability to escape or avoid the body's immune response.",
              "However, Yang and her team found that donor gamma delta T cells with high expressions of a CD16 surface marker had a greater ability to kill cancer cells.",
              "\"These CD16-high gamma delta T cells exhibit unique characteristics that increases their ability to recognize a tumor,\" said Yang, who is also a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA and the study's senior author.",
              "\"They demonstrate heightened levels of effector molecules and are equipped with the ability to engage in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against cancer cells.",
              "We found by using CD16 as a biomarker for donor selection we can improve their anti-cancer properties.\"",
              "Yang and her team also overcame some of the issues seen in previous studies with gamma delta T cell treatments by engineering the cells so they were equipped with CAR and IL-15, two essential components that help enhance gamma delta T cells' cancer-fighting capabilities.",
              "The team of scientists were then able to efficiently produce the more potent engineered cells in large quantities, which they then tested on two different preclinical ovarian cancer models.",
              "They found the cells were capable of attacking tumors and remained in the models for a long period of time, enabling them to continue their anti-tumor effects.",
              "Additionally, there were no signs of complications such as graft-versus-host disease.",
              "\"The results of this research shed light on the promising feasibility, therapeutic potential, and remarkable safety profile of these engineered CD16-high gamma delta T cells,\" Yang said.",
              "\"We hope this can be a viable therapeutic option for cancer treatment in the future.\"",

              "Part of Nature Outlook: Cancer diagnosis Part of Nature Outlook: Cancer diagnosis Mutations that impair the function of genes that underpin a cell\u2019s ability to repair damaged DNA have also been implicated in cancer, as have mutations that generate oncogenes: genes that can actively transform a healthy cell into a cancer cell.",
              "For example, HER2-positive breast cancers involve a mutated HER2 oncogene, which produces a protein that increases the growth of cancer cells.",
              "Sometimes, as in the case of BRCA1 and BRCA2, these mutations are inherited.",

              "Diagnosis of these \u2018liquid\u2019 tumours is usually informed, and sometimes explicitly decided, by genetic abnormalities.",
              "For example, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is diagnosed by the presence of a mutated gene called BCR-ABL, which is created by the transfer of genetic material from one chromosome to another.",

              "Categorizations based on the location of the cancer and the type of cell involved are still essential.",
              "\u201cBut it\u2019s getting from these broad-basket diagnoses into the subcategories of these diagnoses, which can only really be defined genetically, that is really finessing our treatment within those categories,\u201d Blombery says.",

              "And gefitinib, which targets the epidermal growth factor receptor in some lung cancers, was approved in 2003.",
              "Some genetic mutations can significantly alter the choice of treatment, even if those treatments do not directly target the mutation.",
              "For example, in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the presence of a mutation in the TP53 gene means that the cancer probably won\u2019t respond to chemoimmunotherapy.",
              "If physicians know that a person has that mutation, they might instead opt for a stem-cell transplant.",
              "And in colorectal cancers, mutations in the KRAS gene mean that patients will not respond to drugs such as cetuximab or panitumumab.",
              "Certain mutations can also signal that a cancer is more likely to become resistant to a treatment.",
              "In acute myeloid leukaemia, for example, some people carry mutations that make their cancer more likely to become resistant to a class of drug called isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors.",

              "Its database now contains genomic-sequencing information from around 5,000 people.",
              "The institute has focused on people with metastatic cancer because it would be too costly to sequence everyone, and many people with primary cancer can be cured with existing treatments.",
              "The idea, says Voest, is to give the people at the highest risk of dying from cancer access to a wider pool of potential treatments, whether these are the standard of care for a particular cancer, an off-label treatment or even an experimental agent.",
              "In 2016, the institute launched the Drug Rediscovery Protocol, in which people who have so far not responded to standard treatment, but who have DNA anomalies that suggest they might respond to therapies not approved for their particular cancer, are treated with those drugs in an experimental setting.",
              "The approach is showing clinical benefit in around one-third of people2.",
              "Shaw says that she takes a more focused approach by sequencing people with cancer only when a known actionable molecular target exists for that cancer type, or when patients have run out of treatment options.",
              "She estimates that there are only about 130\u2013140 \u201ctherapeutically actionable\u201d genes for solid tumours, and even fewer for liquid tumours.",
              "But Voest says that whole-genome sequencing of people with metastatic disease isn\u2019t just about finding mutations that are currently treatable, but also about targets and treatments yet to be discovered.",
              "Identifying people\u2019s mutations in advance means that, when researchers do discover a treatment option for a particular mutation, \u201cwe can identify patients that we can help\u201d.",

              "Checkpoint inhibitors do not target a particular mutation and they are not affected by cancer mutations.",

              "Because genomic instability is one of the fundamental features of cancer, this intrinsic tendency of genomic variation leads to striking intratumor heterogeneity and functions during the process of cancer formation, development, metastasis, and relapse.",
              "With the increased mutation rate and abundant diversity of the gene pool, this heterogeneity leads to cancer evolution, which is the major obstacle in the clinical treatment of cancer.",
              "Cells rely on the integrity of DNA repair machineries to maintain genomic stability, but these machineries often do not function properly in cancer cells.",
              "The deficiency of DNA repair could contribute to the generation of cancer genomic instability, and ultimately promote cancer evolution.",
              "With the rapid advance of new technologies, such as single-cell sequencing in recent years, we have the opportunity to better understand the specific processes and mechanisms of cancer evolution, and its relationship with DNA repair.",
              "Here, we review recent findings on how DNA repair affects cancer evolution, and discuss how these mechanisms provide the basis for critical clinical challenges and therapeutic applications.",
              "Cancer is a major threat to human health throughout the world.",
              "Despite an extraordinary amount of effort, the goal of eradication or even controlling the disease has not been achieved1.",
              "Cellular complexity and evolutionary characteristics are the main barriers to curing the disease.",
              "Cancer clones possess the features of asexual reproduction and are capable of constantly acquiring mutations under the stress of natural or artificial selection, which make them perfectly suitable for the Darwinian adaptive system.",
              "Genomic instability is one of the hallmarks of cancer cells, which contributes to intratumor heterogeneity, and provides the genetic diversity as materials of natural and artificial selection2.",
              "Genomic instability refers to the increased tendency to acquire genomic alterations, which range from base pair mutations to chromosome aberrations.",
              "Genomic instability caused by defective DNA repair is closely associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression.",
              "Gaining insight into how DNA repair pathways participate in tumorigenesis and cancer evolution is crucial for understanding the progression of tumors, for explaining why drug resistance emerges, and for developing more efficient strategies for controlling cancer.",
              "Viewing cancer as an evolutionary process is not a new concept.",
              "Nowell\u2019s pioneering study in 1976 proposed a hypothesis of tumor evolution, which is driven by stepwise somatic mutations and selective pressure3.",
              "Because a single neoplastic cell could be the origin of cancer, the latter is often viewed as a clone.",
              "Due to genomic instability, numerous individual cells go through diverse mutations, copy number variations, karyotype alterations, and epigenetic alterations, which have distinct effects on the fitness of cancer cells in a heritable way.",
              "Under the force of natural or artificial (such as drug treatment) selection and genetic drift, the subclones possessing beneficial alterations expand by delivering advantageous genetic information to their daughter cells4.",
              "With these features, cancer is now generally considered as a Darwinian evolving process.",
              "Subsequent studies in the field of cancer genetics have validated cancer as a genetically and epigenetically evolving system, containing a large pool of heterogeneous cells5\u20137.",
              "Variations among different subclones are mainly observed due to changes of DNA sequences.",
              "These changes can be divided into different types including \u201cdriver\u201d lesions (which are selectively advantageous) and \u201cpassenger\u201d lesions (which are selectively negligible).",
              "Driver lesions can be identified by the higher frequency in many neoplasms, when compared with the expected frequencies in the normal background8,9, combined with the oncogenic functions of the dysfunctional genes10,11.",
              "Driver lesions are believed to play an important role in subclone proliferation advantage and tumorigenesis12, such as mutations of TP53 and BRAF, which appear in a wide range of cancer types, as well as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast cancer13 and APC mutations in adenomatous polyposis14.",
              "Yet there are challenges in identifying general driver lesions, such as the spatial heterogeneity of sampling15 and the heterogeneity among the same types of tumors16.",
              "Instead, passenger lesions are just \u201chitchhikers\u201d along with driver lesions, which account for the majority of all cancer mutations17.",
              "For example, although the truncated mutations of the N-terminus of APC are driver lesions, its C-terminal truncation does not influence tumor progression18.",
              "Studies have shown that the majority of passenger lesions have existed prior to tumor initiation19,20, and during cancer progression, new passenger lesions can also be acquired.",
              "During the process of cancer evolution, diverse types and time points of lesion events together with multiple selective pressures shape the trajectory of clonal lineages.",
              "Several models depicting dynamic changes of clonal competition over time have been proposed, including linear, branching, neutral, and punctuated evolution21,22.",
              "The linear evolution model suggests that when a subclone has gained multiple driver mutations, it eliminates almost all previous subclones, resulting in a major dominant subclone.",
              "The branching evolution model, instead, supports the idea that multiple subclones from the same ancestor expand simultaneously with increased fitness, presenting a high level of intratumor heterogeneity.",
              "The neutral evolution can be considered as an extreme case of the branching evolution, when random mutations with no significant effect accumulate and lead to intratumor heterogeneity.",
              "Finally, the punctuated evolution model challenges the classical Darwinian evolution model and suggests that many lesions occur within a short period of time.",
              "There are evidences from different systems that support all four models.",
              "For example, multi-region sequencing shows that most driver mutations of clear cell renal cell carcinomas are subclonal, supporting the branching evolution model23, while chromothripsis in colorectal cancer24 and prostate cancer25 tends to favor the punctuated model.",
              "Furthermore, in support of the neutral model, the multi-region sequencing of a single tumor has revealed extreme genetic diversity without any evidence of positive selection26.",
              "There are also evidences of the linear model in some early studies27\u201329.",
              "However, these results may have limitations in detecting heterogeneous mutations in distinct subclones.",
              "Importantly, evidences have shown that the evolution of tumors may mix multiple models during different processes, rather than following a single model30,31.",
              "Further studies are therefore needed to investigate the dynamics of tumor evolution models, to determine whether selection and fitness play roles in these mechanisms. The molecular mechanisms underlying cancer evolution include changes in genetics and epigenetics of the genome.",
              "Many processes can cause alterations of the DNA sequence or epigenetic reprogramming.",
              "For example, when DNA replication is stalled by DNA damage on the template strand, translesion synthesis is executed, which is inherently error-prone and can lead to numerous point mutations32.",
              "Furthermore, a large network of DNA damage-up proteins (DDPs) was discovered recently in Escherichia coli, and many of their human homologs were shown to induce endogenous DNA damage when overexpressed33.",
              "These DDPs participate in different DNA-damage-inducing mechanisms such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase by transmembrane transporters and replication stalling by transcription factors.",
              "The strong correlation of DDP expression and the mutation load in diverse types of human cancers suggests that DDPs can be important sources of endogenous DNA damage.",
              "Epigenetic reprogramming is another remarkable trait of human cancers, which functions in tumor initiation and progression.",
              "For example, the promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes was discovered as an early event in the transformation of human esophageal cancer, and the accumulation of methylation parallels tumor progression34,35.",
              "In addition, the dynamic regulation of histone acetylation and methylation can also lead to the activation of oncogenes and repression of tumor suppressors, contributing to various stages of cancer evolution36,37.",
              "Among all the processes causing genetic and epigenetic alterations, the most important one is the defect of DNA repair pathways.",
              "In this review, we mainly focus on DNA repair pathways and their relationship with cancer evolution.",
              "Our genome is constantly assaulted by endogenous and exogenous agents, which can cause numerous DNA lesions and threaten the viability of cells.",
              "Some routine physiological processes, such as DNA replication, can lead to spontaneous DNA mutations;",
              "and some metabolites such as ROS arising from oxidative respiration can result in endogenous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).",
              "Furthermore, environmental agents such as ultraviolet light and ionizing radiation can result in exogenous DNA damages38.",
              "In normal somatic cells, endogenous and exogenous DNA damage can be balanced by efficient repair by multiple DNA repair pathways.",
              "However, this damage-repair balance can be shifted by the deficiency of DNA repair pathways, which causes an increase of genomic instability and the accumulation of multiple mutations, finally leading to tumorigenesis (Figure 1).",
              "Consistently, DNA repair pathway genes also play important roles in species evolution by regulating evolution rates39.",
              "However, not all cancers harbor an overt level of genomic instability40,41, which might be due to a high rate of clonal expansion, and even a relatively normal mutation rate can cause tumorigenesis42.",
              "The events generated from genomic instability driving cancer initiation can be divided into two classes: small range aberrations such as driver gene mutations, and large range aberrations such as chromosomal rearrangements and the emergence of aneuploid cells12.",
              "Consistently, a pan-cancer analysis defines two types of tumors43.",
              "Tumors including kidney clear-cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and colorectal carcinoma, are characterized by mutations (M class), while serous ovarian and breast cancers show characteristics of copy number changes (C class).",
              "This difference may be partially due to the defect of different DNA repair pathways, which are discussed in detail in the second part.",
              "DNA repair pathways influence cancer evolution.",
              "When DNA repair pathways are defective, the balance of DNA damage source and repair is shifted, leading to the accumulation of mutations and chromosome aberrations, and an increase of genomic instability.",
              "During cancer evolution, moderate genomic instability provides more materials for selection and favors tumor progression.",
              "Furthermore, by causing mutations of crucial tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, genomic instability contributes to the growth advantages of subclones with these driver mutations.",
              "Under the natural or artificial (drug treatment) selection, the trajectory of cancer evolution is shaped.",
              "During the process of tumor progression and drug treatment, an increased mutation rate raises the diversity of subclones, favoring growth advantages under different selective pressures (Figure 1)44.",
              "However, in this case, more genomic instability is not always better.",
              "The level of genomic instability and intratumor heterogeneity vary in different patients and cancer types.",
              "Intriguingly, patients with tumors that contain moderate levels of genome instability show the worst prognosis, while tumors with extremely high (for instance, somatic copy number alterations are found in more than 75% of the genome) or too low levels of genomic instability are associated with improved prognosis45\u201347.",
              "For example, patients with microsatellite instability (MSI)-positive tumors tend to have favorable prognosis, in which case MSI leads to a dramatic increase of the mutation rate and genomic instability48.",
              "This phenomenon is called the \u201ctrade-off\u201d between tumor genomic instability and tumor fitness, which could influence clinical outcomes49.",
              "The genomic instability or intratumor heterogeneity is distributed over a wide range.",
              "A high level of genomic instability may provide more choices for cancer evolution and tumor progression, but this could also damage the fitness of the tumor, which together may result in a better prognosis.",
              "Thus, maintaining a moderate level of genomic instability is critical for tumor cells to survive and compete, because an excessive level of genomic instability can be harmful and reduce cell viability50,51.",
              "A case in point is that a mouse model with Cenp-e deficiency, which leads to increased aneuploidy and chromosome instability, can both promote and inhibit tumorigenesis in different sets of backgrounds52.",
              "Moreover, using the CIN70 signature to quantify chromosomal complexity and chromosomal instability (CIN), analysis of CIN and patient outcomes in diverse cancers revealed that patients with intermediate CIN had the poorest outcomes, whereas high levels of CIN were correlated with improved outcomes50.",
              "Therefore, the genomic instability level of tumors has been considered to be maintained in an optimal range, which could facilitate tumor evolution, and cause minimal damage to the tumor itself.",
              "Indeed, in many cancer types, mitotic checkpoint genes tend to be highly expressed rather than mutated53, and this probably occurs to prevent excessive genomic instability.",
              "Furthermore, in colorectal cancers, MSI and aneuploidy are mutually exclusive, suggesting that the combination of MSI and chromosome instability may be lethal to these cancer cells54.",
              "This \u201ctrade-off\u201d theory could also be applied to clinical drug treatment, because many chemotherapy drugs are aimed to induce more DNA damage and exaggerate the genomic instability of the tumor beyond a certain threshold, leading to the elimination of cancer cells.",
              "Cancers with certain defects of DNA repair pathways are specifically sensitive to drugs, which induce corresponding lesions.",
              "For example, because DNA adducts caused by cisplatin are known to be detected and repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER), evidence has linked the expression level of ERCC1 with cisplatin sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)55\u201357.",
              "Another classic example is the use of inhibitors of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) for the treatment of breast and ovarian cancers, which is the first application of the \u201csynthetic lethality\u201d theory (see below).",
              "However, these mutagenic therapies could also cause increased mutations, and may result in the promotion of cancer evolution and drug resistance.",
              "Strategies are suggested in clinical treatments, including the specific combination therapy of cytotoxic and cytostatic drugs and optimizing the dose of cytotoxic drugs, instead of administering the maximal tolerated dose58.",
              "The concept of cancer evolution highlights two features of cancer: the intratumor heterogeneity, and the fact that cancer cells undergo a constantly evolving process driven by genomic instability and selective pressure.",
              "Studies on premalignant conditions, such as Barrett\u2019s esophagus, have revealed that the level of heterogeneity could be predictive of future neoplasms59,60.",
              "Furthermore, the levels of intratumor heterogeneity can reflect the potential of tumor progression and provide prognostic information.",
              "A study on chronic lymphocytic leukemia showed that subclones with driver mutations, such as mutations of TP53, have more potential to expand during chemotherapy, and the presence of subclonal driver mutations serves as an independent risk factor for tumor progression61.",
              "Furthermore, cancer evolution also poses a huge challenge, in which clinical drug treatments often end with resistance, which will be discussed in detail in the third part.",
              "The human body possesses sophisticated cancer suppression mechanisms to eliminate or postpone cancer evolution.",
              "DNA repair pathways serve as guardians of genomic stability.",
              "Thus, it is not surprising that defects of DNA repair pathways are common in various cancers.",
              "In normal cells, genomic stability is guarded by an intricate machinery of DNA repair.",
              "For different types of DNA damages, there are corresponding repair pathways to efficiently fix them.",
              "Defects in these pathways cause diverse and detrimental consequences, and many of them may lead to the generation of cancer (Table 1).",
              "As mentioned above, the deficiencies of different DNA repair pathways are associated with the features of distinct cancer types.",
              "Many of the DNA repair pathway deficiencies leave idiosyncratic patterns of mutations in cancer genomes, termed mutation signatures, which are found in specific types of cancers62.",
              "For example, breast and ovarian cancers frequently possess mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, which are vital genes of homologous recombination (HR), and these cancers often show the mutation signature with a distinctive pattern of substitutions and deletions63.",
              "Similarly, nucleotide excision repair deficiency is highly associated with dinucleotide mutations, which have been found predominantly in skin cancers.",
              "Distinct DNA damage pathways are therefore associated with specific cancer types, and may be involved in multiple processes of cancer evolution.",
              "Here, we review several important DNA repair pathways and their impact on cancer evolution by exploring their roles in the generation and progression of cancers.",
              "DNA repair pathways and their association with cancer evolution The mismatch repair (MMR) system is critical for maintaining genomic stability, which is highly conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.",
              "Its primary function is to eliminate mutational intermediates generated by DNA polymerization errors at the post-replicative level, helping to ensure the high fidelity of DNA replication64.",
              "MMR in mammalian cells is complex and contains multiple steps.",
              "First, mismatched DNA is recognized by either MutS\u03b1 (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS\u03b2 (MSH2-MSH3).",
              "Second, MutL\u03b1 (MLH1-PMS2) is recruited to mismatch sites65.",
              "Then, PCNA is loaded and activates PMS2 to exert its endonuclease activity by direct interaction66,67.",
              "Third, during the excision of the mismatched DNA, PCNA and MutL\u03b1 are required for 3\u2032nick-directed excision, while 5\u2032nick-directed excision is readily carried out by EXO1, which is a 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease and interacts with MSH2 and MLH168\u201372.",
              "RPA is also involved in MMR, which helps to protect the ssDNA generated by the exonuclease, and terminate the excision73.",
              "Finally, the excised gaps are fixed by DNA polymerase \u03b4 and LIG174,75.",
              "Mismatch repair deficiency can cause the expansion and contraction of repetitive tracts of DNA, namely MSI, which leads to an increase of frameshift mutations.",
              "MSI is clinically associated with 10%\u201315% of colorectal, ovarian, endometrial, and gastric cancers, and germline mutation of MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PSM2) causes Lynch syndrome, which shows the characteristic molecular changes of MSI and is the most common form of hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC)76,77.",
              "Moreover, MMR-deficiency has a strong correlation with tumor recurrence and poor patient prognosis following chemotherapy of breast cancer78.",
              "Importantly, although MMR pathway defect is closely correlated to cancer, MMR deficiency does not by itself lead to cancer.",
              "Instead, it causes detrimental mutations in crucial genes, which might contribute to tumor progression, resulting in a \u201cmutator phenotype\u201d79.",
              "Indeed, in MMR-deficient tumors but not in MMR-proficient tumors, frameshift mutations in mononucleotide tracts have been identified in tumor suppressors and DNA repair genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2 and BLM80,81, and tumor progression genes such as BAX82 and TGFB283.",
              "Evidence has shown that in MMR-deficient cells, an elevated mutation rate could be observed in key growth regulatory genes, which may provide the subclone a growth advantage against selective pressure within a heterogeneous tumor84.",
              "In addition, MSI in non-transcribed regions can also have a potential tumorigenic effect.",
              "For example, a primary cancer series revealed that the expression of a key factor of DSB repair, MRE11, is frequently impaired in MMR-deficient primary colorectal cancers (83.",
              "7%), but not in MMR-proficient ones, due to the aberrant splicing caused by the T11 repeat instability within the MRE11 intron 485,86.",
              "Therefore, although the hypermutation caused by MSI can also increase the frequency of lethal mutations87, MMR deficiency contributes to greater possibilities of driver mutations and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), an increased level of cancer cell genomic instability, and intratumor heterogeneity, ultimately promoting tumorigenesis and favoring cancer evolution88.",
              "MMS deficiency and MSI define a unique subset of cancers and have been used as diagnostic tools89.",
              "In clinical trials, tumors with MMS deficiency or MSI showed great responses to immunotherapy90.",
              "Furthermore, many studies have shown that MSI is associated with improved prognosis in colorectal and endometrial cancers91,92, while CIN, another hallmark of these cancers, is linked to a poor prognosis50,93.",
              "However, a recent study argued that the association between MSI and a favorable prognosis could be rather due to the lack of aneuploidy of the MSI tumors than the effect of MSI itself54.",
              "Researchers have shown that there is a clear inverse correlation between MSI and chromosome arm aneuploidy (which refers to the imbalance of chromosome arms) in gastrointestinal and endometrial tumors, suggesting that MSI and aneuploidy are mutually exclusive within these tumors, which leads to an alternative route of cancer evolution with improved prognosis.",
              "Further efforts should be directed toward solving questions such as whether combined MSI and aneuploidy could be lethal to tumor cells and may create a potentially new target therapy for aneuploid tumors.",
              "Intriguingly, the MMR pathway, as well as the HR pathway (reviewed below) could directly participate in the response of cancer cells to drug treatment, helping to acquire higher levels of genomic instability and favoring cancer evolution.",
              "A recent study demonstrated that EGFR/BRAF inhibition could downregulate MMR genes, and increase mutability and MSI94.",
              "This research provides evidence for the adaptive mutability of tumor cells, which could evade therapeutic pressure by transiently enhancing mutability, reminding us to pay attention to this novel mechanism of drug resistance and to develop drugs capable of reducing the generation of new mutations.",
              "The mammalian NER pathway recognizes and repairs a wide range of structurally unrelated DNA lesions, including cyclobutene-pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts induced by ultraviolet (UV) light, bulky chemical adducts, and ROS-generated cyclopurines95.",
              "There are two subpathways of NER, the global genome NER (GG-NER) and the transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER).",
              "The GG-NER probes the genome for helix-distorting lesions, which are caused by disturbed base pairing.",
              "The helix-distorting lesions can be directly recognized by XPC-RAD23B96.",
              "TFIIH is then recruited to the lesion site through direct interaction with XPC-RAD23B97.",
              "TC-NER is instead activated by the stalled RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) when there is a lesion in the template strand.",

              "(A) The drug resistant subclones reside within the tumor before the drug treatment.",
              "Under a selection effect, these subclones eventually expand and become the dominant subclones, leading to drug resistance and tumor relapse.",
              "(B) Mutagenic treatments such as alkylating agents can result in an increase of genomic instability and the generation of new driver genes, creating new drug resistant subclones.",
              "Recent studies have revealed that the pre-existence of resistant subclones is the major cause of drug resistance in cancer cell lines222,223.",
              "Numerous studies have shown that drug-resistant subclones reside within the tumor before treatment of colorectal cancer224, ovarian cancer47, and melanoma225 and prostate cancer226.",
              "Functioning as a selective pressure, drug treatment causes these subclones with beneficial genomic features to expand, causing resistant subclones to gradually become the dominant groups of cancer, and resulting in drug resistance and cancer relapse.",
              "Prolonged BRAF inhibitor treatment for melanoma xenografts carrying BRAF activation mutations leads to resistance.",
              "However, the resistant tumor cells exhibit a dependency on the BRAF inhibitor, indicating that new therapeutic strategies can be exploited by targeting this specific vulnerability227.",
              "Similarly, a recent study based on single cell sequencing of chemotherapy resistant human triple negative breast tumor samples revealed that most mutations in resistant tumors originate from pre-existing genomic alterations219.",
              "Moreover, this adaptive resistance may be due to the reactivation of the targeted pathways.",
              "For example, cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer is found to be associated with the re-expression of FANCF228 and the reverse mutation of functional BRCA1 or BRCA2229,230.",
              "Similarly, platinum chemotherapies can cause reverse drug resistance through the hypermethylation of mismatch repair genes231,232.",
              "To solve this problem, DNA-demethylating agents have been combined with platinum to prevent hypermethylation-caused resistance233, although it is not the ultimate solution.",
              "Cancer therapies usually kill cancer cells more efficiently than normal cells, and this specificity is key to eliminating cancer without causing significant side effects.",
              "Most cancer cells are characterized by more rapid proliferation.",
              "Therefore, cell division can be targeted to prevent cancer progression.",
              "DNA-damaging drugs are widely used to achieve this goal by causing cell cycle arrest or cell death.",
              "However, because these drugs cause more DNA damage, they inevitably induce more mutations and chromosome aberrations during treatment, fueling cancer evolution and eventually causing the emergence of resistant subclones234,235.",
              "Chemotherapy drugs impact DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell division, generating mutations and chromosome instability, inevitably promoting drug resistance by selecting for the resistant subclones with growth advantages.",
              "Studies of acute myeloid leukemia and glioma have shown that the cytotoxic effect of alkylating agents may lead to an increase of the mutation rate and promote the generation of new driver mutations236,237.",
              "This effect could be intensified, especially in cases with certain defect DNA repair pathways.",
              "Studies have shown that in gliomas with MSH6 inactivation, alkylating agents seem to induce a hypermutation phenotype, which promotes neoplastic progression rather than tumor cell death238.",
              "Similarly, the cytotoxicity caused by radiotherapy is particularly due to DSBs, and the high efficiency of DSB repair is associated with radioresistance in many cases239,240.",
              "Furthermore, the mutagenic feature of radiotherapy cannot only contribute to resistance but also can cause radiation-induced neoplasms239\u2013243.",
              "Notably, in addition to these well-known mutagenic treatments, targeted drugs such as cetuximab could cause adaptive mutability of colorectal cancers by downregulating DNA repair gene expression and aggravating genomic instability94.",
              "For cancers with defects in DNA repair pathways, cancer cells often rely on the compensating repair pathway to maintain a suitable level of genomic instability.",
              "Thus, targeting such compensating pathways using the concept of synthetic lethality is an effective way to treat DNA repair-defective tumors244.",
              "One notable example is the PARP inhibitor used in the treatment of inherited breast and ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations.",
              "Unfortunately, PARP inhibitor therapy is also hampered by emerging resistance.",
              "The mechanism of PARPi resistance has been investigated extensively245.",
              "Studies have shown that besides general resistance mechanisms for most drugs including the upregulation of drug efflux and target loss246, restoration of competent HR by reactivation of functional BRCA proteins247, loss of NHEJ by 53BP1 or Shieldin complex defects140,248, and restoration of replication fork protection249 are also important mechanisms of PARPi resistance.",
              "There are several ways to avoid or overcome the possible acquired resistance of PARPi and other drugs.",
              "First, tumors rewiring their DNA repair pathway to gain resistance may have new vulnerabilities to other targeted therapies.",
              "For example, BRCA1-mutated tumor cells, which also harbor 53BP1 inactivations, show resistance to PARPi, while this phenotype depends on ATM activity, which makes these cancer cells specifically vulnerable to ATM inhibition132.",
              "Similarly, loss of NHEJ leads to hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation139.",
              "Second, combination therapies can be used to sensitize the small subpopulations in cancer, which leads to clonal evolution.",
              "For example, the synthetic lethal approach could be used in BRCA-deficient breast cancer, which may be eradicated by certain alkylators or high dose chemotherapy250.",
              "Finally, it is important to monitor the dynamics of tumor genomic alterations during the process of treatment.",
              "Analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is very helpful in providing a broader picture of clonal evolution251,252.",
              "The ctDNA can reveal somatic mutations acquired through therapy and can mitigate tumor sampling bias, making it a powerful tool to delineate evolutionary trajectories of individual cancer and to guide therapeutic interventions.",
              "The traditional view of evolution biology states that mutations are random, constant, and gradual, and the generation of variation and natural selection are two independent processes.",
              "In the field of cancer evolution, a similar view has been challenged by discoveries of the reversible drug-tolerant epigenetic state and stress-induced adaptive mutability of cancer cells under treatment.",
              "Transient drug resistance caused by nongenetic alterations has been reported in many studies253,254.",
              "In a ground-breaking study, during drug treatment, a small population of cells with a drug-tolerant phenotype was detected.",
              "These cells can maintain viability under near-extinction conditions with >100-fold reduced drug sensitivity255.",
              "Intriguingly, this phenotype is transiently acquired and KDM5A is responsible for the chromatin alterations in the drug-tolerant state, and altering histone acetylation can prevent the development of acquired drug resistance.",
              "Consistent with clinical reports of the success of a \u201cdrug-holiday,\u201d this study also suggests that chromatin-modifying agents can be utilized to improve clinical benefits.",
              "Stress-induced mutagenesis has long been recognized in Escherichia coli, and the similarity between cancer cells and asexually reproducing prokaryotes has suggested that the same mechanism may exist in human cancers to develop drug resistance256.",
              "Recently, a vital discovery of adaptive mutability in response to targeted therapy in human cancer evolution has provided a new perspective to investigate how DNA repair functions during tumor progression94.",
              "In this study, Russo et al.",
              "provided evidence that cancer cells possess a similar mechanism to generate intratumor heterogeneity, which enables cancer adaptation during drug treatment.",
              "Human CRC cells treated with EGFR or BRAF inhibitors showed a transient dysfunction of MMR and HR repair systems and a corresponding increase of DNA damage and MSI.",
              "More importantly, this mutagenesis ceased after drug removal.",
              "Furthermore, this study suggested that DNA repair deficiencies underlying drug treatment may create new therapeutic vulnerabilities for the development of combined therapies257.",
              "Because CRC cells are HR deficient during treatment, it is worth exploring whether PARPi could show a better efficiency to kill these cancer cells.",
              "Moreover, a recent study showed that the Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase (WRN) may play a similar role as a synthetically lethal target in MMR deficient cancers258, thus WRN inhibition may be an alternative way to target these cancer cells.",
              "Similarly, platinum such as oxaliplatin, a DSB-inducing drug, may be a greater threat to these cancer cells.",
              "Subsequently, a new study suggested that stress-induced mutagenesis is a prevalent feature of human cancers, and a genome-wide screen identified Serine/threonine-protein kinase mTOR as a stress-sensing capacitor regulating accurate DNA replication and repair259.",
              "These studies demonstrated that DNA repair is at the core of cancer evolution and can be regulated under different environmental conditions.",
              "Intratumor heterogeneity and cancer evolution make cancer one of the biggest challenges of modern medicine, and the most insidious killers of humans.",
              "As genomic technologies advance rapidly in recent decades, our understanding of how cancer evolution is driven and shaped becomes enhanced.",
              "In this perspective, many basic problems still need to be solved.",
              "It would be significant to distinguish the driver mutations and passenger mutations and trace the pivotal event, which makes normal cells turn into cancer cells.",
              "DNA repair pathways play crucial roles in maintaining genomic stability, and how cancer cells hijack DNA repair pathways to keep intratumor instability in a moderate range to fuel cancer evolution is largely unknown.",
              "Furthermore, the prevalence of adaptive mutability should be more extensively assessed in the future.",
              "By understanding these mechanisms, we can gain more insight into the characteristics of diverse tumor types, which can be coupled to treatment strategies and benefit individual patients.",
              "Analyses of mutation signatures in cancer genomes have shown the great potential of tumor diagnostics and treatment guidance.",
              "We can also explore how to develop future therapeutic strategies to slow down the pace of cancer evolution and to avoid or overcome drug resistance, by targeting not only DNA repair pathways, but also other important characteristics possessed by cancer cells during evolution, such as alterations of transcription, replication, and epigenetics.",
              "For example, to combat the reversible drug tolerant condition in osimertinib treatment of NSCLC, HDACi shows promising clinical application, by targeting chromatin state, which has been mentioned above.",
              "In addition, combined therapy can be exploited to overcome drug resistance.",
              "For example, mutagenic therapies such as radiotherapy can induce the production of neoantigens, which can act as an in situ vaccine.",
              "Thus, patients may benefit from the combination of chemotherapy/radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy.",
              "The characteristics of intratumor heterogeneity and cancer evolution pose a big challenge for the development of targeted therapies and more effective drugs.",

              "In the late nineteenth century, physicians found, with the help of the microscope, that cancer had multiple cellular forms. Now, technology is once again transforming our understanding of cancer\u2019s origins and complexity.",
              "Instead of broad categorizations based on the location of tumours, genome sequencing is providing detailed characterizations of the combination of genetic mutations that trigger or aid cancer development in an individual.",
              "\u201cWhat you now see is that every cancer is a rare cancer,\u201d says Emile Voest, an oncologist and medical director of the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam.",
              "Ten years ago, he says, lung cancer was classified as either small cell or non-small cell.",
              "It\u2019s now described by the presence or absence of nearly 30 genetic mutations.",
              "As well as advancing physicians\u2019 understanding of what causes each person\u2019s cancer, genomics is providing insights into how an individual\u2019s cancer might progress, and its likely response to treatment.",
              "For some, this information will save their lives \u2014 knowledge of the genetic drivers of cancer is already changing how some people\u2019s cancer is treated.",
              "For others, it currently only adds new data, not years to their lives or new treatment options.",
              "But each cancer-causing or cancer-influencing genetic mutation that is discovered is a potential target for drug development, including for cancers for which there are currently few treatment choices.",
              "\u201cWe\u2019ve known for decades that genes and genetic alterations are the foundation to cancer,\u201d says Kenna Shaw, executive director of the Khalifa Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.",
              "Some of these genetic alterations interrupt the normal functioning of tumour-suppressor genes, which regulate cell growth and death, and are usually protective against cancer.",
              "Mutations in the tumour-suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, for example, have been linked to a much higher risk of breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.",
              "Part of Nature Outlook: Cancer diagnosis Part of Nature Outlook: Cancer diagnosis Mutations that impair the function of genes that underpin a cell\u2019s ability to repair damaged DNA have also been implicated in cancer, as have mutations that generate oncogenes: genes that can actively transform a healthy cell into a cancer cell.",
              "For example, HER2-positive breast cancers involve a mutated HER2 oncogene, which produces a protein that increases the growth of cancer cells.",
              "Sometimes, as in the case of BRCA1 and BRCA2, these mutations are inherited.",
              "But most are not.",
              "Identifying cancer-causing mutations can be essential to diagnosis, particularly when it comes to haematological cancers, says Piers Blombery, a haematologist at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia.",
              "Diagnosis of these \u2018liquid\u2019 tumours is usually informed, and sometimes explicitly decided, by genetic abnormalities.",
              "For example, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is diagnosed by the presence of a mutated gene called BCR-ABL, which is created by the transfer of genetic material from one chromosome to another.",
              "Most people with CML also have an unusually short chromosome called the Philadelphia chromosome, the presence of which is also key to diagnosis.",
              "Genetic mutations do not have such a central role in all cancer diagnoses, but even if they don\u2019t, their presence or absence might change how each person\u2019s cancer is described.",
              "\u201cWe\u2019re realizing the relative unsophistication of calling something diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which doesn\u2019t capture the full biological heterogeneity of that condition,\u201d Blombery says.",
              "A 2018 study found four distinct genetic subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, each of which differed in clinical presentation, progression and, most importantly, response to treatment1.",
              "Categorizations based on the location of the cancer and the type of cell involved are still essential.",
              "\u201cBut it\u2019s getting from these broad-basket diagnoses into the subcategories of these diagnoses, which can only really be defined genetically, that is really finessing our treatment within those categories,\u201d Blombery says.",
              "One of the biggest impacts that cancer genomics is having is on treatment choices.",
              "\u201cHaving the right diagnosis is the most potent determinant of getting the right treatment,\u201d Blombery says.",
              "One early treatment targeted at people with cancer who carried a particular mutation was trastuzumab, which was approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer in 1998.",
              "It was followed in 2001 by imatinib for forms of leukaemia with the Philadelphia chromosome mutation.",
              "And gefitinib, which targets the epidermal growth factor receptor in some lung cancers, was approved in 2003.",
              "Some genetic mutations can significantly alter the choice of treatment, even if those treatments do not directly target the mutation.",
              "For example, in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the presence of a mutation in the TP53 gene means that the cancer probably won\u2019t respond to chemoimmunotherapy.",
              "If physicians know that a person has that mutation, they might instead opt for a stem-cell transplant.",
              "And in colorectal cancers, mutations in the KRAS gene mean that patients will not respond to drugs such as cetuximab or panitumumab.",
              "Certain mutations can also signal that a cancer is more likely to become resistant to a treatment.",
              "In acute myeloid leukaemia, for example, some people carry mutations that make their cancer more likely to become resistant to a class of drug called isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors.",
              "Piers Blombery (left) says identifying cancer-causing mutations is particularly important for haematological cancers.",
              "Credit: Vision Super Pty Ltd The possibility of treating cancer on the basis of an individual tumour\u2019s genetic profile has led to a surge in cancer-genome profiling of patients.",
              "At the Netherlands Cancer Institute, every person with metastatic cancer has their cancer genome sequenced.",
              "Its database now contains genomic-sequencing information from around 5,000 people.",
              "The institute has focused on people with metastatic cancer because it would be too costly to sequence everyone, and many people with primary cancer can be cured with existing treatments.",
              "The idea, says Voest, is to give the people at the highest risk of dying from cancer access to a wider pool of potential treatments, whether these are the standard of care for a particular cancer, an off-label treatment or even an experimental agent.",
              "In 2016, the institute launched the Drug Rediscovery Protocol, in which people who have so far not responded to standard treatment, but who have DNA anomalies that suggest they might respond to therapies not approved for their particular cancer, are treated with those drugs in an experimental setting.",
              "The approach is showing clinical benefit in around one-third of people2.",
              "Shaw says that she takes a more focused approach by sequencing people with cancer only when a known actionable molecular target exists for that cancer type, or when patients have run out of treatment options.",
              "She estimates that there are only about 130\u2013140 \u201ctherapeutically actionable\u201d genes for solid tumours, and even fewer for liquid tumours.",
              "But Voest says that whole-genome sequencing of people with metastatic disease isn\u2019t just about finding mutations that are currently treatable, but also about targets and treatments yet to be discovered.",
              "Identifying people\u2019s mutations in advance means that, when researchers do discover a treatment option for a particular mutation, \u201cwe can identify patients that we can help\u201d.",
              "And even when sequencing reveals only bad news for a person, the knowledge of their likely prognosis can be useful.",
              "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s very important to be able to tell a patient that, unfortunately, with this particular molecular lesion, you\u2019ve only got 3\u20136 months to live, and no chemotherapy will work,\u201d Blombery says.",
              "The Cancer Genome Atlas programme, set up by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), has sequenced more than 20,000 primary cancer samples of 33 cancer types.",
              "This is just one of a suite of NCI initiatives to collect and analyse cancer-genomic data, and support the translation of those data into new treatments.",
              "The NCI also supports the Cancer Target Discovery and Development Network \u2014 a group of 12 cancer research teams and centres across the United States, including the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a bridge programme between all the data generated through these large-scale genomic initiatives,\u201d says Subhashini Jagu, scientific programme manager for the network, which is based at the NCI\u2019s Office of Cancer Genomics.",
              "\u201cAll that raw data generated through high-throughput screening will be deposited to the data portal,\u201d where researchers can access it, she adds.",
              "To help scientists make sense of the troves of data, the centres are also developing and sharing computational and analytical tools.",
              "\u201cThe goal is to integrate systems biology with the cancer biology,\u201d Jagu says, so researchers can, for example, stratify patients according to their responses to a particular therapy, or find specific genes in the data sets.",
              "\u201cThis is the best time to work in the field,\u201d Jagu says.",
              "More from Nature Outlooks More from Nature Outlooks However, genomics isn\u2019t the only answer to the cancer challenge, Voest warns.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s a starting point,\u201d he says.",
              "He notes that newer technologies, such as RNA sequencing, gene-expression profiling and proteomics, are also bringing in a wealth of information to help characterize and treat cancer.",
              "\u201cWe need to integrate all types and all levels of information.",
              "\u201d At the same time, some treatment options, such as checkpoint inhibitors and immunotherapy, are leapfrogging cancer genomics altogether.",
              "These therapeutic approaches target the tumour\u2019s ability to suppress the cellular immune response that might otherwise identify and destroy it.",
              "Checkpoint inhibitors do not target a particular mutation and they are not affected by cancer mutations.",
              "However, there is emerging evidence that checkpoint-inhibitor treatments for diseases such as lung cancer might work better when patients have a greater quantity of mutations3.",
              "Despite the wealth of data being accumulated about cancer genomics, the actual benefits are still murky.",
              "For people with a cancer mutation that can be targeted by an available therapy, there is no question that cancer-genome sequencing leads to better outcomes and survival.",
              "But Voest acknowledges that if overall cancer-survival data are taken as the endpoint, the benefits might not yet be as clear.",
              "The number of known cancer-causing mutations still far outweighs the number of treatments targeting those mutations.",
              "\u201cYou need to look at the impact that it has on those very small subgroups,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cThen I would consider that the impact of genomics is really big.",

              "As such, discovery and particularly validation of novel serum or plasma protein biomarkers for PDAC should primarily be conducted using benign pancreatic diseases as control group, rather than solely healthy controls.",

              "Specifically, this means recruiting a cohort of patients with suspected PDAC (ie, prior to final diagnosis), rather than using a multiple-gate design (\u2018case\u2013control design\u2019) in which patients with PDAC and controls (eg, chronic pancreatitis) are recruited separately.",
              "Second, studies that aim to discover or validate novel protein biomarkers should preferably also assess the diagnostic performance of previously discovered promising biomarkers.",
              "This approach would facilitate more accurate estimation of the diagnostic performance of protein biomarkers across a range of studies.",
              "Third, novel biomarkers should be assessed for their added value to CA19-9 and other routinely measured biomarkers.",
              "High diagnostic accuracy of a single protein biomarker is, on its own, generally insufficient to warrant further consideration of the protein in external validation or clinical impact studies.",
              "Rather, novel protein biomarkers should demonstrate sufficient added value \u2013 in terms of diagnostic accuracy and potential clinical utility \u2013 when added to prediction models using inexpensive and routinely measured markers, such as clinical symptoms, CA19-9, and bilirubin.",
              "Fourth, clinical prediction models should adhere to minimum sample size requirements, both during development56 and external validation,57 to prevent overoptimism in model performance estimates, increase the likelihood of adequate performance at external validation, and allow accurate estimation of key performance metrics of the model.",
              "In general, prediction models should be developed, validated, and reported in accordance with the TRIPOD-statement.",
              "58 Lastly, the cost-effectiveness and impact of successfully externally validated prediction models on clinical decision making and patient outcomes should be evaluated in prospective studies.",
              "The evidence base of this meta-analysis should be assessed in light of several limitations.",
              "First, there is considerable heterogeneity among the included studies.",
              "The most important source of heterogeneity was whether the control group consisted of healthy controls or benign diseases.",
              "This factor alone explained 66% (median R2 for all biomarkers;",
              "range, 24\u201382%) of the heterogeneity that was observed in the AUC of the biomarkers.",
              "To account for this source of heterogeneity and explore its impact on the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers, we performed stratified analyses and meta-regression analyses, respectively.",
              "However, due to a lack of studies we could not account for the specific composition of the benign disease control group.",
              "Thus, it is not possible to conclude whether the performance of biomarkers varies per patient group;",
              "eg, to specify whether MIC-1 accurately distinguishes PDAC from chronic pancreatitis but cannot accurately distinguish PDAC from acute pancreatitis or a benign biliary obstruction.",
              "For this reason, our meta-analysis merges the benign group as one group, even though important clinically distinct benign diseases then remain unacknowledged.",
              "The impact of other potential sources of heterogeneity, such as type of blood sample (serum vs plasma [R2, 0.",
              "63%]) and type of test comparison (direct vs indirect comparisons), was limited and did not change the conclusions of our analyses.",
              "Second, the use of optimal threshold selection methods (eg, with the Youden index) for protein biomarkers could have resulted in overoptimistic performance estimates of the proteins compared with CA19-9 in the HSROC analysis.",
              "Therefore, a separate meta-analysis of the AUCs was also conducted, as this approach is invariant to data-driven cut-off selection methods.",
              "In conclusion, the present findings suggest that not one protein biomarker outperforms CA19-9 as a diagnostic marker for distinguishing PDAC from benign disease in clinically relevant studies, and that these single protein biomarkers offer limited added clinical value over CA19-9 alone.",
              "There is room for improvement of the pipeline for biomarker discovery.",

              "We evaluated whether single biomarkers or multi-biomarker panels generally have the best efficacy for PDAC diagnosis by performing a multivariate three-level meta-analysis using AUC values as effect sizes, and by comparing sensitivity and specificity values.",
              "Overall, multi-biomarker panels are significantly more robust than single biomarkers alone, and in the context of PDAC, this holds true for both CA19-9 and novel biomarker subgroups, as well as across different patient control cohorts.",
              "This review shows extensive evidence, both graphically and statistically, that panels of more than one biomarker tend to perform better than single biomarkers alone for the diagnosis of PDAC.",
              "Furthermore, it was evident when eliminating confounding variables by subdividing the data into different groups, using variables such as biomarker type (CA19-9 or novel) or patient control cohort examined (healthy, benign, or mixed), that this result is robust and prevails throughout multiple subgroup analyses.",
              "Importantly, the inclusion of studies that do not specify PDAC did not greatly alter the results of the meta-analysis, suggesting that the cohorts within these studies are similar to those included in the original analysis.",
              "While there were many single biomarkers reported in the included studies with impressive efficacy, the results of the meta-analysis indicate that on the whole, multi-biomarker panels produce the most robust diagnostic performance.",
              "This information is crucial for future studies, as it suggests that researchers should focus their efforts on the identification of multiple biomarkers, rather than attempting to isolate one single biomarker.",
              "It is important to note also, that the creation of a multi-biomarker panel is not as straightforward as it may seem, and when dealing with multiple levels of patient data and consequently different cutoffs for individual biomarkers, care must be taken to ensure the desired sensitivity and specificity of the panel as a whole.",
              "Integration of these data will allow researchers the flexibility to tailor their panel to certain conditions, and determine individual cutoffs based on the needs of the test (5).",
              "Computational approaches, such as machine learning, have shown utility in this context and could provide future research with a more streamlined approach to multi-biomarker panel generation (29).",
              "One caveat to this, however, is the integration of multi-omic data, which would require cautious consideration of the various unit measurements involved and, in each case, careful control of confounding variables and potential artefacts of experimental design (30).",
              "In any case, whether multi-omic or single-omic, the thoughtful generation of highly sensitive and specific multi-biomarker panels should arguably be the primary aim of future studies hoping to identify novel diagnostic biomarkers for PDAC.",
              "As CA19-9 is regarded as the current standard biomarker for pancreatic cancer diagnosis, the data were separated into two groups, those including CA19-9 and those without (novel biomarkers), to evaluate the performance of CA19-9 across all studies.",
              "For both subgroups of data, multi-biomarkers were shown to perform significantly better than single biomarkers alone.",
              "Indeed, we found that while CA19-9 is the \u201cgold standard\u201d for pancreatic diagnosis, the addition of some other biomarker to create a multi-biomarker panel with CA19-9 resulted in improved biomarker efficacy compared with CA19-9 alone.",
              "Furthermore, there was a substantial amount of variation between studies in the reported sensitivity and specificity values of CA19-9, and this is in keeping with current literature (31\u201334).",
              "The results of the meta-analysis showed that the addition of CA19-9 to a multi-biomarker panel provided a clear improvement over novel biomarker panels that did not contain CA19-9.",
              "In addition, CA19-9 alone appears to have consistently outperformed novel single biomarkers.",
              "While CA19-9 may be the most commonly used biomarker for diagnosis of PDAC in patients with pancreatic cancer, elevated expression has been shown in various benign conditions such as pancreatitis, which contributes to its nonspecificity for PDAC (34).",
              "Given the similarities that are often observed between benign pancreatic patient blood and pancreatic cancer patient blood, it follows therefore that a biomarker may have a diminished ability to distinguish benign cohorts from those with cancer when compared with healthy cohorts.",
              "To ensure the differences being observed were not a result of the patient cohorts being evaluated by different studies, we separated the data further based on the patient cohorts distinguished from PDAC: PDAC versus healthy, PDAC versus benign, and PDAC versus mixed.",
              "When separated based on patient control cohorts, the improved ability of CA19-9 biomarkers over novel biomarkers to diagnose PDAC is clear.",
              "It is also demonstrated here that the efficacy of a biomarker or biomarker panel to diagnose PDAC, whether including CA19-9 or a novel biomarker, is dependent on the reference cohort in question.",
              "Both CA19-9 and novel biomarkers exhibit improved ability to distinguish patients with PDAC from healthy controls when compared with both benign and mixed cohorts, with CA19-9 multi-biomarker panels producing the best diagnostic performance across all cohorts.",
              "There is considerable variation across pooled AUC values for CA19-9 biomarkers and novel biomarkers in the mixed patient cohort setting, demonstrating the increased difficulty faced in this control cohort.",
              "As a result of the recognized poor specificity of CA19-9, the lack of a standardized detection method (10), and the variation in cutoff levels being used for PDAC diagnosis across the studies (35\u201337), in clinical practice CA19-9 is rarely relied upon for diagnostic purposes, despite being FDA approved for this indication.",
              "More often it is used to support a diagnosis, based on appropriate imaging and/ or biopsy, or in staging with Immuno-PET imaging (38), as a biomarker of recurrence (9, 39), or as a biomarker of tumor resectability (40, 41).",
              "In fact, the results of this meta-analysis provide a strong argument in favor of the inclusion of CA19-9 when evaluating a new biomarker panel, while exercising caution given the variation in results obtained across different studies, and the reduced potential of CA19-9 in certain benign conditions.",
              "The role of CA19-9 in pancreatic cancer diagnosis, therefore, seems reliant on the identification of a robust multi-biomarker panel that can adequately control for the inherent defects of the biomarker.",
              "While it is evident from the results of this review that multi-biomarker panels are the most robust biomarker type, it remains to be seen which biological factors produce the most robust biomarkers.",
              "A major limitation of this review results from the lack of diversity seen in the \u201comic\u201d compartments (genomics, proteomics, etc.)",
              "of biomarkers.",
              "Indeed, proteomic biomarkers make up the vast majority of biomarkers evaluated across all studies in this review, making comparisons between proteomic biomarkers and other omic compartments difficult.",
              "We can see, however, that the combination of different omic compartments with CA19-9 (proteomics) did result in high sensitivity and specificity values, though the number of studies examining multi-omic biomarker panels is too low to see any distinct difference.",
              "By examining the biomarkers that fall into the 90th percentile for both sensitivity and specificity, it is evident that while proteomic biomarkers may represent the majority, they do not solely comprise the top biomarkers.",
              "Indeed, nearly as many of these \u201ctop\u201d biomarkers were transcriptomic in nature, highlighting the importance of examining different biological compartments for the discovery of robust biomarkers.",
              "Furthermore, while instances where multiple omic compartments were integrated to form a panel were uncommon among the papers included in this review, one multi-omic biomarker panel was among the 90th percentile biomarkers.",
              "A 4-biomarker panel containing CA19-9 and three metabolites was among those with the highest sensitivity and specificity, demonstrating the potential for such multi-omic biomarker panels in this context.",
              "While it is not within the scope of this review to evaluate whether multi-omic panels produce better results than single-omic panels, current trends in biomarker discovery are leaning toward multi-omic data integration (5, 42, 43).",
              "The evaluation of multiple biological compartments to give a comprehensive overview of disease, and subsequently the generation of a robust panel that encompasses the complexity of that disease is an appealing concept that has much potential in this context and requires further elucidation.",
              "Systematic reviews are uniquely poised to identify trends in the literature that may otherwise go unnoticed.",
              "Importantly, this systematic review allowed for the identification of 13 novel biomarkers that have been repeatedly examined as blood-based biomarkers for PDAC diagnosis across multiple studies, and show promise both alone and as part of a multi-biomarker panel.",
              "While again, the majority of these biomarkers are proteins, the transcriptomic biomarker TIMP-1 emerged as the most frequently assessed novel biomarker.",
              "Though it showed poor mean sensitivity and specificity alone, TIMP-1 performed well as part of a panel with improved mean sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values.",
              "This is further evident from its appearance among the 90th percentile biomarkers, where it achieved high sensitivity and specificity as part of an 8-biomarker panel of extracellular vesicle long RNAs.",
              "Because of its association with cell survival, cell growth, and tumorigenesis, the TIMP-1 protein has been investigated as a potential biomarker, both alone and as part of a panel, in several other cancer types such as gastric (44, 45), colorectal (46\u201348), and breast (49, 50).",
              "This association, however, could be the reason for TIMP-1s poor utility alone in PDAC diagnosis.",
              "Indeed, TIMP-1 protein performance as a blood-based biomarker in PDAC has been shown to be impaired in patients with jaundice (51), though not in patients with chronic pancreatitis (52, 53).",
              "Furthermore, TIMP-1 expression is known to be increased in patients with, and at an increased risk of developing, type 2 diabetes (54, 55), as well as in obese patients (56).",
              "This evidence suggests that the utility of TIMP-1 in PDAC diagnosis is promising, and may lie in its addition to a biomarker panel rather than its use alone due to its impairment in patients with several benign conditions.",
              "Interestingly, TIMP-1 has been examined alongside another promising novel biomarker, inflammatory protein leucine-rich-alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1).",
              "LRG1 has been shown to promote angiogenesis and regulate tumorigenesis, and is a promising biomarker candidate for several other cancer types (57).",
              "Indeed, a plasma-based panel of TIMP-1, LRG1, and CA19-9 discriminated PDAC from healthy controls with improved accuracy compared with CA19-9 alone (58).",
              "LRG1 has also been evaluated in plasma alongside TTR and CA19-9, where this panel exceeded the accuracy of CA19-9 alone by over 10% in its ability to discriminate PDAC from benign controls and other cancers (59).",
              "While LRG1 shows promise as part of a panel for PDAC diagnosis, it has poor mean sensitivity and specificity alone, and there is a lack of research into its performance in control cohorts with various benign conditions.",
              "Conversely, cancer antigen 125 (CA125), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 242 (CA242) have been evaluated extensively in pancreatic cancer and as such there is a plethora of research on these biomarkers.",
              "CEA is an established and widely used tumor biomarker that is known to be increased in several cancers such as colorectal (60), breast (61), and lung (62).",
              "While CEA levels are currently measured for PDAC diagnosis in some clinical settings, it is not FDA approved for PDAC diagnosis and its utility and accuracy remains limited, with a 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis reporting CEA to be inferior to CA19-9 (63).",
              "CEA levels are also known to be elevated in patients with chronic pancreatitis, with serum CEA being unable to distinguish patients with PDAC from those with chronic pancreatitis (64).",
              "Indeed, in this review, we show that CEA alone exhibits poor diagnostic performance across included studies, with improved results being obtained when CEA is examined as part of a panel.",
              "CA125 is a known biomarker for ovarian cancer, which has been shown to have superior performance to CEA for PDAC diagnosis (65, 66).",
              "It has also produced higher mean sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values than CEA across the studies included here.",
              "Furthermore, a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis showed that a CA125-based diagnostic panel for PDAC was superior to CA125 or CA19-9 alone (67).",
              "Similar to CEA, CA242 has also been extensively evaluated for PDAC diagnosis, with serum CA242 levels having been shown to positively correlate with CA19-9 levels (68).",
              "CA242 has also been demonstrated to have better diagnostic performance than CEA, with mean sensitivity, specificity and AUC values in this study being higher for CA242 than CEA (69).",
              "Unfortunately, CA242 is known to be elevated in the blood of patients with type 2 diabetes, and as such, has limited utility alone for PDAC diagnosis, despite exhibiting higher specificity than CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 (65, 70).",
              "While none of these biomarkers have stood out on their own as having utility across all patient cohorts, they are frequently examined as part of biomarker panels with other novel biomarkers.",
              "Laminin subunit gamma-2 (LAMC2), for example, is a promising new biomarker which was examined in a large-scale study of over 400 patients across three continents, where it was elevated in pancreatic cancer serum compared with controls and demonstrated a sensitivity that was comparable with CA19-9 (71, 72).",
              "Furthermore, a serum-based panel of LAMC2 with both CA19-9 and CA125 has been shown to produce accurate discrimination of PDAC from benign controls (33).",
              "These studies provide promising results for LAMC2 as a potential diagnostic biomarker both alone and as part of a panel, though the breadth of research is limited at this time, with no results for mean sensitivity or specificity being obtained in this review.",
              "Another promising biomarker that has produced results similar to CA19-9 is MUC5AC.",
              "Serum MUC5AC levels have been shown to be increased in patients with PDAC compared with both benign and chronic pancreatitis cohorts, with MUC5AC performing on par with CA19-9, though again, the combination of the two produced the best results (73, 74).",
              "Interestingly, the measurement of the CA19-9 antigen on circulating MUC5AC proteins showed promise in a study comprising over 500 patients from three different institutions, where both the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker were improved by this method compared with measuring just CA19-9 alone (75).",
              "While the initial research on MUC5AC shows favorable results, there are few papers examining the capability of MUC5AC as part a multi-biomarker panel.",
              "The addition of CA19-9 to some novel biomarker is a trend across most studies aimed at identifying diagnostic biomarkers for PDAC, with results generally reporting an improved result from the panel compared to individual biomarkers alone.",
              "Studies examining the potential of ALB in this setting are no different, with the vast majority of entries for ALB in this review originating from multi-biomarker panels.",
              "Indeed, a 5-biomarker panel containing ALB and CA19-9 produced improved diagnostic capabilities compared with CA19-9 alone (76).",
              "Similarly, the combination of ALB with CA19-9 and IGF-1 also performed better than CA19-9 at distinguishing PDAC from chronic pancreatitis (64).",
              "Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a proinflammatory cytokine, has also shown limited utility alone but appears to achieve reasonable results when included in a panel.",
              "Serum IL-8 has been shown to be higher in patients with pancreatic cancer than controls;",
              "however, the mean AUC value for IL-8 alone is poor and improved when included in a panel with other biomarkers (77\u201379).",
              "This is also the case for THBS2, which produces modest discrimination alone, and is significantly improved when examined alongside CA19-9 (80, 81).",
              "Conversely, c-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of inflammation, has shown limited utility as part of a panel, where the panel showed no improvement with the addition of CRP (64).",
              "A 2020 study also showed a significant difference in CRP levels between PDAC and normal controls;",
              "however, after running extensive statistical tests on all candidate biomarkers it was not included in the final panel of six biomarkers (82).",
              "While CRP is increased in patients with PDAC compared with controls, it is also elevated in patients with moderate and severe pancreatitis (83).",
              "Moreover, as CRP is derived from the liver, it is substantially influenced by the presence of jaundice making it unreliable in patients with this comorbidity (64).",
              "Interestingly, several studied have examined these more \u201cunreliable\u201d candidates together, and obtained promising results.",
              "A 4-biomarker panel with CA19-9, CRP, and IL-8 demonstrated good discrimination of PDAC from controls (84).",
              "While a 2014 study showed that a panel consisting of ALB, CA19-9, CRP, and IL-8 had the highest diagnostic value for distinguishing PDAC from controls, with this panel proving to be effective in identifying other cancers, such as breast, cervical, colorectal, prostate, and lung (84).",
              "These studies highlight the utility of all of these biomarkers together, rather than independently.",
              "Finally, two miRNA emerged as the most frequently examined across the studies included in this review, miR-21 and miR-483.",
              "MiR-21 levels in the circulation have been shown to be higher in PDAC compared with healthy controls, and are also associated with advanced stage, metastasis, and shorter survival (85, 86).",
              "However, miR-21 shows poor discriminatory ability between IPMN and PDAC, suggesting the involvement of miR-21 in an early step of pancreatic tumorigenesis (85).",
              "Indeed, the ability of miR-21 to distinguish PDAC from controls was overshadowed by several other miRNA in a 2019 study, such as miR-33a and miR-320a, which outperformed miR-21 in combination, thus excluding miR-21 from the final panel (87).",
              "Overexpression of miR-483 is also thought to be an early event in PDAC progression, having been shown to be present in premalignant pancreatic cystic lesions and early-stage disease (88).",
              "A 2016 large-scale miRNA study with over 400 patients with PDAC showed that serum miR-483 expression was significantly increased in patient with PDAC compared with both benign and healthy controls together (89).",
              "Unfortunately, there is a lack a research into the diagnostic potential of these individual miRNAs, as most studies focus on the large-scale screening of miRNAs and utilize complex modeling to narrow down their validation cohort to the most statistically relevant biomarkers.",
              "On closer examination of the literature around these frequently examined biomarkers, it is clear that no one biomarker produces highly accurate diagnostic results alone.",
              "Indeed, the evidence would suggest that the primary utility of all of these biomarkers can be found in their use within multi-biomarker panels.",
              "While individually each of these biomarkers has their limitations, it is evident that when put together they can account for the weaknesses of the others to improve the end results.",
              "Furthermore, the addition of CA19-9 stands out as a clear prerequisite for the design of future multi-biomarker panels.",
              "These novel candidates provide a glimpse into the promising future of PDAC diagnostic biomarker discovery, though they remain to be examined within cohorts of patients with various underlying conditions and comorbidities that may influence their performance.",
              "Importantly, while blood-based biomarkers in the PDAC setting are likely to be used primarily as companion diagnostics, several of these biomarkers may also prove useful in the risk stratification of pancreatic patients with underlying conditions, given their dysregulation across certain control cohorts as outlined in this study.",
              "This review highlights the variability in data quality and study design across pancreatic cancer research.",
              "Here, we have interrogated studies which employ biomarkers for the diagnosis of PDAC, identifying many studies that fail to provide sufficient information regarding their patient cohorts, their experimental design or their index test of interest.",
              "A substantial number of papers fail to report on the subtype of pancreatic cancer examined, simply conflating all subtypes as pancreatic cancer.",
              "For the purposes of the meta-analysis, papers that do not specify PDAC as the subtype of interest were excluded so as to reduce confounding variables.",
              "However, this lack of detail is a major flaw within many pancreatic cancer studies, where the specific subtype examined should always be clearly indicated.",
              "Furthermore, almost half of the included biomarker entries did not have information regarding the reference standard used to diagnose patients with PDAC.",
              "In these cases, it was unclear whether all patients in this cohort had been diagnosed using the same reference standard or not, resulting in high levels of bias amongst these papers.",
              "A third of the biomarkers examined had no details attributed to them regarding the stage details of the PDAC cohort, with reporting of sex and age breakdowns in this cohort also poor.",
              "Control cohorts had similar issues, with high numbers of biomarkers also lacking sex and age information.",
              "Unfortunately, the number of studies examining arguably the most clinically relevant control cohort (mixed) is extremely low compared with healthy alone and benign alone.",
              "While this review has identified many studies evaluating various types of biomarkers for PDAC diagnosis, the lack of studies conducted in clinically relevant cohorts may be the reason for the unfortunate lack of biomarkers currently in clinical use.",
              "Blinding of studies was also extremely poor, with very few opting to adopt this strategy for biomarker identification.",
              "This has further contributed to the high levels of bias observed across the studies included in this review.",
              "Finally, evaluation of biomarker efficacy was extremely flawed in some cases, with a substantial number of biomarkers being attributed only with a P value and no qualitative assessment (e.",
              "g., AUC or sensitivity) of the biomarker.",
              "Overall, huge flaws exist in current pancreatic cancer research in the context of identification of biomarkers for PDAC diagnosis.",
              "High levels of bias can be seen in many studies, with missing or unclear information regarding key study design points further compounding these issues.",
              "These are major flaws which recur again and again in the literature and could be contributing to the lack of repeated examination of high performing biomarkers in follow-up studies and could subsequently be responsible for the poor progress seen in this field in recent years.",
              "As modern vernaculars regard pancreatic cancer and its PDAC subtype to be synonymous, any paper that did not specify an alternative subtype of pancreatic cancer was included in the extraction stage of this study and assumed to be PDAC.",
              "While a small minority of the total included studies make up this population, it is important to note that the inclusion of these data may not be appropriate in some cases as PDAC may not have been the subtype of pancreatic cancer examined.",
              "CA19-9 is highlighted in this review as the current FDA-approved biomarker for PDAC diagnosis;",
              "however, CA19-9 cut-off values were not standardized across all studies included in the review.",
              "As such, all CA19-9 entries may not have resulted from the same cut-off value and it may not be appropriate to compare them directly, as changes in CA19-9 cut-off values have been demonstrated to improve biomarker robustness (33).",
              "A major caveat of this review, which results from the nature of the data extraction, is that certain biomarkers or biomarker panels may arise several times from a single study, having been examined in multiple patient cohorts within that study, for example, in the context of model training and validation.",
              "Unfortunately, as in many studies, there can be overlap between the patients recruited for the training and validation cohorts, resulting in repeated sampling from the same patients.",
              "The within-study variance has been controlled for in the multivariate meta-analysis;",
              "however, repeated sampling from the same patients was not accounted for and may introduce a level of bias toward some biomarkers.",
              "Furthermore, in many instances, studies have opted to evaluate several single biomarkers and subsequently combine these biomarkers to form a multi-biomarker panel.",
              "Some multi-biomarker panels have also been examined in some studies both alone and with the addition of CA19-9 to the panel.",
              "Possible bias due to repeated entries is an important limitation of this study, which could not be avoided due to the nature of current research papers and study designs.",
              "Importantly, while the QUADAS-2 tool that was used to assess study quality and RoB has been used previously for similar systematic reviews of diagnostic biomarkers (90), there may be other forms of bias introduced by these studies that were not accounted for in this assessment.",
              "In summary, blood-based multi-biomarker panels for the diagnosis of PDAC exhibit superior performance in comparison with single biomarkers, in both CA19-9\u2013containing biomarkers and novel biomarkers, and across all patient control cohorts.",
              "CA19-9 shows little utility alone, as it is less effective in mixed control cohorts, though when used in combination with a panel of multiple biomarkers these CA19-9\u2013containing panels produce a better diagnostic performance than novel multi-biomarker panels.",
              "These results suggest that future biomarker studies for PDAC diagnosis should focus on the identification of a multi-biomarker panel which includes CA19-9, while drawing from the pool of promising novel biomarkers that have been identified and examined across several different studies.",
              "This will allow for better use of the breadth of knowledge that has been accumulated over decades of research and save valuable time and resources as studies steer away from large-scale fishing expeditions, and move toward more focused and specialized research with appropriate blinding and comprehensive experimental design.",
