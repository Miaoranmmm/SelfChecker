              "A qualitative comparison was also performed between the two contexts: unlike for childhood vaccinations, only one European country (Austria) imposed generalised COVID-19 mandates, most countries preferring targeted mandates for higher-risk categories (Italy, Greece) or workers in key public services (Finland, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Germany).",
              "Many countries (Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain) confirmed their traditional voluntary vaccination approach also for COVID-19, while others (Slovenia and Hungary), historically relying on compulsory vaccination strategies, surprisingly opted for voluntary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, with unsatisfactory results in terms of immunisation rates.",
              "However, no tangible relationship was generally found between vaccination policies and immunisation coverages: data show that, unlike some countries with mandates, countries where vaccinations are merely recommended could achieve higher coverages, even beyond the recommended 95% threshold.",

              "In response, many countries began imposing stricter rules regulating childhood vaccination, some with compulsory vaccination for certain infectious diseases [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].",
              "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region report, measles outbreaks between 2016 and 2018 involved a total of 83,540 cases and 74 related deaths in 2018, up sharply from 25,869 cases and 42 deaths in 2017, and 5273 cases and 13 deaths in 2016.",

              "No country reported no cases [8].",
              "Based on 2017 data, measles was eliminated in 37 of the 53 countries in the WHO European Region, while it was still endemic in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Romania, and the Russian Federation according to the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination (RVC) [9].",
              "Outside Europe, in 2019 alone, about 1300 measles cases were reported in the United States, the highest since 1992, although measles was declared eliminated in 2000.",
              "The 2019 outbreaks were linked to travel-related cases that reached a population of un- or under-vaccinated people [10].",
              "The European Vaccine Action Plan 2015\u20132020 (EVAP), unanimously adopted by the 53 countries of the WHO European Region, states that at least 95% of individuals in a population must be immune to ensure community protection for everyone\u2014including children too young to be vaccinated and individuals ineligible for immunisation due to comorbidities and medical conditions.",
              "While the 95% coverage rate is necessary only for diseases with a higher R0 (measles, chicken pox, whooping cough), for practical reasons this target has been set for all vaccinations against infectious diseases [11].",
              "Attempts to reach (and maintain) this ambitious goal had chequered success, however.",
              "Immunisation measures and strategies range widely from voluntary choice-oriented policies to penalties, financial incentives, and social restrictions (the unvaccinated barred from attending school), to mandatory regulations [1,2,3,4,5].",
              "The ongoing debate on whether to make vaccination mandatory was fuelled over the past two years by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has taken public health experts by surprise due to its infectious potential and rapid spread worldwide [12].",
              "The availability of safe and effective vaccines that can prevent most infections and reduce the severity of the disease has once again raised the importance of successful strategies to achieve vaccine coverage objectives, and highlighted the conspicuous differences in immunisation policies, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccination coverage among countries.",
              "Furthermore, disruption of vaccination services during the COVID-19 pandemic implied that millions of children missed their routine childhood vaccine doses, setting the stage for future outbreaks without the coverage to prevent them [13,14,15,16].",

              "Strategies for COVID-19 vaccination and vaccination coverage in the last 12 months are also explored, and issues potentially related to vaccine hesitancy are discussed.",
              "The data reported in the manuscript refer to a set of countries considered representative of different vaccination strategies: \u201cmandatory\u201d, \u201cvoluntary with requirements\u201d, \u201cvoluntary with financial incentives\u201d, or \u201ctotally voluntary\u201d.",
              "This set included some countries that recently had to deal with measles outbreaks, along with some other (geographically and sometimes culturally close to the former) that managed to prevent the problem with strategies to maintain high vaccination coverage for childhood diseases, and some countries that, albeit geographically distant (US, Australia), have adopted policies that, if effective, could be used in countries not attaining the recommended coverage yet.",
              "The same countries were studied in relation to the vaccination strategy deployed to tackle the pandemic, and to the corresponding results in terms of vaccination coverage.",
              "Measles was the focus of our attention in the pre-pandemic analysis for three reasons: first, before the COVID-19 pandemic, measles was the most recent epidemic reported by many countries that dealt with the event often via different approaches;",
              "second, eliminating measles in five of the six WHO regions by 2020 was the goal of the 2012 Global Vaccine Action Plan endorsed by the World Health Assembly [17] (despite the long history of MMR vaccination with a safe and effective vaccine, the elimination of measles remains an unfulfilled goal that still requires effective public health and policy efforts);",
              "finally, immunisation Agenda 2021\u20132030 uses measles incidence as a quality indicator of public health systems and the strength of immunisation systems [18].",
              "Data about measles vaccination coverage were downloaded from the World Health Organisation (WHO), United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Bank databases [19,20,21,22,23].",
              "Years 2015 and 2019 were chosen as representatives of childhood vaccination coverage before and after the 2016\u20132018 infectious disease revival: 2015 as it was the last year preceding the measles epidemic waves in Europe and the following restrictions adopted in some countries;",
              "2019 as it could at least partially reflect the effects of the mentioned new/stricter regulations and because it was the last year with expectedly reliable data about childhood vaccine coverages before the COVID-19 pandemic (in fact, 2020 data might have been blurred because of the pandemic-related disruption in data collection and non-COVID vaccination campaigns).",
              "Data on COVID-19 vaccination coverage were obtained from the \u201cOur World in Data\u201d COVID vaccination database, to have up-to-date and comparable data between countries [24].",

              "According to the ECDC, measles vaccination is now mandatory for children aged 11\u201323 months in 10 out of 30 member states (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia) [25].",
              "The concept of \u201cmandatory vaccination\u201d varies widely, ranging from legally required albeit mildly enforced, to fines imposed on non-compliant citizens or parents responsible for having their children vaccinated, social restrictions, financial penalties, or incentives [1,4,6].",
              "The strictest regulations regarding vaccination are enforced in Slovenia, Italy, and France.",
              "Slovenia has one of the most rigorous vaccination policies based on the principle that the benefits of vaccination for the health of an individual and the wider community outweigh any possible harm that may occur to the individual due to vaccine-related adverse effects [28].",
              "Since 1995, vaccination against nine diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, measles, mumps, and rubella for infants, and hepatitis B before starting school) is mandatory for participation in social activities [29].",
              "In Italy, vaccination against four diseases (diphtheria, poliomyelitis, tetanus, hepatitis B) was mandatory under the former schedule and was required (until 1999) to be admitted to school, while other vaccines, including that against measles, were \u201crecommended\u201d.",
              "Due to a decline in immunisation levels below the coverage targets set by Italian [30] and international standards [11], in 2017 a new decree (Law 2017/119) introduced mandatory vaccination against six more diseases (pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae B, chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella) [31].",
              "This change aroused social and political debate between those supporting mandatory vaccination, because they were worried about the 2017 measles outbreak, and those advocating the principles of self-determination in health-related choices [32].",
              "A similar change in the vaccination schedule was made in France.",
              "Before 2017, vaccination was mandatory against three diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis) and recommended against eight others.",
              "Although vaccination was mandatory for admission to schools, kindergartens, day-care centres, and summer camps, the regulation was seldom enforced (fines and imprisonment).",
              "As vaccination coverage remained high for the mandatory and the recommended vaccines combined with them, but lower for vaccines that were only recommended, vaccination mandates were extended from 3 to 11 for children born 1 January 2018 onwards (Law 2017/1836) to include pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae B, hepatitis B, pneumococcus, meningococcus C, and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) complex [4,33].",
              "In Italy and France, non-vaccinated children are barred from entering a public educational institution (e.",

              "exemption is granted on proof of medical contraindication to vaccination.",
              "In Germany, where all vaccines had been voluntary though strongly recommended [4], the 2017 amendment to the Infection Protection Act (IfSG) [34] mandated kindergartens to notify health agencies when parents refused to provide proof of their child\u2019s vaccination, so that the health department could invite the child\u2019s parents or legal guardian for a consultation or fine them.",
              "The 2019 Measles Protection Act (Masernschutzgesetz) [35] made measles vaccination compulsory for children as of March 2020 under penalty of a fine or a ban from attending nursery or primary school.",
              "The law extended mandatory vaccination to specific professional figures, such as holiday camp educators, teachers, professors, and healthcare workers.",
              "Other countries rely on individual responsibility, with more or less strict limitations.",
              "In Australia, for example, all vaccinations are voluntary;",
              "however, a system of state incentives and disincentives is in place to ensure that high immunisation rates can be maintained: only parents of vaccinated children are eligible for family tax benefits or child care fee reductions (\u201cNo Jab, No Pay\u201d policy) [36].",
              "In some states (e.",

              "However, exemptions\u2013varying from state to state\u2013were formerly granted not only for medical reasons, but also for religious objections (in 44 states and the District of Columbia) or personal, moral, or other beliefs (in 15 states), with no substantial differences in vaccination coverages, ranging from 88% to 94% in all exemption categories [22,23,38].",
              "With the view to increase coverage rates, recent immunisation legislation eliminated personal belief exemptions for school entry, added or strengthened vaccination requirements, and promoted vaccine education programs [39].",
              "In Canada, where the national constitution prohibits the enactment of legislation that directly mandates actions to enforce vaccination (and, therefore, legislation is mandated by provincial acts), measles vaccination is compulsory when registering children for school in three provinces (Ontario, Manitoba, New Brunswick).",

              "children are vaccinated before registration for childcare centres or school, but an immunisation certificate is not required for attending school.",
              "Adherence to immunisation programmes relies on individual responsibility and trust in vaccines, as well as vaccination education and financial support.",
              "In the UK and Finland, vaccinating doctors receive a refund for each person they vaccinate [42].",
              "The Netherlands maintains a central digital vaccination registry that holds individual-level data and a call\u2013recall system that reminds eligible citizens to get vaccinated, thus, ensuring a high level of coverage [3].",
              "This is not an isolated instance, as many countries that opt for a voluntary approach often rely on a system of reminders that provide information about vaccines and notification of due dates either in written form (as, for instance, in Denmark [43]) or through apps or electronic devices, as in New Zealand [44].",
              "Portugal has never mandated compulsory vaccination, except for tetanus and diphtheria in particular cases.",
              "Since 2017 [45], Portuguese schools must notify health boards about unvaccinated children.",
              "The intent is to promote counselling and education, as well as to raise awareness of the benefits of this public health policy.",
              "A similar approach has been adopted by New Zealand, where the National Immunisation Schedule envisages the offer of routine vaccines free of charge to babies, children, and adolescents (including rotavirus and human papillomavirus vaccines), but no compulsory vaccination [44].",

              "This was to protect the population segment at higher risk of COVID-related morbidity, hospitalisation, and mortality.",
              "Italy made vaccination mandatory for healthcare workers in April 2021, and then in December 2021, extended mandatory vaccination to school staff and faculty and people working in the police and the armed forces [46,47,48,49].",

              "Ecuador also made vaccination mandatory, except for people with medical conditions, while Costa Rica was the first country in the world to require COVID-19 vaccination also for minors: children aged 5 years or older must be vaccinated, except those with a documented medical exemption [53].",
              "In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) took a federal approach in November 2021, when it released the vaccine-or-test emergency temporary standard (ETS) to protect unvaccinated employees from workplace coronavirus exposure by strongly encouraging they be vaccinated [54].",
              "Under this rule, covered employers are expected to develop, implement, and enforce a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy [55].",

              "Immunisation strategies and recent COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates are also reported.",
              "Measles and COVID-19 vaccination strategies, and corresponding vaccination coverages achieved.",
              "* Data updated to 19 February 2022: % fully vaccinated (% fully + partially vaccinated).",
              "The data show that most countries share voluntary vaccination policies for childhood immunisation and that the countries with mandatory vaccination policies do not necessarily achieve higher coverage rates.",
              "This is confirmed by the case of the United States, where the recommended 95% threshold has not been achieved yet, although MMR vaccination is required for school entry (despite a wide range of admitted exemptions).",
              "Nevertheless, in Italy, where vaccination coverage for MMR was found to be very low (<90%) in 2015, and epidemic outbreaks occurred between 2017 and 2018, vaccination coverage turned out to be 9 percentage points higher two years after vaccination became mandatory [64,65,66].",
              "Although not yet reflected in the data presented in Table 1, vaccination coverage for children born in 2018 also increased notably in France after vaccination became mandatory: the increase in MMR first dose vaccination coverage is around 3% [33].",
              "Conversely, the European countries (Portugal, Spain, Greece, Scandinavian countries) that merely recommend childhood MMR vaccination achieved and were able to maintain vaccination coverages above the recommended 95% threshold.",
              "As with childhood vaccinations, countries with no legal obligation (e.",
              "g., Portugal and Spain) achieved very high COVID-19 vaccination rates.",
              "In contrast, Slovenia, which has one of the strictest mandatory childhood vaccination policies in Europe, has maintained COVID-19 vaccination on a voluntary basis and achieved low vaccination coverage.",
              "This overview of public health policies on routine vaccination against childhood diseases, more recently against SARS-CoV-2, and vaccination coverage reveals a highly diversified picture of policies, but no evident link between such policies and outcomes: very high vaccination rates are achieved in countries that rely on voluntary vaccination (e.",
              "g., Norway, Finland, Spain, Portugal), while similar or lower rates are reported for countries with stricter regulations (e.",
              "g., Italy, France, Slovenia).",
              "This consideration, noted in the literature [2] and confirmed by our summary for measles vaccination, emerged more clearly during the current pandemic.",
              "For example, Hungary imposed compulsory vaccination for certain professional categories, yet fell behind Spain or Norway, where coverage of up to 80\u201388% was attained without COVID-19 vaccination mandates.",
              "Nonetheless, almost all countries, including those with recommendation-based vaccination policies, envisaged specific (e.",
              "g., Italy) or general (e.",
              "g., Austria) vaccination mandates or imposed restrictions on access to public venues (e.",
              "g., Greece, the Netherlands), to counteract the spread of the infection [67].",
              "It might be thought that the outbreak of an uncommon and/or severe disease would elicit risk perception and motivate the vaccine hesitant to be vaccinated [68,69].",
              "It might have been expected that the rapid spread of the pandemic would have been a sufficient warning to acquire protection by vaccination, as was partially seen during the measles outbreaks in Europe between 2016 and 2018.",
              "Nevertheless, anti-vaccination sentiment and vaccine hesitancy are entrenched attitudes.",
              "We believe that our study findings should be read in the framework of vaccine hesitancy and its determinants, in which hesitancy may be defined as a product of vaccine \u201cconfidence\u201d, \u201ccomplacency\u201d, and \u201cconvenience\u201d [70].",
              "As public health agencies stepped up their efforts to ensure vaccine convenience (i.",
              "e., on-site availability and safety) for the public, the two other factors are likely to offer the most plausible explanations for the observed differences in vaccination coverage.",
              "Social and cultural elements exert a strong influence on vaccine confidence (i.",
              "e., trust in vaccines and vaccination policies) and on a person\u2019s willingness to respond to vaccination campaigns.",
              "Even the possibility to introduce and maintain a mandatory vaccination policy depends on the cultural background of a population: during the 19th and the 20th century, mandatory vaccinations were introduced in some eastern and Mediterranean European countries, but such a policy would have never been acceptable in northern European countries [43], neither in the US and in Canada, where the Constitution denies the right of the State to impose such treatments.",
              "Not coincidentally, many countries with different policy approaches opted for school mandates, an effective strategy that can make the choice not to vaccinate a child seriously disadvantageous, to increase immunisation rates among children and adolescents [71]: California and Australia restricted exemption to vaccination school mandates to medical contraindication only, Italy and France re-introduced school mandates and fines.",
              "Moreover, immunisation rates are influenced by several other factors, which are independent of the vaccination policy adopted.",
              "One predictor of high vaccination compliance is higher education level [72].",
              "Analysis of the country demographics shows that adult education level counts as a possible determinant: the proportion of 55- to 64-year-olds with tertiary education (e.",
              "g., Italy, Hungary) is low in the countries with stringent vaccine regulations and/or low coverage rates where such regulations are not in place.",
              "By comparison, 30 to 50% of the same age group in the countries with high coverage rates but no or few restrictions (e.",
              "g., Norway, Spain, Sweden, Finland) had received tertiary education [73].",
              "Additionally, religious factors may also influence personal beliefs about vaccines [74].",
              "Although religious leaders generally encouraged people to be vaccinated against COVID-19 [75,76], many people view vaccination as conflicting with their religious beliefs, with the subsequent establishment of clusters of unvaccinated in some communities, as occurred in the Netherlands [74] and the United States [77].",
              "The remaining hallmark of vaccine hesitancy (i.",
              "e., complacency) derives from personal attitudes to vaccines in general: vaccines can be perceived as either a necessary or a useless (potentially harmful) social norm [70].",
              "This touches on the perception of the actual need for prevention.",
              "In a given instance, a vaccination campaign may paradoxically become \u201ca victim of its own success\u201d [78], when vaccination might no longer be perceived as necessary because the frequency of an infectious disease is low and because the risks are seen as outweighing the potential benefit to an individual\u2019s health [79,80].",
              "In Italy and France, for example, the relatively low incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases in the last few decades was sufficient reason for many people to opt-out of vaccination, leading to a decline in vaccine coverage.",
              "Differently, a striking mismatch can be observed between the low vaccination coverage against COVID-19 (mostly voluntary) and the high rates of childhood vaccination (mandatory) in Slovenia and Hungary, where we might speculate that the vaccination rates result from compliance with legal mandates (an aftereffect of the Soviet system), rather than from actual confidence in science or vaccination programs. Anti-vax influencers can have a determinant effect on vaccine hesitancy by spreading, via social networks, misinformation about the benefits of vaccination (e.",
              "g., minimising the role of vaccination in infection eradication, elimination, and control) and by undermining confidence in vaccination campaigns by spreading fake news about vaccine effectiveness and safety, or exaggerating adverse effects.",
              "Furthermore, anti-vax movements have political implications, as shown by Italy in 2017, where many politicians initially appeased their constituents\u2019 demand for voluntary vaccinations, and more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, where protests by transport workers on the US\u2013Canadian border led to many restrictions being either lifted or no longer imposed, ensuing in a domino effect in other countries.",
              "On the other hand, a powerful weapon to counteract the harmful effects of anti-vax propaganda is represented by effective, correct, and consistent scientific communication, ideally performed coherently between different information levels and media technologies, which is key to reassuring people about vaccine safety and utility of vaccination campaigns [81].",
              "Of note, the same countries where strong anti-vax movements were present suffered from a lack of communication from healthcare professionals and authorities, and poor coordination among the different institutions involved.",
              "Disagreeing opinions were recorded even among physicians and scientists themselves [82,83], which opened the way to uncontrolled (and influential) information spreading through many sources (chiefly social networks [84]) about vaccines.",
              "The present study has both limitations and strengths.",
              "Most of the data came from high-income countries, which opens the way to similar studies of different economic contexts for policy comparison;",
              "nevertheless, these countries provide reliable (and retrievable) data about public health policies and vaccination coverage.",
              "The choice of the countries, in fact, is connected to the limited availability of systematically updated archives for accessing institutional information and international comparisons: information about vaccination policies was retrieved from a variety of sources (e.",
              "g., institutions and newspaper websites), which was already crucial for measles, to detect changes in strategies after corresponding outbreaks, and even more in the case of COVID-19, for which vaccination policies changed almost every week in some contexts.",
              "This prevented us from including a detailed analysis of countries in Asia or Africa as, for instance, childhood vaccination strategies are nearly unknown in most African countries.",
              "However, this choice allows the study to be grounded on thorough research of journal articles, grey literature, online news, and national regulations (often evolving over time and differing from region to region, as in Italy, where the mandate should have standardised the national immunisation program).",
              "Our study provides a general overview of vaccination strategies against a common childhood disease (measles) and a then unknown disease (COVID-19), and a comparison of vaccination coverage rates in high-income countries.",
              "The analysis shows almost no consistency between vaccination policies for COVID-19 and those for routine childhood vaccinations.",
              "If some countries have taken a voluntary approach (e.",
              "g., Spain, Portugal, Norway) and others mandate vaccination (e.",
              "g., Italy) in both contexts, the approach to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 often differs from that against childhood disease.",
              "Several countries with compulsory childhood vaccination opted for voluntary COVID-19 vaccination (e.",
              "g., Slovenia, Hungary), often achieving low coverages, while others with recommended schedules for childhood diseases imposed strict mandates for COVID-19 vaccination (e.",
              "g., Austria, Canada).",
              "Finally, the link between immunisation policy and actual vaccination coverage is weak.",
              "Though some of the variability in policy-driven effects remains unexplained, the determinants of vaccine hesitancy provide insights into the phenomenon.",
              "As such, they warrant further study that may inform targeted actions: information that is clear in content and delivery [85], proper training of healthcare operators, medical preparedness, and education about vaccine-related risks [32].",
              "A similar analysis in low- or low-middle-income countries could help to differentiate between various contexts and to better focus on key determinants for building prevention campaigns specific to socioeconomic settings.",

              "Many hospitals achieved this through \"clustering,\" which reduced the number of times a worker had to enter a patient area during a shift.",
              "To do this, NYC Health + Hospitals adjusted its EHR and other technology to improve its patient monitoring so workers would not have to physically check in as often.",

              "The authors built and deployed an RPM program within weeks of recognition of community spread of COVID-19;",
              "this occurred through multidisciplinary collaboration, allowing integration of clinical guidelines with postdischarge monitoring for high-risk patients.",
              "The rapidity with which the team was able to institute this innovation was made possible by several factors: already existing VHC and IT infrastructure, high urgency, institutional buy-in, stakeholder engagement, and open feedback channels for improvement.",
              "Subsequent changes were made quickly to both RPM and its IT components, allowing the program to serve as a trustworthy mode of monitoring.",
              "Since the solution was fluidly integrated into the EHR, providers could easily build this into their daily workflows.",
              "Hospitals without preexisting telemedicine resources could implement similar systems using off-the-shelf, commercially available hardware, such as pulse oximeters with heart rate capability, a possibility made even more feasible by the loosening of HIPAA constraints during the current pandemic.",
              "9 Over the course of the pilot RPM program, the team learned several important operational lessons which are worth disseminating.",
              "While this is a descriptive study, the authors have attempted to contextualize these lessons within the available demographic and readmission data.",
              "As has been previously reported, COVID-19 disproportionately affects minority populations.",
              "10 The authors certainly observed this within their RPM cohort, where 51% of patients had limited English proficiency.",
              "This was similar to the larger COVID-19 cohort not enrolled in RPM.",
              "The authors found that integrating translator services into their workflows was critical for operational success.",
              "Furthermore, they added additional education for patients\u2019 families as needed to ensure understanding of the program and discuss any possible cultural or language nuances that may arise.",
              "The authors also observed that a significant proportion of their RPM patients were either uninsured or had Medicaid coverage (which does not reimburse for RPM).",
              "While codes are available for RPM reimbursement, the authors made the operational decision to not bill for these services given that cost could represent a significant disincentive to participate in the program.",
              "Additionally, most RPM codes require a minimum of 14 consecutive days for monitoring and the 8-day program would not have allowed the authors to bill.",
              "It is worth noting that the age range in the RPM cohort was highly variable from 19 to 83 years old.",
              "Anecdotally it is worth noting that the technical support required for RPM was more challenging than video visits.",
              "If vital sign signal was lost, devices and apps would often have to be rebooted or reinstalled, sometimes multiple times.",
              "The team anecdotally observed that elderly patients could require more technical support than younger patients.",
              "While it remains to be seen if this level of support is scalable, it is certainly feasible.",
              "Put another way, RPM should not be limited to those who are technologically savvy, as this greatly reduces RPM\u2019s relevance.",
              "However, health care systems should anticipate the need for technical support resources with tools specifically catered to an elderly population and incorporating family members into their care.",
              "The authors\u2019 observations support previous work where a lower level of digital illiteracy has been identified as a barrier to implementing remote monitoring on a broader scale.",
              "11 The authors observed that most of their clinical \u201csaves\u201d centered around home oxygen.",
              "In several instances they recognized postdischarge hypoxemia via RPM vital signs and were able to deliver home oxygen without a subsequent emergency department (ED) visit or readmission.",
              "They observed early in the pilot that home oxygen companies were unable to deliver oxygen in a timely way, leading to ED visits.",
              "Monitoring this trend early in the pilot allowed us to partner more effectively with home oxygen companies to ensure timely delivery.",
              "Despite the fact that patients enrolled in RPM were pre-identified as higher risk, the authors observed a similar rate of readmission between those receiving RPM and potentially lower risk patients who were discharged without RPM.",
              "More rigorous controlled study is required to determine whether RPM can be relied upon as a tool to reduce readmission rates.",
              "The main programmatic challenge the authors experienced centered on consolidating efforts.",
              "Building an RPM program de novo required coordination of multiple stakeholder groups under one venture, including clinical staff, care management, nursing staff, as well as technological requirements and staff.",
              "It was also particularly challenging to navigate the daily changing face of this novel global pandemic relying on rapid cycle improvement based on provider experience and rapid technological brainstorming for any arising issues.",
              "Additionally, the authors\u2019 device required a smart phone app for data transmission, which limited some patient enrollment as not all patients had this capability.",

              "Considerations for Building a Remote Patient Monitoring Program Abbreviation: VHC, virtual health center.",
              "Interestingly, the authors initially had difficulty with getting buy-in from frontline staff.",
              "This was centered around the requirement for a smart phone application for data transmission as not all patients had smart phones.",
              "There was a perception that this was a large proportion of patients that was resulting in disparity in care when in fact this occurred rarely.",
              "To account for this, the authors embarked on an educational campaign comprised of one-on-one meetings, emails, and virtual meetings to share data on the actual occurrence as well as the importance of continuing with the pilot.",
              "Furthermore, they were able to secure some donations of smart phones to provide for patient use to overcome this hurdle.",

              "This process is resource dependent, requiring a dedicated team of providers, nurses, and support and improvement specialists.",

              "Integrating the recruitment, registration, and device setup were time intensive and would not easily integrate into the bedside staff role;",
              "this would require someone dedicated to this role away from other patient care responsibilities.",
