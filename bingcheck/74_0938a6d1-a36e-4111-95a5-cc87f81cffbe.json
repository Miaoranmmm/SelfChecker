              "Some theories predicting extra Higgs bosons have already been ruled out, but other theories will require more data to explore their prediction.",
              "By studying the production and decay of the Higgs boson, ATLAS physicists confirmed that the Higgs boson interacts with both bosons and fermions (the latter being particles that make up matter), confirming the prediction by the Standard Model that elementary particles acquire mass via the all-pervasive Higgs field.",
              "The discovery of the Higgs boson relied on \u200b\u200bmeasurements of its decay to vector bosons: the photon, W and Z.",
              "The existence of such interactions provided crucial evidence for a process known as spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking to have occurred in our Universe, and is a key prediction of the theory of the BEH mechanism.",
              "However, measurements of this kind were not enough to give the complete picture of the Higgs boson\u2019s properties.",
              "In the Standard Model, different types of couplings determine the Higgs boson\u2019s interactions with fermions and bosons, so the presence of new undiscovered physics might impact them differently.",

              "During Run 2, the increase in the centre-of-mass energy to 13 TeV and the larger dataset allowed further channels to be probed.",

              "One of the most illustrative ways to summarise the current understanding of the Higgs boson\u2019s couplings to other particles is by comparing its interaction strength to the mass of Standard Model particles (see figure on left).",
              "This clearly shows that the interaction strength (vertical axis) depends on the particle mass (horizontal axis): the heavier the particle, the stronger its interaction with the Higgs field.",

              "The relation between the Higgs boson\u2019s coupling strength and particle mass is not the only property of its interactions that physicists want to understand.",
              "Larger datasets collected since the original discovery, and data still to be recorded, now enable detailed and precise measurements of how often the Higgs boson is produced and decays through various different mechanisms. The figure on right illustrates just some of the measurements of the production and decay rates of the Higgs boson (vertical axes) that have been made.",
              "Any deviations from the predictions of the Standard Model could indicate our understanding of the Higgs boson is incomplete.",
              "By looking at the motion of the particles from the decay of the Higgs boson, such as the angles between the particles produced, other properties of Higgs boson interactions can be tested.",
              "Such techniques have been used to explore whether Higgs interactions with tau particles exhibit charge-parity asymmetry and thus whether the Higgs boson plays a special role in explaining why there is vastly more matter than antimatter in our Universe.",
              "One as-of-yet unobserved interaction predicted for the Higgs boson is its self-interaction, where Higgs bosons interact with each other.",
              "This is an extremely rare process at the LHC and is predicted to require much more data than currently recorded to even be observed.",
              "This process allows exploration of new phenomena predicted to only interact with the Higgs boson, but also crucially will allow tests of properties of the Higgs field itself for the first time.",
              "Physicists are not just trying to verify that the properties of the Higgs boson agree (or not) with those predicted by the Standard Model \u2013 they are also now using the Higgs boson as a tool to search for evidence for new physics!",
              "With measurement of the Higgs boson to known particles firmly established, a comprehensive search programme is underway using what we know about the Higgs boson to study theories predicting new particles produced from the decay of a Higgs boson, or produced alongside it.",

              "As dark matter has mass, the BEH mechanism tells us the Higgs boson should interact with it.",
              "Physicists use this knowledge to both search for dark matter produced alongside Higgs bosons in the LHC and, by constraining the rate that the Higgs boson decays to invisible or unobserved particles, search for dark matter produced in from Higgs bosons themselves.",
              "These searches put strong constraints on theories of dark matter interactions with normal matter (see figure on left).",

              "Yet, as physicists steadily populated the particle zoo with electrons, protons, bosons, and all flavors of quarks, some pressing questions remained stubbornly unanswered.",
              "Amongst these, why do some particles have mass?",

              "For example, when two electrons interact they exchange a photon \u2014 the force-carrying particle of electromagnetic fields.",
              "Because quantum field theory describes the microscopic world and the quantum fields that fill the universe with wave mechanics, a boson can also be described as a wave in a field.",
              "So a photon is a particle and a wave that arises from an excited electromagnetic field and the Higgs boson is the particle or \"quantized manifestation\" that arises from the Higgs field when excited.",
              "That field generates mass via its interaction with other particles and the mechanism carried by the Higgs boson called the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism.",
              "The Higgs boson's nickname \"the God Particle\" was solidified upon its discovery, namely as a result of the popular media.",
              "The origin of this is often connected to Nobel Prize-winning physicist Leon Lederman referring to the Higgs boson as the \"Goddamn Particle\" in frustration with regards to how difficult it was to detect.",
              "Business Insider says that when Lederman authored a book on the Higgs boson in the 1990s the title was to be \"The Goddamn Particle\" but the publishers changed this to \"The God Particle\" and a troublesome connection with religion was drawn, one which bothers physicists to this day.",
              "Still, it's hard to overestimate the importance of the Higgs boson and the Higgs field in general, as without this aspect of nature no particles would have mass.",
              "That means no stars, no planets, and no us \u2014 something which may help warrant its hyperbolic nickname.",
              "In 1964, researchers had begun to use quantum field theory to study the weak nuclear force \u2014 which determines the atomic decay of elements by transforming protons to neutrons \u2014 and its force carriers the W and Z bosons.",
              "The weak force carriers should be massless, and if they weren't this risked breaking a principle of nature called symmetry which \u2014 just like the symmetry of a shape ensures it looks the same if it is turned or flipped \u2014 ensures the laws of nature are the same however they are viewed.",
              "Putting mass arbitrarily onto particles also caused certain predictions to trend towards infinity.",

              "It is the predominant and efficient cellular repair mechanism that is most active in the cells, but it is an error-prone mechanism that may result in small random insertion or deletion (indels) at the cleavage site leading to the generation of frameshift mutation or premature stop codon.",

              "26 BCL11A is a 200 base pair gene found on chromosome 2 and its product is responsible to switch \u03b3-globin into the \u03b2-globin chain by repressing \u03b3-globin gene expression.",
              "27 Once this gene is disabled using CRISPR/Cas-9, the production of fetal hemoglobin containing \u03b3-globin in the red blood cells will increase, thereby alleviating the severity and manifestations of SCD.",

              "30 Although there is no cure for cystic fibrosis, symptom-based therapies (such as antibiotics, bronchodilators, and mucus thinning medications) and CFTR modulating drugs have become the first-line treatments to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of complications.",
              "31 Currently, gene manipulation technologies and molecular targets are also being explored.",
              "The use of CRISPR/Cas-9 technology for genome editing has great potential, although it is in the early stages of development.",
              "32 In 2013, researchers culture intestinal stem cells from two cystic fibrosis patients and corrected the mutation at the CFTR locus resulting in the expression of the correct gene and full function of the protein.",
              "Since then, the potential utility of the application of CRISPR/Cas-9 for cystic fibrosis was established.",
              "33 Furthermore, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene and characterized by muscle weakness, has been successfully corrected by CRISPR/Cas-9 in patient-induced pluripotent stem cells.",
              "34 Despite considerable efforts, the treatment available for DMD remains supportive rather than curative.",
              "Currently, several therapeutic approaches (gene therapy, cell therapy, and exon skipping) have been investigated to restore the expression of dystrophin in DMD muscles.",
              "35,36 Deletion/excision of intragenic DNA and removing the duplicated exon by CRISPR/Cas-9 are the new and promising approaches in correcting the DMD gene, which restores the expression of dystrophin protein.",
              "37 Moreover, the latest researches show that the CRISPR/Cas-mediated single-base editing and prime editing systems can directly install mutations in cellular DNA without the need for a donor template.",
              "The CRISPR/Cas-base editor and prime editor system do not produce DSB, which reduces the possibility of indels that are different from conventional Cas-9.",
              "38 So far, two types of base editors have been developed: cytosine base editor (CBE) and adenine base editor (ABE).",
              "39 The CBE is a type of base editor composed of cytidine deaminase fused with catalytically deficient or dead Cas-9 (dCas-9).",
              "It is one of the novel gene therapy strategies that can produce precise base changes from cytidine (C) to thymidine (T).",
              "40 However, the target range of the CBE base editor is still restricted by PAM sequences containing G, T, or A bases.",
              "Recently, a more advanced fidelity and efficiency base editor called nNme2-CBE (discovered from Neisseria meningitides) with expanded PAM compatibility for cytidine dinucleotide has been developed in both human cells and rabbits embryos.",
              "41 The ABE uses adenosine deaminase fused to dCas-9 to correct the base-pair change from adenosine (A) to guanosine (G).",
              "38 Overall, single-base editing through the fusion of dCas-9 to cytidine deaminase or adenosine deaminase is a safe and efficient method to edit point mutations.",
              "But both base editors can only fix four-transition mutations (purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine).",
              "42 To overcome this shortcoming, the most recent member of the CRISPR genome editing toolkit called Prime Editor (PE) has been developed to extend the scope of DNA editing beyond the four types of transition mutations.",
              "43 PE contains Cas-9 nickase fused with engineered reverse transcriptase and multifunctional primer editing guide RNA (pegRNA).",
              "The pegRNA recognizes the target nucleotide sequence;",
              "the Cas-9 nickase cuts the non-complementary strand of DNA three bases upstream from the PAM site, exposing a 3\u02b9-OH nick of genomic DNA.",
              "The reverse transcriptase then extends the 3\u02b9 nick by copying the edit sequence of pegRNA.",
              "Hence, PE not only corrects all 12 possible base-to-base transitions, and transversion mutations but also small insertion and deletion mutations in genetic disorders.",
              "44 The first CRISPR-based therapy in the human trial was conducted to treat patients with refractory lung cancer.",
              "Researchers first extract T-cells from three patient\u2019s blood and they engineered them in the lab through CRISPR/Cas-9 to delete genes (TRAC, TRBC, and PD-1) that would interfere to fight cancer cells.",
              "Then, they infused the modified T-cells back into the patients.",
              "The modified T-cells can target specific antigens and kill cancer cells.",
              "Finally, no side effects were observed and engineered T-cells can be detected up to 9 months of post-infusion.",
              "45 CRISPR/Cas-9 gene-editing technology could also be used to treat infectious diseases caused by microorganisms.46 One focus area for the researchers is treating HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS.",
              "In May 2017, a team of researchers from Temple University demonstrated that HIV-1 replication can be completely shut down and the virus eliminated from infected cells through excision of HIV-1 genome using CRISPR/Cas-9 in animal models.",
              "47 In addition to the approach of targeting the HIV-genome, CRISPR/Cas-9 technology can also be used to block HIV entry into host cells by editing chemokine co-receptor type-5 (CCR5) genes in the host cells.",
              "For instance, an in vitro trial conducted in China reported that genome editing of CCR5 by CRISPR/Cas-9 showed no evidence of toxicity (infection) on cells and they concluded that edited cells could effectively be protected from HIV infection than unmodified cells.",
              "48 As the world population continues to grow, the risk of shortage in agricultural resources is real.",
              "Hence, there is a need for new technologies for increasing and improving natural food production.",
              "CRISPR/Cas-9 is an existing addition to the field since it has been used to genetically modify foods to improve their nutritional value, increase their shelf life, make them drought-tolerant, and enhance disease resistance.",
              "18 There are generally three ways that CRISPR is solving the world\u2019s food crisis.",
              "It can restore food supplies, help plants to survive in hostile conditions, and could improve the overall health of the plants.",
              "49 Beyond genome editing activity, CRISPR/Cas-9 can be used to artificially regulate (activate or repress) a certain target of a gene through advanced modification of Cas-9 protein.",
              "15 Researchers had performed an advanced modified Cas-9 endonuclease called dCas-9 nuclease by inactivating its HNH and RuvC domains.",
              "The dCas-9 nuclease lacks DNA cleavage activity, but its DNA binding activity is not affected.",
              "Then, transcriptional activators or inhibitors can be fused with dCas-9 to form the CRISPR/dCas-9 complex.",
              "Therefore, catalytically inactive dCas-9 can be used to activate (CRISPRa) or silence (CRISPRi) the expression of a specific gene of interest.",
              "50 Moreover, the CRISPR/dCas-9 can be also used to visualize and pinpoint where specifically the gene of interest is located inside the cell (subcellular localization) by fusing a marker such as Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFP) with dCas-9 enzyme.",
              "This enables site-specific labeling and imaging of endogenous loci in living cells for further utilization.",
              "51 Despite its great promise as a genome-editing system CRISPR/Cas-9 technology had hampered by several challenges that should be addressed during the process of application.",
              "Immunogenicity, lack of a safe and efficient delivery system to the target, off-target effect, and ethical issues have been the major barriers to extend the technology in clinical applications.",
              "52 Since the components of the CRISPR/Cas-9 system are derived from bacteria, host immunity can elicit an immune response against these components.",
              "Researchers also found that there were both pre-existing humoral (anti-Cas-9 antibody) and cellular (anti-Cas-9 T cells) immune responses to Cas-9 protein in healthy humans.",
              "Therefore, how to detect and reduce the immunogenicity of Cas-9 protein is still one of the most important challenges in the clinical trial of the system.",
              "53 Safe and effective delivery of the components into the cell is essential in CRISPR/Cas-9 gene editing.",
              "Currently, there are three methods of delivering the CRISPR/Cas-9 complex into cells, physical, chemical, and viral vectors.",
              "Non-viral (physical and chemical) methods are more suitable for ex vivo CRISPR/Cas-9-based gene editing therapy.",
              "54 The physical methods of delivering CRISPR/Cas-9 can include electroporation, microinjection, hydrodynamic injection, and so on.",
              "Electroporation applies a strong electric field to the cell membrane to temporarily increase the permeability of the membrane, allowing the CRISPR/Cas-9 complex to enter the cytoplasm of the target cell.",
              "However, the main limitation of this method is that it causes significant cell death.",
              "55 Microinjection involves injecting the CRISPR/Cas-9 complex directly into cells at the microscopic level for rapid gene editing of a single cell.",
              "Nevertheless, this method also has several disadvantages such as cell damage, which is technically challenging and is only suitable for a limited number of cells.",
              "56 The hydrodynamic injection is the rapid injection of a large amount of high-pressure liquid into the bloodstream of animals, usually using the tail vein of mice.",

              "61 Vectors, such as adenoviral vectors (AVs), adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), and lentivirus vectors (LVs) are currently being widely used as delivery methods due to their higher delivery efficiency relative to physical and chemical methods.",
              "Among them, AAVs are the most commonly used vectors due to their low immunogenicity and non-integration into the host cell genome compared to other viral vectors.",
              "62 However, the limited virus cloning capacity and the large size of the Cas-9 protein remain a major problem.",
              "One strategy to tackle this hurdle is to package sgRNA and Cas-9 into separate AAVs and then co-transfect them into cells.",

              "The skeletal remains discovered in the cave are concentrated in a single, hard-to-reach subsystem and are dated to between 335,000 and 241,000 years ago\u2014a period when modern humans were just beginning to emerge in Africa.",
              "\"We've found the cultural space of a non-[modern] human species,\" Berger says.",
              "The research is sponsored by the National Geographic Society, where Berger is Explorer in Residence.",
              "Berger\u2019s team raised the possibility of intentional burials in 2015 when it first announced the discovery of Homo naledi.",
              "That seemed the most plausible explanation for how more than 1,800 bone fragments ended up deep in an underground chamber reachable only by a four-story vertical drop through a 7.",
              "5-inch-wide slot\u2014the length of a pencil\u2014they dubbed the Chute.",
              "Moreover, the position and intactness of some skeletal remains suggested that the dead may have been carefully laid out on the floor of the chamber rather than tossed down the Chute to collect as a jumble of bones at its base.",
              "Many experts were skeptical that a small-brained hominin could engage in such human-like behavior, suggesting instead that the remains washed into the cave or were carried inside by predators.",
              "But the bone fragments showed no traces of gnaw marks, and analysis of the cave environment and sediments ruled out water deposition.",
              "Other skeptics suggested that modern humans, who likely overlapped with Homo naledi in southern Africa for at least 50,000 years, may have carried the bodies in through the Chute or some other passage that has since collapsed.",
              "But the Rising Star team found no signs of modern humans and no evidence of a secondary entrance.",
              "The researchers returned to Rising Star in 2017 and began making a series of discoveries that have not been fully revealed until now.",
              "They include concentrations of Homo naledi bone fragments that may belong to one or more individuals in shallow pits that cut through the layers of the cave floor and don\u2019t follow its natural slope\u2014evidence suggesting that the pits were dug.",
              "In addition, the composition of fill material in the pits differs from surrounding sediments.",
              "One group of bones was excavated in complete blocks and stabilized in plaster.",
              "CT scans of the blocks revealed the remains of at least three individuals, including an older juvenile.",
              "The youth\u2019s remains appear undisturbed and remarkably intact, including 30 teeth in the correct order, two series of partial ribs, a right foot, ankle, and lower limb bones.",
              "Near a partial right hand is a rock that researchers hypothesize may be a stone artifact or tool, but some outside experts dismiss the association outright.",
              "Arguments around deliberate interment of the dead often hinge on differences between what scientists call mortuary behavior and funerary behavior, says Andre\u0301 Gonc\u0327alves, who studies how animals interact with the dead.",
              "Chimps and elephants, for example, display mortuary behavior when they keep watch over a dead body or physically interact with it expecting it to come back to life.",
              "Funerary behavior, by contrast, involves intentional social acts by beings capable of complex thought who understand themselves to be separate from the natural world and who recognize the significance of the deceased.",
              "Until now, the earliest recorded evidence for funerary behavior and intentional burial among hominin species\u2014including both modern humans and Neanderthals\u2014was at least 100,000 years after Homo naledi.",
              "\u201cHumans are really peculiar as a primate because we bury our dead,\u201d Gonc\u0327alves says.",
              "\u201cNo other primate seems to do it.",
              "\u201d External experts who reviewed the papers for National Geographic raised a variety of concerns around the evidence for deliberate burial.",
              "Some still maintain that water could have washed the bone fragments into natural depressions in the cave floor, which then filled with sediment over the years.",
              "But, says anthropologist John Hawks, a Rising Star team member and co-author of the papers, \u201cThe strongest evidence we have is that the burials disrupt the existing stratigraphy in the cave.",
              "\u201d Another critique involves the state of the bones, most of which are dispersed and disconnected.",
              "\u201cMost of the displacements can\u2019t be explained by the natural course of decomposition,\u201d says paleoanthropologist Mari\u0301a Martino\u0301n-Torres, who studied the oldest-known human burial in Africa.",
              "The new discoveries, however, have somewhat shifted the opinion of anthropologist Chris Stringer.",
              "\u201cI might have been one of those people who's been skeptical about the idea that a small-brained creature like Homo naledi could be going deep into the cave to dispose of its dead,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cBut I have to say, on the amount I've seen so far, that yes, it does change my view on the balance of probability.",
              "\u201d For Gonc\u0327alves, who finds the discoveries \u201cpromising\u201d but is also keeping a wait-and-see attitude, the idea that Homo naledi engaged in human-like behaviors isn\u2019t especially surprising given how close in space and time the small hominins were to modern humans.",
              "\u201cWe\u2019re separated from chimps and bonobos by six million years,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cThree hundred thousand years is nothing.",
              "\u201d In a second paper, researchers describe another new discovery: abstract shapes and patterns etched into the cave walls near the presumed burials.",
              "The inscribed surfaces appear to have been prepared with a substance and smoothed, and some of the markings seem to have been erased and engraved over, indicating that they were made over a period of time.",
              "The nature of the cave\u2019s dolomitic limestone walls make dating very difficult, and researchers concede that it will be \u201cchallenging to assess whether the engravings are contemporary with the Homo naledi burial evidence from only a few meters away.",
              "\u201d Archaeologist Curtis Marean notes that the particular cross-hatch designs that appear on the cave walls are \u201cvery similar\u201d to designs found in later Homo sapiens sites in the region, as well as indigenous Khoi-San imagery.",
              "While the researchers caution that further study is needed to identify and analyze all the engravings, they point out that the production of designs\u2014whether painted, etched, or engraved\u2014on cave walls or other surfaces is recognized \u201cas a major cognitive step in human evolution.",
              "\u201d In a third paper, Berger and his colleagues synthesize their burial and rock-art data to challenge another long-held assumption: that bigger brains mean more complex behavior, such as making tools, managing fire, and creating symbols.",
              "The fossil record shows that relative brain size in many hominin populations increased over the course of two million years, topping off with Homo sapiens.",
              "While a modern adult male brain has a capacity of roughly 1,500 cubic centimeters, Homo naledi\u2019s brain was less than 600.",
              "If this small-brained hominin did in fact engage in advanced behaviors such as deliberate burial and the creation of symbols associated with those burials, the researchers argue, then brain size shouldn\u2019t be a major factor in determining whether a hominin species is capable of complex cognition.",
              "Many key developments in human evolution, they point out, occurred among small-brained hominins, including the creation of distinct stone tools, the initial expansion out of Africa into Asia, and the use of fire.",
              "In addition, another small-brained species, Homo floresiensis, is known to have used tools and fire.",
              "Brain structure and wiring, they argue, may have played a more important role than brain size.",
              "While evidence for fire in Rising Star is not specifically mentioned in the papers, Berger says the team has evidence for controlled fire in the cave system, including dozens of hearths.",
              "\u201cThat place is full of soot, fire, and burned bone.",
              "It\u2019s everywhere\u201d he says.",
              "Carbon-dating of the evidence is planned for the future.",
              "The research team\u2019s decision to go public with their extraordinary claims without first publishing in a peer-reviewed journal is a source of frustration for some paleoanthropologists, but Berger defends the decision.",
              "The papers will eventually appear in the online journal eLife, alongside reviews and an editorial summary, making the process \u201ctransparent,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cYour readers will be able to watch as the authors\u2014our large team\u2014interact with reviewers and editors as part of the open access policy,\u201d Berger explains.",
              "The authors then have the choice to keep the papers as they are, or to incorporate comments from reviewers and other scientists.",
              "\u201cEffectively, we're letting people in to watch the review process and the way peer review works.",
              "\u201d Experts who reviewed the papers agree that paleoanthropology is entering a new era with a growing awareness that there are other human species who have behaviors that until quite recently we thought were uniquely \u201cmodern human.",
              "\u201d With it come expectations of more discoveries of how Homo naledi lived, and how they\u2019re related to us\u2014or not.",
              "\u201cIf this species was adapted to living in caves and going deep into caves, which is the implication in Rising Star, then there must be more evidence of it in many other sites in South Africa,\u201d notes Stringer.",
