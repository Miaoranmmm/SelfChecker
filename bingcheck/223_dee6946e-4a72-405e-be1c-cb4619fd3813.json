    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. Developing a safe and effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection is one of the highest priorities for HIV research, as it could help end the global pandemic that has claimed millions of lives[^1^]. However, it is also a very challenging task, as HIV is a highly variable and complex virus that can evade the immune system[^2^].\n\nThere are different approaches to developing an HIV vaccine, such as empirical and theoretical ones[^2^]. An empirical approach relies on observation and experimentation to quickly move vaccine candidates into human clinical trials, while a theoretical approach involves designing vaccine candidates based on an understanding of the immune response to HIV infection[^2^].\n\nSome of the current HIV vaccine trials are based on the findings from the RV144 trial, which was conducted in Thailand from 2003 to 2009 and showed a modest degree of protection against HIV infection[^2^] [^3^]. Other trials are exploring novel concepts such as peptide vaccines, which use small proteins from HIV to trigger an immune response[^4^], or broadly neutralizing antibodies, which can block a wide range of HIV strains from infecting cells[^2^].\n\nSome of the recent advancements in this field of research include:\n\n- The launch of two large-scale efficacy trials in Africa, called Imbokodo and Mosaico, which are testing a four-dose vaccine regimen that combines two different types of vaccines[^5^].\n- The completion of a Phase 2b trial in South Africa, called HVTN 702 or Uhambo, which tested a modified version of the RV144 vaccine regimen but did not show any protection against HIV infection[^5^].\n- The initiation of a Phase 1 trial in the United States, called AMP (Antibody Mediated Prevention), which is testing whether infusing people with broadly neutralizing antibodies can prevent HIV infection[^5^].\n\nThese are just some examples of the ongoing efforts to develop an HIV vaccine.

              "In 2018, VRC scientists reported that a vaccine based on the fusion peptide\u2014a vulnerable site on HIV that helps the virus fuse with a cell to infect it\u2014elicited neutralizing antibodies in mice, guinea pigs and monkeys.",
              "VRC scientists first identified the fusion peptide target in 2016 and consider it particularly promising for use as a vaccine because its sequence is the same across most strains of HIV, it is exposed on the spike on HIV\u2019s surface, it lacks the sugars that obscure the immune system\u2019s view of other sites on the virus\u2019 outer shell, and the immune system makes a strong response to it.",
              "The experimental vaccine includes a portion of the fusion peptide bonded to a carrier that evokes a strong immune response.",
              "This immunogen is paired with a replica of the spike on HIV\u2019s surface.",
              "The scientists are working to optimize the vaccine and ultimately aim to manufacture a version of it suitable for safety testing in human volunteers in a carefully designed and monitored clinical trial.",
              "One of the signature characteristics of powerful HIV bNAbs is that they mutate dozens of times before achieving their mature HIV-fighting form.",
              "This means eliciting such antibodies through vaccination likely would involve an initial vaccine to kick-start bNAb development followed by a series of vaccinations to coax the bNAb along the desired developmental pathway.",
              "A 2011 VRC-led study of antibody genetics enabled scientists to deduce the step-by-step evolution of VRC01 and related antibodies.",
              "Moreover, studies by VRC scientists and NIAID grantees have revealed how bNAbs and HIV stimulate each other to evolve, shedding light on the necessary structures of the initial and intermediate immunogens of an HIV vaccine regimen that would generate a nascent bNAb and coax it to mature.",
              "A 2015 trio of animal studies by NIAID grantees provided evidence that such a strategy could generate the desired antibody response.",
              "A related approach to creating an HIV vaccine is to elicit a variety of HIV antibodies, each of which neutralizes only a modest variety of HIV strains but together neutralize a wide range.",
              "This strategy is attractive because some modestly neutralizing antibodies have a much shorter developmental pathway than bNAbs, thus requiring far fewer immunogens.",
              "BNAbs bind mainly to five unchanging sites located on spikes on HIV\u2019s surface.",
              "These spikes are known as the envelope glycoprotein, or Env.",
              "Each spike is composed of three identical pairs of proteins, collectively called the trimer.",
              "Many attempts to immunize against HIV used just one segment of the trimer, yielding suboptimal results.",
              "Eventually it became clear that the whole trimer would be a more effective immunogen.",
              "However, Env is extremely difficult to stabilize as a stand-alone molecule separate from HIV.",
              "So it was a major advance when, in 2013, NIAID grantees engineered a more stable form of Env and obtained an atomic-level image of it.",
              "The following year, a study co-led by NIH scientists discovered that an HIV vaccine that teaches the immune system to neutralize the virus should be based on the configuration Env takes before it fuses with a cell.",
              "VRC researchers produced a high-resolution structural model of this pre-fusion viral spike, a valuable tool for HIV immunogen design.",
              "Further studies by NIAID grantees have demonstrated that it is possible to immunize animals with HIV trimer proteins and to modify Env immunogens so they stimulate production of the earliest precursors of particular bNAbs.",
              "Such experimental structure-based vaccines currently are being evaluated in early-stage clinical trials at NIAID and elsewhere.",
              "Structural studies by VRC scientists led to the 2016 discovery of the fusion peptide as a vaccine target.",
              "The scientists characterized in atomic-level detail how a bNAb isolated from the blood of a person living with HIV binds to the fusion peptide and stops the virus from infecting a cell.",
              "These insights led to the development of a fusion peptide-based vaccine that can elicit neutralizing antibodies in animal models.",
              "An alternative theoretical approach to HIV vaccine design aims to elicit a potent cell-based immune response, rather than an antibody response.",
              "Some NIAID grantees pursuing this strategy aim to elicit cellular immune responses to the most static regions of HIV\u2019s proteins by creating vaccine components focused solely on these regions.",
              "In contrast, other grantees strive to elicit cellular immune responses using so-called mosaic antigens, which are computationally derived proteins created by stitching together genetic sequences from across the whole HIV genome.",
              "Taking a different tack, another NIAID grantee pursuing a cell-based response to HIV created an immunogen by placing selected HIV genes into an unrelated virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV).",
              "Most people naturally acquire CMV, which usually does not cause any symptoms in healthy adults, and which persists in the body at very low levels yet garners a large immune response, as T-cells armed to fight the virus circulate in high numbers in the blood.",
              "In a preliminary test of this approach, monkeys infected with SIV, the simian form of HIV, were vaccinated with a monkey version of the CMV immunogen.",
              "More than half of the vaccinated animals completely controlled SIV and ultimately eliminated it from their bodies within a year or two, marking the first time an immune response cleared an AIDS-causing virus.",
              "Scientists are still investigating how this vaccine works at the cellular and molecular levels, and clinical trials are awaiting the selection and manufacture of a final vaccine candidate."

              "Based on these additive effects, and using raw data from the study, a Bliss\u2013Hill model was developed that enabled the neutralization magnitude and breadth of various bnAb combinations to be predicted using single bnAb data [48].",

              "Viruses from infected placebo recipients in the AMP trials, representing more contemporary genetic and antigenic diversity, are additional useful reference reagents for single and combination bnAb evaluation.",
              "When the first\u2010in\u2010human VRC01 trials were designed, VRC01 neutralization, measured by the in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), surpassed 90% of viral reference strains at an IC50 <50 mcg/ml and 72% of strains at an IC50 <1 mcg/ml (or 86% at an IC80 <50 mcg/ml and 42% <1 mcg/ml) [12, 13].",
              "When administered at 10 mg/kg, for example, the in vivo VRC01 trough levels were predicted to be 4 mcg/ml, which corresponds to a neutralization breadth based on IC50/IC80 values of 94%/93% against subtype B strains and 80%/73% against subtype C isolates [51].",
              "Results from the AMP trials permitted an estimation of protective serum neutralization titers in vivo (50% and 80% inhibitory dilutions, or ID50 and ID80).",
              "ID50/ID80 titers were calculated by dividing the median mid\u2010infusion VRC01 concentration across the 10 infusions by the IC50 or IC80 of VRC01 against the participant's acquired virus.",
              "Achieving 50%, 75% and 90% PE was predicted to require ID50 titers of 1:116, 1:252 and 1:565, respectively, with corresponding ID80 titers of 1:32, 1:82 and 1:194 (Gilbert et al.",

              "Early NHP studies showed that neutralizing titers of 50\u2013100 were required for 50% protection [18] and that V2\u2010apex and V3\u2010glycan\u2010specific antibodies protected at remarkably low titers, consistent with their high in vitro neutralizing potencies [52, 53].",
              "The AMP study serum neutralization titers now allow validation of NHP challenge models for preclinical predictive efficacy.",
              "To date, there are many similarities between the data derived from NHP high\u2010dose mucosal challenge models and the AMP trials.",
              "A meta\u2010analysis of 17 studies involving 274 NHPs and all classes of bnAbs showed that neutralizing activity in serum at the time of challenge was the primary determinant of protection irrespective of challenge virus, route of infection or mAb epitope specificity [54, 55].",
              "ID50 titers of 1:91, 1:219 and 1:685 were required for 50%, 75% and 95% protection, respectively, which is remarkably similar to titers predicted from the AMP trials mentioned above.",
              "These data suggest that neutralization titer in serum has the potential to be a surrogate marker for predicting PE similar to viral load RNA in plasma as a predictor of antiretroviral efficacy.",
              "This observation also has important implications for defining the serum titers required for vaccines intended to elicit protective antibodies.",
              "A major priority now is to develop one or more mAb cocktails or multi\u2010specific mAbs that provide high\u2010level (>80%) protection against HIV acquisition in multiple geographic regions and risk groups.",
              "This goal is likely achievable, on the basis of the breadth and potency of current mAbs under study and their ability to prevent SHIV infection in NHPs [14, 16, 18, 52, 53, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64].",
              "For example, a recent study showed a mAb cocktail was required for complete protection, as single antibodies failed to protect due to differential resistance profiles of the challenge viruses [62].",
              "These data support the notion that mAb cocktails can enhance PE against diverse HIV strains.",
              "One caveat to using the meta\u2010analysis data is that each NHP experiment used a homogeneous SHIV stock as the challenge virus [54], which is distinct from viral swarms that humans are typically exposed to.",
              "In most of these studies, each NHP was administered one bnAb followed by challenge with a single viral strain.",
              "Going forward, NHP studies should use strain mixtures to more accurately reflect what occurs during human transmission and provide a better comparative strategy for designing combinations of bnAb cocktails for HIV prevention.",
              "As the VRC01 concentration predicted to protect against HIV was insufficient for the majority of circulating strains observed in the AMP trial, future mAbs/mAb cocktails will need wider in vivo coverage and higher potency [63, 64].",
              "As with first\u2010generation antiretrovirals, resistance to drug abrogated single drug efficacy and stimulated the use of drug cocktails.",
              "The same will most likely be required for mAb prevention strategies.",
              "As the AMP study was ongoing, a series of phase 1 trials were designed and conducted to determine the best antibody or antibody cocktail to move forward clinically.",
              "Table 1 lists the current or planned clinical trials for single, double or multiple mAb cocktails, which display a broad range of neutralization potency and breadth [19, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70].",
              "Great strides have been made in improving upon both breadth and potency [71, 72, 73] as well as manufacturability, stability, epitope affinity and serum half\u2010life through antibody screening and targeted engineering [2, 74, 75, 76].",
              "For example, antibody recycling and turnover is regulated through Fc binding the neonatal Fc receptor, which then limits lysosomal degradation, and modifications to the Fc region can prolong plasma half\u2010life [77].",
              "A leucine and serine double mutation in the Fc region of VRC01, VRC01\u2010LS, increases serum half\u2010life and genital tissue persistence [15, 78].",

              "When tested in vitro against multiclade panels of HIV\u20101 pseudoviruses, PGT121 and PGDM1400 displayed limited breadth, but also had complementary coverage and outstanding potency, with among the lowest median IC50 and IC80 titers among all bnAbs identified to date [63].",
              "In addition to using cocktails, the delivery route of antibodies can be altered.",

              "In a naturally infective course, the average survival time of patients is approximately 10 years.",
              "However, the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) as a breakthrough has altered the course trajectory.",
              "Indeed, cART can dramatically increase the life expectancy of infected individuals by suppressing viral replication, promoting immune reconstitution, and preventing the onset of AIDS;",
              "in addition, cART might decrease the number of new infections when administered as part of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis [2\u20134].",
              "Despite suppression of plasma viraemia, cART is not curative because these drugs fail to eliminate the latent HIV-1 reservoir [5], and the suppressed virus rebounds quickly in the vast majority of HIV-1-infected individuals when treatment is discontinued.",

              "Due to their important features, including a longer half-life, excellent safety and engaging the host immune response, bNAbs are being strongly pursued and developed [6, 7].",
              "Functions, such as neutralizing free viruses, clearing infected cells and inhibiting cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1, have been reported in a variety of studies [8\u201310].",
              "Moreover, the growing profile of bNAbs provides new insight for rational vaccine design and promising immunogen testing [11].",

              "Although these bNAbs neutralized diverse primary strains of HIV-1 in vitro, their potency and breadth were less than ideal [16].",
              "For example, clinical trials showed that during interruption of cART, the combination of three neutralizing antibodies (2G12, 2F5 and 4E10) only moderately suppressed viraemia both in acutely and chronically HIV-1-infected individuals.",
              "Furthermore, the emergence of variants resistant to 2G12 was observed in most (12/14 and 7/8) of the recipients, and these escape mutants developed very rapidly and showed high titres [17, 18].",

              "Although early studies with these first-generation bNAbs showed less than optimal results, the development of high-throughput neutralization assays and single-cell antibody cloning techniques have facilitated the isolation and characterization of a new generation of bNAbs with much greater potency and breadth for immune prophylaxis and therapy of HIV-1.",
              "These potent bNAbs were isolated by single-B-cell culture and direct functional screening or antigen-specific single-B-cell sorting.",

              "For example, studies in rhesus macaques showed that passive administration of bNAbs can protect against a high-dose viral challenge or repeated low-dose challenges at significantly lower serum concentrations [22, 23].",
              "In immunotherapy experiments, administration of bNAb to chronically infected animals resulted in a rapid decline of plasma viral RNA to undetectable levels and a reduction in proviral DNA in the peripheral blood, gastrointestinal mucosa and lymph nodes.",

              "In addition, by increasing positive charges at the paratope surface of 10E8, the S30R/N52R/S67R triple substitution enhanced electrostatic interaction between the antibody and lipid bilayer, enabling 10E8 to bind to Env spikes with a higher affinity and neutralizing the virus with greater potency [59].",
              "More recently, an FR3-loop grafting strategy was used to construct chimeric antibodies by engrafting the extended FR3 loop of VRC03 onto different bNAbs.",

              "A longer half-life of bNAbs should maintain protective concentrations and durable HIV-1 suppression.",
              "However, the serum half-life is closely linked to the degree to which immunoglobulin G (IgG) binds to the neonatal Fc receptor for IgG (FcRn) [62].",

              "Regarding other bNAbs, LS substitution in 3BNC117 and 10\u20131074 leads to a significant increase in half-life and protective efficacy against SHIV infection [64].",

              "Moreover, the combination of bNAbs significantly limited signature-resistant mutations.",
              "More recent research showed that the combination of PGT121 and PGDM1400 provided 100% protection against mixed SHIV challenge but that PGT121 or PGDM1400 alone failed to protect against mixed challenge [71].",
              "These results suggest that single-bNAb-selected resistant viruses generate a diverse infection and that the combination of PGT121 and PGDM1400 display remarkable complementarity, as viruses resistant to one of these antibodies are generally sensitive to the other antibody.",
              "Furthermore, clinical tests have revealed that postinfusion viruses resistant to a certain bNAbs exhibit no corresponding change in sensitivity to bNAbs targeting different and nonoverlapping epitopes.",
              "For example, VRC01-resistant variants showed no corresponding change in sensitivity to the MPER-targeting antibody 10E8 [27], and viral rebound during ATI with 3BNC117 did not well correlate with increased resistance to 10\u20131074 [30].",
              "Moreover, no correlations between the emergence of resistance to 10\u20131074 and resistance to antibodies binding to independent sites on the HIV-1 envelope (VRC01, 3BNC117 and PGDM1400) were found [32].",
              "Clinical trials have determined that the combination of 3BNC117 and 10\u20131074 significantly prolonged viral suppression and that it was relatively difficult for HIV-1 to develop resistance to both antibodies [33].",
              "The variability of bNAbs reacting with divergent epitopes and their abilities to block both transmission modes and to distinctly neutralize pre- and post-CD4 attachment further highlights the need to create optimal combinations of bNAbs.",

              "Overall, combinations of antibodies targeting nonoverlapping epitopes display remarkable complementarity and may dampen the development of viral resistance and lower doses.",
              "High inhibition efficacy against free virus is associated with high neutralization activity prior to CD4 engagement.",
              "Nevertheless, the effect of bNAbs on targeting the viral envelope post-CD4 engagement appears to be effective during cell-to-cell transmission, as cell-to-cell transmission is mediated through the formation of the virological synapse (VS).",
              "This effect may explain why some bNAbs with great potency in vitro lack comparable activity in vivo and fail to suppress viral load to undetectable levels in humans in the long term.",
              "Thus, inhibitory activity in cell-to-cell transmission must be considered when determining bNAb candidates for further study.",
              "The activity of bNAb-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission is likely impacted by steric hindrance at the virological synapse.",
              "Therefore, antibodies with smaller sizes may gain access to the VS and increase inhibitory activity.",
              "It has been reported that the Fab fragment of 10E8 displays more comparable neutralization potency during cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission than the full-size 10E8 at the macrophage-to-T cell [76].",
              "In addition, a llama antibody J3 with a heavy chain-only variable region (VHH) is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread.",
              "Notably, the full-length heavy chain-reconstituted VHH (J3-Fc) effectively neutralizes cell-to-cell spread, suggesting that small size is not the only determinant of potency and that other factors are worthy of further exploration [77].",
              "Additionally, due to the higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) during cell-to-cell transmission, maintaining high concentrations of bNAbs is crucial for protecting against cell-associated viruses [54].",
              "Alternatively, mAbs that target CD4 or coreceptors competitively or uncompetitively bind to CD4/CCR5 with higher affinity than to HIV glycoprotein 120 (gp120) and might inhibit viral entry as well as cell-to-cell spread [78\u201380].",
              "Overall, a better understanding of the mechanisms of cell-to-cell transmission in vivo may promote the use of bNAbs for effectively inhibiting this mode of HIV-1 spread.",
              "Indeed, defining the relative contribution of cell-free and cell-to-cell virus transmission in vivo is a priority.",
              "Mathematical analysis has revealed that cell-to-cell transmission is more likely to lead to escape mutants [52], highlighting the significance of controlling virus replication through the cell-to-cell transmission pathway.",
              "In addition, differentiating virological synapses from immunological synapses and identifying viral particles produced at the virological synapse will be beneficial for specific and accurate therapies.",
              "Initiation of cART during the early stage of HIV-1 infection accelerates the decay of infected CD4+ T cells, leading to significantly lower levels of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA after long-term therapy [81].",
              "The results suggest that early antiretroviral therapy may affect the seeding of viruses and limit the size of the latent viral reservoir.",
              "Similarly, early immunotherapy can clear viral foci and thereby protect against the establishment of viral reservoirs.",
              "In a preclinical trial, infant rhesus macaques received subcutaneous injection of bNAbs on days 1, 4, 7 and 10 after virus challenge.",

              "these animals displayed virus control for 56\u2013177 days, but those treated with cART experienced virus rebound after interruption.",
              "Among 13 bNAb-treated rhesus macaques, the proportion of replication-competent virus-carrying cells was less than 1 per 106 circulating CD4+ T cells in 6 controllers, and four additional rhesus macaques maintained CD4+ T cells and very low levels of viral load for over 2 years.",
              "The results also indicated that in contrast to cART, bNAb therapy during acute SHIV infection promotes the emergence of potent CD8+ T cell immunity that is able to persistently suppress virus replication.",
              "This mechanism of immunotherapy may constrain the establishment and maintenance of viral reservoirs and control infection in humans.",
              "Another possible way of impacting the HIV-1 reservoir is to prolong treatment with bNAbs.",
              "In recent clinical trials, one or more doses of bNAb were administered, and individuals were observed for 2\u20135 months [27].",
              "As it is possible that the therapeutic strategy or time frame was not sufficient to affect the latent viral reservoir, prolonging treatment with bNAbs and extending the follow-up time frame may lead to reservoir depletion.",
              "Additionally, the administration of engineered antibodies with improved Fc-mediated cell killing, such as ADCC and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), may reduce the latent viral reservoir [9].",
              "The latent HIV-1 reservoir is in a quiescent state and may not express viral antigens recognized by antibodies.",
              "In this regard, bNAbs in combination with latency-reversal agents that activate virus expression on the cell surface may potentiate the ability of bNAbs to kill infected cells.",
              "It has been reported that the combination of inducers and bNAbs interferes with the establishment and maintenance of the HIV-1 reservoir in a humanized-mouse model [84].",
              "Additionally, a recent study showed that bNAb PGT121 together with a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist delayed viral rebound in SHIV-infected monkeys, probably due to a reduction in the viral reservoir [85].",
              "Furthermore, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, with the extracellular domain from the single-chain variable fragment of bNAb, can effectively kill reactivated HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells [86].",
              "Multispecific anti-HIV duoCAR-T cells display potent elimination of HIV-infected cells and mitigate CD4+ T cell loss in a humanized mouse model of intrasplenic HIV infection [87].",

              "The V5 hypervariable region is embedded in the CD4bs contact surface, and of note, slight shifts in length can change the relative position of glycans in the V5 loops, and impact developing antibody sensitivity (188).",

              "Within these subjects, there is always variation in the characteristics sampled, and in some cases nearly the full range of global diversity of these loop characteristics can be recapitulated in a single infection.",
              "The problem of within-host diversity is driven by the fact that chronically infected individuals can develop NAbs that target similar epitopes as the bNAbs considered for passive transfer and vaccines.",
              "bNAb epitopes are in regions of vulnerability, and thus are relatively frequently targeted in natural infection (143, 159).",
              "Thus, bNAb-resistant variants naturally arise during in vivo escape either from autologous neutralizing antibodies targeting the bNAb epitope, even if the host\u2019s antibody lineage does not acquire breadth, or as part of the intricate process of antibody-virus co-evolution that gives rise to neutralization breadth.",
              "The latter process involves multiple rounds of viral escape followed by antibody evolution to recognize escaped viruses, and ultimately, most within-host viruses escape matured bNAbs in each infection regardless of their neutralization breadth and potency for heterologous viruses (40, 43, 160).",
              "Since bNAbs targeting similar epitopes show similar neutralization profiles and resistance mutations (38), chronically infected individuals who develop bNAbs targeting a particular epitope will often harbor viruses that are relatively resistant to clinically used bNAbs of a similar epitope class.",
              "For example, individuals who are known to have developed V2 apex, CD4bs, and V3 glycan bNAbs, respectively, also typically show resistance mutations in the corresponding bNAb signature sites.",
              "Studies of cross-sectional cohorts have established that ~50% individuals develop ~50% serum breadth (35, 161).",
              "In such individuals, 12\u201314% develop V2 apex, 21\u201336% develop V3 glycan and 5\u201326% develop CD4bs bNAbs, depending on the cohort (162, 163).",
              "Extensive characterization of within-host diversity is currently only possible for a handful of individuals.",
              "We therefore cannot assess the coverage of bNAbs against the swarm of viral variants that are present in most chronically HIV-infected individuals.",
              "Timing of infection may also be important, as transmissions are most common during acute infection when the within-host viruses are more homogeneous (164\u2013167).",
              "Nevertheless, data to date raise substantial concern that within-host minor resistant variants may reduce the projected efficacy of bNAbs in preventing HIV-1 infection.",
              "The use of combinations of 3 or more bNAbs can alleviate this concern.",
              "If most of the within-host viruses are sensitive to at least 2 bNAbs in the combination, the development of minority variants that are simultaneously resistant to all the bNAbs is less likely during within-host evolution.",
