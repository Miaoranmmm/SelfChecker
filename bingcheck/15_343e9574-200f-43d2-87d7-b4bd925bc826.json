    "query": "What was the most challenging scientific discovery to date and what obstacles did scientists face in discovering it?",
    "response": "That's a very broad and interesting question. There have been many scientific discoveries throughout history that have challenged our understanding of the world and the universe, and each of them faced different obstacles and difficulties. Some examples of such discoveries are:\n\n- The theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the 19th century, which explained how life on Earth diversified and adapted over time. This discovery faced opposition from religious authorities and some scientists who believed in creationism or other alternative explanations for the origin of species[^5^].\n- The discovery of penicillin, the first antibiotic, by Alexander Fleming in 1928, which revolutionized medicine and saved millions of lives from bacterial infections. This discovery faced challenges in developing a method to mass-produce and purify the drug, as well as overcoming resistance from some doctors who doubted its efficacy or safety[^4^].\n- The discovery of gravitational waves, ripples in space-time caused by massive events like black hole collisions, by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations in 2015, which confirmed a prediction of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity and opened a new window to observe the universe. This discovery faced challenges in building and operating extremely sensitive detectors that could measure tiny distortions in space-time, as well as analyzing huge amounts of data to identify the signals from noise[^3^].\n\nThese are just a few examples of scientific discoveries that have had a major impact on our knowledge and society. Each of them required creativity, curiosity, perseverance, collaboration, and rigorous testing to overcome the obstacles they faced.",

              "But as earlier chapters in this history have shown, the raw material for Darwin\u2019s theory had been known for decades.",
              "Geologists and paleontologists had made a compelling case that life had been on Earth for a long time, that it had changed over that time, and that many species had become extinct.",
              "At the same time, embryologists and other naturalists studying living animals in the early 1800s had discovered, sometimes unwittingly, much of the best evidence for Darwin\u2019s theory.",
              "It was Darwin\u2019s genius both to show how all this evidence favored the evolution of species from a common ancestor and to offer a plausible mechanism by which life might evolve.",
              "Lamarck and others had promoted evolutionary theories, but in order to explain just how life changed, they depended on speculation.",
              "Typically, they claimed that evolution was guided by some long-term trend.",
              "Lamarck, for example, thought that life strove over time to rise from simple single-celled forms to complex ones.",
              "Many German biologists conceived of life evolving according to predetermined rules, in the same way an embryo develops in the womb.",
              "But in the mid-1800s, Darwin and the British biologist Alfred Russel Wallace independently conceived of a natural, even observable, way for life to change: a process Darwin called natural selection.",
              "Interestingly, Darwin and Wallace found their inspiration in economics.",
              "An English parson named Thomas Malthus published a book in 1797 called Essay on the Principle of Population in which he warned his fellow Englishmen that most policies designed to help the poor were doomed because of the relentless pressure of population growth.",
              "A nation could easily double its population in a few decades, leading to famine and misery for all.",
              "When Darwin and Wallace read Malthus, it occurred to both of them that animals and plants should also be experiencing the same population pressure.",
              "It should take very little time for the world to be knee-deep in beetles or earthworms. But the world is not overrun with them, or any other species, because they cannot reproduce to their full potential.",
              "Many die before they become adults.",
              "They are vulnerable to droughts and cold winters and other environmental assaults.",
              "And their food supply, like that of a nation, is not infinite.",
              "Individuals must compete, albeit unconsciously, for what little food there is.",
              "In this struggle for existence, survival and reproduction do not come down to pure chance.",
              "Darwin and Wallace both realized that if an animal has some trait that helps it to withstand the elements or to breed more successfully, it may leave more offspring behind than others.",
              "On average, the trait will become more common in the following generation, and the generation after that.",
              "As Darwin wrestled with natural selection he spent a great deal of time with pigeon breeders, learning their methods.",
              "He found their work to be an analogy for evolution.",
              "A pigeon breeder selected individual birds to reproduce in order to produce a neck ruffle.",
              "Similarly, nature unconsciously \u201cselects\u201d individuals better suited to surviving their local conditions.",
              "Given enough time, Darwin and Wallace argued, natural selection might produce new types of body parts, from wings to eyes.",
              "Darwin began formulating his theory of natural selection in the late 1830s but he went on working quietly on it for twenty years.",
              "He wanted to amass a wealth of evidence before publicly presenting his idea.",
              "During those years he corresponded briefly with Wallace (right), who was exploring the wildlife of South America and Asia.",
              "Wallace supplied Darwin with birds for his studies and decided to seek Darwin\u2019s help in publishing his own ideas on evolution.",
              "He sent Darwin his theory in 1858, which, to Darwin\u2019s shock, nearly replicated Darwin\u2019s own.",
              "Charles Lyell and Joseph Dalton Hooker arranged for both Darwin\u2019s and Wallace\u2019s theories to be presented to a meeting of the Linnaean Society in 1858.",
              "Darwin had been working on a major book on evolution and used that to develop On the Origins of Species, which was published in 1859.",
              "Wallace, on the other hand, continued his travels and focused his study on the importance of biogeography.",
              "The book was not only a best seller but also one of the most influential scientific books of all time.",
              "Yet it took time for its full argument to take hold.",
              "Within a few decades, most scientists accepted that evolution and the descent of species from common ancestors were real.",
              "But natural selection had a harder time finding acceptance.",
              "In the late 1800s many scientists who called themselves Darwinists actually preferred a Lamarckian explanation for the way life changed over time.",
              "It would take the discovery of genes and mutations in the twentieth century to make natural selection not just attractive as an explanation, but unavoidable.",

              "In Lamarck\u2019s theory, modifications in an individual caused by its environment, or the use or disuse of a structure during its lifetime, could be inherited by its offspring and, thus, bring about change in a species.",

              "Darwin\u2019s journey, like Wallace\u2019s later journeys in the Malay Archipelago, included stops at several island chains, the last being the Gala\u0301pagos Islands (west of Ecuador).",
              "On these islands, Darwin observed species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had distinct differences.",
              "For example, the ground finches inhabiting the Gala\u0301pagos Islands comprised several species that each had a unique beak shape.",
              "He observed both that these finches closely resembled another finch species on the mainland of South America and that the group of species in the Gala\u0301pagos formed a graded series of beak sizes and shapes, with very small differences between the most similar (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)).",
              "Darwin imagined that the island species might be all species modified from one original mainland species.",
              "In 1860, he wrote, \u201cSeeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.\"",

              "True or False: Darwin's most significant contribution to biology was proposing that species change over time (evolve).",
              "False: By the time Darwin traveled the world it was already accepted by the scientific community that species had changed over Earth's history.",
              "What was not understood, was why this would happen in nature.",

              "Wallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and independently conceived a mechanism to explain how and why such changes could take place.",
              "Darwin called this mechanism natural selection.",
              "Natural selection, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature: Out of these three principles, Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics that allow them to best compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are less able to compete.",
              "Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation.",
              "This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called \u201cdescent with modification.",
              "\u201d Papers by Darwin and Wallace presenting the idea of natural selection were read together in 1858 before the Linnaean Society in London.",

              "otherwise, selection will not lead to change in the next generation.",
              "This is critical because variation among individuals can be caused by non-genetic reasons, such as an individual being taller because of better nutrition rather than different genes.",
              "The original source of the new gene variants that produce new heritable traits, such as fur colors, is random mutation (changes in DNA sequence).",
              "A heritable trait (one that is genetically, rather than environmentally determined) that aids the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation.",
              "An adaptation is a \u201cmatch\u201d of the organism to the environment.",
              "Adaptation to an environment comes about when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the match of the population with its environment.",
              "Natural selection doesn't favor traits that are somehow inherently superior.",

              "The medium ground finch feeds on seeds.",
              "The birds have inherited variation in the genes for bill shape.",
              "Some individuals have an allele (a variation of the gene for bill shape) that causes a wide, deep bill, and others have an allele for thinner bills.",
              "Large-billed birds feed more efficiently on large, hard seeds, whereas smaller billed birds feed more efficiently on small, soft seeds.",
              "During 1977, a drought period altered vegetation on the island.",
              "After this period, the number of seeds declined dramatically: the decline in small, soft seeds was greater than the decline in large, hard seeds.",
              "The large-billed birds were able to survive better than the small-billed birds the following year.",
              "When the Grants measured beak sizes in the much-reduced population the year after the drought, they found that the average bill size was larger.",
              "This was clear evidence for natural selection (differences in survival) of bill size caused by the availability of seeds.",
              "The Grants had studied the inheritance of bill sizes and knew that the surviving large-billed birds would tend to produce offspring with larger bills, so the selection would lead to evolution of bill size.",
              "Subsequent studies by the Grants have demonstrated selection on and evolution of bill size in this species in response to changing conditions on the island.",

              "This contrasted with the predominant view that the geology of the planet was a consequence of catastrophic events occurring during a relatively brief past.",
              "Hutton\u2019s view was later popularized by the geologist Charles Lyell in the nineteenth century.",
              "Lyell became a friend to Darwin and his ideas were very influential on Darwin\u2019s thinking.",
              "Lyell argued that the greater age of Earth gave more time for gradual change in species, and the process provided an analogy for gradual change in species.",
              "In the early nineteenth century, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a book that detailed a mechanism for evolutionary change that is now referred to as inheritance of acquired characteristics.",
              "In Lamarck\u2019s theory, modifications in an individual caused by its environment, or the use or disuse of a structure during its lifetime, could be inherited by its offspring and, thus, bring about change in a species.",
              "While this mechanism for evolutionary change as described by Lamarck was discredited, Lamarck\u2019s ideas were an important influence on evolutionary thought.",
              "The actual mechanism for evolution was independently conceived of and described by two naturalists, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace, in the mid-nineteenth century.",
              "Importantly, each spent time exploring the natural world on expeditions to the tropics.",
              "From 1831 to 1836, Darwin traveled around the world on H.",

              "Beagle, visiting South America, Australia, and the southern tip of Africa (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)).",
              "Wallace traveled to Brazil to collect insects in the Amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago from 1854 to 1862.",
              "Darwin\u2019s journey, like Wallace\u2019s later journeys in the Malay Archipelago, included stops at several island chains, the last being the Gala\u0301pagos Islands (west of Ecuador).",
              "On these islands, Darwin observed species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had distinct differences.",
              "For example, the ground finches inhabiting the Gala\u0301pagos Islands comprised several species that each had a unique beak shape.",
              "He observed both that these finches closely resembled another finch species on the mainland of South America and that the group of species in the Gala\u0301pagos formed a graded series of beak sizes and shapes, with very small differences between the most similar (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)).",
              "Darwin imagined that the island species might be all species modified from one original mainland species.",
              "In 1860, he wrote, \u201cSeeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.\"",
              "(Darwin, 1860).",
              "True or False: Darwin's most significant contribution to biology was proposing that species change over time (evolve).",
              "False: By the time Darwin traveled the world it was already accepted by the scientific community that species had changed over Earth's history.",
              "What was not understood, was why this would happen in nature.",
              "Darwin's most significant contribution was proposing a mechanism, or process, for this change.",
              "His theory of natural selection is still today the most widely accepted, and supported, explanation of species change.",
              "Wallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and independently conceived a mechanism to explain how and why such changes could take place.",
              "Darwin called this mechanism natural selection.",
              "Natural selection, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature: Out of these three principles, Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics that allow them to best compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are less able to compete.",
              "Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation.",
              "This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called \u201cdescent with modification.",
              "\u201d Papers by Darwin and Wallace presenting the idea of natural selection were read together in 1858 before the Linnaean Society in London.",
              "The following year Darwin\u2019s book, On the Origin of Species, was published, which outlined in considerable detail his arguments for evolution by natural selection.",
              "Natural selection can only take place if there is variation, or differences, among individuals in a population.",
              "Importantly, these differences must have some genetic basis;",
              "otherwise, selection will not lead to change in the next generation.",
              "This is critical because variation among individuals can be caused by non-genetic reasons, such as an individual being taller because of better nutrition rather than different genes.",
              "The original source of the new gene variants that produce new heritable traits, such as fur colors, is random mutation (changes in DNA sequence).",
              "A heritable trait (one that is genetically, rather than environmentally determined) that aids the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation.",
              "An adaptation is a \u201cmatch\u201d of the organism to the environment.",
              "Adaptation to an environment comes about when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the match of the population with its environment.",
              "Natural selection doesn't favor traits that are somehow inherently superior.",
              "Instead, it favors traits that are beneficial (that is, help an organism survive and reproduce more effectively than its peers) in a specific environment.",
              "Whether or not a trait is favorable depends on the environment at the time.",
              "Traits that are helpful in one environment might actually be harmful in another.",
              "Demonstrations of evolution by natural selection can take years to study.",
              "One of the best lines of evidence has been in the very birds that helped to inspire the theory, the Gala\u0301pagos finches.",
              "Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have studied Gala\u0301pagos finch populations every year since 1976.",
              "The Grants found changes from one generation to the next in the beak shapes of the medium ground finches on the Gala\u0301pagos island of Daphne Major.",
              "The medium ground finch feeds on seeds.",
              "The birds have inherited variation in the genes for bill shape.",
              "Some individuals have an allele (a variation of the gene for bill shape) that causes a wide, deep bill, and others have an allele for thinner bills.",
              "Large-billed birds feed more efficiently on large, hard seeds, whereas smaller billed birds feed more efficiently on small, soft seeds.",
              "During 1977, a drought period altered vegetation on the island.",
              "After this period, the number of seeds declined dramatically: the decline in small, soft seeds was greater than the decline in large, hard seeds.",
              "The large-billed birds were able to survive better than the small-billed birds the following year.",
              "When the Grants measured beak sizes in the much-reduced population the year after the drought, they found that the average bill size was larger.",
              "This was clear evidence for natural selection (differences in survival) of bill size caused by the availability of seeds.",
              "The Grants had studied the inheritance of bill sizes and knew that the surviving large-billed birds would tend to produce offspring with larger bills, so the selection would lead to evolution of bill size.",
              "Subsequent studies by the Grants have demonstrated selection on and evolution of bill size in this species in response to changing conditions on the island.",
              "The evolution has occurred both to larger bills, as in this case, and to smaller bills when large seeds became rare.",

              "People who lived on the islands could even tell which island a tortoise came from by its shell.",
              "This started Darwin thinking about the origin of species.",

              "In fact, archaeological evidence indicates that selective breeding of both plants and animals began as early as 10,000 years ago in the Middle East when previous hunter-gatherers began to domesticate animals and cultivate cereal plants.",
              "Around this time, changes in climate led to increasing drought, which forced people to concentrate around permanent water sources.",
              "These population concentrations could not be supported by wild animals and plants in the vicinity, providing a stimulus for the invention of agriculture and the use of selective breeding to increase the amount of available food.",
              "For thousands of years, species of plants such as wheat and rice and of animals such as goats and sheep were selectively bred and changed from their wild ancestors.",
              "In the New World, the wild grain called teosinte, pictured on the left in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{7}\\), was selectively bred by Native Americans to produce larger and more numerous edible kernels.",
              "The result was modern maize (commonly called corn), shown on the right in the same picture.",
              "Teosinte was very small with fewer grains on it.",

              "But as earlier chapters in this history have shown, the raw material for Darwin\u2019s theory had been known for decades.",
              "Geologists and paleontologists had made a compelling case that life had been on Earth for a long time, that it had changed over that time, and that many species had become extinct.",

              "He then set his assistants, Stuart Craddock and Frederick Ridley, the difficult task of isolating pure penicillin from the mold juice.",
              "It proved to be very unstable, and they were only able to prepare solutions of crude material to work with.",
              "Fleming published his findings in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in June 1929, with only a passing reference to penicillin's potential therapeutic benefits.",
              "At this stage it looked as if its main application would be in isolating penicillin-insensitive bacteria from penicillin-sensitive bacteria in a mixed culture.",
              "This at least was of practical benefit to bacteriologists, and kept interest in penicillin going.",
              "Others, including Harold Raistrick, Professor of Biochemistry at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, tried to purify penicillin but failed.",
              "Back to top It was Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and their colleagues at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at Oxford University who turned penicillin from a laboratory curiosity into a life-saving drug.",
              "Their work on the purification and chemistry of penicillin began in earnest in 1939, just when wartime conditions were beginning to make research especially difficult.",
              "To carry out a program of animal experiments and clinical trials the team needed to process up to 500 liters a week of mold filtrate.",
              "They began growing it in a strange array of culture vessels such as baths, bedpans, milk churns and food tins.",
              "Later, a customized fermentation vessel was designed for ease of removing and, to save space, renewing the broth beneath the surface of the mold.",
              "A team of \"penicillin girls\" was employed, at \u00a32 a week, to inoculate and generally look after the fermentation.",
              "In effect, the Oxford laboratory was being turned into a penicillin factory.",
              "Meanwhile, biochemist Norman Heatley extracted penicillin from huge volumes of filtrate coming off the production line by extracting it into amyl acetate and then back into water, using a countercurrent system.",
              "Edward Abraham, another biochemist who was employed to help step up production, then used the newly discovered technique of alumina column chromatography to remove impurities from the penicillin prior to clinical trials.",
              "In 1940, Florey carried out vital experiments, showing that penicillin could protect mice against infection from deadly Streptococci.",
              "Then, on February 12, 1941, a 43-year old policeman, Albert Alexander, became the first recipient of the Oxford penicillin.",
              "He had scratched the side of his mouth while pruning roses, and had developed a life-threatening infection with huge abscesses affecting his eyes, face, and lungs.",
              "Penicillin was injected and within days he made a remarkable recovery.",
              "But supplies of the drug ran out and he died a few days later.",
              "Better results followed with other patients though and soon there were plans to make penicillin available for British troops on the battlefield.",
              "War-time conditions made industrial production of penicillin difficult.",
              "A number of British companies, including Glaxo (now GlaxoSmithKline) and Kemball Bishop, a London firm later bought by Pfizer, took up the challenge.",
              "Back to top Substantial amounts of penicillin would be needed for the extensive clinical trials required to confirm the promise of the early results and to provide adequate supplies of the drug for therapeutic use if it did live up to its potential.",
              "Florey recognized that large-scale production of penicillin was probably out of the question in Britain, where the chemical industry was fully absorbed in the war effort.",
              "With the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, Florey and his colleague Norman Heatley traveled to the United States in the summer of 1941 to see if they could interest the American pharmaceutical industry in the effort to produce penicillin on a large scale.",
              "Yale physiologist John Fulton helped to put his British colleagues in touch with individuals who might be able to assist them in their goal.",
              "They were referred to Robert Thom of the Department of Agriculture, a foremost mycologist and authority on the Penicillium mold, and eventually to the Department's Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL) in Peoria, Illinois, because of the expertise of its Fermentation Division.",
              "This contact proved to be crucial to the success of the project, as the NRRL was a key contributor of innovations that made large-scale production of penicillin possible.",
              "Back to top Orville May, Director of the NRRL, agreed to have the Laboratory undertake a vigorous program to increase penicillin yields under the direction of Robert Coghill, Chief of the Fermentation Division.",
              "It was agreed that Heatley would remain in Peoria to share his expertise with his American colleagues.",
              "Within a few weeks, Andrew Moyer found that he could significantly increase the yield of penicillin by substituting lactose for the sucrose used by the Oxford team in their culture medium.",
              "Shortly thereafter, Moyer made the even more important discovery that the addition of corn-steep liquor to the fermentation medium produced a ten-fold increase in yield.",
              "Corn-steep liquor was a by-product of the corn wetmilling process, and the NRRL, in an attempt to find a use for it, tried it in essentially all of its fermentation work.",
              "Later, the Peoria laboratory increased the yield of penicillin still further by the addition of penicillin precursors, such as phenylacetic acid, to the fermentation medium.",
              "It was recognized that the Oxford group's method of growing the mold on the surface of a nutrient medium was inefficient, and that growth in submerged culture would be a superior process.",
              "In submerged culture fermentation, the mold is grown in large tanks in a constantly agitated and aerated mixture, rather than just on the surface of the medium.",
              "Florey's Penicillium culture, however, produced only traces of penicillin when grown in submerged culture.",
              "Under the direction of Kenneth Raper, staff at the NRRL screened various Penicillium strains and found one that produced acceptable yields of penicillin in submerged culture.",
              "Soon a global search was underway for better penicillin producing strains, with soil samples being sent to the NRRL from around the world.",
              "Ironically, the most productive strain came from a moldy cantaloupe from a Peoria fruit market.",
              "A more productive mutant of the so-called cantaloupe strain was produced with the use of X-rays at the Carnegie Institution.",
              "When this strain was exposed to ultraviolet radiation at the University of Wisconsin, its productivity was increased still further.",
              "Back to top While Norman Heatley remained in Peoria helping the NRRL staff to get the penicillin work started, Howard Florey visited various pharmaceutical companies to try to interest them in the drug.",
              "Although Florey was disappointed in the immediate results of his trip, three of the companies (Merck, Squibb and Lilly) had actually conducted some penicillin research before Florey's arrival and Pfizer seemed on the verge of investigating the drug as well.",
              "At this time, however, the promise of penicillin was still based on only limited clinical trials.",
              "Florey next visited his old friend Alfred Newton Richards, then vice president for medical affairs at the University of Pennsylvania.",
              "More importantly, Richards was chair of the Committee on Medical Research (CMR) of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD).",
              "The OSRD had been created in June, 1941, to assure that adequate attention was given to research on scientific and medical problems relating to national defense.",
              "Richards had great respect for Florey and trusted his judgment about the potential value of penicillin.",
              "He approached the four drug firms that Florey indicated had shown some interest in the drug (Merck, Squibb, Lilly and Pfizer) and informed them that they would be serving the national interest if they undertook penicillin production and that there might be support from the federal government.",

              "Antiseptics, which were used at the time to treat infected wounds, he observed, often worsened the injuries.",
              "[12] In an article published in the medical journal The Lancet in 1917, he described an ingenious experiment, which he was able to conduct as a result of his own glassblowing skills, in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during the war.",
              "Antiseptics worked well on the surface, but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent, and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach.",
              "[13] Wright strongly supported Fleming's findings, but despite this, most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients.",

              "When he added nasal mucus, he found that the mucus inhibited the bacterial growth.",
              "[15] Surrounding the mucus area was a clear transparent circle (1 cm from the mucus), indicating the killing zone of bacteria, followed by a glassy and translucent ring beyond which was an opaque area indicating normal bacterial growth.",

              "His paper describing his discovery was received with no questions asked and no discussion, which was most unusual and an indication that it was considered to be of no importance.",
              "The following year he read a paper on the subject before the Royal Society, Burlington House, Piccadilly and he and I gave a demonstration of our work.",
              "Again with one exception little comment or attention was paid to it.",
              "[14] Reporting in the 1 May 1922 issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences under the title \"On a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions\", Fleming wrote: In this communication I wish to draw attention to a substance present in the tissues and secretions of the body, which is capable of rapidly dissolving certain bacteria.",
              "As this substance has properties akin to those of ferments I have called it a \"Lysozyme\", and shall refer to it by this name throughout the communication.",

              "[15] This was the first recorded discovery of lysozyme.",
              "With Allison, he published further studies on lysozyme in October issue of the British Journal of Experimental Pathology the same year.",
              "[17] Although he was able to obtain larger amounts of lysozyme from egg whites, the enzyme was only effective against small counts of harmless bacteria, and therefore had little therapeutic potential.",
              "This indicates one of the major differences between pathogenic and harmless bacteria.",
              "[12] Described in the original publication, \"a patient suffering from acute coryza\"[15] was later identified as Fleming himself.",
              "His research notebook dated 21 November 1921 showed a sketch of the culture plate with a small note: \u201cStaphyloid coccus from A.",

              "[16] He also identified the bacterium present in the nasal mucus as Micrococcus Lysodeikticus, giving the species name (meaning \"lysis indicator\" for its susceptibility to lysozymal activity).",
              "[18] The species was reassigned as Micrococcus luteus in 1972.",
              "[19] The \"Fleming strain\" (NCTC2665) of this bacterium has become a model in different biological studies.",
              "[20][21] The importance of lysozyme was not recognised, and Fleming was well aware of this, in his presidential address at the Royal Society of Medicine meeting on 18 October 1932, he said: I choose lysozyme as the subject for this address for two reasons, firstly because I have a fatherly interest in the name, and, secondly, because its importance in connection with natural immunity does not seem to be generally appreciated.",
              "[22] In his Nobel lecture on 11 December 1945, he briefly mentioned lysozyme, saying, \"Penicillin was not the first antibiotic I happened to discover.\"",
              "[23] It was only towards the end of the 20th century that the true importance of Fleming's discovery in immunology was realised as lysozyme became the first antimicrobial protein discovered that constitute part of our innate immunity.",
              "[24][25] One sometimes finds what one is not looking for.",
              "When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer.",
              "But I suppose that was exactly what I did.",
              "By 1927, Fleming had been investigating the properties of staphylococci.",
              "He was already well known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher.",
              "In 1928, he studied the variation of Staphylococcus aureus grown under natural condition, after the work of Joseph Warwick Bigger, who discovered that the bacterium could grow into a variety of types (strains).",
              "[27] On 3 September 1928, Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent a holiday with his family at Suffolk.",
              "Before leaving for his holiday, he inoculated staphylococci on culture plates and left them on a bench in a corner of his laboratory.",
              "[16] On his return, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking \"That's funny\".",
              "[28] Fleming showed the contaminated culture to his former assistant Merlin Pryce, who reminded him, \"That's how you discovered lysozyme.\"",

              "Following the production of a relatively pure compound in 1942, penicillin was the first naturally-derived antibiotic.",
              "Ancient societies used moulds to treat infections, and in the following centuries many people observed the inhibition of bacterial growth by moulds.",
              "While working at St Mary's Hospital in London in 1928, Scottish physician Alexander Fleming was the first to experimentally determine that a Penicillium mould secretes an antibacterial substance, which he named \"penicillin\".",

              "[27] Staphylococcus, streptococcus, and diphtheria bacillus (Corynebacterium diphtheriae) were easily killed, but there was no effect on typhoid bacterium (Salmonella typhimurium) and a bacterium once thought to cause influenza (Haemophilus influenzae).",
              "He prepared a culture method from which he could obtain the mould juice, which he called \"penicillin\" on 7 March 1929, \"to avoid the repetition of the rather cumbersome phrase 'mould broth filtrate'.\"",
              "[28][22] In his Nobel lecture of 1945 he gave a further explanation, saying: I have been frequently asked why I invented the name \"Penicillin\".",
              "I simply followed perfectly orthodox lines and coined a word which explained that the substance penicillin was derived from a plant of the genus Penicillium just as many years ago the word \"Digitalin\" was invented for a substance derived from the plant Digitalis.",
              "[29] After structural comparison with different species of Penicillium, Fleming believed that his specimen was Penicillium chrysogenum, a species described by an American microbiologist Charles Thom in 1910.",
              "Charles John Patrick La Touche, an Irish botanist, had recently joined St Mary's as a mycologist, and he identified the specimen as Penicillium rubrum, the identification used by Fleming in his publication.",

              "[33][36] The source of the fungal contamination in Fleming's experiment remained a speculation for several decades.",
              "Fleming suggested in 1945 that the fungal spores came through the window facing Praed Street,[37] but was disputed by his co-workers, who testified much later that Fleming's laboratory window was kept shut,[38] and Fleming was unable to reach the window to open it.",
              "[39] A consensus developed that the mould had come from La Touche's laboratory, a floor below Fleming's, and that spores had drifted in through the open doors.",
              "[40] For the effect on the cultures of staphylococci that Fleming observed, the mould had to be growing before the bacteria began to grow, because penicillin is only effective on bacteria when they are reproducing.",
              "Fortuitously, the temperature in the laboratory during that August was optimum first for the growth of the mould, below 20\u00b0C, and later in the month for the bacteria, when it reached 25\u00b0C.",
              "Had Fleming not left the cultures on his laboratory bench and put them in an incubator, the phenomenon would not have occurred.",
              "[41] Fleming was a bacteriologist, not a chemist, so he left most of the chemical work to Craddock.",
              "[21] In January 1929, Fleming recruited Frederick Ridley, a former research student of his who had studied biochemistry, to the study the chemical properties of the mould,[23] but Craddock and Ridley could not isolate penicillin, and before the experiments were over, both had left for other jobs.",
              "It was due to this failure to isolate the compound that Fleming abandoned further research on the chemical aspects of penicillin in 1929.",
              "[22] Fleming reported his findings to the British Journal of Experimental Pathology on 10 May 1929, and published them in the next month's issue,[42][43] but the article failed to attract much attention.",
              "Fleming himself was quite unsure of the medical application of his work and was more concerned with its the application for bacterial isolation.",
              "[42] The article also contained some important errors.",
              "Although Ridley and Craddock had demonstrated that penicillin was soluble in ether, acetone and alcohol as well as in water \u2013 information that would be critical to its isolation \u2013 Fleming erroneously claimed that it was soluble in alcohol and insoluble in ether and chloroform, which had not been tested.",
              "[44] In fact, penicillin is soluble in ethanol, ether and chloroform.",
              "[45] In 1939, at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at the University of Oxford, Ernst Boris Chain found Fleming's largely forgotten 1929 paper, and suggested to the professor in charge of the school, the Australian scientist Howard Florey, that the study of antibacterial substances produced by micro-organisms might be a fruitful avenue of research.",
              "[46] Howard Florey led an interdisciplinary research team that included Edward Abraham, Mary Ethel Florey, Arthur Duncan Gardner, Norman Heatley, Margaret Jennings, Jean Orr-Ewing and Gordon Sanders.",

              "This sort of collaboration was practically unknown in the United Kingdom at the time.",
              "[49] Three sources were initially chosen for investigation: Bacillus subtilis, Trueperella pyogenes and penicillin.",
              "[50] \"[The possibility] that penicillin could have practical use in clinical medicine\", Chain later recalled, \"did not enter our minds when we started our work on penicillin.\"",
              "[51] The broad subject area was deliberately chosen to be one requiring long-term funding.",
              "[46] Howard Florey approached the MRC in September 1939, and the secretary of the council, Edward Mellanby authorized the project, allocating \u00a3250 (equivalent to \u00a316,000 in 2021) to launch the project, with \u00a3300 for salaries (equivalent to \u00a320,000 in 2021) and \u00a3100 for expenses (equivalent to \u00a37,000 in 2021) per annum for three years.",

              "[55][56] Dreyer had died in 1934, but Campbell-Renton had continued to culture the mould and was able to supply it to the Oxford team.",
              "[57][58] The next task was to grow sufficient mould to extract enough penicillin for laboratory experiments.",
              "The mould was cultured on a surface of liquid Czapek-Dox medium.",
              "Over the course of a few days it formed a yellow gelatinous skin covered in green spores.",
              "Beneath this, the liquid became yellow and contained penicillin.",
              "The team determined that the maximum yield was achieved in ten to twenty days.",

              "Initially, glass bottles laid on their sides were used.",

              "Heatley tried adding various substances to the medium, including sugars, salts, malts, alcohol and even marmite, without success.",
              "[63] At the suggestion of Paul Fildes, he tried adding brewing yeast.",
              "This did not improve the yield either, but it did cut the incubation time by a third.",
              "[59] The team also discovered that if the penicillin-bearing fluid was removed and replaced by fresh fluid, a second batch of penicillin could be prepared,[59] but this practice was discontinued after eighteen months due to the danger of contamination.",
              "The mould had to be grown under sterile conditions.",
              "[64] Abraham and Chain discovered that some airborne bacteria produced penicillinase, an enzyme that destroys penicillin.",
              "[65] It was not known why the mould produced penicillin, as the bacteria penicillin kills are no threat to the mould;",
              "it was conjectured that it was a byproduct of metabolic processes for other purposes.",
              "[64] The next stage of the process was to extract the penicillin.",
              "The liquid was filtered through parachute silk to remove the mycelium, spores and other solid debris.",
              "[66] The pH was lowered by the addition of phosphoric acid and the resulting liquid was cooled.",
              "[67] Chain determined that penicillin was stable only with a pH of between 5 and 8, but the process required one lower than that.",
              "By keeping the mixture at 0 \u00b0C, he could retard the breakdown process.",
              "[68] In this form the penicillin could be drawn off by a solvent.",
              "Initially ether was used, as it was the only solvent known to dissolve penicillin, but it is highly inflammable and toxic.",
              "At Chain's suggestion, they tried using the much less flammable amyl acetate instead, and found that it also worked.",
              "[66][69][70][71] Heatley was able to develop a continuous extraction process.",
              "The penicillin-bearing solvent was easily separated from the liquid, as it floated on top, but now they encountered the problem that had stymied Craddock and Ridley: recovering the penicillin from the solvent.",

              "As one of these initiatives, all WHO member states are expected to develop national action plans to combat AMR by 2017 [59].",
              "This will undoubtedly make the first key step in implementing all main action plans currently available, which share the same goals: stop and prevent the spread of multi-drug resistant bacterial strains.",

              "It costs 800 million to 1 billion dollars to bring a new drug to market, and it takes on average over 10 years for it to enter the clinic.",
              "Due to the time pressure that we are currently facing in the battle against AMR, a different approach is to explore alternatives to antibiotic therapy.",
              "It is well-known that some metals have antimicrobial properties;",

              "Using antimicrobial peptides on their own is another approach.",
              "For instance, pexiganan, a natural peptide identified over ten years ago in the skin of the African clawed frog, was shown to be effective in killing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [63].",
              "This drug has now entered a Phase III clinical trial as a treatment against diabetic ulcers [64,65].",
              "Phage therapy is emerging as an alternative to target antimicrobial resistant bacteria.",

              "The scientific community is still looking for ways to overcome the hurdles of phage therapy.",
              "For example, it remains difficult to validate production, as combinations of phages or phage cocktails remain highly variable.",
              "Furthermore, stability of the phages and their antibacterial activity has to be validated.",
              "Preventing infections in the first place is another strategy in tackling AMR.",
              "Access to clean water supply and effective healthcare systems will substantially reduce the burden of AMR by limiting the spread of infections and decreasing the overall number of infected individuals.",
              "Furthermore, improving the hygiene and sanitation in hospitals can lower the number of cases associated with multiple-drug resistant bacteria [55].",
              "Unlike antimicrobial therapies, vaccines have several advantages.",
              "Firstly, they can prevent infections by both antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive bacteria.",
              "Secondly, vaccines are able to provide herd immunity, offering protection to unvaccinated individuals by reducing the transmission of pathogens.",
              "Furthermore, vaccination may affect bacterial colonization, thus reducing the overall population of bacteria and possibly the spread of antimicrobial genes to the commensal microbiota [67].",
              "Thirdly, antibiotics are often given to individuals with viral infection to prevent any potential secondary implications caused by bacterial infection.",
              "Vaccination programs have the capacity to prevent viral infections which would subsequently lower antibiotic administration and combat the rising AMR.",
              "Similar to human immunization, vaccines have a potential to be exploited in agriculture to reduce the antibiotic usage in the farming sector.",
              "An example to show the successful impact of vaccines on AMR is the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).",

              "Penicillin-resistant cases dropped by 81 percent, and a general downturn of resistant pneumococcal infections was observed among older children as well as adults who did not receive the vaccine.",
              "This demonstrated herd immunity, leading to an estimated 50 percent reduction of the total number of penicillin resistant cases [68].",
              "Similar results were obtained following the introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine in 1990, which slowed down the incessant evolution of resistant strains [67].",
              "For vaccines to be effective as an antimicrobial strategy, several challenges have to be overcome.",
              "For instance, the pneumococcal vaccine introduced in 2001 was able to protect individuals against seven serotypes defined by their capsular polysaccharide.",
              "Over time, there was an increased incidence of disease caused by non-vaccine pneumococcal serotypes.",
              "This has led to reintroduction of a modified PCV, which covers six additional serotypes and offers broader protection.",
              "Therefore, the impact of vaccines has to be monitored so that the vaccines can be updated to cover emerging strains.",
              "The alternative therapies demand rapid diagnostic tools to identify bacterial infection quickly and efficiently.",
              "This will allow more targeted approaches to therapy by determining the bacteria species causing disease.",
              "Effective diagnostic techniques and rapid screens will also reduce empirical administration of the existing antibiotics, hopefully lowering the selective benefit for antibiotic-resistant strains.",
              "Understanding the mechanisms that underlie resistance remains a key priority, as the acquisition and development of resistance varies depending on the species as well as on the stage of the infection.",
              "Subverting resistance mechanisms themselves, for instance through the development of beta lactamase inhibitors, has proven highly successful in the past, and might prolong the effective lifespan of our current stock of antibiotics.",
              "The discovery and development of penicillin by Alexander Fleming, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Norman Heatley, opened a new chapter in modern medicine.",
              "The purification and characterization of penicillin resulted in identification of next generation penicillins and has led to the discovery of different classes of antibiotics, which has had a profound impact, saving many lives throughout the last 75 years.",
              "Unfortunately, the influence of antibiotics is now fading due to the progressive rise of resistance, and this phenomenon is observed among all antimicrobial drugs.",
              "Increasingly, there are reports of bacterial species which are resistant to all known antibiotics, leaving us very vulnerable to common infections.",
              "We now must respond to this challenge, keeping in mind the lessons we learned from the discovery of penicillin and the subsequent events.",
              "To begin to tackle AMR, countries across the world must unite to implement strict regulations for antibiotic administration in the medical and agricultural sectors.",
              "Secondly, alternative strategies such as phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides, and vaccines should be explored, as they offer another route to halt and prevent AMR.",

              "The first direct observation of gravitational waves was made on 14 September 2015 and was announced by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations on 11 February 2016.",
              "[3][4][5] Previously, gravitational waves had been inferred only indirectly, via their effect on the timing of pulsars in binary star systems. The waveform, detected by both LIGO observatories,[6] matched the predictions of general relativity[7][8][9] for a gravitational wave emanating from the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes of around 36 and 29 solar masses and the subsequent \"ringdown\" of the single resulting black hole.",
              "[note 2] The signal was named GW150914 (from gravitational wave and the date of observation 2015-09-14).",
              "[3][11] It was also the first observation of a binary black hole merger, demonstrating both the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems and the fact that such mergers could occur within the current age of the universe.",
              "This first direct observation was reported around the world as a remarkable accomplishment for many reasons.",
              "Efforts to directly prove the existence of such waves had been ongoing for over fifty years, and the waves are so minuscule that Albert Einstein himself doubted that they could ever be detected.",
              "[12][13] The waves given off by the cataclysmic merger of GW150914 reached Earth as a ripple in spacetime that changed the length of a 4 km LIGO arm by a thousandth of the width of a proton,[11] proportionally equivalent to changing the distance to the nearest star outside the Solar System by one hair's width.",

              "It was also heralded as inaugurating a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy, which will enable observations of violent astrophysical events that were not previously possible and potentially allow the direct observation of the very earliest history of the universe.",
              "[3][18][19][20][21] On 15 June 2016, two more detections of gravitational waves, made in late 2015, were announced.",
              "[22] Eight more observations were made in 2017, including GW170817, the first observed merger of binary neutron stars, which was also observed in electromagnetic radiation.",
              "Albert Einstein originally predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916,[24][25] on the basis of his theory of general relativity.",
              "[26] General relativity interprets gravity as a consequence of distortions in space-time, caused by mass.",
              "Therefore, Einstein also predicted that events in the cosmos would cause \"ripples\" in space-time \u2013 distortions of space-time itself \u2013 which would spread outward, although they would be so minuscule that they would be nearly impossible to detect by any technology foreseen at that time.",
              "[13] It was also predicted that objects moving in an orbit would lose energy for this reason (a consequence of the law of conservation of energy), as some energy would be given off as gravitational waves, although this would be insignificantly small in all but the most extreme cases.",
              "[27] One case where gravitational waves would be strongest is during the final moments of the merger of two compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes.",
              "Over a span of millions of years, binary neutron stars, and binary black holes lose energy, largely through gravitational waves, and as a result, they spiral in towards each other.",
              "At the very end of this process, the two objects will reach extreme velocities, and in the final fraction of a second of their merger a substantial amount of their mass would theoretically be converted into gravitational energy, and travel outward as gravitational waves,[28] allowing a greater than usual chance for detection.",
              "However, since little was known about the number of compact binaries in the universe and reaching that final stage can be very slow, there was little certainty as to how often such events might happen.",
              "[29] Gravitational waves can be detected indirectly \u2013 by observing celestial phenomena caused by gravitational waves \u2013 or more directly by means of instruments such as the Earth-based LIGO or the planned space-based LISA instrument.",
              "[30] Evidence of gravitational waves was first deduced in 1974 through the motion of the double neutron star system PSR B1913+16, in which one of the stars is a pulsar that emits electro-magnetic pulses at radio frequencies at precise, regular intervals as it rotates.",
              "Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor, who discovered the stars, also showed that over time, the frequency of pulses shortened, and that the stars were gradually spiralling towards each other with an energy loss that agreed closely with the predicted energy that would be radiated by gravitational waves.",
              "[31][32] For this work, Hulse and Taylor were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993.",
              "[33] Further observations of this pulsar and others in multiple systems (such as the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039) also agree with General Relativity to high precision.",
              "[34][35] Direct observation of gravitational waves was not possible for the many decades after they were predicted due to the minuscule effect that would need to be detected and separated from the background of vibrations present everywhere on Earth.",
              "A technique called interferometry was suggested in the 1960s and eventually technology developed sufficiently for this technique to become feasible.",
              "In the present approach used by LIGO, a laser beam is split and the two halves are recombined after travelling different paths.",
              "Changes to the length of the paths or the time taken for the two split beams, caused by the effect of passing gravitational waves, to reach the point where they recombine are revealed as \"beats\".",
              "Such a technique is extremely sensitive to tiny changes in the distance or time taken to traverse the two paths.",
              "In theory, an interferometer with arms about 4 km long would be capable of revealing the change of space-time \u2013 a tiny fraction of the size of a single proton \u2013 as a gravitational wave of sufficient strength passed through Earth from elsewhere.",
              "This effect would be perceptible only to other interferometers of a similar size, such as the Virgo, GEO 600 and planned KAGRA and INDIGO detectors.",
              "In practice at least two interferometers would be needed because any gravitational wave would be detected at both of these but other kinds of disturbance would generally not be present at both.",
              "This technique allows the sought-after signal to be distinguished from noise.",
              "This project was eventually founded in 1992 as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).",

          "He believed that this kind of movement could cause ripples in space.",
          "Some examples of events that could cause a gravitational wave are: when a star explodes asymmetrically (called a supernova) when two big stars orbit each other when two black holes orbit each other and merge.",
          "Einstein's mathematics showed that massive accelerating objects (things like neutron stars or black holes orbiting each other) would disrupt space-time in such a way that 'waves' of undulating space-time would propagate in all directions away from the source."

          "And it is a ringing confirmation of the nature of black holes, the bottomless gravitational pits from which not even light can escape, which were the most foreboding (and unwelcome) part of his theory.",
          "The finding earned the pair the Nobel prize for physics in 1993.",
          "More generally, it means that a century of innovation, testing, questioning and plain hard work after Einstein imagined it on paper, scientists have finally tapped into the deepest register of physical reality, where the weirdest and wildest implications of Einstein\u2019s universe become manifest.",
          "A team of scientists announced on Thursday that they had heard and recorded the sound of two black holes colliding a billion light-years away, a fleeting chirp that fulfilled the last prediction of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.",
          "By studying gravitational waves, the final unconfirmed prediction of Einstein\u2019s theory, physicists may be able to figure out a way to extend it."
