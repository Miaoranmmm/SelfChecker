    "query": "What is the most important archaeological discovery in recent history, and how has it changed our understanding of ancient civilizations?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question, but also a very difficult one to answer. There are many archaeological discoveries that have shed light on different aspects of ancient civilizations, such as their culture, religion, art, technology, trade, and politics. However, it is hard to say which one is the most important or influential, as different discoveries may have different impacts on different fields of study or regions of the world.\n\nSome examples of recent archaeological discoveries that have enhanced our understanding of ancient civilizations are:\n\n- The discovery of full-color portraits of mummies in Egypt[^4^], which are the first to be found in over a century. These portraits show vivid images of the deceased and their social status, and provide insights into the artistic techniques and materials used by ancient Egyptians[^4^].\n- The discovery of the oldest map in Europe[^2^], which dates back to about 2200 B.C.E. and was carved on a stone slab in France. The map depicts a river valley with geometric shapes that may represent fields or settlements. The map shows that ancient people had sophisticated spatial awareness and cartographic skills[^2^].\n- The discovery of an 11,000-year-old parade in Turkey[^2^], which consists of hundreds of human footprints preserved in mud. The footprints belong to men, women, and children who walked together in a single direction, possibly as part of a ritual or a social event. The footprints reveal details about the physical characteristics, health, and behavior of the ancient people[^2^].\n- The discovery of Dragon Man[^2^], a new species of human ancestor that lived in China about 146,000 years ago. Dragon Man had a large skull with a prominent brow ridge and a wide mouth. He may have been more closely related to modern humans than Neanderthals or Denisovans. Dragon Man expands our knowledge of human evolution and diversity[^2^].\n\nThese are just some examples of the many amazing archaeological discoveries that have been made in recent years. Each one of them contributes to our understanding of ancient civilizations and their legacy. However, there is still much more to learn and discover about the past.",

              "Some years ago British Museum colleagues carried out CT scans of certain mummies with associated mummy portraits partly to see whether the mummified body could be linked to the person in the portrait.",
              "You can see their results on Collection online \u2013 but that would be a blog in its own right!",
              "I am a wood scientist in the Department of Scientific Research at the British Museum.",
              "An important part of my job is to identify the different types of wood that people have chosen for objects, including mummy portraits.",
              "I do this by examining and imaging microscopic features in wood structure (such as those shown above), using scanning electron microscopes and comparing them with reference sections of known woods (shown below) using a biological optical microscope.",
              "I was surprised by the results of 180 wood identifications I have done so far on mummy portraits in Museum and gallery collections around the world \u2013 70 percent used imported lime tree wood.",
              "This has been a major breakthrough in mummy portrait research.",
              "Why?",
              "Lime trees are not native to Egypt, and lime tree wood was not imported into Egypt for use before the fashion for mummy portraits.",
              "So why was lime wood so popular for mummy portraits?",
              "It is a quality wood, excellent for carving.",
              "Carpenters could cut thin planks, which might be steam-bent to a slight curve so that the painted portrait could be placed snugly over the face of the mummy.",
              "It may be that Greek and Roman carpenters, knowing about the great properties of lime wood, first produced portrait panels for use in Europe.",
              "We just don't know, because the preservation of ancient wood in Europe generally is very rare, nowhere near as good as wood from the sealed Egyptian tombs.",
              "In addition to 70 percent of mummy portraits being lime wood, I found 10 percent used other woods not from Egypt \u2013 oak, fir and yew from Europe, and cedar from Lebanon.",
              "In total, that's 80 percent of mummy portraits made on non-Egyptian woods.",
              "I wonder whether this means that most panels were actually crafted in Europe and brought to Egypt to paint the person shown.",
              "Before the Roman period, cedar wood from Lebanon was imported into Egypt for high-status coffins, but in these earlier periods most coffins used local Egyptian woods such as fig (shown above), tamarisk, acacia and sidr (Christ's thorn).",
              "Only 20 percent of Roman period mummy portraits were made on native Egyptian woods.",
              "Was there a cost issue for this minority?",
              "Perhaps some people could not afford imported lime wood?",
              "Actually it was probably something more complex.",
              "It is possible that some portraits were intended to be displayed in houses before being used for burial.",
              "If that is true, not all portraits needed to be on thin lime wood panels.",
              "Mummy portrait panels that were made using imported oak, fir and yew wood, as well as those using local Egyptian woods, are much thicker and flatter than those on lime wood.",
              "Could these have been on domestic display first?",
              "There is a curious example in the British Museum \u2013 a small framed portrait made of local fig wood with attached fibre cords.",
              "This one, however, may only have been for a wall display.",
              "It is difficult to imagine how it could have been placed in cartonnage over a mummy.",
              "I would like to mention scientist Joanne Dyer and conservator Nicola Newman who have made an important contribution to mummy portrait research through the use of multispectral imaging (MSI) techniques.",
              "Under different wavelengths of illumination MSI can be used to visualise the materials used in painting the portraits, including Egyptian blue, madder, organic binders and coatings.",
              "Sets of multispectral images often act as 'maps' that highlight particular properties, allowing the mummy portraits to be viewed in a new way and to be compared with one another.",

Note that the hunter-gatherer residents would certainly have been using stone tools to carve into the bedrock;",
              "this was a massive effort.",
              "Like at the other tepes, benches were carved into the rock along the walls, and it was on the face of a bench 60 to 80 centimeters high (about two to two-and-a-half feet) that the relief was discovered.",
              "Moreover, the bench displays a number of cavities about 40 centimeters (15 inches) wide along the wall, which may have been niches for pillars, now missing.",
              "As said, some think of the tepes, such as Gobekli, as the earliest temples in the world.",

              "As for the relief on the bench, O\u0308zdog\u0306an suggests it embodies the essentials of narrative: it has a theme and a story, in contrast to other contemporaneous images in the area, which may come in bunches but are self-contained.",

              "The other isn\u2019t.",
              "The second set shows a human, apparently a man, because it seems the artisan depicted or meant to depict a penis, and a bovine, seemingly a bull.",
              "This male is shown half-squatting with his back turned to the man with the leopards.",
              "In one hand he is either shaking a rattle (making the total five figures) or holding a snake, as one does (six).",

              "This stylized depiction is, again, similar to that of the other settlements of this culture in southeast Turkey.",
              "There seems to be an artistic emphasis on the wildness: the teeth of the leopards and the horns of the bull.",

              "In the beginning of this period, the settled societies were completely hunters and gatherers, and towards the end of the period, the pre-domestication process began,\u201d Ozdogan says \u2013 which means that this picture shows a wild bull, not a domestic one.",
              "The leopards, it should go without saying, are also not domestic.",

              "The march was banned for the ninth consecutive year as were all other pride events in the city, with the Istanbul governor stating on social media that there would be no permission for events that \"threaten [the] institution of the family.\"",
              "In the western city of Izmir where pride demonstrations were also banned, police detained at least 52 people.",

              "In the last three years, eight courts \u2013 in Istanbul, Ankara, I\u0307zmir, Mersin, and Adana \u2013 have ruled that the prohibition of Pride marches and Pride Week activities by public authorities without evidence and justification for the existence of a clear, concrete, and imminent danger constitutes a violation of Tukey\u2019s Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.",
              "Human Rights Watch has reviewed these decisions.",

              "Moreover, public authorities disregard the courts\u2019 rulings.",
              "In June, after a trial that lasted about two years, the regional court of appeal upheld the acquittal of 19 people who had been detained in the Istanbul Pride March in 2021 and prosecuted for holding an unauthorized assembly in violation of the law on assemblies and demonstrations (law no.",

              "The committee examined over 70 applications to the ECtHR concerning disproportionate interference in assemblies and demonstrations in Turkey over a period of more than 15 years and ordered the government of Turkey to guarantee the right to assembly by amending law 2911 to bring it into alignment the case law of the European Court.",
              "The bans on Pride and related LGBT assemblies are consistent with the pattern of discriminatory statements against LGBT people by the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdog\u0306an.",
              "Recently, the government suggested that it may seek to amend Turkey\u2019s Constitution by introducing language asserting that marriage is based solely on the union of a man and woman, protecting the family from \u201cthreats,\u201d and thus opening the way to further moves against associations upholding the rights of LGBT people.",
              "Ahead of the 2023 presidential and parliamentary elections, discriminatory statements against LGBT people became one of the main themes of President Erdog\u0306an\u2019s election campaign.",
              "At many rallies, President Erdog\u0306an used the words \u201cThese are LGBTers,\u201d to refer to the opposition parties while Fatih Erbakan, the leader of the Islamist Yeniden Refah Party (New Welfare Party), aligned with the Erdogan campaign, pledged to close down LGBT associations in a speech on Turkish state television on May 7.",
              "In his election victory speech on May 28, Erdogan again targeted LGBT people and has continued to do so in subsequent speeches.",

              "That\u2019s exactly what happened thousands of years ago when a group of at least 20 prehistoric modern humans walked through a volcanic mudflow produced by the Oldoinyo L\u2019engai volcano, still active today in what\u2019s now Tanzania.",
              "The local Tanzanian Masai have known about this set of ancient human footprints at Engare Sero for a while.",
              "When our research team leader, geologist Cynthia Liutkus-Pierce, first visited the site in 2009, only 56 footprints had been exposed by natural surface erosion \u2013 but she was still floored by what she saw.",
              "Our research group \u2013 including archaeologists, anthropologists, biologists, geologists, statisticians and other scientists \u2013 went on to uncover, document and analyze an astonishing 408 total human footprints.",
              "Using two different dating techniques that measure radioactive decay in the material that preserved the footprints, we dated the footprints to between 6,000 and 19,000 years ago.",
              "In this time period, modern humans were likely the only hominin species left in Africa, and had already spread to many other parts of the globe.",
              "We meticulously traced each footprint trail and analyzed the size, spacings and directions of the footprints.",
              "We determined that 17 of the footprint tracks were created by a single group of individuals walking at the same time in a southwesterly direction.",
              "Based on a sophisticated statistical analysis using a vast comparative dataset of modern foot dimensions, this group likely consisted of mainly 14 adult females, with two adult males and one younger male.",
              "Modern foragers such as the Hadza in Tanzania and the Ache in Paraguay often include groups of adult females cooperatively gathering food together, with occasional visits from or accompaniment by adult males.",

              "They may have been carrying bows and arrows to hunt animals like the antelopes, zebra or buffalo who left other footprints nearby.",
              "Maybe these people looked up when they heard another rumble of the nearby volcano, which had erupted recently enough that the ash underneath their bare feet was still soft.",
              "There are also six other footprint tracks heading in an almost perfectly opposite direction, to the northeast.",
              "Most of the people who made these footprints were walking at different speeds and at least one was running, suggesting that these tracks were not created by a single group traveling together.",

              "Hidden down a well for decades, the stunningly complete cranium is stirring debate about the increasing number of fossils that don\u2019t neatly fit in the classic human origin story.",
              "The strange skull appeared soon after the Japanese invaded northeast China in the early 1930s.",
              "A team of locals was raising a bridge near Harbin, a city in China\u2019s northernmost province, when one of the workers stumbled on a surprise in the river mud.",
              "The nearly complete human skull had an elongated cranium from which a heavy brow bone protruded, shading the gaping squares that once housed eyes.",
              "And then there was the skull\u2019s unusual size: \"It's enormous,\" says paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer of London's Natural History Museum.",
              "Perhaps aware of the magnitude of the find, the man secreted the skull away in an abandoned well.",
              "Now, nearly 90 years later, a study published in the journal The Innovation makes the case that this skull represents a new human species: Homo longi, or the Dragon Man.",
              "Two additional studies reveal that the stunningly preserved cranium likely came from a male that died at least 146,000 years ago.",
              "Its mashup of both ancient and more modern anatomical features hints at a unique placement on the human family tree.",
              "\"I\u2019ve held a lot of other human skulls and fossils, but never like this,\" says paleoanthropologist Xijun Ni of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is an author of all three studies.",
              "Based on the shape and size of the Harbin skull, as it's often called, and comparison to other known fossils, the researchers posit that it\u2019s closely related to several other perplexing human fossils, from this same time period, that have been found across Asia.",
              "The researchers\u2019 analysis suggests all these fossils belong to a group that is closely related to our own species\u2014perhaps even more so than the Neanderthals.",
              "\"It's a spectacular fossil,\" says Mari\u0301a Martino\u0301n-Torres, the director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, who was not involved in the suite of papers.",
              "Yet the proposed grouping and species designation is stirring debate among scientists.",
              "Some experts see tantalizing hints that the Dragon Man may have ties to the mysterious Denisovans, a sister group of the Neanderthals for which scant fossil remains have been found\u2014a few teeth, a fractured piece of skull, a pinky bone, and perhaps a broken jaw.",
              "While she is excited about the Harbin skull\u2019s preservation and mosaic of features, \"at this point, I am not that clear how different it is from other groups that are already known,\" Martino\u0301n-Torres says.",
              "Still, the skull underscores how tangled the branches are in the human family tree, and how studying the full array of enigmatic human ancestors and their shifting distribution through time could help us decipher our own origins.",
              "\"We forget, even as anthropologists, that it\u2019s really weird for us to be the only hominins left alive,\" says Laura Buck, biological anthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University, who was not part of the study team.",
              "Before his death, the worker who found the skull disclosed his long-held secret to his grandchildren, who ventured to the well to retrieve the prize in 2018.",
              "Qiang Ji, a paleontologist at Hebei GEO University of China who led the new research, caught wind of the find and went to take a look.",
              "Unsure of its significance, he took a picture to show Ni.",
              "\"I was shocked,\" Ni recalls.",
              "Not only was the fossil remarkably well preserved, it sported that odd mishmash of features.",
              "The Harbin skull is squat and wide, with a prominent brow common among ancient hominins.",
              "Only one tooth remains in the jawless cranium, but that tooth has three roots, which is a rare trait among modern humans.",
              "Other features\u2014such as its delicate cheekbones, which sit flat and low on the face\u2014are more reminiscent of our own species.",
              "\"You have a very strange feeling when you look into the eye sockets,\" Ni says.",
              "\"You're always thinking, he's trying to tell you something.\"",
              "Ji persuaded the family to donate the specimen to the Geoscience Museum of Hebei GEO University, and the team got to work.",
              "They accrued information from 95 fossil crania, jawbones, and teeth representing a range of hominin groups, characterizing more than 600 features.",
              "They then used a supercomputer to construct billions of phylogenetic trees, tools used to illuminate the evolutionary relationships between hominins, with the fewest evolutionary steps, which most scientists agree is the most likely possibility.",
              "The tree that sprouted placed the Harbin skull on a new branch that is closely related to our own species.",
              "\"I was surprised to see this,\" says Stringer, who is an author on two of the studies defining the grouping and age of the fossil.",
              "He had expected the Harbin skull to be an offshoot of the Neanderthals.",
              "Part of the team thought that the Harbin skull was so different from other hominin fossils that it should be named a separate species.",
              "Ni, an author on the third study defining the new species, ticks off the list of features that together define the Dragon Man: remarkably square eye holes, a long and low braincase, lack of a ridge along the skull's midline, and more.",
              "\"It's not just one feature that distinguishes this from all the others,\" he says.",
              "\"It's kind of a combination.\"",
              "Yet not all the scientists and outside experts agree that Dragon Man is a separate species\u2014nor do they agree about its relative position on the hominin family tree.",
              "Many of the skull's defining characteristics seem to be matters of scale rather than distinct features, says Buck, of Liverpool John Moores University.",
              "Even within a species, she says, some variation is expected.",
              "Differences in sex, age of the individual, regional adaptations, age of the fossil, and more can all drive slight individual changes.",
              "If not its own species, what was the Dragon Man?",
              "Stringer points to a similar mix of modern and more ancient traits in a fossil called the Dali cranium, which the new study categorized in the same group as the Harbin skull.",
              "Found in Shaanxi Province in Northwest China, this skull is considered its own species, Homo daliensis.",
              "\"There is already a bit of an inflation of species names in anthropology,\" adds Bence Viola, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Toronto, who was not part of the study team.",
              "He thinks it\u2019s preferable to group the skull with H.",
              "daliensis, or leave the species unnamed, rather than coining a new species moniker.",
              "Then there are the mysterious Denisovans.",
              "Though not formally recognized as its own species, this group likely inhabited Asia for tens of thousands of years, and many Asian fossils have been suggested as members.",
              "But because scientists have found only meager fossil traces of their existence, genetic confirmation is necessary\u2014and DNA preservation becomes increasingly unlikely with older fossils.",
              "In 2019, scientists announced the discovery of a fractured jaw on the Tibetan Plateau that likely came from a Denisovan, which would make the bone the first fossil of these ancient humans found outside the cave that gives the group its name.",
              "The newly proposed phylogenetic tree suggests the Dragon Man is most closely related to this jaw, called the Xiahe mandible.",
              "\"They probably belong to the same species,\" Ni says.",
              "But he's hesitant to call the jaw (and thus the Dragon Man) Denisovan, since the fractured mandible's identity came by way of proteins extracted from the jaw and DNA extracted from sediments, not directly from the mandible's DNA.",
              "The Harbin skull also lacks a jaw for physical comparison.",
              "Viola, who was on the team that first described the Denisovans, disagrees, noting that Denisovan identity is most logical for the Xiahe mandible.",
              "But he points out that even if the Dragon Man was Denisovan, the new analysis places the branch of the tree that includes both the Harbin skull and the Xiahe mandible apart from the Neanderthals.",
              "That would be odd, since such a grouping conflicts with the story of the Denisovans laid out in past studies of their genetics.",
              "Those analyses suggest that the common ancestor of Neanderthals and Denisovans split from the predecessors of Homo sapiens some 600,000 years ago.",
              "That ancestor then split into two groups, with Neanderthals fanning out through Europe and the Middle East and Denisovans moving into Asia.",
              "The relationships between all these groups are \"bound to be close and difficult to resolve,\" paleoanthropologist Katerina Harvati, who was not part of the research, says via email.",
              "\"I think probably this is something that will need to be worked out more closely once there is more evidence,\" says Harvati, of Eberhard Karls University of Tu\u0308bingen.",
              "More evidence may be on the horizon.",
              "The team involved in the new papers is exploring the possibility of genetic analyses for the Dragon Man, Ni says.",
              "But they are proceeding with caution because such work requires destroying small samples of the fossil.",
              "Regardless of whether Dragon Man is a new species, its stunningly preserved features are a reminder that nature rarely paints inside the lines, and that categorization will only get more complex as new discoveries emerge.",
              "\"What you consider a species is really this philosophical question rather than this biological truth,\" Buck says.",
              "Species definitions can be useful, she says, but \"for me, the more interesting questions are .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "how did they adapt?",
              "And how did they exist in the world?\"",
              "Here, too, the Dragon Man offers enticing possibilities.",
              "The exact location where the worker pulled it from the mud remains unknown, but the proposed region is extremely far north, says Michael Petraglia, a paleoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, who was not part of the research.",
              "Even in today's relatively balmy conditions, the wintertime temperatures in this area can plummet into the single digits in degrees Fahrenheit;",
              "about 146,000 years ago, it probably wasn\u2019t much warmer.",
              "The team speculates that some of the skull\u2019s robust traits reflect adaptations to a much colder climate.",
              "The environment may have also isolated the Dragon Man and its kin from other hominins, Petraglia says, which could have driven some of the distinctiveness seen in the fossil today.",
              "The team's full database and detailed images of the Dragon Man are now publicly available, Stringer says, so other researchers can plumb the hominin\u2019s depths themselves.",

              "The strange skull appeared soon after the Japanese invaded northeast China in the early 1930s.",
              "A team of locals was raising a bridge near Harbin, a city in China\u2019s northernmost province, when one of the workers stumbled on a surprise in the river mud.",
              "The nearly complete human skull had an elongated cranium from which a heavy brow bone protruded, shading the gaping squares that once housed eyes.",
              "And then there was the skull\u2019s unusual size: \"It's enormous,\" says paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer of London's Natural History Museum.",
              "Perhaps aware of the magnitude of the find, the man secreted the skull away in an abandoned well.",
              "Now, nearly 90 years later, a study published in the journal The Innovation makes the case that this skull represents a new human species: Homo longi, or the Dragon Man.",
              "Two additional studies reveal that the stunningly preserved cranium likely came from a male that died at least 146,000 years ago.",
              "Its mashup of both ancient and more modern anatomical features hints at a unique placement on the human family tree.",
              "\"I\u2019ve held a lot of other human skulls and fossils, but never like this,\" says paleoanthropologist Xijun Ni of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is an author of all three studies.",
              "Based on the shape and size of the Harbin skull, as it's often called, and comparison to other known fossils, the researchers posit that it\u2019s closely related to several other perplexing human fossils, from this same time period, that have been found across Asia.",
              "The researchers\u2019 analysis suggests all these fossils belong to a group that is closely related to our own species\u2014perhaps even more so than the Neanderthals.",
              "\"It's a spectacular fossil,\" says Mari\u0301a Martino\u0301n-Torres, the director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, who was not involved in the suite of papers.",
              "Yet the proposed grouping and species designation is stirring debate among scientists.",
              "Some experts see tantalizing hints that the Dragon Man may have ties to the mysterious Denisovans, a sister group of the Neanderthals for which scant fossil remains have been found\u2014a few teeth, a fractured piece of skull, a pinky bone, and perhaps a broken jaw.",
              "While she is excited about the Harbin skull\u2019s preservation and mosaic of features, \"at this point, I am not that clear how different it is from other groups that are already known,\" Martino\u0301n-Torres says.",
              "Still, the skull underscores how tangled the branches are in the human family tree, and how studying the full array of enigmatic human ancestors and their shifting distribution through time could help us decipher our own origins.",
              "\"We forget, even as anthropologists, that it\u2019s really weird for us to be the only hominins left alive,\" says Laura Buck, biological anthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University, who was not part of the study team.",
              "Before his death, the worker who found the skull disclosed his long-held secret to his grandchildren, who ventured to the well to retrieve the prize in 2018.",
              "Qiang Ji, a paleontologist at Hebei GEO University of China who led the new research, caught wind of the find and went to take a look.",
              "Unsure of its significance, he took a picture to show Ni.",
              "\"I was shocked,\" Ni recalls.",
              "Not only was the fossil remarkably well preserved, it sported that odd mishmash of features.",
              "The Harbin skull is squat and wide, with a prominent brow common among ancient hominins.",
              "Only one tooth remains in the jawless cranium, but that tooth has three roots, which is a rare trait among modern humans.",
              "Other features\u2014such as its delicate cheekbones, which sit flat and low on the face\u2014are more reminiscent of our own species.",
              "\"You have a very strange feeling when you look into the eye sockets,\" Ni says.",
              "\"You're always thinking, he's trying to tell you something.\"",
              "Ji persuaded the family to donate the specimen to the Geoscience Museum of Hebei GEO University, and the team got to work.",
              "They accrued information from 95 fossil crania, jawbones, and teeth representing a range of hominin groups, characterizing more than 600 features.",
              "They then used a supercomputer to construct billions of phylogenetic trees, tools used to illuminate the evolutionary relationships between hominins, with the fewest evolutionary steps, which most scientists agree is the most likely possibility.",
              "The tree that sprouted placed the Harbin skull on a new branch that is closely related to our own species.",
              "\"I was surprised to see this,\" says Stringer, who is an author on two of the studies defining the grouping and age of the fossil.",
              "He had expected the Harbin skull to be an offshoot of the Neanderthals.",
              "Part of the team thought that the Harbin skull was so different from other hominin fossils that it should be named a separate species.",
              "Ni, an author on the third study defining the new species, ticks off the list of features that together define the Dragon Man: remarkably square eye holes, a long and low braincase, lack of a ridge along the skull's midline, and more.",
              "\"It's not just one feature that distinguishes this from all the others,\" he says.",
              "\"It's kind of a combination.\"",
              "Yet not all the scientists and outside experts agree that Dragon Man is a separate species\u2014nor do they agree about its relative position on the hominin family tree.",
              "Many of the skull's defining characteristics seem to be matters of scale rather than distinct features, says Buck, of Liverpool John Moores University.",
              "Even within a species, she says, some variation is expected.",
              "Differences in sex, age of the individual, regional adaptations, age of the fossil, and more can all drive slight individual changes.",
              "If not its own species, what was the Dragon Man?",
              "Stringer points to a similar mix of modern and more ancient traits in a fossil called the Dali cranium, which the new study categorized in the same group as the Harbin skull.",
              "Found in Shaanxi Province in Northwest China, this skull is considered its own species, Homo daliensis.",
              "\"There is already a bit of an inflation of species names in anthropology,\" adds Bence Viola, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Toronto, who was not part of the study team.",
              "He thinks it\u2019s preferable to group the skull with H.",
              "daliensis, or leave the species unnamed, rather than coining a new species moniker.",
              "Then there are the mysterious Denisovans.",
              "Though not formally recognized as its own species, this group likely inhabited Asia for tens of thousands of years, and many Asian fossils have been suggested as members.",
              "But because scientists have found only meager fossil traces of their existence, genetic confirmation is necessary\u2014and DNA preservation becomes increasingly unlikely with older fossils.",
              "In 2019, scientists announced the discovery of a fractured jaw on the Tibetan Plateau that likely came from a Denisovan, which would make the bone the first fossil of these ancient humans found outside the cave that gives the group its name.",
              "The newly proposed phylogenetic tree suggests the Dragon Man is most closely related to this jaw, called the Xiahe mandible.",
              "\"They probably belong to the same species,\" Ni says.",
              "But he's hesitant to call the jaw (and thus the Dragon Man) Denisovan, since the fractured mandible's identity came by way of proteins extracted from the jaw and DNA extracted from sediments, not directly from the mandible's DNA.",
              "The Harbin skull also lacks a jaw for physical comparison.",
              "Viola, who was on the team that first described the Denisovans, disagrees, noting that Denisovan identity is most logical for the Xiahe mandible.",
              "But he points out that even if the Dragon Man was Denisovan, the new analysis places the branch of the tree that includes both the Harbin skull and the Xiahe mandible apart from the Neanderthals.",
              "That would be odd, since such a grouping conflicts with the story of the Denisovans laid out in past studies of their genetics.",
              "Those analyses suggest that the common ancestor of Neanderthals and Denisovans split from the predecessors of Homo sapiens some 600,000 years ago.",
              "That ancestor then split into two groups, with Neanderthals fanning out through Europe and the Middle East and Denisovans moving into Asia.",
              "The relationships between all these groups are \"bound to be close and difficult to resolve,\" paleoanthropologist Katerina Harvati, who was not part of the research, says via email.",
              "\"I think probably this is something that will need to be worked out more closely once there is more evidence,\" says Harvati, of Eberhard Karls University of Tu\u0308bingen.",
              "More evidence may be on the horizon.",
              "The team involved in the new papers is exploring the possibility of genetic analyses for the Dragon Man, Ni says.",
              "But they are proceeding with caution because such work requires destroying small samples of the fossil.",
              "Regardless of whether Dragon Man is a new species, its stunningly preserved features are a reminder that nature rarely paints inside the lines, and that categorization will only get more complex as new discoveries emerge.",
              "\"What you consider a species is really this philosophical question rather than this biological truth,\" Buck says.",
              "Species definitions can be useful, she says, but \"for me, the more interesting questions are .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "how did they adapt?",
              "And how did they exist in the world?\"",
              "Here, too, the Dragon Man offers enticing possibilities.",
              "The exact location where the worker pulled it from the mud remains unknown, but the proposed region is extremely far north, says Michael Petraglia, a paleoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, who was not part of the research.",
              "Even in today's relatively balmy conditions, the wintertime temperatures in this area can plummet into the single digits in degrees Fahrenheit;",
              "about 146,000 years ago, it probably wasn\u2019t much warmer.",
              "The team speculates that some of the skull\u2019s robust traits reflect adaptations to a much colder climate.",
              "The environment may have also isolated the Dragon Man and its kin from other hominins, Petraglia says, which could have driven some of the distinctiveness seen in the fossil today.",
              "The team's full database and detailed images of the Dragon Man are now publicly available, Stringer says, so other researchers can plumb the hominin\u2019s depths themselves.",

              "The strange skull appeared soon after the Japanese invaded northeast China in the early 1930s.",
              "A team of locals was raising a bridge near Harbin, a city in Chinaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s northernmost province, when one of the workers stumbled on a surprise in the river mud.",
              "The nearly complete human skull had an elongated cranium from which a heavy brow bone protruded, shading the gaping squares that once housed eyes.",
              "And then there was the skulla\u0302\u0080\u0099s unusual size: \"It's enormous,\" says palaeoanthropologist Chris Stringer of London's Natural History Museum.",
              "Perhaps aware of the magnitude of the find, the man secreted the skull away in an abandoned well.",
              "Now, nearly 90 years later, a study published in the journal The Innovation makes the case that this skull represents a new human species: Homo longi, or the Dragon Man.",
              "Two additional studies reveal that the stunningly preserved cranium likely came from a male that died at least 146,000 years ago.",
              "Its mashup of both ancient and more modern anatomical features hints at a unique placement on the human family tree.",
              "\"Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ve held a lot of other human skulls and fossils, but never like this,\" says palaeoanthropologist Xijun Ni of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is an author of all three studies.",
              "Based on the shape and size of the Harbin skull, as it's often called, and comparison to other known fossils, the researchers posit that ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s closely related to several other perplexing human fossils, from this same time period, that have been found across Asia.",
              "The researchersa\u0302\u0080\u0099 analysis suggests all these fossils belong to a group that is closely related to our own speciesa\u0302\u0080\u0094perhaps even more so than the Neanderthals.",
              "\"It's a spectacular fossil,\" says MarA\u0303\u00ada MartinA\u03033n-Torres, the director of Spain's National Research Centre on Human Evolution, who was not involved in the suite of papers.",
              "Yet the proposed grouping and species designation is stirring debate among scientists.",
              "Some experts see tantalising hints that the Dragon Man may have ties to the mysterious Denisovans, a sister group of the Neanderthals for which scant fossil remains have been founda\u0302\u0080\u0094a few teeth, a fractured piece of skull, a pinky bone, and perhaps a broken jaw.",
              "While she is excited about the Harbin skulla\u0302\u0080\u0099s preservation and mosaic of features, \"at this point, I am not that clear how different it is from other groups that are already known,\" MartinA\u03033n-Torres says.",
              "Still, the skull underscores how tangled the branches are in the human family tree, and how studying the full array of enigmatic human ancestors and their shifting distribution through time could help us decipher our own origins.",
              "\"We forget, even as anthropologists, that ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s really weird for us to be the only hominins left alive,\" says Laura Buck, biological anthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University, who was not part of the study team.",
              "Before his death, the worker who found the skull disclosed his long-held secret to his grandchildren, who ventured to the well to retrieve the prize in 2018.",
              "Qiang Ji, a palaeontologist at Hebei GEO University of China who led the new research, caught wind of the find and went to take a look.",
              "Unsure of its significance, he took a picture to show Ni.",
              "\"I was shocked,\" Ni recalls.",
              "Not only was the fossil remarkably well preserved, it sported that odd mishmash of features.",
              "The Harbin skull is squat and wide, with a prominent brow common among ancient hominins.",
              "Only one tooth remains in the jawless cranium, but that tooth has three roots, which is a rare trait among modern humans.",
              "Other featuresa\u0302\u0080\u0094such as its delicate cheekbones, which sit flat and low on the facea\u0302\u0080\u0094are more reminiscent of our own species.",
              "\"You have a very strange feeling when you look into the eye sockets,\" Ni says.",
              "\"You're always thinking, he's trying to tell you something.\"",
              "Ji persuaded the family to donate the specimen to the Geoscience Museum of Hebei GEO University, and the team got to work.",
              "They accrued information from 95 fossil crania, jawbones, and teeth representing a range of hominin groups, characterising more than 600 features.",
              "They then used a supercomputer to construct billions of phylogenetic trees, tools used to illuminate the evolutionary relationships between hominins, with the fewest evolutionary steps, which most scientists agree is the most likely possibility.",
              "The tree that sprouted placed the Harbin skull on a new branch that is closely related to our own species.",
              "\"I was surprised to see this,\" says Stringer, who is an author on two of the studies defining the grouping and age of the fossil.",
              "He had expected the Harbin skull to be an offshoot of the Neanderthals.",
              "Part of the team thought that the Harbin skull was so different from other hominin fossils that it should be named a separate species.",
              "Ni, an author on the third study defining the new species, ticks off the list of features that together define the Dragon Man: remarkably square eye holes, a long and low braincase, lack of a ridge along the skull's midline, and more.",
              "\"It's not just one feature that distinguishes this from all the others,\" he says.",
              "\"It's kind of a combination.\"",
              "Yet not all the scientists and outside experts agree that Dragon Man is a separate speciesa\u0302\u0080\u0094nor do they agree about its relative position on the hominin family tree.",
              "Many of the skull's defining characteristics seem to be matters of scale rather than distinct features, says Buck, of Liverpool John Moores University.",
              "Even within a species, she says, some variation is expected.",
              "Differences in sex, age of the individual, regional adaptations, age of the fossil, and more can all drive slight individual changes.",
              "If not its own species, what was the Dragon Man?",
              "Stringer points to a similar mix of modern and more ancient traits in a fossil called the Dali cranium, which the new study categorised in the same group as the Harbin skull.",
              "Found in Shaanxi Province in Northwest China, this skull is considered its own species, Homo daliensis.",
              "\"There is already a bit of an inflation of species names in anthropology,\" adds Bence Viola, a palaeoanthropologist at the University of Toronto, who was not part of the study team.",
              "He thinks ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s preferable to group the skull with H.",
              "daliensis, or leave the species unnamed, rather than coining a new species moniker.",
              "Then there are the mysterious Denisovans.",
              "Though not formally recognised as its own species, this group likely inhabited Asia for tens of thousands of years, and many Asian fossils have been suggested as members.",
              "But because scientists have found only meagre fossil traces of their existence, genetic confirmation is necessarya\u0302\u0080\u0094and DNA preservation becomes increasingly unlikely with older fossils.",
              "In 2019, scientists announced the discovery of a fractured jaw on the Tibetan Plateau that likely came from a Denisovan, which would make the bone the first fossil of these ancient humans found outside the cave that gives the group its name.",
              "The newly proposed phylogenetic tree suggests the Dragon Man is most closely related to this jaw, called the Xiahe mandible.",
              "\"They probably belong to the same species,\" Ni says.",
              "But he's hesitant to call the jaw (and thus the Dragon Man) Denisovan, since the fractured mandible's identity came by way of proteins extracted from the jaw and DNA extracted from sediments, not directly from the mandible's DNA.",
              "The Harbin skull also lacks a jaw for physical comparison.",
              "Viola, who was on the team that first described the Denisovans, disagrees, noting that Denisovan identity is most logical for the Xiahe mandible.",
              "But he points out that even if the Dragon Man was Denisovan, the new analysis places the branch of the tree that includes both the Harbin skull and the Xiahe mandible apart from the Neanderthals.",
              "That would be odd, since such a grouping conflicts with the story of the Denisovans laid out in past studies of their genetics.",
              "Those analyses suggest that the common ancestor of Neanderthals and Denisovans split from the predecessors of Homo sapiens some 600,000 years ago.",
              "That ancestor then split into two groups, with Neanderthals fanning out through Europe and the Middle East and Denisovans moving into Asia.",
              "The relationships between all these groups are \"bound to be close and difficult to resolve,\" palaeoanthropologist Katerina Harvati, who was not part of the research, says via email.",
              "\"I think probably this is something that will need to be worked out more closely once there is more evidence,\" says Harvati, of Eberhard Karls University of TA\u03031\u20444bingen.",
              "More evidence may be on the horizon.",
              "The team involved in the new papers is exploring the possibility of genetic analyses for the Dragon Man, Ni says.",
              "But they are proceeding with caution because such work requires destroying small samples of the fossil.",
              "Regardless of whether Dragon Man is a new species, its stunningly preserved features are a reminder that nature rarely paints inside the lines, and that categorisation will only get more complex as new discoveries emerge.",
              "\"What you consider a species is really this philosophical question rather than this biological truth,\" Buck says.",
              "Species definitions can be useful, she says, but \"for me, the more interesting questions are .",

              ".",

              "Here, too, the Dragon Man offers enticing possibilities.",
              "The exact location where the worker pulled it from the mud remains unknown, but the proposed region is extremely far north, says Michael Petraglia, a palaeoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, who was not part of the research.",
              "Even in today's relatively balmy conditions, the wintertime temperatures in this area can plummet below minus 12 degrees Celsius;",
              "about 146,000 years ago, it probably wasna\u0302\u0080\u0099t much warmer.",
              "The team speculates that some of the skulla\u0302\u0080\u0099s robust traits reflect adaptations to a much colder climate.",
              "The environment may have also isolated the Dragon Man and its kin from other hominins, Petraglia says, which could have driven some of the distinctiveness seen in the fossil today.",
              "The team's full database and detailed images of the Dragon Man are now publicly available, Stringer says, so other researchers can plumb the hominina\u0302\u0080\u0099s depths themselves.",
