    "query": "What is the significance and meaning behind the intricate patterns and designs of Navajo rugs, and how have they been used as a form of storytelling and cultural expression throughout history?",
    "response": "Navajo rugs are a form of art and cultural expression that reflect the history and spirituality of the Navajo people. According to [^2^], Navajo rug weaving is a spiritual art form whose textile products have been traded since the 19th century. Navajo rug patterns include symbolic designs such as crosses, triangles, diamond patterns and other shapes that create the artistic and aesthetic beauty of Navajo rug designs.\n\nThe Navajo learned the art of weaving from their Pueblo Indian neighbors who had been growing and weaving cotton since about 800 AD[^2^]. They also adopted wool from the Spanish settlers who brought their Churro sheep to the region in the early 1600s[^2^]. Navajo rug weaving went through several phases of development, influenced by trade, captivity, revival and modernization[^3^].\n\nThe patterns and designs of Navajo rugs often have meanings that relate to nature, spirituality and harmony. For example, triangles and diamonds are often used to represent the mountains that make up the four corners of the Navajo homeland[^3^]. Crosses can symbolize stars or spider webs, which are associated with Spider Woman, a deity who taught the Navajo how to weave[^4^]. The colors used in Navajo rugs typically vary from shades of red to green to black, and are derived from natural dyes[^4^].\n\nNavajo rugs are also a form of storytelling, as they convey the weaver's personal vision and experience. According to [^5^], Navajo rug designs are often visualized early in the process of weaving, and display reflection symmetry and four-fold symmetry. These geometric patterns can also represent abstract concepts such as balance, harmony and beauty[^5^]. Navajo rugs are not only functional items, but also expressions of identity and creativity.",

              "[19] Hand-spun wool from these animals was the main source of yarn for Navajo blankets until the 1860s, when the United States government forced the Navajo people to relocate at Bosque Redondo and seized their livestock.",
              "Before their removal, the early weaving practice was such that unprocessed wool was chiefly used to make blankets and which still retained its lanolin and suint (sweat), and which could repel water, on the one hand, but which left an unpleasant odor to the finished woolen product, on the other.",

              "The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning.",
              "Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult.",
              "The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively.",
              "From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.",
              "[24] In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior created the Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory to address the problems Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy.",
              "Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat.",
              "The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool.",

              "[26] Indigo dye was obtained through trade and purchased in lumps.",

              "Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects.",
              "Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally.",
              "Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England on its way to the Navajo.",

              "The Navajo obtained black dye through pin\u0303on pitch and ashes.",
              "[28] After railroad service began in the early 1880s, aniline dyes became available in bright shades of red, orange, green, purple, and yellow.",
              "Gaudy \"eyedazzler\" weaves dominated the final years of the 19th century.",
              "[29] Navajo weaving aesthetics underwent rapid change as artisans experimented with the new palette and a new clientele entered the region whose tastes differed from earlier purchasers.",
              "During the later years of the 19th century, the Navajo continued to produce earlier styles for traditional customers while they adopted new techniques for a second market.",
              "[30] Traditional Navajo weaving used upright looms with no moving parts.",

              "steel pipe is more common today.",
              "The artisan sits on the floor during weaving and wraps the finished portion of fabric underneath the loom as it grows.",

              "The size greatly determines the amount of time spent weaving a rug.",
              "[31] The ratio of weft to warp threads had a fine count before the Bosque Redondo internment and declined in the following decades, then rose somewhat to a midrange ratio of five to one for the period 1920\u20131940.",

              "According to one aspect of this tradition, a spiritual being called \"Spider Woman\" instructed the women of the Navajo how to build the first loom from exotic materials including sky, earth, sunrays, rock crystal, and sheet lightning.",
              "Then \"Spider Woman\" taught the Navajo how to weave on it.",

              "Navajo weaving (Navajo: diyogi\u0301) are textiles produced by Navajo people, who are based near the Four Corners area of the United States.",
              "Navajo textiles are highly regarded and have been sought after as trade items for more than 150 years.",
              "Commercial production of handwoven blankets and rugs has been an important element of the Navajo economy.",
              "As one art historian wrote, \"Classic Navajo serapes at their finest equal the delicacy and sophistication of any pre-mechanical loom-woven textile in the world.\"",
              "[1] Navajo textiles were originally utilitarian weavings, including cloaks, dresses, saddle blankets, and similar items. By the mid-19th century, Navajo wearing blankets were trade items prized by Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains and neighboring tribes.",
              "Toward the end of the 19th century, Navajo weavers began to make rugs for non-Native tourists and for export.",
              "Earlier Navajo textiles have strong geometric patterns.",
              "They are a flat tapestry-woven textile produced in a fashion similar to kilims of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, but with some notable differences.",
              "In Navajo weaving, the slit weave technique common in kilims is not used, and the warp is one continuous length of yarn, not extending beyond the weaving as fringe.",
              "Traders from the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged adoption of some kilim motifs into Navajo designs.",
              "Textiles with representational imagery are called pictorial.",
              "Today, Navajo weavers work in a wide range of styles from geometric abstraction and representationalism to biomorphic abstraction and use a range of natural undyed sheep wool, natural dyes, and commercial dyes.",
              "Originally, Navajo blankets were used in a wide variety of garments, including (but not limited to) dresses, saddle blankets, serapes, night covers, or as a \u201cdoor\u201d at the entrance of their homes.",
              "[2] The Navajo may have learned to weave from their Pueblo Indian neighbors when they moved into the Four Corners region possibly around AD 1000 to 1200.",
              "[3] Some experts contend that the Navajo were not weavers until after the 17th century.",
              "[4] The Navajo obtained cotton through local trade routes before the arrival of the Spanish, after which time they began to use wool.",
              "The Pueblo and Navajo were not generally on friendly terms due to frequent Navajo raids on Pueblo settlements, yet many Pueblo sought refuge with their Navajo neighbors in the late 17th century to evade the conquistadors in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt.",
              "This social interchange is the probable origin of the distinctive Navajo weaving tradition.",
              "[5] Spanish records show that Navajo people began to herd sheep and weave wool blankets from that time onward.",
              "[4] The extent of Pueblo influence on Navajo weaving is uncertain.",
              "As Wolfgang Haberland notes, \"Prehistoric Puebloan textiles were much more elaborate than historic ones, as can be seen in the few remnants recovered archaeologically and in costumed figures in pre-contact kiva murals.\"",
              "Haberland suggests that the absence of surviving colonial-era Pueblo textile examples makes it impossible to do more than conjecture about whether the creative origins of Navajo weaving arose from Navajo culture or were borrowed from the neighboring people.",
              "[6][7] Written records establish the Navajo as fine weavers for at least the last 300 years, beginning with Spanish colonial descriptions of the early 18th century.",
              "By 1812, Pedro Pin\u0303o called the Navajo the best weavers in the province.",
              "Few remnants of 18th-century Navajo weaving survive;",
              "the most important surviving examples of early Navajo weaving come from Massacre Cave at Canyon de Chelly, Arizona.",
              "In 1804, a group of Navajo were shot and killed there, where they were seeking refuge from Spanish soldiers.",
              "For a hundred years the cave remained untouched due to Navajo taboos until local trader Sam Day entered it and retrieved the textiles.",
              "Day separated the collection and sold it to various museums. The majority of Massacre Cave blankets feature plain stripes, but some exhibit the terraces and diamonds characteristic of later Navajo weaving.",
              "[8] Commerce expanded after the Santa Fe Trail opened in 1822, and greater numbers of examples survive.",
              "Until 1880, all such textiles were blankets as opposed to rugs.",
              "In 1850, these highly prized trade items sold for $50 in gold, a huge sum at that time.",
              "[9] Railroad service reached Navajo lands in the early 1880s and resulted in considerable expansion of the market for Navajo woven goods.",
              "According to Kathy M'Closkey of the University of Windsor in Ontario, Canada, \"wool production more than doubled between 1890 and 1910, yet textile production escalated more than 800%\".",
              "[10] Purchases of manufactured yarn compensated for the deficit in wool production.",
              "[11] Federal government reports affirmed that this weaving, which was performed almost exclusively by women, was the most profitable Navajo industry during that era.",
              "[12] Quality declined in some regards as the weavers attempted to keep up with demand.",
              "[13] However, today the average price of a rug is about $8,000.",

              "Moore, who settled in the Chuska Mountains in 1897 attempted to improve the quality of textiles he traded.",
              "He attempted to regulate the cleaning and dyeing process of artisans who did business with him, and shipped wool intended for higher grade weaving outside the region for factory cleaning.",
              "He limited the range of dyes in textiles he traded and refused to deal fabric that had included certain commercially produced yarns.",
              "Moore's catalogs identified individual textile pieces rather than illustrating representative styles.",
              "He appears to have been instrumental in introducing new motifs to Navajo weaving.",
              "Carpets from the Caucasus region were popular among Anglo-Americans at that time.",
              "Both the Navajo and the Caucasus weavers worked under similar conditions and in similar styles, so it was relatively simple for them to incorporate Caucasus patterns such as an octagonal motif known as a gul.",
              "[14] Traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and rugs into distinct styles.",
              "They included \"Two Gray Hills\" (credited to George Bloomfield,[15] Ed Davies, and local Navajo weavers, are predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns), \"Teec Nos Pos\" (colorful, with very extensive patterns), \"Ganado\" (founded by John Lorenzo Hubbell), red dominated patterns with black and white, \"Crystal\" (founded by J.",

              "Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought by Professor Gary Witherspoon to embody traditional ideas about harmony or Hozh.",
              "Large numbers of Navajo continue to weave commercially.",
              "Contemporary weavers are more likely to learn the craft from a Dine College course, as opposed to family.",
              "[16] Contemporary Navajo textiles have suffered commercially from two sets of pressures: extensive investment in pre-1950 examples and price competition from foreign imitations.",
              "[17] Modern Navajo rugs command high prices.",
              "[18] In the late 17th century, the Navajo acquired the Iberian Churra, a breed of sheep, from Spanish explorers.",
              "[19] These animals were developed into a unique breed by the Navajo, today called the Navajo-Churro.",
              "These sheep were well-suited to the climate in Navajo lands, and that produced a useful long-staple wool.",
              "[19] Hand-spun wool from these animals was the main source of yarn for Navajo blankets until the 1860s, when the United States government forced the Navajo people to relocate at Bosque Redondo and seized their livestock.",
              "Before their removal, the early weaving practice was such that unprocessed wool was chiefly used to make blankets and which still retained its lanolin and suint (sweat), and which could repel water, on the one hand, but which left an unpleasant odor to the finished woolen product, on the other.",
              "[20] The 1869 peace treaty that allowed the Navajo to return to their traditional lands included a $30,000 settlement to replace their livestock.",
              "The tribe purchased 14,000 sheep and 1,000 goats.",
              "[21] Between 1870 and 1900, commercially processed, pre-dyed woolen goods were introduced to the Navajo, which they incorporated in their weaving.",
              "[22] Mid-19th century Navajo rugs often used a three-ply yarn called Saxony, which refers to high-quality, naturally dyed, silky yarns.",
              "Red tones in Navajo rugs of this period come either from Saxony or from a raveled cloth known in Spanish as bayeta, which was a woolen manufactured in England.",
              "With the arrival of the railroad in the early 1880s, another machine-produced yarn came into use in Navajo weaving: four-ply aniline dyed yarn known as Germantown because the yarn was manufactured in Pennsylvania.",
              "[23] Among the locally produced yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870 to 1890 caused a steady decline in wool quality.",
              "Increasing proportions of brittle kemp can be found in well-preserved examples from the period.",
              "In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population.",
              "The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces.",
              "The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning.",
              "Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult.",
              "The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively.",
              "From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.",
              "[24] In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior created the Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory to address the problems Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy.",
              "Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat.",
              "The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool.",
              "Offspring of these experiments were distributed among the Navajo people.",
              "World War II interrupted the greater part of this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.",
              "[25] Prior to the mid-19th century, Navajo weaving coloration was mostly natural brown, white, and indigo.",
              "[26] Indigo dye was obtained through trade and purchased in lumps.",
              "[27] By the middle of the century, the palette had expanded to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation.",
              "Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects.",
              "Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally.",
              "Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England on its way to the Navajo.",
              "Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles.",
              "The Navajo obtained black dye through pin\u0303on pitch and ashes.",
              "[28] After railroad service began in the early 1880s, aniline dyes became available in bright shades of red, orange, green, purple, and yellow.",
              "Gaudy \"eyedazzler\" weaves dominated the final years of the 19th century.",
              "[29] Navajo weaving aesthetics underwent rapid change as artisans experimented with the new palette and a new clientele entered the region whose tastes differed from earlier purchasers.",
              "During the later years of the 19th century, the Navajo continued to produce earlier styles for traditional customers while they adopted new techniques for a second market.",
              "[30] Traditional Navajo weaving used upright looms with no moving parts.",
              "Support poles were traditionally constructed of wood;",
              "steel pipe is more common today.",
              "The artisan sits on the floor during weaving and wraps the finished portion of fabric underneath the loom as it grows.",
              "The average weaver takes anywhere from two months to many years to finish a single rug.",
              "The size greatly determines the amount of time spent weaving a rug.",
              "[31] The ratio of weft to warp threads had a fine count before the Bosque Redondo internment and declined in the following decades, then rose somewhat to a midrange ratio of five to one for the period 1920\u20131940.",
              "19th-century warps were colored handspun wool or cotton string, then switched to white handspun wool in the early decades of the 20th century.",
              "[32] Weaving plays a role in the creation myth of Navajo cosmology, which articulates social relationships and continues to play a role in Navajo culture.",
              "According to one aspect of this tradition, a spiritual being called \"Spider Woman\" instructed the women of the Navajo how to build the first loom from exotic materials including sky, earth, sunrays, rock crystal, and sheet lightning.",
              "Then \"Spider Woman\" taught the Navajo how to weave on it.",
              "[17] Because of this belief traditionally there will be a \u201cmistake\u201c somewhere within the pattern.",
              "It is said to prevent the weaver from becoming lost in spider woman's web or pattern.",
              "Use of traditional motifs sometimes leads to the mistaken notion that these textiles serve a purpose in Navajo religion.",
              "Actually these items have no use as prayer rugs or any other ceremonial function, and controversy has existed among the Navajo about the appropriateness of including religious symbolism in items designed for commercial sale.",
              "The financial success of purported ceremonial rugs led to their continued production.",
              "[33] Many of these patterns are handed down from one weaver to the next generation of weavers who live within the same area.",
              "Because of this tradition older rugs can be traced back to a geographic location where it was produced.",
              "Until recently, anthropologists have dominated the study of Navajo textiles.",
              "Most historic examples of these works belong to ethnological collections rather than fine art collections, which means items have been exhibited and analyzed with an eye toward normative or average works rather than emphasizing technical or artistic excellence.",
              "These priorities have artificially inflated the market value for items of inferior craftsmanship.",

              "They retreated deep into the high deserts and canyons.",
              "From these strong points, they began raiding Spanish and Pueblo livestock.",
              "By this time the Navajo were already accomplished weavers, having learned this skill from the Pueblo Indians.",
              "It was a simple transition to start weaving with the wool of the purloined Spanish sheep instead of cotton, like the Pueblos.",
              "The belt loom and, later, small vertical looms were transportable, lending themselves to this mobile existence.",
              "Naturally, this caused changes in the Navajo\u2019s weaving styles.",

              "Heavier pieces, more suitable for rugs, probably date from 1890 to the present.",
              "Rugs of this later period, regardless of pattern, are rarely considered examples of the Classic Period.",

              "Until 1890, most weavers created wearing blankets.",
              "However, once the Pendleton Woolen Mills introduced their product, this need ended.",
              "The Pendleton (still used today) was lighter, warmer, every bit as colorful, and much less expensive.",

              "Navajo textiles are highly regarded and have been sought after as trade items for more than 150 years.",
              "Commercial production of handwoven blankets and rugs has been an important element of the Navajo economy.",
              "As one art historian wrote, \"Classic Navajo serapes at their finest equal the delicacy and sophistication of any pre-mechanical loom-woven textile in the world.\"",
              "[1] Navajo textiles were originally utilitarian weavings, including cloaks, dresses, saddle blankets, and similar items. By the mid-19th century, Navajo wearing blankets were trade items prized by Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains and neighboring tribes.",
              "Toward the end of the 19th century, Navajo weavers began to make rugs for non-Native tourists and for export.",
              "Earlier Navajo textiles have strong geometric patterns.",
              "They are a flat tapestry-woven textile produced in a fashion similar to kilims of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, but with some notable differences.",
              "In Navajo weaving, the slit weave technique common in kilims is not used, and the warp is one continuous length of yarn, not extending beyond the weaving as fringe.",
              "Traders from the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged adoption of some kilim motifs into Navajo designs.",
              "Textiles with representational imagery are called pictorial.",
              "Today, Navajo weavers work in a wide range of styles from geometric abstraction and representationalism to biomorphic abstraction and use a range of natural undyed sheep wool, natural dyes, and commercial dyes.",
              "Originally, Navajo blankets were used in a wide variety of garments, including (but not limited to) dresses, saddle blankets, serapes, night covers, or as a \u201cdoor\u201d at the entrance of their homes.",
              "[2] The Navajo may have learned to weave from their Pueblo Indian neighbors when they moved into the Four Corners region possibly around AD 1000 to 1200.",
              "[3] Some experts contend that the Navajo were not weavers until after the 17th century.",
              "[4] The Navajo obtained cotton through local trade routes before the arrival of the Spanish, after which time they began to use wool.",
              "The Pueblo and Navajo were not generally on friendly terms due to frequent Navajo raids on Pueblo settlements, yet many Pueblo sought refuge with their Navajo neighbors in the late 17th century to evade the conquistadors in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt.",
              "This social interchange is the probable origin of the distinctive Navajo weaving tradition.",
              "[5] Spanish records show that Navajo people began to herd sheep and weave wool blankets from that time onward.",
              "[4] The extent of Pueblo influence on Navajo weaving is uncertain.",

              "[8] Commerce expanded after the Santa Fe Trail opened in 1822, and greater numbers of examples survive.",
              "Until 1880, all such textiles were blankets as opposed to rugs.",
              "In 1850, these highly prized trade items sold for $50 in gold, a huge sum at that time.",
              "[9] Railroad service reached Navajo lands in the early 1880s and resulted in considerable expansion of the market for Navajo woven goods.",
              "According to Kathy M'Closkey of the University of Windsor in Ontario, Canada, \"wool production more than doubled between 1890 and 1910, yet textile production escalated more than 800%\".",

              "Another trader named John B.",
              "Moore, who settled in the Chuska Mountains in 1897 attempted to improve the quality of textiles he traded.",
              "He attempted to regulate the cleaning and dyeing process of artisans who did business with him, and shipped wool intended for higher grade weaving outside the region for factory cleaning.",
              "He limited the range of dyes in textiles he traded and refused to deal fabric that had included certain commercially produced yarns.",
              "Moore's catalogs identified individual textile pieces rather than illustrating representative styles.",
              "He appears to have been instrumental in introducing new motifs to Navajo weaving.",
              "Carpets from the Caucasus region were popular among Anglo-Americans at that time.",
              "Both the Navajo and the Caucasus weavers worked under similar conditions and in similar styles, so it was relatively simple for them to incorporate Caucasus patterns such as an octagonal motif known as a gul.",
              "[14] Traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and rugs into distinct styles.",
              "They included \"Two Gray Hills\" (credited to George Bloomfield,[15] Ed Davies, and local Navajo weavers, are predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns), \"Teec Nos Pos\" (colorful, with very extensive patterns), \"Ganado\" (founded by John Lorenzo Hubbell), red dominated patterns with black and white, \"Crystal\" (founded by J.",

              "Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought by Professor Gary Witherspoon to embody traditional ideas about harmony or Hozh.",
              "Large numbers of Navajo continue to weave commercially.",
              "Contemporary weavers are more likely to learn the craft from a Dine College course, as opposed to family.",
              "[16] Contemporary Navajo textiles have suffered commercially from two sets of pressures: extensive investment in pre-1950 examples and price competition from foreign imitations.",
              "[17] Modern Navajo rugs command high prices.",
              "[18] In the late 17th century, the Navajo acquired the Iberian Churra, a breed of sheep, from Spanish explorers.",
              "[19] These animals were developed into a unique breed by the Navajo, today called the Navajo-Churro.",
              "These sheep were well-suited to the climate in Navajo lands, and that produced a useful long-staple wool.",
              "[19] Hand-spun wool from these animals was the main source of yarn for Navajo blankets until the 1860s, when the United States government forced the Navajo people to relocate at Bosque Redondo and seized their livestock.",
              "Before their removal, the early weaving practice was such that unprocessed wool was chiefly used to make blankets and which still retained its lanolin and suint (sweat), and which could repel water, on the one hand, but which left an unpleasant odor to the finished woolen product, on the other.",
              "[20] The 1869 peace treaty that allowed the Navajo to return to their traditional lands included a $30,000 settlement to replace their livestock.",
              "The tribe purchased 14,000 sheep and 1,000 goats.",
              "[21] Between 1870 and 1900, commercially processed, pre-dyed woolen goods were introduced to the Navajo, which they incorporated in their weaving.",
              "[22] Mid-19th century Navajo rugs often used a three-ply yarn called Saxony, which refers to high-quality, naturally dyed, silky yarns.",
              "Red tones in Navajo rugs of this period come either from Saxony or from a raveled cloth known in Spanish as bayeta, which was a woolen manufactured in England.",
              "With the arrival of the railroad in the early 1880s, another machine-produced yarn came into use in Navajo weaving: four-ply aniline dyed yarn known as Germantown because the yarn was manufactured in Pennsylvania.",
              "[23] Among the locally produced yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870 to 1890 caused a steady decline in wool quality.",
              "Increasing proportions of brittle kemp can be found in well-preserved examples from the period.",
              "In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population.",
              "The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces.",
              "The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning.",
              "Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult.",
              "The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively.",
              "From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.",
              "[24] In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior created the Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory to address the problems Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy.",
              "Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat.",
              "The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool.",
              "Offspring of these experiments were distributed among the Navajo people.",
              "World War II interrupted the greater part of this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.",
              "[25] Prior to the mid-19th century, Navajo weaving coloration was mostly natural brown, white, and indigo.",
              "[26] Indigo dye was obtained through trade and purchased in lumps.",
              "[27] By the middle of the century, the palette had expanded to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation.",
              "Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects.",
              "Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally.",
              "Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England on its way to the Navajo.",
              "Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles.",
              "The Navajo obtained black dye through pin\u0303on pitch and ashes.",
              "[28] After railroad service began in the early 1880s, aniline dyes became available in bright shades of red, orange, green, purple, and yellow.",
              "Gaudy \"eyedazzler\" weaves dominated the final years of the 19th century.",
              "[29] Navajo weaving aesthetics underwent rapid change as artisans experimented with the new palette and a new clientele entered the region whose tastes differed from earlier purchasers.",
              "During the later years of the 19th century, the Navajo continued to produce earlier styles for traditional customers while they adopted new techniques for a second market.",
              "[30] Traditional Navajo weaving used upright looms with no moving parts.",
              "Support poles were traditionally constructed of wood;",
              "steel pipe is more common today.",
              "The artisan sits on the floor during weaving and wraps the finished portion of fabric underneath the loom as it grows.",
              "The average weaver takes anywhere from two months to many years to finish a single rug.",
              "The size greatly determines the amount of time spent weaving a rug.",
              "[31] The ratio of weft to warp threads had a fine count before the Bosque Redondo internment and declined in the following decades, then rose somewhat to a midrange ratio of five to one for the period 1920\u20131940.",
              "19th-century warps were colored handspun wool or cotton string, then switched to white handspun wool in the early decades of the 20th century.",
              "[32] Weaving plays a role in the creation myth of Navajo cosmology, which articulates social relationships and continues to play a role in Navajo culture.",
              "According to one aspect of this tradition, a spiritual being called \"Spider Woman\" instructed the women of the Navajo how to build the first loom from exotic materials including sky, earth, sunrays, rock crystal, and sheet lightning.",
              "Then \"Spider Woman\" taught the Navajo how to weave on it.",
              "[17] Because of this belief traditionally there will be a \u201cmistake\u201c somewhere within the pattern.",
              "It is said to prevent the weaver from becoming lost in spider woman's web or pattern.",
              "Use of traditional motifs sometimes leads to the mistaken notion that these textiles serve a purpose in Navajo religion.",
              "Actually these items have no use as prayer rugs or any other ceremonial function, and controversy has existed among the Navajo about the appropriateness of including religious symbolism in items designed for commercial sale.",
              "The financial success of purported ceremonial rugs led to their continued production.",
              "[33] Many of these patterns are handed down from one weaver to the next generation of weavers who live within the same area.",
              "Because of this tradition older rugs can be traced back to a geographic location where it was produced.",
              "Until recently, anthropologists have dominated the study of Navajo textiles.",
              "Most historic examples of these works belong to ethnological collections rather than fine art collections, which means items have been exhibited and analyzed with an eye toward normative or average works rather than emphasizing technical or artistic excellence.",

              "The Navajo, unwilling to be subjected to outside domination, simply reverted to their original, nomadic way of life.",
              "They retreated deep into the high deserts and canyons.",
              "From these strong points, they began raiding Spanish and Pueblo livestock.",
              "By this time the Navajo were already accomplished weavers, having learned this skill from the Pueblo Indians.",
              "It was a simple transition to start weaving with the wool of the purloined Spanish sheep instead of cotton, like the Pueblos.",
              "The belt loom and, later, small vertical looms were transportable, lending themselves to this mobile existence.",
              "Naturally, this caused changes in the Navajo\u2019s weaving styles.",

              "Life-cycle symbols manifest primarily as small animals or plants that represent certain stages in a person\u2019s journey as they move through different phases of their life.",
              "The interpretation of life-cycle symbols varies from culture to culture and even from one family group to another within a single tribe.",
              "It is up for debate whether the meanings are more personal or collective.",
              "Proponents of the former argue that each family has its customs surrounding life events such as births and marriages, so having individualized symbols fits that narrative well;",
              "advocates for the latter assert that within a given tribe, there will still be strong normative observance of life\u2019s stages, so it makes sense for the symbols to be shared across individuals and families.",
              "In either case, the implications are clear: capturing the passage of life on a physical object such as a rug is an incredibly meaningful act.",
              "These rugs can serve both as tangible repositories of familial memories and connecting pieces between generations.",
              "As ancestral lineages strengthen with each generation via interwoven life-cycle messages in the rug design, so too do new identities take shape through these powerful symbolic mementos.",
              "As a manifestation of permanent memories forged between generations, these weavings become windows into past lives that have left indelible marks on subsequent generations.",
              "With this in mind, let us proceed to discuss another aspect integral to Native American Rug Weaving \u2013 ceremonial symbols.",
              "Moving on from life-cycle symbols, it is important to recognize the considerable significance of ceremonial symbols that appear in Native American rug weaving.",
              "From ritualistic items that denote Indian heritage to representations of deeds completed during special occasions or acts of bravery, the weaving art develops an intricate pattern that preserves a story throughout the generations.",
              "This can include sun patterns, which have been integral across different tribes as they depict thoughts of sovereignty and strength through bright and intense motifs.",
              "Furthermore, there are instances of religious figures being portrayed on rugs as a way to venerate and celebrate them more properly.",
              "Significant battles may be memorialized as well, indicating pride in a lineage\u2019s past as many tribes look to build up security for the future.",
              "Similar to life-cycle signs, ceremonial symbols hold a crucial part of the spiritual identity of Indian cultures.",
              "While there is much debate over the origins and purposes of such signs\u2013particularly as to whether they highlight individual heroic actions or pay homage to collective valor\u2013the results offer an intriguing insight into their cultures through artwork and artifacts.",
              "The intricate patterns and complex designs can tell us a lot about how their stories were transmitted and shared amongst various clans.",
              "With this understanding, we must move to explore more specifically how individual designs can come together to create something greater than just the sum of its parts: symbol designs and patterns.",
              "Once the ceremonial symbols of native rug weaving have been discussed, it is time to take a closer look at the different symbols designs, and patterns that are used by weavers to further express their personal and cultural beliefs.",
              "As well as being aesthetically pleasing, native rug weaving is often used to attempt to capture and tell tales of life, stories, constructions, reconstructions, and memories.",
              "To achieve this, Weavers use a range of colors and stitches that add texture and depth to the rug design.",
              "Those colors may be used in combination with motifs such as diamonds and zigzags that also provide meaning within the design.",
              "It has been argued by some scholars that these motifs often represent traditional cosmological beliefs held by many Native American cultures including cardinal directions, migrations, or spiritual affiliations.",
              "On the other hand, some suggest that it is more likely that motifs were inspired by modern designs or furniture decorations during certain periods when weavers had access to milled fabrics and rugs from trading posts.",
              "In this case, it could be argued that some symbols were taken from tradable items already in circulation but may have retained symbolic importance depending on their color or pattern choice.",
              "While there continues to be debate about the exact origin of all patterns and symbols used for native weaving designs, one thing is certain \u2013 all these designs can work together in unique ways, creating tapestries loaded with meanings from both past and present, contributing immensely towards the vibrancy of these wonderful works of art.",
              "This becomes even more apparent when considering another integral part of native rug weaving: The animal motifs which will be discussed next.",
              "Animal motifs are a key symbol in many Native American rug weavings, with animals representing gods and spiritual powers that have significance to the tribe.",
              "The use of animal images and symbols in weaving those spiritual aspects into weavings can be found in numerous traditional designs from all across Native America.",
              "Evidence suggests that the use of animals was meant to invoke the power and protection of certain creatures, including eagles, buffalos, jaguars, deer, and many more.",
              "These powerful beasts were believed to carry special spiritual powers and serve as protectors for the individual tribes.",
              "In some cases, an animal would represent an entire clan or group of people, with that image being used either directly or indirectly to signify their heritage.",
              "Other tribes may have used the creature as a representation of a powerful deity who brought them luck or strength during times of adversity.",
              "Though there are countless examples of spiritual symbolism in Native American rug weavings featuring animals, they continue to delight and amaze viewers today.",
              "Whether it is in design or aesthetic appeal, these animal motifs are incredibly unique and beautifully crafted representations of the rich cultural history of Native American artistry.",
              "Through further exploration and research into the art of Native American rug weaving, we will uncover more about the sophisticated nature of these animal motifs and the deeper meanings behind them.",
              "With this understanding, we gain insight into the wonderfully dynamic world of Indigenous Symbolism.",
              "The art of indigenous symbolism is an important part of exploring and interpreting the history, culture, and beliefs of Native American rug weaving.",
              "It serves as a lens through which to glean a deep understanding of the weavers\u2019 lifeways and expressiveness.",
              "Symbols help to convey messages, tell stories, evoke emotion, and serve as aesthetic embellishments in rugs.",
              "Some experts argue that the symbols used in these rugs are rooted in the spiritual realm of the weaver\u2019s tribal traditions.",
              "By understanding the symbols and their context, it can be possible to communicate with the ancestors and expand one\u2019s knowledge of a particular tribe\u2019s practice.",
              "For example, Navajo weavers typically incorporate geometric designs into their pieces that reflect Hopi iconography and potentially other ancestral elements as well.",
              "The placement of symbols and design elements often tells stories or speaks to personal or communal identity.",
              "Other scholars argue that while some symbols may draw on traditional meanings they are being recreated or reimagined by contemporary weavers in subtle ways.",
              "This process allows the artist to create hybrid symbolism that reflects aspects from both traditions as well as modern contexts.",
              "These innovations feature personally meaningful content such as self-portraits or autobiographical stories that push against predetermined notions about tribal identity.",
              "Whether a weaver\u2019s work draws on traditional symbolisms or incorporates more modern elements, what remains consistent is the appreciation for vibrant colors and intricate patterns, which help establish a deep connection between artistry and heritage.",
              "Ultimately rug weaving evolves alongside its purpose: preserving past narratives within current contexts;",
              "these practices are vital for offering insight into this distinctive form of visual expression and indigenous identity.",
              "Native American rugs are typically hand-crafted and woven from natural fibers such as wool or cotton, with many of the designs incorporating traditional symbols and motifs.",
              "Wool has long been a popular material used in rug weaving amongst many Native American tribes, as it is both warm and resilient ideal for creating functional pieces which can be passed down through generations.",
              "Other materials used commonly used in creating native rugs include hemp, jute, and flax.",
              "Additionally, makers often add decorative elements such as feathers, fur, shells, beads, and quills to their weavings.",
              "The combination of these varied materials results in stunningly detailed and intricate works of art that provide deeper insight into the cultures they come from.",
              "Native American rug weaving is an ancient art form that has been used to communicate stories and beliefs for centuries.",
              "There are many symbols used in rug weaving, each of which has a unique meaning and purpose.",
              "For example, the swastika is a very common symbol found in Native American rugs.",
              "The swastika represents the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.",
              "Other popular symbols include eagle feathers (representing strength, protection, and honor), animals such as bears or wolves (symbolizing bravery and cunning), as well as geometric patterns (which represent various spiritual or cultural themes).",
              "By looking closely at the symbols found in Native American rug weavings, one can gain an insight into the culture, beliefs, and values of the people who created them.",
              "Yes, there are a few special techniques used in preparing the wool for weaving a rug.",
              "These techniques are usually passed down through generations, so they vary among different tribal cultures.",
              "For instance, many tribes would use vegetable dyes to color their wool before weaving it into a rug.",
              "They may also have practiced traditional felting processes like fulling or shrinking.",
              "Additionally, some tribes may have utilized special methods of spinning the wool fibers finer and stronger to make higher-quality rugs.",
              "Finally, certain tribes would rely on specific hand tools like shuttle needles and looms to prep the wool for weaving into a rug.",
              "These tools, combined with careful practice and skillful craftsmanship, were essential to ensure that the rugs reached their desired quality level and aesthetic appeal.",

              "Perhaps his most important innovation was to introduce weavers in his region to Oriental rug patterns.",
              "Rather than copying wholesale, the Navajo filtered the new patterns through their own cultural sensibilities and personal design preferences.",

              "It is generally defined as a central rectangle connected by zig-zag lines to smaller rectangles in each corner.",
              "The storm pattern often is said to have symbolic meaning: the zig-zags are lighting, the corner rectangles are the four sacred mountains of the Navajo or the four directions or the four winds, etc.",

              "Beginning in the 1920s, weavers and traders developed several new regional styles based on a revival of early banded patterns and the predominant use of vegetal dyes.",
              "The impetus behind this trend came primarily from Anglo collectors, traders, and government agencies that had a sincere desire to upgrade the quality of Navajo weaving and return to traditional, pre-rug patterns.",
              "The resulting rugs were not literal copies of older pieces, but were creative variations on banded designs using a wide palette of newly developed vegetal dye colors made from indigenous plants, as well as new, subtly colored chemical dyes.",

              "Small pictorial motifs such as feathers, arrows, animals and other common objects may have held some personal significance for the individual weaver.",
              "As the modern trappings of Anglo culture filtered onto the Reservation, strange new objects such as cattle, trains, American flags, and letters of the alphabet caught the fancy of some weavers.",
              "Pictorials made before the 1940s are relatively uncommon and usually command a premium price from collectors.",

              "Even though the rug design on the right is not necessarily typical, the fact that it resembles the cartesian grid on the left allows us to see how the position of any design element on a rug can be described according to a cartesian coordinate relative to the center of the rug, which is like the \"origin\" of a cartesian grid.",
              "Before creating the design, the weaver marks two places on the rug (usually using chalk): 1) By counting the weft strands and dividing by two, she finds the horizontal center of the rug.",

              "2) Using a loose strand of yarn, she determines the total height that the rug will be.",

              "This is the equivalent of finding Y = 0.",
              "Therefore, for the rug on the right, the center of the rug is defined where X = 0 (determined by weft count) and Y = 0 (determined by yarn length), which is the origin on a cartesian grid.",
              "While weaving, the weaver will often count the number of wefts in each design element to ensure that the rug to the right of the horizontal center is an exact reflection of the rug's left side.",
              "At the vertical center, the weaver often reflects the design across the X axis.",
              "This process of counting to keep track of where design elements are to be placed is crucial for making the rugs symmetrical in appearance."

              "[1] Navajo textiles were originally utilitarian weavings, including cloaks, dresses, saddle blankets, and similar items. By the mid-19th century, Navajo wearing blankets were trade items prized by Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains and neighboring tribes.",
              "Toward the end of the 19th century, Navajo weavers began to make rugs for non-Native tourists and for export.",
              "Earlier Navajo textiles have strong geometric patterns.",
              "They are a flat tapestry-woven textile produced in a fashion similar to kilims of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, but with some notable differences.",
              "In Navajo weaving, the slit weave technique common in kilims is not used, and the warp is one continuous length of yarn, not extending beyond the weaving as fringe.",

              "Textiles with representational imagery are called pictorial.",
              "Today, Navajo weavers work in a wide range of styles from geometric abstraction and representationalism to biomorphic abstraction and use a range of natural undyed sheep wool, natural dyes, and commercial dyes.",
              "Originally, Navajo blankets were used in a wide variety of garments, including (but not limited to) dresses, saddle blankets, serapes, night covers, or as a \u201cdoor\u201d at the entrance of their homes.",
              "[2] The Navajo may have learned to weave from their Pueblo Indian neighbors when they moved into the Four Corners region possibly around AD 1000 to 1200.",
              "[3] Some experts contend that the Navajo were not weavers until after the 17th century.",
              "[4] The Navajo obtained cotton through local trade routes before the arrival of the Spanish, after which time they began to use wool.",
              "The Pueblo and Navajo were not generally on friendly terms due to frequent Navajo raids on Pueblo settlements, yet many Pueblo sought refuge with their Navajo neighbors in the late 17th century to evade the conquistadors in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt.",
              "This social interchange is the probable origin of the distinctive Navajo weaving tradition.",
              "[5] Spanish records show that Navajo people began to herd sheep and weave wool blankets from that time onward.",
              "[4] The extent of Pueblo influence on Navajo weaving is uncertain.",
              "As Wolfgang Haberland notes, \"Prehistoric Puebloan textiles were much more elaborate than historic ones, as can be seen in the few remnants recovered archaeologically and in costumed figures in pre-contact kiva murals.\"",
              "Haberland suggests that the absence of surviving colonial-era Pueblo textile examples makes it impossible to do more than conjecture about whether the creative origins of Navajo weaving arose from Navajo culture or were borrowed from the neighboring people.",

              "Day separated the collection and sold it to various museums. The majority of Massacre Cave blankets feature plain stripes, but some exhibit the terraces and diamonds characteristic of later Navajo weaving.",
              "[8] Commerce expanded after the Santa Fe Trail opened in 1822, and greater numbers of examples survive.",
              "Until 1880, all such textiles were blankets as opposed to rugs.",
              "In 1850, these highly prized trade items sold for $50 in gold, a huge sum at that time.",
              "[9] Railroad service reached Navajo lands in the early 1880s and resulted in considerable expansion of the market for Navajo woven goods.",
              "According to Kathy M'Closkey of the University of Windsor in Ontario, Canada, \"wool production more than doubled between 1890 and 1910, yet textile production escalated more than 800%\".",
              "[10] Purchases of manufactured yarn compensated for the deficit in wool production.",
              "[11] Federal government reports affirmed that this weaving, which was performed almost exclusively by women, was the most profitable Navajo industry during that era.",
              "[12] Quality declined in some regards as the weavers attempted to keep up with demand.",
              "[13] However, today the average price of a rug is about $8,000.",

              "He attempted to regulate the cleaning and dyeing process of artisans who did business with him, and shipped wool intended for higher grade weaving outside the region for factory cleaning.",
              "He limited the range of dyes in textiles he traded and refused to deal fabric that had included certain commercially produced yarns.",
              "Moore's catalogs identified individual textile pieces rather than illustrating representative styles.",

              "Contemporary weavers are more likely to learn the craft from a Dine College course, as opposed to family.",
              "[16] Contemporary Navajo textiles have suffered commercially from two sets of pressures: extensive investment in pre-1950 examples and price competition from foreign imitations.",
              "[17] Modern Navajo rugs command high prices.",
              "[18] In the late 17th century, the Navajo acquired the Iberian Churra, a breed of sheep, from Spanish explorers.",
              "[19] These animals were developed into a unique breed by the Navajo, today called the Navajo-Churro.",
              "These sheep were well-suited to the climate in Navajo lands, and that produced a useful long-staple wool.",
              "[19] Hand-spun wool from these animals was the main source of yarn for Navajo blankets until the 1860s, when the United States government forced the Navajo people to relocate at Bosque Redondo and seized their livestock.",
              "Before their removal, the early weaving practice was such that unprocessed wool was chiefly used to make blankets and which still retained its lanolin and suint (sweat), and which could repel water, on the one hand, but which left an unpleasant odor to the finished woolen product, on the other.",
              "[20] The 1869 peace treaty that allowed the Navajo to return to their traditional lands included a $30,000 settlement to replace their livestock.",
              "The tribe purchased 14,000 sheep and 1,000 goats.",
              "[21] Between 1870 and 1900, commercially processed, pre-dyed woolen goods were introduced to the Navajo, which they incorporated in their weaving.",
              "[22] Mid-19th century Navajo rugs often used a three-ply yarn called Saxony, which refers to high-quality, naturally dyed, silky yarns.",
              "Red tones in Navajo rugs of this period come either from Saxony or from a raveled cloth known in Spanish as bayeta, which was a woolen manufactured in England.",
              "With the arrival of the railroad in the early 1880s, another machine-produced yarn came into use in Navajo weaving: four-ply aniline dyed yarn known as Germantown because the yarn was manufactured in Pennsylvania.",
              "[23] Among the locally produced yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870 to 1890 caused a steady decline in wool quality.",
              "Increasing proportions of brittle kemp can be found in well-preserved examples from the period.",
              "In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population.",
              "The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces.",
              "The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning.",
              "Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult.",
              "The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively.",
              "From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.",
              "[24] In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior created the Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory to address the problems Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy.",
              "Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat.",
              "The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool.",
              "Offspring of these experiments were distributed among the Navajo people.",
              "World War II interrupted the greater part of this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.",
              "[25] Prior to the mid-19th century, Navajo weaving coloration was mostly natural brown, white, and indigo.",
              "[26] Indigo dye was obtained through trade and purchased in lumps.",
              "[27] By the middle of the century, the palette had expanded to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation.",
              "Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects.",
              "Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally.",
              "Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England on its way to the Navajo.",
              "Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles.",
              "The Navajo obtained black dye through pin\u0303on pitch and ashes.",
              "[28] After railroad service began in the early 1880s, aniline dyes became available in bright shades of red, orange, green, purple, and yellow.",
              "Gaudy \"eyedazzler\" weaves dominated the final years of the 19th century.",
              "[29] Navajo weaving aesthetics underwent rapid change as artisans experimented with the new palette and a new clientele entered the region whose tastes differed from earlier purchasers.",
              "During the later years of the 19th century, the Navajo continued to produce earlier styles for traditional customers while they adopted new techniques for a second market.",
              "[30] Traditional Navajo weaving used upright looms with no moving parts.",
              "Support poles were traditionally constructed of wood;",

              "The artisan sits on the floor during weaving and wraps the finished portion of fabric underneath the loom as it grows.",

              "The size greatly determines the amount of time spent weaving a rug.",
              "[31] The ratio of weft to warp threads had a fine count before the Bosque Redondo internment and declined in the following decades, then rose somewhat to a midrange ratio of five to one for the period 1920\u20131940.",
