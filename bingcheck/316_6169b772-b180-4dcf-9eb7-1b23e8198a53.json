    "query": "What is the impact of social media algorithms on the formation and reinforcement of a person's political beliefs, and what can individuals do to ensure that they are exposed to diverse and accurate perspectives to avoid being trapped in a filter bubble?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. Social media algorithms are computer programs that use data about users' preferences, behavior, and network to personalize and rank the content they see on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. These algorithms can have an impact on the formation and reinforcement of a person's political beliefs by exposing them to information that confirms or challenges their existing views, or by filtering out information that contradicts or diversifies their views. [^1^] [^2^] [^3^]\n\nAccording to some studies and experts, social media algorithms can create a phenomenon called a **filter bubble**, which is a state of intellectual isolation that can result from personalized searches, where a website algorithm selectively curates what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past click-behavior, and search history. [^4^] [^5^] Being in a filter bubble means these algorithms have isolated you from information and perspectives you haven\u2019t already expressed an interest in, meaning you may miss out on important information. [^4^] This can lead to a limited and customized view of the world, and contribute to a lack of understanding and an unwillingness to consider opposing viewpoints and unfavorable information. [^4^] [^5^]\n\nSome critics argue that filter bubbles can harm democracy and well-being by making the effects of misinformation worse, polarizing public opinion, and undermining civic discourse. [^5^] [^6^] [^7^] However, some researchers and platforms contend that filter bubbles are not as prevalent or problematic as they are portrayed, and that users are still exposed to diverse and accurate perspectives through other sources and channels. [^8^] [^9^]\n\nOne way that individuals can ensure that they are exposed to diverse and accurate perspectives is to be aware of the existence and influence of social media algorithms and filter bubbles, and to actively seek out new sources and perspectives that challenge their own assumptions and biases. [^4^] [^10^] Another way is to use tools and settings that allow users to control or modify their personalization preferences, such as turning off personalized ads, clearing their browsing history, or following accounts that offer different viewpoints.   A third way is to use critical thinking skills and media literacy strategies to evaluate the credibility and quality of the information they encounter online, such as checking the source, date, evidence, and motive of the content.",

              "Absolutely no!",
              "Thankfully social media algorithms exist to make social media live up to your expectations and bring you the content you want to engage with.",
              "As a social media user, algorithms lighten up your social media experience.",
              "On the other hand, the same algorithm can bring you low visibility and no traction if you are a budding influencer or marketer with a handful of followers.",
              "Fortunately, you can cease your share of visibility on social media platforms. So, let us begin by understanding how algorithms work and what steps you can take to win over them.",
              "A social media algorithm is a complex set of rules and calculations used by social media platforms to prioritize the content that users see in their feeds.",
              "Users\u2019 past behavior, content relevance, and the popularity of posts are some of the vital algorithm factors taken into account by social media platforms. Social media algorithms determine which content will make it to your feed based on your behavior.",
              "The specific algorithm and its ranking factors can vary between social media platforms. But how do social media algorithms work?",
              "Let\u2019s start with a fun fact!",
              "No social media users see the same content on their feeds daily.",
              "But how do social media platforms ensure users view content especially tailored for them?",
              "The algorithms at play on all social media platforms keep your feeds interesting and engaging.",
              "In simple words, an algorithm is a sequence of instructions programmed to deliver content based on your past behavior and interaction on a social media platform.",
              "Relevancy is the key factor that impacts the algorithm.",
              "The more you interact with a particular type of content on social media, the more likely it is that the algorithm will show you similar content in your feeds.",
              "Based on relevancy, social media platforms decide how to rank content in user feeds.",
              "Apart from relevancy, social platforms place a strong emphasis on content from your friends, following, and connections.",
              "However, the algorithms also work the other way around and filter out noise.",
              "For example, if you have a connection or friend posting content you don\u2019t interact with, a social media algorithm will filter out all that content for you.",
              "Sponsored content, aka ads, are paid advertisements that target a specific set of audiences.",
              "Meta, Twitter, and all other social media platforms show sponsored content that reflects your taste and interest.",
              "In my case, the platform keeps me entertained with tech and software-related sponsored content.",
              "Why?",
              "Because I engage a lot with such type of content and the algorithm makes sure to keep my feeds true to my interest.",
              "Here is an example of the sponsored content from my feed.",
              "All social media platforms have their algorithm comprising various ranking signals.",
              "You can never determine all these ranking signals, but you can surely mold your content strategy to win your share of visibility on social media.",
              "Here are some platform-specific ranking signals to keep in mind for every social media platform.",
              "Facebook is the leading social media platform, with over 2.",
              "9 billion users worldwide.",
              "With that number, Facebook is a crucially important platform for brands and marketers to win the algorithm and reach a wider audience.",
              "So, here are some ranking signals to take into account while creating your marketing strategies: You can find more tips on the Facebook algorithms change blog.",
              "YouTube is capable of keeping its users hooked for hours, thanks to its ranking signals which are as follows: Herein is an example of how YouTube brings you videos related to your search term alongside the video you stream.",
              "YouTube algorithms rely on an AI-driven recommendation model that filters content to offer a personalized recommendation to every user.",
              "The prominent ranking signals considered by YouTube\u2019s algorithm include experience, expertise, trustworthiness, and authoritativeness.",
              "Not just that, YouTube constantly segregates authoritative and trustworthy content from misleading content and educates its users to spot misinformation at all levels.",
              "Check out our blog to learn more about Youtube\u2019s algorithm.",
              "The Instagram app is divided into three sections \u2013 feed, reels, and explore.",
              "Each section has its specific algorithm tailored to display personalized content for every user.",
              "The feed and stories section displays recent content from the accounts you follow and suggested content based on your past activity.",
              "That sounds pretty simple, right?",
              "So, where does the algorithm help in this?",
              "The Instagram algorithm plays a significant role here by ranking content based on various factors that, in turn, keep your feeds and stories interesting for you.",
              "These ranking factors include: Read our blog to learn more about how the Instagram algorithm works.",
              "The explore section helps the users to find new content.",
              "This content includes recommendations based on signals like what content you have viewed, liked, and commented on lately.",
              "For example, say I recently liked the reels of an Instagram creator called @XYZ.",
              "Instagram looks at all the other users who have liked the content of @XYZ.",
              "So, if a majority of users who liked content from creator @XYZ have also liked the content from creator @ABC, then the Explore page may show you content from @ABC the next time you use the app.",
              "Essentially, the Instagram algorithm shows content related to your interests without fully comprehending the content of each post.",
              "Instagram\u2019s Reels feature is designed to provide entertainment to its users.",
              "Similar to the Explore page, Reels shows content from accounts you don\u2019t follow.",
              "The algorithm sources Reels that it thinks you might like and orders them based on how interesting it believes they are to you.",
              "However, with Reels, the primary focus is on entertainment.",
              "Instagram surveys users to determine if they find a particular Reel funny or entertaining, using the feedback to improve its ability to predict what will entertain people.",
              "The algorithm also prioritizes smaller creators in its content selection process.",
              "The most crucial predictions that the algorithm makes are whether you are likely to watch a Reel in its entirety, like it, and visit the audio page (which serves as a proxy for whether you might be inspired to create your reel).",
              "Here is a quick read to learn more about the Instagram reels algorithm.",
              "Twitter uses several ranking signals to rank content on its platform.",
              "These ranking signals include: Just like all other social media platforms, LinkedIn\u2019s algorithm focuses on increasing engagement and prioritizing relevant content for its millions of users.",
              "Here are crucial LinkedIn ranking signals: Pinterest works a tad differently than other platforms in terms of algorithms and focuses on these major ranking signals: TikTok has its own set of ranking factors that places more emphasis on new content instead of whom you follow.",
              "Based on that, here are some important ranking signals for Tiktok: Based on this data, the platform analyzes your preferences and how they change with time.",
              "With this analysis, TikTok ranks videos for every individual user.",
              "With this information, it becomes easy to understand your preferred language for content, preferred category of content, etc.",
              "Unlike most other platforms, TikTok doesn\u2019t consider followers to be a ranking signal.",
              "Instead, TikTok\u2019s algorithm works to bring up new content that you may like regardless of who you follow.",
              "So, now we know the science of social media algorithms. The next step is to master the skill of leveraging the algorithm with your content strategies.",
              "Here is exactly how you can do it: Social media algorithms rely heavily on signals such as content relevance and quality.",
              "These signals are crucial because the algorithms aim to display content that users are likely to find interesting.",
              "Among all the ranking factors, content quality is the most prominent one for every platform.",
              "So the key to passing the quality test is to offer the content your audience wants.",
              "It can be entertaining, inspiring, or educating, depending on what your audience wants to view.",
              "For instance, if you are a popular fashion influencer on Instagram, then your audience would expect fashion inspiration and style guidance through your posts.",
              "If you run a DIY channel on YoutTube, your audience would expect you to share tips and tricks and easy hacks to do anything manually.",
              "The key is to ensure that the content is relevant to your audience.",
              "Also, make sure that the content you create matches the audience\u2019s expectations and drives engagement, as it is a major factor in determining content quality for all social media platforms. Here is an example of how an AI Architecture & Design platform, DesignMidjourney, does it for its Instagram profile.",
              "They not just focus on AI architecture and design but keep it utterly interesting to keep their followers engaged.",
              "Audience engagement is an important ranking factor for social media algorithms. So how do you get that?",
              "Of course, the key to attracting higher likes, shares, and comments is to create content that encourages engagement.",
              "A simple yet effective approach to increase engagement is by asking for it.",
              "Caption your post with a question, or use the first comment to begin an interaction.",
              "Here is how Disneyplus does it on Instagram.",
              "In the above post, Disneyplus wins its followers\u2019 engagement with a quiz question as a caption.",
              "The brand interacts with its audience every time and triggers interactions with quizzes, questions, and fandom trends.",
              "Social media platforms prioritize trending topics as they drive user engagement.",
              "As a result, the algorithms aim to display more of such content to users to keep them scrolling through their feeds.",
              "While it\u2019s not necessary to hop onto every trend, it can be worthwhile to explore trends that align with your brand messaging.",
              "To do this, consider leveraging tools like Google Trends to identify what\u2019s trending online in general and utilize social listening programs to understand what\u2019s happening within your specific industry.",
              "You can also follow trends through hashtags and find trendy hashtags that go with your content.",
              "You can also go with popular Instagram reel trends.",
              "ASOS rocks the reel trend game and showcases products tried by individuals to up their fashion game.",
              "In the above reel, ASOS has shared a reel of a customer trying out their vintage jackets that will soon be launched on their website.",
              "You can also keep an eye out for ways to integrate trending sounds and effects into short-form videos like TikToks and Instagram Reels.",
              "This can help to boost the visibility of your content and engage with your audience.",
              "There is no way to trick the algorithm and gain higher visibility on social media without offering value to your viewers.",
              "So, whether you are a marketer or business owner, experimenting with content is the key to understanding what drives better engagement.",
              "To begin experimenting, start by observing what information your audience is seeking.",
              "Also, pay attention to what your close competition is offering on social media.",
              "Once you do that, test various content formats such as images, polls, videos, and stories to see which brings you more engagement.",
              "Analyze the performance of all the content experiments you do.",
              "For better evaluation, pay close attention to performance metrics such as reach, engagement, and clicks to understand which of your content experiments are most liked by your audience.",
              "Once you know your top-performing content, you can begin creating more of that to gain more visibility in feeds.",
              "Using native analytics to gauge the performance of multiple social media accounts is like squeezing water from a stone.",
              "Such analytics data remains scattered and restricted to the analytics section of various social accounts.",

              "Generally, the most recent posts are given priority over those that are days or weeks old, resulting in a higher ranking on the feeds.",
              "It\u2019s essential to consider the optimal times to post on social media to increase the likelihood of your audience seeing and engaging with your posts.",
              "However, remember that posting at the best times alone does not guarantee engagement.",
              "Although posting at optimal times may attract attention, the ultimate fate of your posts depends on the quality of the content you create.",
              "Each social media account has its own optimal time for posting content.",

              "I often share them through Messenger with my sister.",
              "The behavior tells Facebook I want more of this content \u2013 and boy, does it deliver.",

              "Sources: @stunning_plant, @greentica, @vintage____visions In this case, I have followed some accounts based on suggested posts.",
              "That reinforcing signal tells the algorithm to serve even more of the same type of content into my feed, and I\u2019m not mad about it.",
              "Sometimes Instagram even tells you why it is suggesting a specific post to you, based on something you liked, followed, or watched.",

              "Filter bubbles describe a situation where news that we dislike or disagree with is automatically filtered out and this might have the effect of narrowing what we know.",
              "This distinction is important because echo chambers could be a result of filtering or they could be the result of other processes, but filter bubbles have to be the result of algorithmic filtering.",
              "The filter bubble is a very powerful metaphor.",
              "Also the mechanisms which I described seem quite plausible.",
              "Everyone can understand them and they kind of make sense.",
              "The idea of the filter bubble is very prominent and it has had an impact in the way we understand politics since the election of Donald Trump.",
              "A piece published at Wired magazine said that filter bubbles were destroying democracy, which is quite a bold claim.",
              "And as recently as in 2017 Bill Gates said that filter bubbles are a serious problem with news.",
              "Both claims show the kind of extent to which these ideas have taken hold from two sources that are not exactly technology sceptics.",
              "The existence of filter bubbles is widely accepted in many circles.",
              "It's useful to start at the very beginning.",
              "So perhaps the easiest place to start is to ask whether people are actually using the internet to get news, and I think the answer to that question is a clear yes.",
              "Most of the data that I\u2019ve collected with a team of people at the Reuters Institute comes from the Digital News Report, our annual survey of news use in 38 different markets across five continents, mostly in Europe.",
              "Around 75,000 people responded to the survey.",
              "The polling was done by YouGov, but we designed the questionnaire.",
              "When we asked people what their main source of news is, roughly equal numbers of people say online and television.",
              "In some countries, TV is slightly ahead.",
              "In some countries, online is slightly ahead.",
              "But generally speaking, we see a very similar pattern with online and TV quite far ahead of print and radio.",
              "We also see differences when we look at age groups.",
              "TV is more likely to be the main source of news for people over 45.",
              "People under 45 are more likely to get their news online.",
              "We've been tracking the use of social media for news in different countries since around 2013.",
              "From around 2013 to 2016 there was consistent growth in the use of social media for news.",
              "So the proportion who said they used it each week rose from around 25% in 2013 to over 50% in 2016, but the figures have flattened off in the last three years.",
              "If we dig a little bit deeper and look at the individual platforms, we can see that in most countries Facebook is the dominant platform for news use.",
              "Facebook use for news has hovered around 35% of the national population in countries where we have data going back to 2014.",
              "We saw a slight decrease from 2016 to 2018.",
              "During the same period, we've seen other networks such as WhatsApp becoming increasingly important for news use.",
              "These are very different kinds of social networks, but they are lumped under the social media category.",
              "So WhatsApp use for news has grown from around 10% to 16% in the last five years and Instagram has seen similar growth.",
              "Search engines, email, mobile alerts and aggregators also rely on algorithms in some way to deliver news to people.",
              "When we ask people what their main way of getting news online is, around a third say that it's by going directly to the websites and apps of news providers like BBC News or The Guardian in the UK.",
              "The other two-thirds say that their main way of getting news is by what we call a side door, which includes services like search, social, etc.",
              ", and some of these services rely on algorithms to varying degrees.",
              "So when it comes to filter bubbles, it's clear that the potential is there for us to be concerned.",
              "It's clear that algorithms and algorithmically driven services are very important, and a lot of people are using them to get news online.",
              "We can distinguish between self-selected personalisation and preselected personalisation.",
              "Self-selected personalisation refers to the personalisations that we voluntarily do to ourselves, and this is particularly important when it comes to news use.",
              "People have always made decisions in order to personalise their news use.",
              "They make decisions about what newspapers to buy, what TV channels to watch, and at the same time which ones they would avoid.",
              "Academics call this selective exposure.",
              "We know that it's influenced by a range of different things such as people's interest levels in news, their political beliefs and so on.",
              "This is something that has pretty much always been true.",
              "Pre-selected personalisation is the personalisation that is done to people, sometimes by algorithms, sometimes without their knowledge.",
              "And this relates directly to the idea of filter bubbles because algorithms are possibly making choices on behalf of people and they may not be aware of it.",
              "The reason this distinction is particularly important is because we should avoid comparing pre-selected personalisation and its effects with a world where people do not do any kind of personalisation to themselves.",
              "We can't assume that offline, or when people are self-selecting news online, they're doing it in a completely random way.",
              "People are always engaging in personalisation to some extent and if we want to understand the extent of pre-selected personalisation, we have to compare it with the realistic alternative, not hypothetical ideals.",
              "It's important in particular not to romanticise the nature of offline news use for many people.",
              "One of the first studies we did in this area looked at how people self-select news online compared to offline.",
              "We looked at the extent to which audiences for particular news outlets in the UK overlapped with one another.",
              "When people are offline, they stick to a couple of their preferred news sources.",
              "They dig very deeply into those news sources and tend not to deviate from them.",
              "Online, it's a bit different.",
              "Audiences for individual outlets are smaller because people spread their news consumption thinly across lots of different outlets.",
              "Online news is often free, so people can sample news from different sources, and we can see that essentially self-selected personalisation is more prominent offline than it is online.",
              "This is why it's important to compare online news with the realistic alternative, and not an ideal.",
              "Social media combines self-selected personalisation with pre-selected personalisation.",
              "We also know that people choose to follow certain news organisations and not to follow others.",
              "But it is also possible that algorithms might be hiding news from people which they're not interested in or from outlets they don't particularly like.",
              "People have a limited amount of time, so the decisions made by algorithms are going to affect what people see when they're using Facebook.",
              "In order to understand how social media shapes news use, we compared the news diets of people who do not use social media with two other groups of people: one group who said they intentionally use social media for news and another group who said they don't intentionally use social media for news but see news when they're on social media for other purposes.",
              "So we took data from the UK, the USA, Italy and Australia, and studied the effect of using social media on different demographic groups and on different social networks.",
              "Here\u2019s what we found.",
              "People who use social media for news, particularly if they're using it for other reasons, are incidentally exposed to news whilst they're there and this boosts the amount of news that people use compared to the group that don't use social media at all.",
              "So the group that do use social media use more and more different online news sources.",
              "Interestingly, the effect was stronger for younger people, perhaps because they're more adept at using social media and more active on these platforms. It was also stronger for people who don't have high levels of interest in the news.",
              "We also found the effect was stronger for YouTube and Twitter than it was for Facebook, which is important to keep in mind.",
              "Our study highlights the fact that most people, particularly people who use social media, are not terribly interested in the news.",
              "And this becomes particularly important on the web, because this is a high-choice media environment.",
              "That makes it very easy for people who are not interested in news to essentially opt out of it.",
              "But because these same people often use social media, social media is incidentally exposing people to news even when they're not looking for it.",
              "Search engines are different to social media.",
              "When people load up a search engine for news, they're intentionally trying to find news.",
              "But when you search for a particular topic, it's still possible that search engines will use algorithmic selection based on the data that has been collected about your past use.",
              "So the possibility again exists that when people log into search engines, algorithmic selection will trap them in a filter bubble.",
              "We compared the news diets of people who search for news with the news diets of people who say they don't use search engines for news in four countries, and we studied the news diets that these two groups have in terms of what we call diversity and balance.",
              "What we found is that a process of automated serendipity effectively diversifies people's news diets.",
              "People who use search engines for news on average use more news sources than people who don't.",
              "More importantly, they're more likely to use sources from both the left and the right.",
              "People who rely mainly on self-selection tend to have fairly imbalanced news diets.",
              "They either have more right-leaning or more left-leaning sources.",
              "People who use search engines tend to have a more even split between the two.",
              "Our results are in line with different studies in the same area that have looked at this problem in a slightly different way.",
              "A study compared search results from different types of people, particularly people who were Republicans and Democrats in the US.",
              "And what this found essentially was that the results that people got when they searched for political topics were more or less the same.",
              "So there was no real evidence that people with different views are getting different search results.",
              "One of the problems with relying on survey data is that people are not great at remembering what news sources they used.",
              "This has been a consistent problem for some time.",
              "So we tracked the web use of a panel of people in the UK and we compared situations when people go directly to news sources with situations when people go to news via Facebook, via Twitter and a range of other different services.",
              "What we found was that the more people use direct access, the less diverse their news diet was.",
              "Not only people are using more sources of news when they get their news on social media.",
              "They're using lots of different sources, and the balance between those different sources improves with respect to diversity This is a sort of summary of the work we've done in this area.",
              "But it's fairly representative of work in this area as a whole.",
              "There are numerous studies that either find weak evidence of filter bubbles or, at best, mixed evidence.",
              "There are almost no studies that find a very strong evidence of these kinds of effects.",
              "Even though we might be seeing more diversity when we use social media and search, it's possible that this diversity consists of more partisan or polarising news sources.",
              "A study published by a team of researchers in the US looked at people's exposure to their opposing side on Twitter.",
              "So if they were Republicans, they were fed lots of messages on Twitter from Democrats, and vice versa.",
              "They measured attitudes before and after this process and what they found is that as people paid attention to messages from the opposing side, their attitudes began to polarise, and they became more entrenched in their original beliefs.",
              "We've approached the same issues slightly differently.",
              "We measured the level of polarisation that exists in different news environments in different countries.",
              "We looked at the audience of the particular news outlets and saw how different that audience was in terms of its composition of left- and right-leaning people as compared to the population as a whole.",
              "In the US, unsurprisingly, we found that Fox News has a news audience that is much more right-leaning than the population as a whole.",
              "The US is a polarised news environment because the bubbles of the audiences are much more dispersed than they are in some other countries.",
              "What we can also do in those countries is compare online to offline.",
              "What we found when we looked at 12 different countries was that in eight out of 12 cases online news audiences are slightly more polarised, slightly more dispersed, than they were offline.",
              "In some countries, the numbers were either pretty much the same or offline is slightly more polarised.",
              "In general, though, online news environments do seem to be more polarised.",
              "Perhaps because there's much more incentive for some news outlets to produce more partisan content online.",
              "Focusing on filter bubbles can cause us to misunderstand the mechanisms at play and might also be distracting us from slightly more pressing problems. The reason this is important is because some of these problems in some ways are connected with the use of platforms. It's not that the platforms are the cause, but they are part of the picture.",
              "Most of the best available independent empirical evidence seems to suggest that online news use on search and social media is more diverse.",
              "But there's a possibility that this diversity is causing some kind of polarisation, in both attitudes and usage.",
              "This is interesting, because in some ways it's the opposite of what the filter bubble hypothesis predicted.",
              "The hypothesis states that we'll actually get less diversity and there'll be negative consequences from that.",
              "So the end result might be the same.",
              "But the hypothesis fails to capture the mechanisms. Of course, we know that platforms are changing the way they serve news to people all the time and the way that people are getting news is also changing.",
              "So we need to critically examine the effects of algorithmic selection on news use because what was true in the last few years isn't necessarily going to be true in the future.",
              "Most importantly of all, and this is an argument that's taken from a recent book by Axel Bruns, the focus on filter bubbles may be preventing us from properly confronting the deeper causes of division in both politics and society.",
              "While we keep examining platforms and their effects on news use, it\u2019s crucial that we don't fall into this trap of ignoring some of the potentially more important factors that are creating some of the problems that we face.",

              "Facebook, for example, epitomizes all of these aspects.",
              "Their user-friendly website acts as a mediator for social activities and discussion, and it is often used by individuals or parties to express their political views.",
              "Since platforms \u201care a newly predominant type of business model premised upon bringing different groups together\u201d (Srnicek 254), then Facebook can be said to partake in platform capitalism \u2014 a system of capitalism involving the commoditization of users and social production.",
              "User data, harvested with the help of coded platform architecture such as algorithms and protocols, is the main commodity sold by platforms. Facebook platform architecture results in a phenomenon that Eli Pariser terms \u2018the filter bubble\u2019.",

              "Filter bubbles, formed as a result of algorithms on social media websites such as Facebook, have diminished the exchange of opposing viewpoints necessary for a healthy, functioning democracy, and in some cases have subsequently led to radical political change.",
              "Platform capitalism is organized around the \u201ccentrality of data\u201d (Srnicek 254) and the profitability of that data for the platform business model.",
              "Facebook generates revenue by acting as a medium between advertisers and consumers, and controlling the means of social cooperation and commodity production (Sevignani 61).",
              "By collecting user data through its platform, Facebook is able to commodify social interactions and sell them to third-party companies.",
              "The results of this data analysis are shown on the social media platform in \u201ctargeted advertisements and recommendations appearing as banners or running in sidebars\u201d (Langley & Leyshon 12).",
              "For example, if a user once \u2018liked\u2019 a Facebook page about gardening, they may see targeted advertisements for gardening tools.",

              "Facebook uses data collection to convert their users into commodities.",

              "Srnicek asserts that \u201cby providing the infrastructure and intermediation between different groups, platforms place themselves in a position in which they can monitor and extract all the interactions between these groups\u201d (254\u201355).",
              "Facebook provides a social media platform through which users can connect, but its interface constantly monitors and shapes these interactions.",
              "This shaping is done with the use of social algorithms and protocols.",
              "One of Facebook\u2019s first algorithms was the \u2018like\u2019 button, \u201ca feature that lets users express their instant approval of a specific idea or item and share it\u201d (van Dijck 49).",
              "Every time a user \u2018likes\u2019 something on Facebook, that information is stored according to protocols that categorize this data to be later used to create targeted advertisements.",
              "In 2016, Facebook debuted \u2018reactions,\u2019 which are similar to the \u2018like\u2019 feature, but let users choose from a range of emotional reactions, such as the \u2018love\u2019, \u2018sad\u2019, or \u2018angry\u2019 reactions, to items on the platform (Krug 2016).",
              "This development supports Facebook\u2019s capitalist agenda, as it helps them to collect increasingly specific data about a user\u2019s feelings on particular content, thereby gaining the power to promise third-party marketers interested viewers for their paid advertisements.",
              "Social buttons not only encourage interaction among users on social media, but act as a further source for data collection from which Facebook can profit.",
              "Underlying the social button feature are additional algorithms and protocols that influence a user to \u2018like\u2019 content in the first place.",
