    "query": "What is the most effective way for individuals to balance their screen time and digital media use with their physical and mental health, and what practices or habits have been shown to promote a healthy relationship with technology?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Balancing screen time and digital media use with physical and mental health is important for everyone, especially in today's world where we rely on technology for many aspects of our lives. According to some experts, the content you consume on your screen matters more than the overall time you spend on it[^2^]. For example, watching a documentary or learning a new skill online may have different effects than scrolling through social media or playing a video game.\n\nHowever, excessive screen time can still have negative consequences, such as digital eye strain, impaired sleep, and worsened mental health[^4^]. Therefore, it is advisable to limit your screen time to a reasonable amount and avoid using screens before bedtime. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no more than two hours of screen time per day for adults[^1^].\n\nSome practices or habits that have been shown to promote a healthy relationship with technology are:\n\n- Be accountable. Set expectations and goals with yourself and others about reducing screen time. Be realistic and start with small changes[^1^].\n- Control content. Use apps or settings that can help you manage access to appropriate content and limit distractions. Be selective about what you watch, read, or play online[^2^] [^3^].\n- Create electronic-free zones in your home, such as your bedroom, kitchen, or dining area. This will help you focus on other activities and interactions[^1^].\n- Maintain a good sleep routine. Avoid using screens at least an hour before bedtime and keep your devices out of your bedroom. This will help you fall asleep faster and improve your sleep quality[^4^].\n- Identify time for physical activity and socializing. Getting outdoors, exercising, and spending time with friends and family are good for your health and happiness. They can also reduce stress and boredom that may lead to excessive screen use[^1^] [^3^].\n- Use media together. If you do use screens for entertainment or education, try to do it with others who share your interests or goals. This can make the experience more enjoyable and meaningful[^2^].\n\nI hope this helps you find a balance between screen time and digital media use with your physical and mental health. \ud83d\ude0a",

              "Scope Stanford University School of Medicine blog Thomas Robinson, MD, professor of pediatrics and of medicine, has been studying the effect of watching mobile and video screens since the early 1990s.",
              "But before your thoughts go to Tamagachis and Gameboys, Robinson took an interest in screens for their potential to support (and undermine) one's health.",
              "\"Even back then, well before smartphones, children were already spending more time watching screens than they were spending in school or doing any other single activity,\" Robinson said.",
              "\"Adults were watching even more.\"",
              "Robinson suspected that even if the daily effects on health and well-being are relatively small, over the course of months and years, those hours accumulate to something that has a major impact on health and development.",
              "As a pediatrician, Robinson believes it's crucial to understand the effects of such a major activity in the lives of children and families.",
              "In the following Q&A, Robinson discusses the controversies over screen time and usage, how screens affect health, and his approach to studying such a complicated topic, among other matters.",
              "Your research prioritizes approaches that yield solutions, something you've dubbed the \"solution-oriented research paradigm.\"",
              "What does that mean?",
              "Can you give an example?",
              "A lot of research is focused on discovering causes, risk factors and correlates of diseases, but it does not directly tell us how to prevent or treat them -- that is, solutions.",
              "Changing how one frames research questions and designs studies can get to solutions more directly.",
              "For example, in our early screen media research, it was hypothesized that screen time caused obesity, aggression and other problems. Many epidemiological studies, including our own, found relatively weak associations between screen time and these outcomes but they were limited by the difficulty of measuring screen time accurately.",
              "The media industry, arguing that the studies did not show cause and effect, blocked practice and policy initiatives.",
              "But even if one could prove, with experimental studies, that screen viewing caused health problems, the findings still wouldn't tell us what to do about it.",
              "Instead, we designed behavioral interventions to help reduce children's screen time, and we tested the approaches in a series of randomized controlled trials to observe the effects.",
              "We showed that children who receive our interventions to reduce screen time -- which helped the children stay under weekly screen time budgets -- gained less weight, were less aggressive to their peers and asked their parents to buy them fewer advertised products, compared with kids who did not receive the intervention.",
              "We didn't have to first prove the ill effects of screen viewing -- we were able to prove the benefits of an intervention to reduce screen time, directly discovering a solution that could be applied.",
              "There's quite a bit of controversy about how screens affect kids - what do we know and what are the big unknowns still to decipher?",
              "It seems obvious that screens, particularly smartphones, are affecting kids -- and adults.",
              "The list of suspected effects is long: It is not unusual to hear digital media blamed for everything from mental and physical health problems to impaired brain development and social skills to the downfall of democracy, but it's also credited with improving lives by helping kids stay safe and in touch with distant family members.",
              "Many of these impacts are backed up with plausible mechanisms and observations.",
              "Unfortunately, after literally thousands of studies, we have very few clear answers.",
              "Some of this stems from problems of measuring screen use and of differences among children and how they use screens.",
              "Those are problems we are trying to help solve with our Human Screenome Project.",
              "But what we know from studies of screens before smartphones, such as television and video games, still holds.",
              "Kids learn behaviors -- such as aggression and gender and racial stereotypes -- from what they see portrayed in media.",
              "The time spent on screens can displace time spent doing other activities, such as time with family, playing outside and schoolwork.",
              "And while we're waiting for research to catch up, we can base our parenting, school and public policies on what we know from research on earlier media, along with the impacts that seem obvious to us.",
              "Tell me about the Human Screenome Project, and what you aim to do with it.",
              "With my colleagues Byron Reeves, professor of communication, and Nilam Ram, professor of communication and of psychology, and many other collaborators across campus, we are trying to address some of the limitations of past media research by measuring exactly what people are seeing and doing on their screens.",
              "Consented volunteer participants use an app on their devices that unobtrusively records a screenshot every few seconds, encrypts the image and accompanying data and securely sends it to our research servers.",
              "Machine learning and analytics software identify what's on each screen -- all the words, images and other screen characteristics.",
              "We called it the screenome, like the genome, because it creates a record of individuals' unique experiences on their screens.",
              "It feels like what it must have felt like to invent the electron microscope or MRI, to be able to observe a part of life that has been, up until now, invisible.",
              "To date, we have collected screenomes and accompanying surveys for up to one year from several hundred adults and adolescents and their parents.",
              "It immediately became apparent that no two people share similar screenomes and that no person's two days or two hours in a day are the same.",
              "Our goals for this project are to obtain the first detailed understanding of how people are using their screen devices and what they are seeing;",
              "to test relationships between the many hypothesized health, psychological and social effects of screen media and specific screen exposures and behaviors, such as social media, misinformation or jumping from screen to screen;",
              "and to design and test precision interventions based on specific moment-to-moment screen experiences.",
              "What advice do you have to help parents manage their child's screen use, especially mobile phones?",
              "For infants and young children, I recommend avoiding screens altogether.",
              "Young children benefit from more face-to-face time with their parents and other family members.",
              "That means it is also important for parents to limit their own screen use when they are with their children.",
              "I also recommend delaying children's use of screens as they grow.",
              "We recently published a study that followed kids from as young as 7 to as old as 15 as they received their first phone.",
              "We found, on average, getting a phone at a younger age was no better or worse than getting it at an older age, in terms of depressive symptoms, sleep and school grades.",
              "Although some children experienced negative changes after getting a phone, the age of receiving a phone did not appear to be a key factor in determining these outcomes.",
              "It is possible that parents are matching their decisions about when to give their child a phone with their child's readiness and their child's and family's needs.",
              "I recommend parents wait to give their child a phone until they are mature enough to regulate their own use and not allow it to distract them from sleep, homework, family time, and playing and socializing with other kids in the real world.",
              "Parents must also be aware that once their child has a phone they may be exposed to cyber bullying, body shaming, discrimination and racism, violence, pornography, predatory advertising and other content they may not want their child to experience.",
              "I also suggest families have rules about screen use, such as limiting kids' time on screens, limiting the shows they are allowed to watch and apps they are allowed to use, creating phone-free activities (like spending time with family, eating meals, doing homework and sleeping) and creating phone-free spaces, like bedrooms. There are parental controls and apps to help parents enact some of these limits.",
              "And, I tell parents it's OK to take away a child's phone if they do not demonstrate sufficient responsibility to follow the rules.",
              "Lastly, instead of simple screen ownership and screen time, we believe the key is how children and adults use their phones - what they see and do on their phones.",
              "We are studying this now in our Human Screenome Project.",

              "Hunt says that her second, forthcoming follow-up study found that it was better for college students\u2019 mental health to post and engage with others on social media (versus passively scrolling) and to follow people they actually knew in real life versus strangers, celebrities, and influencers (who tend to focus on crafting the perfect image of their lives, which can lead to unhealthy social comparisons).",

              "Another way to build a healthier relationship with screens is to protect the time you spend without one.",
              "People should spend at least three to four hours each day completely detached from screens, Christakis says.",
              "His research has found screen time affects children\u2019s language skills and is correlated with potential behavior problems. \u201cI think what we really need to focus on as a society is having other more healthy, traditional ways of engaging with the people in front of you or even with yourself,\u201d he says.",

              "It should, however, be kept in mind that accelerometers have been shown to be less accurate in correctly classifying MVPA in children during free-living conditions when using a cut-point based on steps per minute [30].",
              "Another limitation is that we did not distinguish between light physical activity and inactive time, which may have led to an overestimation of sedentary time.",
              "Furthermore, the time for automatic screen lock was included in the total screen time.",
              "Although we do not believe that this time is of significance for the study results, it is something that should be taken into consideration in future studies involving smartphone screen time.",

              "For example, in our early screen media research, it was hypothesized that screen time caused obesity, aggression and other problems. Many epidemiological studies, including our own, found relatively weak associations between screen time and these outcomes but they were limited by the difficulty of measuring screen time accurately.",
              "The media industry, arguing that the studies did not show cause and effect, blocked practice and policy initiatives.",
              "But even if one could prove, with experimental studies, that screen viewing caused health problems, the findings still wouldn't tell us what to do about it.",
              "Instead, we designed behavioral interventions to help reduce children's screen time, and we tested the approaches in a series of randomized controlled trials to observe the effects.",
              "We showed that children who receive our interventions to reduce screen time -- which helped the children stay under weekly screen time budgets -- gained less weight, were less aggressive to their peers and asked their parents to buy them fewer advertised products, compared with kids who did not receive the intervention.",
              "We didn't have to first prove the ill effects of screen viewing -- we were able to prove the benefits of an intervention to reduce screen time, directly discovering a solution that could be applied.",
              "There's quite a bit of controversy about how screens affect kids - what do we know and what are the big unknowns still to decipher?",
              "It seems obvious that screens, particularly smartphones, are affecting kids -- and adults.",
              "The list of suspected effects is long: It is not unusual to hear digital media blamed for everything from mental and physical health problems to impaired brain development and social skills to the downfall of democracy, but it's also credited with improving lives by helping kids stay safe and in touch with distant family members.",
              "Many of these impacts are backed up with plausible mechanisms and observations.",
              "Unfortunately, after literally thousands of studies, we have very few clear answers.",
              "Some of this stems from problems of measuring screen use and of differences among children and how they use screens.",
              "Those are problems we are trying to help solve with our Human Screenome Project.",
              "But what we know from studies of screens before smartphones, such as television and video games, still holds.",
              "Kids learn behaviors -- such as aggression and gender and racial stereotypes -- from what they see portrayed in media.",
              "The time spent on screens can displace time spent doing other activities, such as time with family, playing outside and schoolwork.",
              "And while we're waiting for research to catch up, we can base our parenting, school and public policies on what we know from research on earlier media, along with the impacts that seem obvious to us.",
              "Tell me about the Human Screenome Project, and what you aim to do with it.",
              "With my colleagues Byron Reeves, professor of communication, and Nilam Ram, professor of communication and of psychology, and many other collaborators across campus, we are trying to address some of the limitations of past media research by measuring exactly what people are seeing and doing on their screens.",
              "Consented volunteer participants use an app on their devices that unobtrusively records a screenshot every few seconds, encrypts the image and accompanying data and securely sends it to our research servers.",
              "Machine learning and analytics software identify what's on each screen -- all the words, images and other screen characteristics.",
              "We called it the screenome, like the genome, because it creates a record of individuals' unique experiences on their screens.",
              "It feels like what it must have felt like to invent the electron microscope or MRI, to be able to observe a part of life that has been, up until now, invisible.",
              "To date, we have collected screenomes and accompanying surveys for up to one year from several hundred adults and adolescents and their parents.",
              "It immediately became apparent that no two people share similar screenomes and that no person's two days or two hours in a day are the same.",
              "Our goals for this project are to obtain the first detailed understanding of how people are using their screen devices and what they are seeing;",
              "to test relationships between the many hypothesized health, psychological and social effects of screen media and specific screen exposures and behaviors, such as social media, misinformation or jumping from screen to screen;",
              "and to design and test precision interventions based on specific moment-to-moment screen experiences.",
              "What advice do you have to help parents manage their child's screen use, especially mobile phones?",
              "For infants and young children, I recommend avoiding screens altogether.",
              "Young children benefit from more face-to-face time with their parents and other family members.",
              "That means it is also important for parents to limit their own screen use when they are with their children.",
              "I also recommend delaying children's use of screens as they grow.",
              "We recently published a study that followed kids from as young as 7 to as old as 15 as they received their first phone.",
              "We found, on average, getting a phone at a younger age was no better or worse than getting it at an older age, in terms of depressive symptoms, sleep and school grades.",
              "Although some children experienced negative changes after getting a phone, the age of receiving a phone did not appear to be a key factor in determining these outcomes.",
              "It is possible that parents are matching their decisions about when to give their child a phone with their child's readiness and their child's and family's needs.",
              "I recommend parents wait to give their child a phone until they are mature enough to regulate their own use and not allow it to distract them from sleep, homework, family time, and playing and socializing with other kids in the real world.",
              "Parents must also be aware that once their child has a phone they may be exposed to cyber bullying, body shaming, discrimination and racism, violence, pornography, predatory advertising and other content they may not want their child to experience.",
              "I also suggest families have rules about screen use, such as limiting kids' time on screens, limiting the shows they are allowed to watch and apps they are allowed to use, creating phone-free activities (like spending time with family, eating meals, doing homework and sleeping) and creating phone-free spaces, like bedrooms. There are parental controls and apps to help parents enact some of these limits.",
              "And, I tell parents it's OK to take away a child's phone if they do not demonstrate sufficient responsibility to follow the rules.",
              "Lastly, instead of simple screen ownership and screen time, we believe the key is how children and adults use their phones - what they see and do on their phones.",
              "We are studying this now in our Human Screenome Project.",

              "Peer Review reports Early childhood, defined as the first six years of life, is a critical life phase characterized by substantial growth and development in several domains, including the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive domains [1].",
              "Young children are therefore malleable and their growth and development can be enhanced or impaired by early life experiences [1].",
              "In terms of the social domain of development in early childhood, social competence has been identified as a key element [2].",
              "Socially competent children are typically characterized as possessing the abilities to: \u201cinteract with others effectively\u201d and \u201cdevelop positive relationships\u201d [2].",
              "Within this complex construct, social skills have been identified as a central component as they are the specific abilities that underlie competence [3, 4].",

              "Given the important long-term implications of social skills in early childhood, it is important to understand the relevant determinants to inform early prevention and intervention [2].",
              "A growing body of evidence suggests physical activity and sedentary behavior, in particular screen time, in early childhood are important predictors of multiple domains of development, including the social domain [6,7,8].",
              "Play is considered critical for children\u2019s development, and physically active play is considered a main category of play in early childhood [9].",
              "Through play, young children learn and practice important social skills via interactions with parents, siblings, peers, and significant others, primarily in home and child care settings [10].",
              "Conversely, screen time in early childhood is linked to decreased interactions with caregivers [11] and lower vocabulary [12], which are essential to developing social skills [2].",
              "Furthermore, screen time may displace time spent in more developmentally enriching activities [13].",
              "However, important research gaps and limitations have been highlighted in recent reviews examining physical activity, sedentary behavior, and the social domain of development in early childhood [6, 7].",
              "For instance, to overcome limitations of previous studies, future longitudinal studies using objective measures of physical activity and sedentary behavior have been recommended [6].",
              "Additionally, while important developmental processes occur in infanthood and toddlerhood (< 3 years) [2], most research, particularly investigating associations with physical activity and social skills, has focused on preschool-aged children (3\u20135 years) [7].",
              "Therefore, studies with samples of children < 3 years are needed to fill this notable gap.",
              "Another central reason for targeting physical activity and sedentary behavior in early childhood is the potential for behavioral patterns established early in life to remain stable overtime resulting in sustained impact on growth and development.",
              "For instance, moderate effect sizes have been observed for the tracking of both physical activity and sedentary behavior during early childhood and from early childhood to middle childhood [14].",
              "There is some evidence that these health behaviors, in particular screen time, are associated with social skills in school-aged children and youth [15, 16].",
              "However, a review on the tracking of physical activity and sedentary behavior found no studies on physical activity [14] and only two on sedentary behavior [17, 18] that included a sample of children < 3 years at baseline.",

              "Consequently, studies have found it is common for parents of young children to think screen time is an appropriate learning tool or beneficial for cognitive development [33, 34].",
              "However, several countries have recently developed evidence-based guidelines that do not support this point of view, and recommend no screen time for children under 2 years of age and one hour or less per day for children 2\u20134 years or 2\u20135 years, depending on the country [35,36,37].",
              "It is important to note that the majority of evidence that informed these guidelines is based on television viewing using a traditional television [8].",

              "Though evidence is quite limited, interactive games may have different implications on cognitive development than that of passive television viewing [38].",
              "However, the findings of the present study, which incorporated newer devices, suggest regardless of whether young children are using traditional or new devices, they are still primarily engaging in screen time through television/video watching, which is more likely to be passive compared to playing interactive games.",
              "This finding is supported by another recent study that reported on the activities young children liked when engaging with touch screens [39].",
              "More research should examine if children\u2019s interactions with caregivers and peers differ between passive and interactive screen time engagement to better understand the role that different types of screen time may have on the development of social skills.",
              "In contrast to screen time, accelerometer-derived LPA and MVPA were not significantly associated with social skills in the present study.",
              "In a recent review on physical activity and health indicators in children aged 0\u20134 years [7], limited experimental evidence of moderate quality was found that suggests physical activity among preschoolers, in particular dance, is favourably associated with overall social competence [40].",

              "A cross-sectional study published after the most recent review found that outdoor play had favourable associations with the express and comply scores of the ASBI [32].",
              "Therefore, similar to sedentary behavior, it could be that the specific types of physical activity and the context surrounding the physical activity engagement is more important for the development of social skills than total duration and intensity of physical activity.",
              "Since no previous studies to our knowledge have examined the associations of accelerometer-derived physical activity with social skills in this age group, future research is needed to confirm our findings around total duration and intensity.",

              "Findings also align with studies in older age groups that observed tracking of physical activity from early childhood to middle childhood [14].",
              "Given that physical activity, MVPA in particular, is associated with a wide variety of health indicators throughout childhood [16], current evidence supports the promotion of regular physical activity, especially MVPA, in toddlerhood.",
              "Similarly, screen time was also found to significantly track over the three time-points, and it had the strongest tracking coefficient among all the behaviors examined.",
              "Previous studies have found that television viewing tracked at moderate levels (r = 0.",

              "Therefore, overall findings across studies also highlight the importance of targeting screen time engagement early in life.",
              "Main strengths of this study include the longitudinal design with three time-points, the toddler-aged sample at baseline, the objective measures of physical activity and sedentary time, and the inclusion of multiple types of screen time.",
              "A main limitation of the study is the loss of participants to follow-up.",
              "Some loss to follow-up is likely explained by PREPS originally being a cross-sectional study.",

              "Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed for baseline demographic and behavior variables between included and excluded samples.",
