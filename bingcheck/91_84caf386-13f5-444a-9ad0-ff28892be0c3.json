According to some sources[^1^] [^2^], the oldest known **non-cloned** living organism on Earth is a **bristlecone pine tree** named Methuselah, which is about **5,000 years old** and grows in the White Mountains of California. However, if you include clones or colonies, then there are some contenders that are much older. For example, a **quaking aspen** grove in Utah named Pando, which is genetically identical and connected by a single root system, is estimated to be **80,000 years old**[^2^]. Another example is a **sea grass meadow** near Spain, which is also genetically identical and self-cloned, and is estimated to be **200,000 years old**[^1^].\n\nThese ancient organisms are able to survive for so long because they have adaptations that help them cope with harsh environments, such as drought, cold, fire, pests and diseases. They also have mechanisms that allow them to regenerate or reproduce asexually, such as root sprouts or rhizomes. However, some of these organisms are also threatened by human activities, such as logging, mining, grazing and climate change, and may not survive much longer without conservation efforts.",
