    "query": "What is the most impactful and successful method for preventing and treating malaria in developing countries, and how can governments and non-profit organizations work together to implement this approach on a larger scale?",
    "response": "That's a very important and complex question. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malaria is a life-threatening disease that affects nearly half of the world's population and causes over 600,000 deaths every year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa[^1^]. Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites or by taking medicines, and it can be cured with effective treatments[^1^]. However, many challenges remain in controlling and eliminating this disease, such as poverty, weak health systems, drug resistance, insecticide resistance, and environmental changes[^1^].\n\nThere is no single method that can prevent and treat malaria in all settings, but rather a combination of strategies that need to be tailored to the local context and epidemiology. Some of the methods that have been proven to be effective include:\n\n- Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), which protect people from mosquito bites at night and reduce malaria transmission[^2^] [^3^].\n- Indoor residual spraying (IRS), which involves spraying insecticides on the walls and ceilings of houses where mosquitoes rest after feeding[^2^].\n- Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT), which involves giving antimalarial drugs to groups at high risk of malaria, such as pregnant women, infants, and children under 5 years[^2^].\n- Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), which involves giving antimalarial drugs to children under 5 years during the peak malaria season in areas with highly seasonal transmission[^2^].\n- Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which allow for quick and accurate diagnosis of malaria at the point of care and reduce unnecessary use of antimalarial drugs[^2^].\n- Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which are the most effective treatments for uncomplicated malaria caused by the deadliest parasite species, Plasmodium falciparum[^2^].\n- Severe malaria case management, which involves prompt referral and treatment of patients with severe malaria symptoms, such as coma, convulsions, or organ failure[^2^].\n\nIn addition to these methods, there are also promising new innovations and approaches that are being developed and tested to combat malaria, such as:\n\n- The world's first malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, which has been deployed in Ghana and Malawi, with plans for rollout in Kenya[^4^]. This vaccine has shown to reduce malaria cases by about 40% in children aged 5\u201317 months over a 4-year period[^4^].\n- New diagnostics, medications, insecticides and vector control tools that can overcome the challenges of drug resistance and insecticide resistance[^4^].\n- Passive immunization therapies such as monoclonal antibodies that can provide short-term protection against malaria infection or disease[^4^].\n- Gene drive technologies that can alter the genetic makeup of mosquitoes to reduce their ability to transmit malaria or to suppress their population[^4^].\n\nTo implement these methods on a larger scale, governments and non-profit organizations need to work together to ensure adequate funding, coordination, surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, advocacy, community engagement, and research. Some of the key partners in the global fight against malaria include:\n\n- The WHO Global Malaria Programme , which provides technical guidance, policy recommendations, and strategic information on malaria control and elimination[^1^].\n- The Roll Back Malaria Partnership , which is a global platform for coordinated action against malaria that brings together hundreds of partners from various sectors[^5^].\n- The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria , which is a financing mechanism that supports countries in implementing evidence-based interventions against these three diseases[^5^].\n- The President's Malaria Initiative , which is a US government initiative that supports malaria prevention and treatment efforts in 24 African countries and 3 regions of Southeast Asia[^5^].\n- The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , which is a philanthropic organization that invests in research and innovation to develop new tools and strategies for malaria eradication[^5^].\n\nI hope this answer has given you some insight into the methods used to prevent and treat malaria in developing countries and how governments and non-profit organizations can work together to implement them on a larger scale. If you have any follow-up questions or feedback, please let me know. \ud83d\ude0a",

              "Nets were retreated by simply dipping them in a mixture of water and insecticide and allowing them to dry in a shady place.",
              "The need for frequent retreatment was a major barrier to widespread use of ITNs in endemic countries.",
              "In addition, the additional cost of the insecticide and the lack of understanding its importance resulted in very low retreatment rates in most African countries.",

              "To help manage resistance, some net products incorporate piperonyl butoxide (PBO) along with a pyrethroid insecticide, but there is not yet evidence that this significantly improves ITN effectiveness in areas with high levels of pyrethroid resistance, and WHO currently does not consider nets that incorporate PBO to be tools for managing pyrethroid resistance.",

              "When given to the young children and pregnant women who are most vulnerable to malaria, preventive chemotherapy has been shown to be a safe, effective and cost-effective strategy for reducing the disease burden and saving lives.",
              "National malaria control programmes have adopted and implemented chemoprevention strategies for young children over the past decade, and for even longer for pregnant women.",
              "In 2020, WHO convened a group of leading malaria experts to consider more than 10 years of evidence and operational experience on these interventions.",
              "The updated recommendations on SMC, PMC and IPTp, published today in the WHO Guidelines for malaria, will support the broader use of chemoprevention among young children at high risk of severe malaria in areas with both seasonal and year-round transmission and promote expanded access to preventive chemotherapy in pregnancy.",
              "\u201cThe updated recommendations are informed by our improved understanding of when and where chemoprevention can be most effective,\u201d said Dr Peter Olumese, technical lead for malaria chemoprevention in the WHO Global Malaria Programme.",

              "\u201d What is preventive chemotherapy?",
              "Preventive chemotherapy is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infection and its consequences.",
              "It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations (generally infants, children under 5 years of age and pregnant women) at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipient is infected.",
              "Preventive chemotherapy includes intermittent preventive treatment of infants, school children and pregnant women, seasonal malaria chemoprevention, post-discharge malaria chemoprevention and mass drug administration.",
              "Updated recommendation: seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) In some areas, malaria is highly seasonal, with most cases occurring over a short period during the rainy season.",
              "SMC is designed to protect children by clearing existing infections and preventing malaria infections during the season of greatest risk.",
              "This is achieved through the monthly administration of antimalarial medicines, usually sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP+AQ), for as long as the rainy season lasts.",
              "In 2021, 13 countries in the Sahel subregion of Africa implemented SMC, and public health experts believe that many other countries could benefit from the intervention, too.",
              "The updated WHO recommendation on SMC differs from the original 2012 recommendation in at least 2 significant ways: No more geographic restrictions The original recommendation restricted SMC use to the Sahel subregion of Africa;",
              "SMC could not be recommended, at the time, in areas outside the Sahel with highly seasonal malaria transmission, such as in southern Africa, due to high levels of resistance to the medicines (SP and AQ) in those areas.",
              "The updated recommendation recognizes that countries in other parts of Africa with highly seasonal variation in malaria burden could also benefit from SMC, and that the availability of new medicines could make it a viable intervention in these areas.",
              "The original recommendation stated that a maximum of 4 monthly doses of SMC should be given during the malaria transmission season.",
              "The updated guidance states that SMC should be given during peak malaria transmission season, without defining the specific number of monthly cycles.",
              "More flexibility in recognizing age-based risk among children While the original recommendation restricted SMC use to children less than 6 years of age, the new recommendation recommends this intervention for children at high risk of severe malaria, which may extend to older children in some locations.",
              "\u201cThe flexibility of the new guidelines is key,\u201d said Dr Dorothy Achu, National Malaria Control Programme Manager for the Ministry of Health in Cameroon.",
              "\u201cIt will enable countries like Cameroon to tailor their strategies.",
              "This will enhance the impact of SMC, especially when used with other interventions such as bed nets and the new malaria vaccine.",
              "\u201d In some countries, malaria is a year-round disease, and transmission is high.",
              "WHO has recommended the use of intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) \u2013 now called perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) \u2013 in these countries since 2010.",
              "But until recently, only one country, Sierra Leone, had adopted this strategy.",
              "Additional experience and evidence over the last decade have informed the updated guidance.",
              "The updated recommendation differs from the original 2010 recommendation in at least 2 important ways: Dosing ages and intervals The original recommendation stated that three doses of the drug SP should be given only at 2, 3 and 9 months of age through the expanded programme on immunization (EPI), timed with the 2nd and 3rd doses of the DPT/Penta and measles vaccines.",
              "The new recommendation removes this tight specification for the number of doses, as well as the ages at which they should be given.",
              "It also extends the target age group to include children beyond the first year of life in places where the burden of severe disease is high.",
              "Consideration of drug resistance The original guidance suggested that SP should only be used for chemoprevention if parasite resistance, measured using molecular markers, was below a certain threshold.",
              "However, the accumulated evidence shows that SP continues to be an effective chemotherapy for malaria even when the prevalence of molecular markers of SP resistance is high and this medicine is no longer an effective treatment.",
              "As a result, the new recommendation has removed restrictions on the use of SP based on prevalence of Pfdhps 540 mutations.",
              "To support decision making at the country level, each WHO chemoprevention recommendation is accompanied by a summary of available research evidence, an explanation of how this was used to inform the recommendation and practical information on key considerations for implementation.",

              "Malaria infection during pregnancy poses substantial risks not only to the mother, but also to her fetus and the newborn.",
              "Available evidence continues to show that intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with SP is a safe and highly cost-effective strategy for reducing the disease burden in pregnancy as well as adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes.",

              "Updated WHO recommendations for malaria chemoprevention among children ...",
              "WHO has updated it recommendations for 3 key malaria prevention strategies: seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC \u2013 previously known as intermittent preventive treatment in infants, or IPTi) and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp).",
              "When given to the young children and pregnant women who are most vulnerable to malaria, preventive chemotherapy has been shown to be a safe, effective and cost-effective strategy for reducing the disease burden and saving lives.",
              "National malaria control programmes have adopted and implemented chemoprevention strategies for young children over the past decade, and for even longer for pregnant women.",
              "In 2020, WHO convened a group of leading malaria experts to consider more than 10 years of evidence and operational experience on these interventions.",
              "The updated recommendations on SMC, PMC and IPTp, published today in the WHO Guidelines for malaria, will support the broader use of chemoprevention among young children at high risk of severe malaria in areas with both seasonal and year-round transmission and promote expanded access to preventive chemotherapy in pregnancy.",
              "\u201cThe updated recommendations are informed by our improved understanding of when and where chemoprevention can be most effective,\u201d said Dr Peter Olumese, technical lead for malaria chemoprevention in the WHO Global Malaria Programme.",
              "\u201cThey encourage national malaria control programmes to expand access to these life-saving interventions, while tailoring the deployment to local contexts.",
              "\u201d What is preventive chemotherapy?",
              "Preventive chemotherapy is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infection and its consequences.",
              "It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations (generally infants, children under 5 years of age and pregnant women) at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipient is infected.",
              "Preventive chemotherapy includes intermittent preventive treatment of infants, school children and pregnant women, seasonal malaria chemoprevention, post-discharge malaria chemoprevention and mass drug administration.",
              "Updated recommendation: seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) In some areas, malaria is highly seasonal, with most cases occurring over a short period during the rainy season.",
              "SMC is designed to protect children by clearing existing infections and preventing malaria infections during the season of greatest risk.",
              "This is achieved through the monthly administration of antimalarial medicines, usually sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP+AQ), for as long as the rainy season lasts.",
              "In 2021, 13 countries in the Sahel subregion of Africa implemented SMC, and public health experts believe that many other countries could benefit from the intervention, too.",
              "The updated WHO recommendation on SMC differs from the original 2012 recommendation in at least 2 significant ways: No more geographic restrictions The original recommendation restricted SMC use to the Sahel subregion of Africa;",
              "SMC could not be recommended, at the time, in areas outside the Sahel with highly seasonal malaria transmission, such as in southern Africa, due to high levels of resistance to the medicines (SP and AQ) in those areas.",
              "The updated recommendation recognizes that countries in other parts of Africa with highly seasonal variation in malaria burden could also benefit from SMC, and that the availability of new medicines could make it a viable intervention in these areas.",
              "The original recommendation stated that a maximum of 4 monthly doses of SMC should be given during the malaria transmission season.",
              "The updated guidance states that SMC should be given during peak malaria transmission season, without defining the specific number of monthly cycles.",
              "More flexibility in recognizing age-based risk among children While the original recommendation restricted SMC use to children less than 6 years of age, the new recommendation recommends this intervention for children at high risk of severe malaria, which may extend to older children in some locations.",
              "\u201cThe flexibility of the new guidelines is key,\u201d said Dr Dorothy Achu, National Malaria Control Programme Manager for the Ministry of Health in Cameroon.",
              "\u201cIt will enable countries like Cameroon to tailor their strategies.",
              "This will enhance the impact of SMC, especially when used with other interventions such as bed nets and the new malaria vaccine.",
              "\u201d In some countries, malaria is a year-round disease, and transmission is high.",
              "WHO has recommended the use of intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) \u2013 now called perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC) \u2013 in these countries since 2010.",
              "But until recently, only one country, Sierra Leone, had adopted this strategy.",
              "Additional experience and evidence over the last decade have informed the updated guidance.",
              "The updated recommendation differs from the original 2010 recommendation in at least 2 important ways: Dosing ages and intervals The original recommendation stated that three doses of the drug SP should be given only at 2, 3 and 9 months of age through the expanded programme on immunization (EPI), timed with the 2nd and 3rd doses of the DPT/Penta and measles vaccines.",
              "The new recommendation removes this tight specification for the number of doses, as well as the ages at which they should be given.",
              "It also extends the target age group to include children beyond the first year of life in places where the burden of severe disease is high.",
              "Consideration of drug resistance The original guidance suggested that SP should only be used for chemoprevention if parasite resistance, measured using molecular markers, was below a certain threshold.",
              "However, the accumulated evidence shows that SP continues to be an effective chemotherapy for malaria even when the prevalence of molecular markers of SP resistance is high and this medicine is no longer an effective treatment.",
              "As a result, the new recommendation has removed restrictions on the use of SP based on prevalence of Pfdhps 540 mutations.",
              "To support decision making at the country level, each WHO chemoprevention recommendation is accompanied by a summary of available research evidence, an explanation of how this was used to inform the recommendation and practical information on key considerations for implementation.",
              "WHO will continue to develop or revise implementation guidance documents to support national malaria programmes in the adoption, adaptation and implementation of the updated recommendations.",
              "Malaria infection during pregnancy poses substantial risks not only to the mother, but also to her fetus and the newborn.",
              "Available evidence continues to show that intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with SP is a safe and highly cost-effective strategy for reducing the disease burden in pregnancy as well as adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes.",
              "The updated recommendation on IPTp differs from the original 2012 recommendation in at least 2 important ways: Delivery method The updated recommendation does not limit the delivery of IPT-SP to antenatal care (ANC) contacts;",
              "where inequities in access to ANC services exist, other delivery methods, such as the use of community health workers, may be explored.",
              "Pregnancy In malaria-endemic areas, IPTp is now recommended for all pregnant women, regardless of the number of pregnancies.",
              "Previously, it was recommended only during a woman\u2019s first and second pregnancies.",

              "SMC consists of monthly administration of a full therapeutic course of the antimalarials sulphadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine (SP) and amodiaquine (AQ) during the peak malaria season, and has been shown to provide a high level of protection against malaria in a series of clinical trials [1].",
              "Since being recommended by the World Health Organization in 2012 [2], SMC has been introduced as part of national malaria control strategies in countries of the Sahel and sub-Sahel regions of West Africa, and reached 22 million children in 13 countries in 2019 [3].",
              "With SMC deployed at scale, there is a need to confirm if the high level of protection against clinical malaria observed in clinical trials is replicated in a programmatic field setting, as a number of factors (such as drug quality, poor administration, poor adherence to the 3-day regimen, and the presence of illnesses that affect drug absorption) could limit treatment efficacy in practice if SMC delivery is not well supervised.",
              "There is also an ongoing need to monitor SMC effectiveness, which could decline over time if parasites become more resistant to SP or AQ, or both, in regions where SMC is being used.",

              "Ongoing monitoring of these molecular markers will be needed to detect any increase in the prevalence and severity of SP resistance, but changes in the prevalence of markers alone cannot indicate in vivo efficacy of chemoprevention [5,6].",
              "Case\u2013control studies offer a reasonably quick and inexpensive approach to estimate protective effectiveness to complement this approach, and can be used to confirm effectiveness even in situations where impact is difficult to measure or interpret due to weak surveillance or changes in malaria detection rates or access to treatment.",

              "A potential bias towards lower estimated effectiveness of SMC is that cases might have better access to care than controls.",
              "If the factors that result in better access to care also result in better access to SMC, this might be associated with higher coverage of SMC among cases, biasing effectiveness downwards.",

              "g., caregivers with more or less time or resources to take children for treatment when unwell).",
              "Test-negative designs, which use patients who test negative for malaria as controls, would more fully control for access to care, but, in the Sahel context, where transmission remains high, selecting children without malaria parasitaemia (or non-febrile children with asymptomatic parasitaemia) would be likely to selectively include SMC recipients as controls.",
              "This would bias estimated effectiveness upwards, and thus neighbourhood controls were preferred.",
              "Controls were more likely to be female than cases, and slightly older on average.",
              "However, adjustment for these factors suggests that this did not introduce important confounding.",
              "Children from households with a large number of other children may be under-represented in the controls, because control households were chosen first, then a single child within the household selected [21].",
              "This could create an artefactual association between household size and malaria.",
              "However, household size did not appear to be associated with receipt of SMC, and controlling for household size did not change estimates of the association between malaria and SMC in any of the studies.",
              "Previous exposure to SMC was documented based on the SMC card, where this was available, and otherwise according to caregiver recall, checked carefully against distribution dates for the community.",
              "Although there is the potential for this to introduce recall bias, provided controls are recruited at or soon after the time that the case is recruited, the length of the recall period is relatively short.",
              "Detailed coverage surveys carried out in other areas implementing SMC found reasonably high retention of the SMC distribution card, and good agreement between SMC card and recall within the same malaria transmission season [4].",
              "Estimates of protection against clinical malaria within the first 28 days after SMC are likely to be sensitive to the exact timing of recruitment with respect to the previous SMC cycle.",
              "For example, the exposure status of cases could differ between the first week following SMC (when one would expect very few cases to have previously received SMC) and the final week of each monthly cycle (when more cases may have received SMC at the time of the last cycle, but still become unwell in spite of this).",
              "In 2016, we attempted to standardise this by recruiting a constant number of cases in each week of the study, over the whole season.",
              "In 2015, recruitment began towards the end of the malaria transmission season, and limiting the number of cases recruited in this way was not possible due to the declining malaria burden.",
              "This may explain the high efficacy estimate in Mali, in 2015, as many of the discordant case\u2013control sets were recruited very soon after SMC (Fig A in S1 Fig), when the SP and AQ were likely to have very high efficacy.",
              "Despite these limitations, the close agreement between the effectiveness estimates obtained in different locations within the SMC area, and in countries where different levels of SMC coverage were achieved (very high in Burkina Faso, and much lower in Nigeria and Chad [4]), is reassuring.",
              "Case\u2013control studies have been widely used to evaluate preventive interventions such as vaccines [10], and other preventive interventions for malaria [12].",
              "Use of case\u2013control studies for the evaluation of SMC is more complicated than for interventions such as vaccines because (1) the expected duration of protection is short, even if SMC is working well, and (2) there are multiple SMC cycles within a short period of time.",
              "Both these factors mean that accurate documentation of the date of receipt of SMC is critical in a way that would not be the case for a vaccine providing lifelong immunity (for which prior receipt of the vaccine or not, as a binary outcome, may be sufficient, without reference to specific dates).",
              "Despite these challenges, our results suggest that this approach is a valid method to monitor the effectiveness of SMC in vivo, complementing other approaches, and potentially providing an approach to monitor the effect of SMC on severe malaria, which is difficult to do using prospective approaches.",
              "This approach also allows the effect of other risk factors to be estimated, including the protection from other interventions.",
              "We attempted to do this for LLINs in this study, but the high coverage of LLINs affected precision in some study centres.",
              "Case\u2013control studies require close attention to methodology, including quality-controlled microscopy at the point of recruitment and careful design, supervision, and analysis, and should to be undertaken by suitably trained teams. It is important to collect a full SMC history from all cases and controls, including SMC in previous months, and to measure potential confounders carefully.",
              "However, if these challenges can be met, the design can give meaningful results even when implemented in only a small number of health facilities, and the costs are relatively low, even with the need to travel to conduct home visits.",
              "In areas where case\u2013control studies are planned, there should be a particular effort to document SMC dates carefully, both on the SMC card and in SMC registers, and to record accurately the dates of SMC campaigns in the study area and the dates of any call back visits made by the delivery teams after the main distribution dates.",
              "In some countries implementing SMC (e.",
              "g., The Gambia), children have an ID card with a quick response (QR) code, permitting electronic data capture of SMC delivery, permitting more accurate ascertainment of treatment dates.",
              "If carried out properly, case\u2013control studies can be a powerful tool to monitor SMC effectiveness, and these studies should be repeated at regular intervals and in a range of locations.",
              "These studies could also be done reactively in response to concerns about low effectiveness (e.",
              "g., many children reporting malaria despite receipt of SMC) or apparent low impact (e.",
              "g., a particularly high burden in routine health system data).",
              "This is important because alarm about loss of effectiveness may arise from fluctuations in malaria incidence over time (leading to peaks in malaria cases that suggest loss of protection) and/or from the observation that a high percentage of malaria cases have recently received SMC (which would be expected if coverage is high) [22].",
              "These results from 5 countries confirm that SMC as used in routine programmes provides a high degree of personal protection against clinical malaria, consistent with reported adherence and low frequencies of molecular markers of resistance, and support the continued deployment of SMC at scale to protect children in the Sahel and sub-Sahel regions of Africa.",

              "New frontiers in vector control - World Health Organization (WHO)",
              "Ever since Sir Ronald Ross discovered malaria parasites in an Anopheles mosquito in 1897, controlling insect vectors has played an increasingly important role in reducing the burden of the disease.",
              "For decades after World War II, indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides was the only weapon against mosquitoes and proved a blunt and reasonably effective instrument for protecting people inside their homes.",
              "Then, beginning in the early 2000s, insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) became a new addition to countries\u2019 vector control strategies.",
              "Thanks, in part, to the wide deployment of these 2 WHO-recommended interventions, the world made remarkable gains against malaria in the period 2000\u20132015.",
              "But progress plateaued, and this troubling slowdown was exacerbated by COVID-19.",
              "According to WHO\u2019s latest World malaria report, 2020 saw a rise in the global burden of malaria, with an estimated 627 000 deaths and 241 million new cases of the disease.",
              "Getting back on track, and meeting WHO\u2019s targets of a 90% reduction in malaria case incidence and mortality rates by 2030, will require renewed global attention, increased funding, and continued research and development of new interventions, among other actions.",
              "In the field vector control, researchers are working on several innovations that aim to enhance efforts to combat the disease.",
              "While insecticide-treated nets are already a key part of the anti-malaria tool kit, their effectiveness has diminished in recent years as mosquitoes have become resistant to pyrethroids, the only class of insecticides recommended by WHO, to date, for use in nets.",
              "Scientists are working to enhance pyrethroids\u2019 lethality or find other more potent insecticides suitable for the treatment of nets.",
              "Several new types of nets are now being tested that include a pyrethroid (still a highly potent mosquito killer) and an additional chemical, sterilizing agent, or insecticide.",
              "One recent large trial in the United Republic of Tanzania suggested that the new Interceptor G2 nets \u2013 treated with both a pyrethroid and chlorfenapyr, a different class of chemical not previously used for vector control \u2013 showed a marked improvement in preventing malaria over pyrethroid-only nets.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s really encouraging to see these results from a very robust clinical trial,\u201d says Dr Hilary Ranson of the Department of Vector Biology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.",
              "But \u201cthere is a huge variation in mosquito populations across Africa, and extrapolating from one setting to a whole continent is a big step,\u201d she added.",
              "Another large trial of new nets in Benin should provide more results by the end of the year.",
              "Current vector control tools are indoor-centric.",
              "\u201cRight now, we have a lot of products that are very effective for indoor use such as IRS and bed nets,\u201d says Mathias Mondy, director of Business Development and Strategy at the Innovative Vector Control Consortium (IVCC), \u201cbut we are desperately lacking products to prevent outdoor transmission.",
              "\u201d In 2014, IVCC requested new ideas for outdoor control.",
              "One company pitched the idea of attractive targeted sugar bait (ATSB), an outdoor bait station to attract and kill mosquitoes.",
              "An ATSB station is the size of an A4 sheet, with small pouches containing a sugary matrix laced with insecticide.",
              "The bait is covered by a soft black membrane that allows mosquitoes to feed through while being protected against rain and dust.",
              "Two bait stations are placed at a height of 1.",
              "8 meters on outside walls of every house, so they\u2019re kept out of reach of young children and animals.",
              "Attractive targeted sugar baits on a wall in Siaya County, Kenya.",
              "\u00a9 IVCC ATSBs are currently being tested in Mali, Zambia, and Kenya and have already shown great promise, while being much less arduous than spraying.",
              "\u201cCompared to IRS,\u201d notes Mondy, \u201cit is much simpler to train health workers to nail ATSBs on the sides of houses.",
              "\u201d Full results are expected by 2025.",
              "Another innovation that could alleviate some of the burdens of indoor spraying is spatial repellents, which release volatile chemicals into the air that change mosquito behaviour.",
              "\u201cWith IRS,\u201d says Dr Nicole Achee, a medical entomologist at the University of Notre Dame, \u201cmosquitoes have to lay or rest on a chemically treated surface\u201d to be affected.",
              "But with spatial repellents, they \u201cinteract with chemicals in the air that have dispersed throughout the treated area.",
              "\u201d Spatial repellents carry other advantages too.",
              "They can be distributed on a surface that is as small as a sheet of paper \u2013 no fire or electricity required.",
              "\u201cThis might be something you put in a box on a bicycle and easily deliver to a community,\u201d says Achee.",
              "They also last much longer than traditional repellents and don\u2019t need to be frequently reapplied like topical anti-mosquito products.",
              "And like ATSBs, spatial repellents, once they have received a WHO recommendation, could be used by anyone to protect against malaria and diseases such as dengue, as long as instructions on proper use are followed.",
              "Another new frontier is endectocides or drugs that, when ingested by humans, exert an effect on mosquitoes that bite them.",
              "Originally used to treat onchocerciasis, ivermectin \u2013 the most studied endectocide to date \u2013 also seemed to have an adverse effect on mosquitoes.",
              "\u201cIf mosquitoes were captured that had fed on people given ivermectin, they did not survive very well,\u201d says Dr Sunil Parikh, Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases at the Yale School of Public Health.",
              "For ivermectin to effectively control mosquitoes, however, humans would have to take a higher or more frequent doses than used for deworming.",
              "Pilot studies suggest that giving humans ivermectin more frequently might curb the mosquito population enough to reduce malaria transmission, and other studies have found the drug can be safely taken at higher doses.",
              "Several larger studies are now under way to confirm those results and to investigate other potential endectocides.",
              "\u201cWhat\u2019s exciting about endectocides,\u201d says Dr Parikh, \u201cis that the person is essentially walking around with something in their blood that is lethal to mosquitoes that bite indoors, outdoors, daytime, night-time.",
              "So, you potentially have an impact on mosquitoes of many different flavours and habits.",
              "\u201d While field trials are still several years away, another intriguing new approach is genetic modification of mosquitoes.",
              "\u201cGenetic changes are made specifically in the malaria vector to reduce malaria transmission,\u201d explains Dr Mike Santos, Director of GeneConvene, a global collaborative focused on genetic biocontrol technologies for public health.",
              "Once released into the wild, these genetically modified mosquitoes would pass on their changes to other malaria vectors.",
              "Dr Mamadou Coulibaly, principal investigator at Target Malaria, explains one such approach: \u201cIf you release a male mosquito that has this gene drive technology, it will impair the fertility of the female when it mates, so there\u2019s no progeny and the population is reduced.",
              "\u201d Research on gene drive technology for vector control.",
              "\u00a9 Imperial College, London The great advantage of gene drive approaches to vector control is their area-wide effect.",
              "Gene drive technology might someday play a particularly important role in hard-to-reach areas, where it may be difficult to deploy other malaria control tools as effectively, notes Santos.",
              "Coulibaly agrees: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t discriminate between poor and rich.",
              "Once the technology is employed, it can do the job wherever mosquitoes are.",
              "\u201d For now, gene drive is being tested only in large-scale laboratory experiments.",
              "But Coulibaly hopes after further study it too can help stop malaria\u2019s spread.",
              "\u201cThis is a new technology, and I cannot ask people to embrace it with closed eyes,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cBut this is also an opportunity to save more lives.",
              "\u201d Assessing the public health value of these and other new technologies is a key responsibility of WHO\u2019s Vector Control Advisory Group, a body of scientists and researchers, including Dr Coulibaly and Dr Ranson, that works to independently assess efficacy data on new tools and approaches.",
              "The group advises WHO on the epidemiological impact of these tools which, once proven, will lead to a WHO recommendation to countries on their deployment.",
              "No matter which technology they\u2019re working on, every researcher agreed that no innovation is a silver bullet on its own.",
              "Rather, each should be seen as a complementary addition to a growing malaria control tool-box.",
              "\u201cWe have to throw the kitchen sink at malaria,\u201d says Dr Parikh.",
              "\u201cIf you\u2019re only doing one thing and resistance pops up, you\u2019ve lost everything.",
              "But when you have multiple interventions out there, it protects the progress that we\u2019re making.",

              "Various types and classes of vector control interventions are available or being tested7.",
              "The mainstay of vector control worldwide has been the use of insecticides to kill or deter vectors.",

              "The sequential pattern of use of different insecticide classes observed in Africa, with a period of pyrethroid dominance followed by periods of intensive use of carbamates, organophosphates, and, most recently, neonicotinoids, suggests that a proactive strategy of frequent rotation of classes to manage resistance has generally not been implemented.",
              "The pattern was reportedly driven by national-level policy change in response to detected resistance in bioassays, or by the availability of superior alternatives products26, and possibly also by development partner contributions to subsidize newer and costlier products.",
              "For example, bendiocarb was after several years of intensive use replaced with pirimiphos-methyl because of reports of bendiocarb resistance and superior residual period of pirimiphos-methyl26.",

              "In retrospect, this pattern did not display optimal product stewardship, even as countries and programs had little choice of using several insecticide classes in annual rotations or in mosaics.",
              "Along the same line, the new product Fludora\u00ae Fusion containing clothianidin plus deltamethrin has been adopted for IRS by countries but available guidance by WHO recommends that vectors should be susceptible to the insecticides being deployed in IRS, which implies that the mixture containing a pyrethroids should not be used in areas where pyrethroid resistance has been detected.",
              "Considering the costly and lengthy process of product development22, the introduction of new products or product portfolios should come with a long-term plan for stewardship commitment by manufacturers, programs and donors aiming to preserve insecticide susceptibility in vector populations14,36.",

              "However, the speed of resistance development and reversal to susceptibility depends on variables including the initial frequency of resistance alleles, the intensity of insecticide use (including from agricultural and domestic insecticide uses), fitness cost in vector species, the resistance mechanism, and immigration of susceptible vectors39,40.",
              "Pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors across sub-Saharan Africa increased dramatically between 2005 and 201741, and in some countries within three years of ITN or IRS campaigns42.",
              "Laboratory and field evidence suggests that, in most cases, the frequency of resistance alleles decreased after the selector was removed, but reversion rates were variable43.",

              "Two main mechanisms of insecticide resistance have been identified: target site mutations (such as kdr and ace) [24,25] and metabolic resistance involving mutation, duplication, or altered regulation of enzymes and transporters that increase insecticide metabolism or excretion.",
              "Metabolic resistance has greater implications for malaria vector control because the efficacy of a range of insecticides is usually affected [5,26].",
              "Routine monitoring of insecticide susceptibility uses phenotypic bioassays that expose live mosquitoes to a single dose of a given insecticide over a fixed time period and measure mortality.",

              "hence, more laborious methods utilising a range of insecticide concentrations may be needed [27].",
              "These assays have local utility but are often logistically challenging.",
              "Larger numbers of mosquitoes can be screened using molecular techniques, although it is unclear under what conditions validated molecular markers could serve as a replacement for phenotypic assays or if this might be appropriate for malaria control programmes [28].",

              "Resistance may have an effect on insect longevity, mating competitiveness, and vectorial capacity [29,30].",
              "Alongside physiological resistance, there is potentially also behavioural resistance, as increased mosquito numbers that bite or rest outdoors have been observed.",
              "There is limited evidence on the genetic basis of behavioural resistance, but determining whether vector control interventions are selecting a heritable trait warrants further research [31].",
              "Resistance to artemisinins is assessed in clinical studies by measuring the parasite clearance in a patient in the first several days after treatment [32].",
              "A lab-based assay that correlates with the in vivo parasite response to artemisinins has also been validated [33].",
              "Mutations in the propeller domain of Kelch 13 (PF3D7_1343700) (K13) were identified as a major determinant of artemisinin resistance and may be reliable molecular markers in the GMS [34,35].",
              "Outside the GMS, parasites with K13 mutant alleles are present in many areas at low levels;",
              "there is currently no molecular evidence to suggest that these alleles are being selected [22,36\u201338].",
              "More than 100 K13 mutant alleles have been reported outside of Southeast Asia [22,38\u201340], but none have yet been associated with the slow-clearing phenotype [41].",
              "One hypothesis is that artemisinin resistance may require additional genetic determinants in these locations to allow selection of K13 mutant parasites that exhibit the slow-clearing phenotype in vivo [20,42].",
              "Nevertheless, the adoption of molecular markers to monitor drug resistance has been much faster than markers to assess insecticide resistance.",
              "Molecular markers correlated with resistance to nonartemisinin antimalarials have also been identified.",

              "falciparum dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes have been associated with resistance to SP [45].",
              "Changes in the prevalence of pfcrt and pfmdr1 alleles have been observed in many areas where ACTs including amodiaquine or lumefantrine have been intensively used [46,47].",
              "However, clinical efficacy of leading ACTs that include lumefantrine, amodiaquine, piperaquine, or mefloquine appears to remain acceptable in areas outside the GMS.",
              "Recent research suggests that plasmepsin 2\u20133 is associated with clinical and in vitro piperaquine resistance (PSA, piperaquine survival assay) but other markers could also be involved [48].",
              "In Southeast Asia, intensive use of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) in parasites already resistant to piperaquine and artemisinin has selected parasites with multiple resistance mechanisms, and high levels of treatment failure to DP are now observed in Cambodia [49].",
              "Chloroquine remains the recommended treatment for P.",
              "vivax, but resistance and declining efficacy has been noted in several populations, and ACTs are recommended in some areas [50,51].",

              "vivax, but P.",
              "vivax multidrug resistance 1 (pvmdr1) has been associated with resistance [52].",
              "Beyond this, the understanding of resistance in nonfalciparum malaria is very limited.",
              "While ecological studies have found broad evidence of dramatic health effects of spreading drug resistance [18], efficient assessment of the public health impact of antimalarial and insecticide resistance has been difficult.",
              "First, assessments of resistance prevalence are drawn from a few sentinel sites, but the heterogeneity of resistance in neighbouring populations can be enormous, making specific predictions difficult.",
              "Second, molecular markers are easier to measure at finer spatial and temporal scales, but the relationship with the drug or insecticide response is not direct [53,54].",
              "Third, most policies on malaria treatment and vector control are implemented nationally, so recommending policies for regions within a country may be operationally unfeasible.",
              "Drug resistance increases the risk of treatment failure and therefore transmission, but these relationships can be difficult to establish in the field.",
              "Human factors, especially immunity, affect treatment efficacy, so treatment failure in the whole population is not obvious until parasite resistance is well established [55].",
              "However, in children there is a clear relationship between parasitaemia and anaemia, with associated morbidity and mortality [55,56].",
              "Studies have correlated the prevalence of molecular markers with the risk of treatment failure, but no metric that works in all regions has been defined [57].",
              "As a result, the prevalence of molecular markers has had a limited impact on policies for routine antimalarial use [58].",
              "This disconnect is changing in the GMS, where ACT treatment failure has reached crisis levels [59], and rapid assessments of molecular markers for resistance to artemisinins and partner drugs are currently being used [47].",
              "There are few published studies on the epidemiological impact of insecticide resistance, so decisions rely primarily on entomological end points.",
              "Evidence from a 5-country evaluation attempted to assess whether LLINs remain effective in the presence of pyrethroid resistance, although the studies were in areas with low to moderate resistance as measured in single-dose bioassays without assessment of resistance intensity [60].",
              "This study was not able to quantify the effect on LLINs [59].",
              "For IRS, the best evidence for an epidemiological impact of pyrethroid resistance comes from settings where pyrethroids were replaced in IRS campaigns with alternative insecticides and parasite prevalence rapidly declined [61, 62].",
              "Similar evidence is available from a study in an area of Sudan with pyrethroid resistance but carbamate susceptibility, in which IRS with pyrethroids in addition to LLINs had no added impact, but changing to carbamate IRS halved the malaria incidence [60].",
              "Avoiding parasite or mosquito population exposure to a single selective agent is the central principle of resistance management.",
              "Ideally, insecticidal compounds with different modes of action should be used simultaneously or in spatial or temporal rotation.",
              "These principles, which are identical to those used in the management of insecticides used for crop pests, have been outlined in the GPIRM in malaria vectors [63].",
              "Unfortunately, implementation has been challenging;",
              "pyrethroid resistance is ubiquitous, nonpyrethroid LLINs are not currently available, and other forms of vector control can significantly increase costs [64].",
              "New public health insecticides with different modes of action are on the horizon [65], but we lack information on the effectiveness of the proposed strategies to slow the emergence or spread of insecticide resistance, and there is no clear indication of how they should be integrated alongside existing tools.",
              "This includes those that are noninsecticidal and products that work on different targets, e.",
              "g., spatial repellents and endocticides, whose efficacy may not be influenced by insecticide resistance [65].",
              "Another confounder is the application of most insecticides for both agricultural and public health use.",
              "The impact of this on public health is highly variable depending on crop type and volume and timing of insecticide application.",
              "What are the benefits of insecticide rotations, mixtures, or spatial mosaics of different compounds?",
              "What is the impact of adding nonpyrethroid IRS where LLINs are already deployed at high coverage and quality?",
              "When should new insecticides be adopted?",
              "What is the ideal rotation period or mosaic configuration?",
              "How many insecticide classes are needed for effective rotation or mosaic strategies?",
              "Despite the absence of data to answer these questions, some countries have already developed operational frameworks for resistance management that could be adopted by other programmes [66].",
              "ACTs are still effective in most regions outside the GMS.",
              "Optimisation of dose, duration of treatment, timing of treatment, and pharmacokinetic-dynamic profiles in specific subpopulations, e.",
              "g., children and pregnant women, should be systematically encouraged post-licensure to maximise efficacy and slow selection for resistance.",
              "Pooled analyses have assessed the effect of dosing strategies for the several currently used ACTs, but the uptake of this by malaria control programmes is limited [67].",
              "Molecular markers are being used in addition to therapeutic efficacy studies in specific locations in the GMS to choose treatment policies more accurately [67], but far more complete information on all ACTs is needed.",
              "Different published models diverged on the conclusion that implementation of multiple first-line therapies could more effectively prevent the emergence of drug resistance compared with the temporal rotation or sequential use of first-line treatments [68\u201371].",
              "Multiple models need to be evaluated and studies to verify this must be defined [72].",
              "We also need to better understand why parasites do not seem to have developed resistance to quinine and factor this into future drug development efforts.",
              "In Southeast Asia, the use of triple therapies using existing antimalarials is currently being tested and could be considered in the context of multidrug-resistant malaria [73].",
              "Assessment of the selective pressures and emergence of resistance to antimalarials is difficult with small-scale studies, but large-scale public health interventions may provide evidence.",
              "For example, studies should be undertaken in countries using different drug combinations for treatment and mass chemoprevention campaigns, such as seasonal malaria chemoprevention, mass drug administration, or intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp).",
              "Coordination of these interventions in the same locality may provide one way to reduce or disrupt the selection pressure exerted on a single class of compound [74].",
              "Entomological data generated by countries vary in quantity and quality, and limited information flow between entomologists, programme managers, and research institutes has hindered advocacy efforts around improved resistance management.",
