    "response": "That's a very interesting question. There are many facts about Beethoven's life and career that are surprising and little-known, but one that stands out to me is that he composed his most celebrated works after he went deaf[^2^] [^3^]. He started to lose his hearing when he was only 26 years old and at the peak of his career, and was completely deaf by the time of his death[^2^]. He suffered from a severe form of tinnitus, which meant he heard a constant ringing in his ears, and an autopsy revealed he had a distended inner ear that had developed lesions over time[^2^].\n\nThis fact sheds new light on his contributions to classical music because it shows how he overcame a tremendous personal challenge and used his inner vision and imagination to create some of the most beautiful and powerful music ever written. He withdrew from conducting and performing to focus on his compositions, which made him feel lonely and isolated, but also allowed him to experiment with new forms and styles[^2^]. His later works, such as his ninth symphony, his late string quartets, and his Missa Solemnis, are considered masterpieces of musical expression and innovation. He also influenced many composers who came after him, such as Schubert, Brahms, Wagner, and Mahler[^3^].\n\nBeethoven's deafness did not stop him from being a musical genius. On the contrary, it may have helped him to transcend the limitations of his time and create music that speaks to all generations.",

              "The players had been instructed to pay him no attention.",

              "Commissioned in 1817, the sublime work was only completed in 1824.",
              "By that time, its composer was completely and totally deaf.",
              "At the first performance, Beethoven did not notice that the massive final choral movement had ended, and one of the musicians had to turn him around to acknowledge the audience.",
              "This may seem, says researcher Natalya St.",
              "Clair in the TED-Ed video above, like some \u201ccruel joke,\u201d but it\u2019s the truth.",
              "Beethoven was so deaf that some of the most interesting artifacts he left behind are the so-called \u201cconversation books,\u201d kept from 1818 onward to communicate with visitors who had to write down their questions and replies.",
              "How then might it have been possible for the composer to create such enduringly thrilling, rapturous works of aural art?",
              "Using the delicate, melancholy \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d (which the composer wrote in 1801, when he could still hear), St.",
              "Clair attempts to show us how Beethoven used mathematical \u201cpatterns hidden beneath the beautiful sounds.",
              "\u201d (In the short video below from documentary The Genius of Beethoven, see the onset of Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss in a dramatic reading of his letters.)",
              "According to St.",
              "Clair\u2019s theory, Beethoven composed by observing \u201cthe mathematical relationship between the pitch frequency of different notes,\u201d though he did not write his symphonies in calculus.",
              "It\u2019s left rather unclear how the composer\u2019s supposed intuition of mathematics and pitch corresponds with his ability to express such a range of emotions through music.",
              "We can learn more about Beethoven\u2019s deafness and its biological relationship to his compositional style in the short video below with research fellow Edoardo Saccenti and his colleague Age Smilde from the Biosystems Data Analysis Group at Amsterdam\u2019s Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences.",
              "By counting the high and low frequencies in Beethoven\u2019s complete string quartets, a task that took Saccenti many weeks, he and his team were able to show how three distinct compositional styles \u201ccorrespond to stages in the progression of his deafness,\u201d as they write in their paper (which you can download in PDF here).",
              "The progression is unusual.",
              "As his condition worsened, Beethoven included fewer and fewer high frequency sounds in his compositions (giving cellists much more to do).",
              "By the time we get to 1824-26, \u201cthe years of the late string quartets and of complete deafness\u201d\u2014and of the completion of the 9th\u2014the high notes have returned, due in part, Smilde says, to \u201cthe balance between an auditory feedback and the inner ear.",
              "\u201d Beethoven\u2019s reliance on his \u201cinner ear\u201d made his music \u201cmuch and much richer.",
              "\u201d How?",

              "Regarding the subspecialities of the authors, there is an obvious change in the publications on this topic over the past 100 years.",
              "Whereas from 1920 to 1970, otolaryngologists represented the dominating discipline with 14 of 21 publications, in the past 50 years only 4 of 21 author groups originate from otolaryngology.",
              "So, experts from different disciplines like pharmacologists, pathologists, infectiologists, gastroenterologists, rheumatologists, neurologists, psychiatrics and even paediatricians might be increasingly interested in this topic.",
              "In the literature, several differential diagnoses regarding the aetiology of Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss have been controversially discussed.",
              "According to the number of publications, the leading cause supposed to explain Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss is otosclerosis which was already favoured in the medical literature between 1921 and 1935 by otolaryngologists [14, 15] and later in the 1970s and 1990s by a wide range of authors of different medical specialities [16, 17].",
              "Arguments supporting this diagnosis have been the age when Beethoven first experienced symptoms of hearing loss in his mid-twenties and the progressive decline of his hearing affecting both ears.",
              "In addition, some authors diagnosed conductive hearing loss in Beethoven based on a wooden drumstick that Beethoven applied to the piano and held on the other side between his teeth which is comparable to a bone conduction hearing aid.",

              "Rattel, who was not a contemporary of Beethoven.",
              "Thus, the mentioned sort of conductive hearing aid might be classified more legendary than real nowadays [18].",
              "In contrast, the medical history of Beethoven with a hearing impairment initially involving the high frequencies, a loss of discrimination, and signs of a positive recruitment is not typical in early stages of a fenestral otosclerosis, but point more to a cochlear hearing impairment.",
              "So, combined or cochlear otosclerosis might be a justifiable alternative differential diagnosis as mentioned by Shearer [17].",
              "In the postmortem protocol of Beethoven, no otosclerotic involvement of the oval window was reported, although this might easily have been visible even without a microscope according to Sorsby who excluded a combined otosclerosis [19].",
              "The remaining pure cochlear otosclerosis is defined as a focus of otosclerosis located in the otic capsule involving the cochlear endosteum, causing sensorineural hearing loss without any stapes fixation.",
              "However, the prevalence of pure cochlear otosclerosis might be low even if the current data situation is still unclear.",
              "Whereas clinical\u2013radiological studies report patients with a pure cochlear sensorineural type of otosclerosis [20], otopathologic studies indicate that this type of pathology is very rare with a prevalence of only 1% of all patients with otosclerosis [21].",
              "According to these data, Beethoven would have suffered from a very rare sub-entity of otosclerosis if cochlear otosclerosis was the underlying cause of his hearing impairment.",
              "Syphilis is the aetiology second most accused of being the cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss.",
              "In the nineteenth century, syphilis was a very common venereal infectious disease which was considered the cause of Beethoven\u2019s deafness by several non-medical authors and the composer\u2019s biographers.",

              "Grove was the first who mentioned this in the first edition of his musicology dictionary \u201cGrove\u2019s dictionary of Music and Musicians\u201d in 1879 by the entry \u201cthe whole of these [postmortem] appearances are most probably the result of syphilitic affections at an early period of his life\u201d.",

              "Even in the 1920s and 1930s, some authors still favoured the hypothesis of tertiary syphilis as the cause of his hearing loss [23].",
              "However, in 1930 the otolaryngologist Sorsby published arguments against syphilis as the cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss.",
              "He stated that no sudden onset or sudden total deafness or vertigo or nystagmus as commonly seen in syphilis patients had been described in Beethoven\u2019s medical history [19].",
              "So, in the following decades syphilis was only sporadically mentioned [24], and Shearer mentioned even in 1990 that McCabe was still the only modern otologist who defended the aetiology of syphilis [17, 24].",
              "Even if a tertiary syphilis might explain the mentioned atrophy of the cochlear nerve due to meningeal irritation, and even if an uveitis as an inflammatory ocular disease might be part of a neurosyphilis complex, there were no other signs of advanced syphilis such as headache, hemiplegia, dysphasia and seizures and no autoptic evidence as gumma and tabes dorsalis.",
              "Also, the early beginning of the hearing loss at the age of 26 years is unlikely in tertiary neurosyphilis, and the pace of progression of the hearing impairment is different from the pace of progression in meningovascular syphilis patients [25].",
              "In addition to the missing typical anamnestic and autoptic findings regarding the signs of syphilis in Beethoven, a more recent examination of a ringlet of the composer in 2000 demonstrated that there was no detectable mercury in Beethoven\u2019s hair which makes syphilis therapy with mercury unlikely [26].",
              "In opposition to these arguments against syphilis as the cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing impairment, the syphilis diagnosis has gained interest again in the medical literature of the twenty-first century by up to now four authors with medical specialization in infectiology, neurology, and psychiatry favouring this aetiology anew [27\u201330].",
              "Overall, syphilis is still one of the aetiologies which has most often been accused of being the cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss by medical publishers over the past 100 years.",
              "However, in the literature published by otolaryngologists, this differential diagnosis has not been favoured any more during the last 50 years even if nowadays the diagnosis of otosyphilis still needs to be considered in the differential diagnostic mind of the clinical otologists as recently mentioned by Theeuwen [31].",
              "Besides otosclerosis, another bone-remodelling disease with fixation of the stapes, the Paget \u0301s disease, was accused of being the cause of Beethoven\u2019s deafness in perennial publications from 1965 up to these days [32, 33].",
              "About 50% of patients with Paget\u2019s disease are known to suffer from hearing loss which can be caused by multiple mechanisms including, e.",
              "g., a fixation of the stapes footplate, a diminished mineral density of the cochlear capsule with microfractures and a damage of the cochlear nerve by a bony overgrowth and compression in tiny foramina before and within the internal auditory canal [33].",
              "The authors supporting this hypothesis based their argumentation on the report that the dense skull was twice as thick as normal and on the documentation of a narrowed bony part of the Eustachian tube in the autopsy protocol of Beethoven as well as on Beethoven\u2019s facial characteristics such as his big head and jaw.",
              "Furthermore, an atrophy of the cochlear nerve which was mentioned in the autopsy protocol and Beethoven\u2019s statement that he completely lost his ability to hear after a fall in 1815 [8] were appraised as secondary clues for an underlying Paget \u0301s disease.",
              "In addition, an increased blood supply and hyperplasia of the vessels of the temporal bones as mentioned in the autopsy protocol of Beethoven can also be seen in patients with Paget\u2019s disease.",
              "However, only 3% of patients with Paget\u2019s disease present symptoms under the age of 30 years [34], and in most cases hearing impairment initially starts with either a mixed or a conductive hearing loss affecting mostly the lower frequencies in contrast to Beethoven who presented with a hearing loss in the high frequencies.",
              "In addition, in 1986 the pathologists Jesserer and Bankl examined parietal bone fragments of the skull of Beethoven without finding any macropathological or radiological signs of Paget\u2019s disease.",
              "Bilateral involvement of the temporal bones by osteodystrophic changes in the mid-twenties without any inclusion of the adjacent parietal parts up to the fifth decade of life have to be considered as quite unlikely [5].",
              "From 1920 up to the turn of the millennium, neural deafness was periodically accused of being the underlying cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing impairment [35, 36].",
              "This assumption was mainly based on the fact that the atrophy of the cochlear nerves which was described could not entirely be explained by any other aetiology.",
              "However, a convincing pathophysiologic cause was not answered by these publications [35, 37].",
              "Furthermore, the anamnestic cues of a positive recruitment by Beethoven himself are not compatible with the hypothesis of a neural origin, but rather point more towards a cochlear hearing impairment.",
              "Beethoven himself assumed a relationship between his lifelong gastrointestinal problems and his hearing impairment.",
              "This is also reflected throughout the medical literature during the last 100 years.",
              "While assumptions about a toxic labyrinthitis or an unspecified cochlear nerve disorder caused by intestinal problems which were popular in the 1920s and 1930s [37, 38] are no longer tenable today, the assumption of an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with an immunopathy of the inner ear was first expressed by Davies in 1988 and elaborated later by Karmody in 2005 [40].",
              "This goes in line with the first description of an autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss by McCabe in 1979 [39\u201341].",
              "Several authors attributed Beethoven\u2019s intestinal disorder to ulcerative colitis [42] or more rarely to Crohn\u2019s disease [43] which are subsets of IBD.",
              "Especially in ulcerative colitis, an autoimmune-mediated sensorineural hearing loss might become an extraintestinal manifestation of an IBD [44] and an underlying ulcerative colitis also might explain other maladies of Beethoven such as joint pains, facial rash, and uveitis [40].",
              "However, up to now research regarding extraintestinal otologic manifestations of ulcerative colitis is rare and the prevalence of a profound hearing loss as a consequence of an IBD has not yet been clarified.",
              "One argument against the hypothesis of an autoimmune-mediated sensorineural hearing loss is the period of appearance of Beethoven\u2019s hearing impairment;",
              "an autoimmune-mediated hearing loss usually occurs during weeks or months but not years as it was the case with Beethoven [45].",
              "In addition, according to the primary literature there was no history of rectal bleeding during his lifetime and the autopsy protocol revealed an intestinal tract filled with air and without adhesions, strictures, or perforations.",
              "This strongly argues against the hypothesis that Beethoven suffered from IBD at all [46].",
              "In the 1990s, Drake and Palverman favoured independently of each other sarcoidosis as a diagnosis, as sarcoidosis encompasses most of the different diseases that Beethoven had.",
              "The multisystemic involvement of sarcoidosis can cause chronic active hepatitis followed by cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease, post-dysenteric seronegative arthropathy, hypercalcemia, and nephrolithiasis [47].",
              "In 5% of subjects with sarcoidosis, the nervous system is involved.",
              "Neurosarcoidosis might explain Beethoven\u2019s deafness [48].",
              "But although bilateral auditory nerve deafness has been reported in sarcoidosis, this is associated with a thickening but not with an atrophy of the cochlear nerves as it was described in Beethoven\u2019s autopsy protocol.",
              "In addition, neurosarcoidosis usually encompasses a clinical involvement of the facial nerve which was not found in Beethoven.",
              "Not least, no gross pathology of lung and heart was mentioned in his autopsy protocol.",
              "It lasted up to 2013, that lead intoxication was mentioned in the medical literature as a potential cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss.",
              "Evaluations of Beethoven\u2019s hair and parietal skull bones in the first decade of this century revealed substantially elevated lead levels indicating chronic lead exposure which might have caused lead poisoning [6, 7].",
              "Whereas subacute lead poisoning notoriously induces a motor neurone disorder, long-term lead exposure can result in a slowly progressive high-frequency hearing loss [49] probably caused by axonal degeneration of the cochlear nerve.",
              "Stevens explained a chronic lead exposure of Beethoven by his long-lasting consumption of wine, which might have started at the age of 17 after the death of his mother.",
              "At that time, lead was added to improve the flavour of cheaper wines like the Hungarian ones preferred by Beethoven [45].",
              "Other sequelae of chronic lead intoxication such as abdominal colic, hepatotoxicity, and kidney damage as reported by Beethoven support this hypothesis.",
              "Recently, Brotto underlined this hypothesis with regard to Beethoven\u2019s autoptic findings of wrinkled cochlear nerves that lacked pith without a medulla [50].",
              "However, up to now the scientific data regarding the prevalence and extent of hearing loss induced by chronic lead exposure is still rare.",
              "Therefore, it remains difficult to clearly associate Beethoven\u2019s hearing impairment with a chronic exposure of lead.",
              "Beethoven\u2019s explicit wish to clarify the cause of his deafness after his death has been fulfilled in numerous medical publications.",
              "Based on primary historical sources including the autopsy report and more recent investigations of probes of his skull and hair, several different hypotheses on the aetiology of the hearing impairment of Beethoven have been postulated.",
              "Otosclerosis and syphilis have been the predominant supposed causes in the medical literature of the past 100 years, whereby the long-rejected hypothesis of syphilis has shown a surprising and probably questionable revival during the last 20 years.",
              "In addition to numerous other causes, the hypothesis of a chronic lead intoxication has recently been developed in the medical literature over the past decade.",
              "To date, no single aetiology exists which might on its own completely explain Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s hearing impairment without a pertinent argument against this hypothesis.",
              "So, it is most likely that the question regarding the irrevocable cause of his deafness will probably remain unanswered forever.",
              "Whereas during his lifetime only insufficient hearing rehabilitation via hearing aids in the form of ear trumpets and a resonating plate was available, it is supposed that Beethoven would now probably benefit from an electrical stimulation by a cochlear implant.",
              "In this context, it has to be mentioned that the composer anticipated the physical fundamentals of this therapeutic option already at the beginning of his hearing loss when he wrote in 1801: \u201cI hear wonders of galvanism;",
              "what do you say to it?",
              "A physician told me that he knew a deaf and dumb child whose hearing was restored by it, and likewise a man who had been deaf for seven years, and recovered his hearing\u201d [8].",

              "So, combined or cochlear otosclerosis might be a justifiable alternative differential diagnosis as mentioned by Shearer [17].",
              "In the postmortem protocol of Beethoven, no otosclerotic involvement of the oval window was reported, although this might easily have been visible even without a microscope according to Sorsby who excluded a combined otosclerosis [19].",
              "The remaining pure cochlear otosclerosis is defined as a focus of otosclerosis located in the otic capsule involving the cochlear endosteum, causing sensorineural hearing loss without any stapes fixation.",
              "However, the prevalence of pure cochlear otosclerosis might be low even if the current data situation is still unclear.",
              "Whereas clinical\u2013radiological studies report patients with a pure cochlear sensorineural type of otosclerosis [20], otopathologic studies indicate that this type of pathology is very rare with a prevalence of only 1% of all patients with otosclerosis [21].",
              "According to these data, Beethoven would have suffered from a very rare sub-entity of otosclerosis if cochlear otosclerosis was the underlying cause of his hearing impairment.",
              "Syphilis is the aetiology second most accused of being the cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss.",
              "In the nineteenth century, syphilis was a very common venereal infectious disease which was considered the cause of Beethoven\u2019s deafness by several non-medical authors and the composer\u2019s biographers.",
              "The non-physician G.",
              "Grove was the first who mentioned this in the first edition of his musicology dictionary \u201cGrove\u2019s dictionary of Music and Musicians\u201d in 1879 by the entry \u201cthe whole of these [postmortem] appearances are most probably the result of syphilitic affections at an early period of his life\u201d.",
              "This statement had been initiated by third-hand information of the biographer A.",
              "W.",
              "Thayer who assumed Beethoven had syphilis based on two prescriptions for Beethoven by his physician Dr.",
              "Bertolini in 1820 for medication containing mercury [22].",
              "Even in the 1920s and 1930s, some authors still favoured the hypothesis of tertiary syphilis as the cause of his hearing loss [23].",
              "However, in 1930 the otolaryngologist Sorsby published arguments against syphilis as the cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss.",
              "He stated that no sudden onset or sudden total deafness or vertigo or nystagmus as commonly seen in syphilis patients had been described in Beethoven\u2019s medical history [19].",
              "So, in the following decades syphilis was only sporadically mentioned [24], and Shearer mentioned even in 1990 that McCabe was still the only modern otologist who defended the aetiology of syphilis [17, 24].",
              "Even if a tertiary syphilis might explain the mentioned atrophy of the cochlear nerve due to meningeal irritation, and even if an uveitis as an inflammatory ocular disease might be part of a neurosyphilis complex, there were no other signs of advanced syphilis such as headache, hemiplegia, dysphasia and seizures and no autoptic evidence as gumma and tabes dorsalis.",
              "Also, the early beginning of the hearing loss at the age of 26 years is unlikely in tertiary neurosyphilis, and the pace of progression of the hearing impairment is different from the pace of progression in meningovascular syphilis patients [25].",
              "In addition to the missing typical anamnestic and autoptic findings regarding the signs of syphilis in Beethoven, a more recent examination of a ringlet of the composer in 2000 demonstrated that there was no detectable mercury in Beethoven\u2019s hair which makes syphilis therapy with mercury unlikely [26].",
              "In opposition to these arguments against syphilis as the cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing impairment, the syphilis diagnosis has gained interest again in the medical literature of the twenty-first century by up to now four authors with medical specialization in infectiology, neurology, and psychiatry favouring this aetiology anew [27,28,29,30].",
              "Overall, syphilis is still one of the aetiologies which has most often been accused of being the cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss by medical publishers over the past 100 years.",
              "However, in the literature published by otolaryngologists, this differential diagnosis has not been favoured any more during the last 50 years even if nowadays the diagnosis of otosyphilis still needs to be considered in the differential diagnostic mind of the clinical otologists as recently mentioned by Theeuwen [31].",
              "Besides otosclerosis, another bone-remodelling disease with fixation of the stapes, the Paget \u0301s disease, was accused of being the cause of Beethoven\u2019s deafness in perennial publications from 1965 up to these days [32, 33].",
              "About 50% of patients with Paget\u2019s disease are known to suffer from hearing loss which can be caused by multiple mechanisms including, e.",
              "g., a fixation of the stapes footplate, a diminished mineral density of the cochlear capsule with microfractures and a damage of the cochlear nerve by a bony overgrowth and compression in tiny foramina before and within the internal auditory canal [33].",
              "The authors supporting this hypothesis based their argumentation on the report that the dense skull was twice as thick as normal and on the documentation of a narrowed bony part of the Eustachian tube in the autopsy protocol of Beethoven as well as on Beethoven\u2019s facial characteristics such as his big head and jaw.",
              "Furthermore, an atrophy of the cochlear nerve which was mentioned in the autopsy protocol and Beethoven\u2019s statement that he completely lost his ability to hear after a fall in 1815 [8] were appraised as secondary clues for an underlying Paget \u0301s disease.",
              "In addition, an increased blood supply and hyperplasia of the vessels of the temporal bones as mentioned in the autopsy protocol of Beethoven can also be seen in patients with Paget\u2019s disease.",
              "However, only 3% of patients with Paget\u2019s disease present symptoms under the age of 30 years [34], and in most cases hearing impairment initially starts with either a mixed or a conductive hearing loss affecting mostly the lower frequencies in contrast to Beethoven who presented with a hearing loss in the high frequencies.",
              "In addition, in 1986 the pathologists Jesserer and Bankl examined parietal bone fragments of the skull of Beethoven without finding any macropathological or radiological signs of Paget\u2019s disease.",
              "Bilateral involvement of the temporal bones by osteodystrophic changes in the mid-twenties without any inclusion of the adjacent parietal parts up to the fifth decade of life have to be considered as quite unlikely [5].",
              "From 1920 up to the turn of the millennium, neural deafness was periodically accused of being the underlying cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing impairment [35, 36].",
              "This assumption was mainly based on the fact that the atrophy of the cochlear nerves which was described could not entirely be explained by any other aetiology.",
              "However, a convincing pathophysiologic cause was not answered by these publications [35, 37].",
              "Furthermore, the anamnestic cues of a positive recruitment by Beethoven himself are not compatible with the hypothesis of a neural origin, but rather point more towards a cochlear hearing impairment.",
              "Beethoven himself assumed a relationship between his lifelong gastrointestinal problems and his hearing impairment.",
              "This is also reflected throughout the medical literature during the last 100 years.",
              "While assumptions about a toxic labyrinthitis or an unspecified cochlear nerve disorder caused by intestinal problems which were popular in the 1920s and 1930s [37, 38] are no longer tenable today, the assumption of an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with an immunopathy of the inner ear was first expressed by Davies in 1988 and elaborated later by Karmody in 2005 [40].",
              "This goes in line with the first description of an autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss by McCabe in 1979 [39,40,41].",
              "Several authors attributed Beethoven\u2019s intestinal disorder to ulcerative colitis [42] or more rarely to Crohn\u2019s disease [43] which are subsets of IBD.",
              "Especially in ulcerative colitis, an autoimmune-mediated sensorineural hearing loss might become an extraintestinal manifestation of an IBD [44] and an underlying ulcerative colitis also might explain other maladies of Beethoven such as joint pains, facial rash, and uveitis [40].",
              "However, up to now research regarding extraintestinal otologic manifestations of ulcerative colitis is rare and the prevalence of a profound hearing loss as a consequence of an IBD has not yet been clarified.",
              "One argument against the hypothesis of an autoimmune-mediated sensorineural hearing loss is the period of appearance of Beethoven\u2019s hearing impairment;",
              "an autoimmune-mediated hearing loss usually occurs during weeks or months but not years as it was the case with Beethoven [45].",
              "In addition, according to the primary literature there was no history of rectal bleeding during his lifetime and the autopsy protocol revealed an intestinal tract filled with air and without adhesions, strictures, or perforations.",
              "This strongly argues against the hypothesis that Beethoven suffered from IBD at all [46].",
              "In the 1990s, Drake and Palverman favoured independently of each other sarcoidosis as a diagnosis, as sarcoidosis encompasses most of the different diseases that Beethoven had.",
              "The multisystemic involvement of sarcoidosis can cause chronic active hepatitis followed by cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease, post-dysenteric seronegative arthropathy, hypercalcemia, and nephrolithiasis [47].",
              "In 5% of subjects with sarcoidosis, the nervous system is involved.",
              "Neurosarcoidosis might explain Beethoven\u2019s deafness [48].",
              "But although bilateral auditory nerve deafness has been reported in sarcoidosis, this is associated with a thickening but not with an atrophy of the cochlear nerves as it was described in Beethoven\u2019s autopsy protocol.",
              "In addition, neurosarcoidosis usually encompasses a clinical involvement of the facial nerve which was not found in Beethoven.",
              "Not least, no gross pathology of lung and heart was mentioned in his autopsy protocol.",
              "It lasted up to 2013, that lead intoxication was mentioned in the medical literature as a potential cause of Beethoven\u2019s hearing loss.",
              "Evaluations of Beethoven\u2019s hair and parietal skull bones in the first decade of this century revealed substantially elevated lead levels indicating chronic lead exposure which might have caused lead poisoning [6, 7].",
              "Whereas subacute lead poisoning notoriously induces a motor neurone disorder, long-term lead exposure can result in a slowly progressive high-frequency hearing loss [49] probably caused by axonal degeneration of the cochlear nerve.",
              "Stevens explained a chronic lead exposure of Beethoven by his long-lasting consumption of wine, which might have started at the age of 17 after the death of his mother.",
              "At that time, lead was added to improve the flavour of cheaper wines like the Hungarian ones preferred by Beethoven [45].",
              "Other sequelae of chronic lead intoxication such as abdominal colic, hepatotoxicity, and kidney damage as reported by Beethoven support this hypothesis.",
              "Recently, Brotto underlined this hypothesis with regard to Beethoven\u2019s autoptic findings of wrinkled cochlear nerves that lacked pith without a medulla [50].",
              "However, up to now the scientific data regarding the prevalence and extent of hearing loss induced by chronic lead exposure is still rare.",
              "Therefore, it remains difficult to clearly associate Beethoven\u2019s hearing impairment with a chronic exposure of lead.",
              "Beethoven\u2019s explicit wish to clarify the cause of his deafness after his death has been fulfilled in numerous medical publications.",
              "Based on primary historical sources including the autopsy report and more recent investigations of probes of his skull and hair, several different hypotheses on the aetiology of the hearing impairment of Beethoven have been postulated.",
              "Otosclerosis and syphilis have been the predominant supposed causes in the medical literature of the past 100 years, whereby the long-rejected hypothesis of syphilis has shown a surprising and probably questionable revival during the last 20 years.",
              "In addition to numerous other causes, the hypothesis of a chronic lead intoxication has recently been developed in the medical literature over the past decade.",
              "To date, no single aetiology exists which might on its own completely explain Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s hearing impairment without a pertinent argument against this hypothesis.",
              "So, it is most likely that the question regarding the irrevocable cause of his deafness will probably remain unanswered forever.",
              "Whereas during his lifetime only insufficient hearing rehabilitation via hearing aids in the form of ear trumpets and a resonating plate was available, it is supposed that Beethoven would now probably benefit from an electrical stimulation by a cochlear implant.",
              "In this context, it has to be mentioned that the composer anticipated the physical fundamentals of this therapeutic option already at the beginning of his hearing loss when he wrote in 1801: \u201cI hear wonders of galvanism;",
              "what do you say to it?",
              "A physician told me that he knew a deaf and dumb child whose hearing was restored by it, and likewise a man who had been deaf for seven years, and recovered his hearing\u201d [8].",
              "To predict the outcome of such a treatment, the irrevocable identification of the aetiology of his hearing loss\u2014especially regarding the possible neural pathophysiologic cause\u2014would be of therapeutic importance.",

              "How he dealt with this deafness is one of the great stories of humanity, not just of music.",
              "Beethoven began losing his hearing in his mid-20s, after already building a reputation as a musician and composer.",
              "The cause of his deafness remains a mystery, though modern analysis of his DNA revealed health issues including large amounts of lead in his system.",

              "The effect of his gradual descent into deafness upon his music corresponded to the three generally accepted periods of his career (early, middle, and late) in revealing ways.",

              "\u201d \u2013 Ludwig van Beethoven, 1802, \u201cHeilegenstadt Testament\u201d In his 20s, Beethoven began experiencing issues with his hearing.",
              "The first symptom was tinnitus, a high-pitched droning sound that interferes with clarity and definition in hearing.",
              "By then, Beethoven was already well known as a composer and performer, and of course he continued to compose until his death at the age of 56.",
              "However, his career as a performer (he was a gifted pianist from a very young age) ended when the tinnitus overwhelmed his ability to hear his own playing, much less the other instruments onstage.",
              "Beethoven\u2019s gradually intensifying hearing problems, of course, were a source of great concern for him and figure prominently in the above-quoted \u201cHeilegenstadt Testament,\u201d a letter he wrote to his brothers in 1802.",
              "In that remarkable document, discovered among his papers after his death, he shares that his hearing loss sparked in him a life-and-death crisis, writing, \u201cI would have ended my life \u2013 it was only my art that held me back.",

              "In fact, not only did he continue, but his music changed, deepened, and became even more profound as he slipped ineluctably into his final years of profound deafness.",
              "It\u2019s generally accepted that Beethoven\u2019s music can be divided into three eras, roughly.",
              "His early period begins with his first compositions in the 1780s and ends around 1801.",
              "His middle period runs through about 1814.",
              "And his final, or \u201cmature\u201d period concludes with his death in 1827.",
              "According to the Beethoven \u201cDigital Archive,\u201d \u201cBeethoven\u2019s work comprises 722 larger and smaller compositions.",

              "\u201d Let\u2019s explore how Beethoven\u2019s hearing issues affected the three stages of his growth as an artist, and how he focused his considerable gifts to respond to the challenges posed by his gradual inability to hear normally the music he composed.",
              "We\u2019ll examine each of these periods and explore how the slow but relentless progress of deafness may have influenced his approach to composition differently in each of the eras.",
              "During Beethoven\u2019s early years as a musician, when his hearing was not an issue, he was strongly influenced by Bach, Haydn, and Mozart, masters of the age whose work he found inspiring.",
              "In fact, he studied with Haydn and others, in Vienna, and several early works in a strong upper range were clearly indebted to Mozart.",
              "The influence of Mozart and Haydn can be heard in the Piano Sonata No.",

              "13, Pathe\u0301tique.",

              "Already, the young maestro was experimenting with big sounds and even bigger emotions.",
              "Another striking piece from his early period is the Moonlight Sonata (Piano Sonata No.",

              "27, No.",
              "2).",
              "This lovely and deeply expressive piece shows the composer in a thoughtful and reflective mood, selecting notes in ranges not yet affected by his incipient tinnitus, and soft tones to express his musical feelings and ideas.",
              "Watch the story of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No.",
              "14: Moonlight Sonata It has been said of Beethoven that he was fully deaf when he wrote all his great works, but that he was able to compose, perform, and even conduct his work without being able to hear a note.",
              "This is a lovely myth, but it does not take into consideration the progressive nature of his hearing loss.",
              "The reality is that it\u2019s quite possible to chart his slow but steady descent into total deafness through the periods of his career.",
              "It was during Beethoven\u2019s middle period, approximately 1801 to 1814, that the hearing problems became more apparent.",
              "He became acutely aware of the tinnitus and a gradual worsening of his hearing.",
              "In these years, his music got louder, deeper, and grander \u2013 and, perhaps as a direct result, his star began to ascend as he captured strong emotions in his work.",
              "Representative work from this period would include the Symphony No.",
              "3, Op.",
              "55, Eroica, as well as the Piano Sonata No.",
              "23, Op.",
              "57, Appassionata.",
              "The \u201cmiddle period\u201d is sometimes referred to as Beethoven\u2019s \u201cheroic\u201d era, as the composer began to conceive many of his works on a grand scale.",
              "In this period, Beethoven\u2019s work to a large degree lost its brightness and high tones, which were supplanted by the more resonant tones of the deeper ranges that he could still hear despite that continuous ringing caused by the tinnitus.",
              "Watch how Beethoven advanced the development of the piano through works like his Piano Sonata No.",
              "23: Appassionata Although, like Mozart, Beethoven was a man of the Enlightenment, these timeless classics linked him to the birth of the Romantic Era in music and art, in which an individual\u2019s feelings became primary in aesthetic expression.",
              "As Beethoven\u2019s fame grew, he had the great fortune to have patrons compete over his services.",
              "As a result, he was in the enviable position of being a truly independent composer.",
              "For example, when he was offered a sizeable sum to take a position as a court composer in Italy, in 1809, a small group of his wealthy patrons banded together to support him with an annual grant of 4,000 florins (a grand sum at the time) to remain in Vienna.",
              "There he would be free to write whatever he wanted, on his own schedule, and not be wholly dependent upon commissions, occasional music, or a court appointment.",
              "In 1811 Beethoven had to give up his lucrative career as a performer due to hearing loss.",
              "He did not appear onstage again until 1824, when he \u201cconducted\u201d \u2013 or, more properly, \u201cdirected\u201d \u2013 the premiere of his Symphony No.",
              "9 by giving cues to the conductor.",
              "This masterful late period, from approximately 1815 to his death in 1827, corresponded with Beethoven\u2019s final descent into complete deafness.",
              "By this time, he was using \u201cconversation books\u201d to communicate with those around him and was employing his prodigious gift for musical composition to create some of his most memorable, mysterious, and transcendent work.",
              "The musical setting for his Catholic Mass, the Missa Solemnis, is a superb example.",
              "Beethoven called this the greatest work he had ever composed, and many would agree.",
              "Despite his total inability to hear, he nonetheless composed music of great complexity that presented technical challenges for virtuoso performers.",
              "The music is of great range, in tone, tempo, and timbre.",
              "It might be said that he vanquished his deafness as he pushed his inventiveness along with his mastery of composition to new heights.",
              "The deepest and most acclaimed music of this period would be his chef-d\u2019oeuvre, the grand Symphony No.",
              "9, Op.",
              "125.",
              "This massive work in four unforgettable movements famously incorporates a full chorus singing Friedrich Schiller\u2019s poem \u201cOde to Joy,\u201d which serves as the climax of the symphony \u2013 and, one might say, of Beethoven\u2019s singular career.",
              "Watch how Beethoven's grand Symphony No.",
              "9 earned the admoration of contemporary audiences, yet Beethoven was unable to hear his aclaim.",
              "Beethoven\u2019s health steadily declined during his 50s.",
              "His hearing was gone, and he started to have physical symptoms of severe gastrointestinal distress that left him weak and bedridden.",
              "From late 1826 he was quite ill, and doctors reached a point where they believed that all they could do had been done.",
              "His closest friends and a sister-in-law were present by his bed on March 26, 1827, as he breathed his final breaths.",
              "The actual cause of his death remains undetermined, but liver disease is the likeliest reason.",
              "The autopsy revealed a severe case of cirrhosis of the liver and some evidence of lead poisoning.",
              "Cirrhosis, of course, is often associated with excessive drinking of alcohol, but the effect of lead has been a subject of speculation.",
              "It is possible that Beethoven was in the custom of drinking wine with lead as an additive (used as a fortifier), and equally possible that his doctors attempted to treat his illnesses, and possibly his deafness, with medicines containing lead.",
              "How do we sum up Beethoven\u2019s life and art?",
              "It would be nearly impossible to exaggerate the profound influence he had on the evolution of music and the introduction of Romantic ideals into the cultural life of his time.",

              "123, was written during one of the most challenging periods of Beethoven\u2019s life.",
              "By this time, his hearing had deteriorated significantly, leading to a near-total deafness.",
              "This loss, while devastating, pushed Beethoven to retreat into a world of introspection, where music became his primary means of communication and expression.",
              "The work was originally intended as a gift for his close friend and pupil, Archduke Rudolph of Austria, on the occasion of his installation as Archbishop.",
              "Beethoven had a profound respect and admiration for the Archduke, who was not just his pupil, but also a benefactor and a trusted friend.",

              "Interestingly, the Missa solemnis was not completed in time for the Archduke\u2019s installation\u2014it took Beethoven almost four years to finalize.",
              "This delay was in part due to Beethoven\u2019s meticulous nature and his desire to create a perfect liturgical work.",

              "His declining health, legal battles over the custody of his nephew, and the ever-present specter of deafness weighed heavily on him.",
              "Yet, amidst these trials, the Missa solemnis became an outlet, a work of catharsis and reflection.",
              "The period in which Beethoven composed the Missa solemnis was also one of significant creativity and output.",
              "Despite his personal adversities, he produced other notable works, like the late string quartets and the Ninth Symphony.",
              "But it\u2019s evident that the Missa solemnis held a unique place in his heart, given the time, effort, and emotion he poured into it.",

              "\u201d Unlike the \u201cmissa brevis,\u201d which focuses on brevity and may omit certain sections for expediency, the \u201cMissa solemnis\u201d is expansive, aiming to capture the full gravity and reverence of the occasion.",
              "It\u2019s not just a musical setting of the ordinary mass but a profound spiritual and artistic statement.",
              "For Beethoven, choosing to title his work \u201cMissa solemnis\u201d signified not just the liturgical importance of the composition but also its personal significance to him.",
              "While he had composed a mass earlier in his career\u2014the Missa in C major, Op.",
              "86\u2014this later work was more ambitious, both in scale and intent.",
              "It wasn\u2019t merely a liturgical piece;",
              "it was an exploration of faith, doubt, hope, and humanity\u2019s relationship with the divine.",
              "Beethoven\u2019s choice of the \u201cMissa solemnis\u201d as a vehicle for such exploration can be seen as a reflection of his respect for tradition coupled with a desire to transcend it.",
              "In his hands, the \u201cMissa solemnis\u201d became more than a sacred ritual\u2014it transformed into a universal testament to the human spirit\u2019s resilience and quest for meaning.",
              "The Missa solemnis follows the traditional structure of the Latin Mass, divided into five primary sections.",
              "Each of these sections offers a unique musical experience, showcasing Beethoven\u2019s genius in fusing liturgical tradition with his innovative compositional style.",
              "The opening section, the Kyrie, is a plea for mercy.",
              "Beethoven sets this text in a three-part structure, corresponding to its liturgical division: \u201cKyrie eleison\u201d (Lord, have mercy), \u201cChriste eleison\u201d (Christ, have mercy), and a return to \u201cKyrie eleison\u201d.",
              "The music is marked by its solemnity, with the orchestra and choir interweaving motifs in a delicate dance of reverence.",
              "The Gloria is a vibrant hymn of praise to God.",
              "Beethoven\u2019s setting is expansive, exploring a range of emotions from jubilant exaltation in \u201cGloria in excelsis Deo\u201d (Glory to God in the highest) to profound gratitude in \u201cGratias agimus tibi\u201d (We give you thanks).",
              "It also includes the serene \u201cQui tollis peccata mundi\u201d (Who takes away the sins of the world) and culminates in a joyous \u201cIn gloria Dei Patris.",

              "Amen).",

              "This is the longest section of the mass and presents the core beliefs of Christianity.",
              "Beethoven\u2019s setting is both assertive and reflective, capturing the unwavering nature of faith.",
              "Notably, the \u201cEt incarnatus est\u201d (And was incarnate) section is rendered with particular tenderness, emphasizing the mystery of the Incarnation.",
              "The Sanctus declares the holiness of God, with the words \u201cSanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus\u201d (Holy, Holy, Holy) being a central motif.",
              "Beethoven introduces this section with a majestic orchestral prelude, leading to the choir\u2019s angelic declarations.",
              "The Benedictus, which follows, is a blessing and a recognition of the divine presence, often characterized by its more ethereal and tranquil musical setting.",
              "The Agnus Dei is a plea for peace and mercy.",
              "Beethoven\u2019s setting is unique, interspersing the traditional text with a militaristic orchestral interlude, perhaps reflecting the turbulent times in which he lived.",
              "This interplay between the spiritual and the temporal, between prayer and worldly concerns, makes this section particularly poignant.",
              "Throughout these sections, Beethoven masterfully balances the requirements of the liturgical text with his personal musical language.",
              "The result is a work that, while rooted in tradition, feels timeless and universally resonant.",
              "Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s genius lay not just in his ability to convey profound emotion but also in his transformative approach to musical structure and innovation.",
              "The Missa solemnis stands as a testament to these attributes, showcasing several pioneering techniques and approaches that have made the piece a cornerstone in choral literature.",
              "While the Missa solemnis is a choral work, Beethoven infused it with a symphonic spirit.",
              "The orchestra is not just an accompanying force but an integral voice, often engaging in dialogues with the choir, trading motifs, and driving the narrative forward.",
              "This symphonic approach results in a richer texture and depth, making the work a symphony of voices and instruments.",
              "Fugues are intricate musical structures where a theme or motif is introduced by one voice and then imitated by other voices in succession.",
              "Beethoven employs fugues masterfully in the Missa solemnis, notably in parts of the Gloria and Credo.",
              "These sections are not just demonstrations of contrapuntal prowess but serve to heighten the intensity and complexity of the text\u2019s declarations.",
              "Rather than introducing new thematic material continually, Beethoven often chooses to take a motif and develop or vary it throughout a movement.",
              "This approach can be seen in the way he manipulates the \u201cKyrie eleison\u201d theme or the \u201cCredo\u201d proclamation.",
              "Such developments offer listeners a journey of familiarity laced with surprise, as themes evolve and transform.",
              "One of the standout features of the Missa solemnis is its vast emotional landscape.",
              "From the serene pleas of the Kyrie to the jubilant declarations of the Gloria, Beethoven employs a wide dynamic range and dramatic contrasts.",
              "Sudden shifts, unexpected pauses, and moments of silence are all tools in his arsenal, ensuring that the listener is always engaged and often moved.",
              "While the choir is central to the Missa solemnis, Beethoven frequently weaves in solo voices and smaller ensembles.",
              "These moments, such as the quartet in the Benedictus, provide an intimate counterpoint to the grand choral statements, allowing for personal reflections within the broader communal narrative.",
              "In the Missa solemnis, Beethoven pushed the boundaries of what a liturgical setting could achieve, both musically and emotionally.",
              "His innovations, while rooted in the classical tradition, pointed the way forward, influencing generations of composers who sought to marry the sacred with the symphonic.",
              "While Beethoven\u2019s works often carried profound personal significance, the Missa solemnis held a particular place in his heart, mirroring his internal struggles and spiritual journey during its composition.",
              "Understanding this personal connection can provide deeper insights into the work\u2019s emotional landscape and overarching themes.",
              "The period during which Beethoven composed the Missa solemnis was fraught with challenges.",
              "His increasing deafness isolated him from society, and he experienced intense personal hardships, including legal battles over the custody of his nephew.",
              "The music reflects this inner turmoil, especially in its more tumultuous passages, offering a sonic representation of a soul in conflict.",
              "Despite his adversities, Beethoven sought solace in spirituality.",
              "The Missa solemnis became a vehicle for this exploration, a canvas upon which he painted his evolving understanding of God and faith.",
              "Phrases like \u201cCredo in unum Deum\u201d (I believe in one God) are set with conviction, mirroring Beethoven\u2019s own grappling with belief in the face of suffering.",
              "The Missa solemnis was dedicated to Archduke Rudolph of Austria, Beethoven\u2019s pupil, benefactor, and close friend.",
              "This relationship was one of the few constants in Beethoven\u2019s turbulent life.",
              "The work\u2019s dedication, \u201cFrom the heart\u2014may it return to the heart!",
              "\u201d, underscores the deep emotional bond they shared and the personal significance of the composition.",
              "Even as the Missa solemnis delves into the depths of human despair, it also ascends to heights of hope and joy.",
              "This duality reflects Beethoven\u2019s personal journey\u2014from moments of utter desolation to instances of transcendence, where he found beauty and meaning despite his afflictions.",
              "By the time Beethoven was working on the Missa solemnis, he was acutely aware of his legacy.",
              "The work can be viewed as an attempt to create something eternal, a musical testament that would outlive him.",
              "In its grandeur and depth, the Missa solemnis is both a personal statement of faith and a universal offering to posterity.",
              "The Missa solemnis is more than just a liturgical work;",
              "it\u2019s a window into Beethoven\u2019s soul.",
              "As listeners, we are privy to his deepest fears, hopes, and revelations, making the experience of this masterpiece both intimate and profound.",
              "The journey of Beethoven\u2019s Missa solemnis from its inception to its reception and eventual position in the pantheon of choral masterpieces is a story of evolving appreciation.",
              "This work, complex in both its musical and emotional depth, would come to influence generations of composers and resonate with audiences worldwide.",
              "Upon its premiere, the Missa solemnis received a mixed reception.",
              "While many recognized its genius, others found it challenging, both in terms of its length and its intricate musical structures.",
              "Some members of the church also felt that its dramatic and symphonic qualities overshadowed its sacred purpose.",
              "Prominent composers and musicians of the era were quick to acknowledge the work\u2019s significance.",
              "Johannes Brahms, for instance, greatly admired the Missa solemnis and considered it to be one of the crowning achievements of Western music.",
              "Such endorsements from Beethoven\u2019s peers helped cement its reputation as a work of genius.",
              "As years passed, the Missa solemnis gained traction among wider audiences.",
              "Its performances became events of note, drawing large crowds and garnering critical acclaim.",
              "With time, the very elements that some early critics found challenging became points of admiration, as listeners came to appreciate its depth and innovation.",
              "The legacy of the Missa solemnis can be traced in the works of subsequent composers.",
              "Its blend of the symphonic and the sacred, its structural innovations, and its emotional range would inspire composers such as Verdi, Berlioz, and Stravinsky in their own choral compositions.",
              "Today, the Missa solemnis is heralded as one of the pinnacles of choral literature.",
              "It\u2019s a staple in the repertoire of major choirs and orchestras around the world.",
              "Its universal themes of faith, struggle, and hope continue to resonate, making it as relevant to contemporary audiences as it was during Beethoven\u2019s time.",
              "From its initial moments of uncertainty, the Missa solemnis has embarked on a journey of enduring resonance.",
              "Its legacy is a testament to Beethoven\u2019s vision and his ability to create music that transcends time, culture, and personal belief, touching the very core of the human experience.",
              "Given the intricate layers of Beethoven\u2019s Missa solemnis, both musically and thematically, interpretations of the work can be as diverse as the listeners and performers approaching it.",
              "Delving deeper into the nuances of this masterpiece, one can uncover a myriad of meanings and insights that Beethoven may have intended or inadvertently woven into the fabric of the composition.",

              "Each section, from the Kyrie\u2019s solemn plea to the Agnus Dei\u2019s quest for peace, mirrors stages of spiritual introspection, doubt, affirmation, and eventual transcendence.",
              "Beyond the spiritual, Beethoven seems to comment on the broader human experience.",
              "The contrasting moments of joy and despair, unity and conflict, reflect the dualities that define our existence.",
              "The militaristic interludes in the Agnus Dei, for instance, might allude to societal struggles, wars, and the human yearning for peace.",
              "While the Missa solemnis is undeniably rooted in the sacred liturgy, Beethoven introduces elements that blur the lines between the sacred and the secular.",
              "The symphonic breadth, dramatic contrasts, and even operatic moments challenge traditional notions of liturgical music, suggesting that the divine can be found in the everyday and the mundane.",
              "Beethoven famously said, \u201cMusic is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy.",
              "\u201d In the Missa solemnis, he seems to advocate for music as a conduit to the divine, a universal language that transcends dogma and doctrine.",

              "Time plays a pivotal role in the interpretation of the Missa solemnis.",
              "From the fleeting moments of beauty to the overarching eternal themes, Beethoven juxtaposes the temporal nature of human life with the timeless aspects of the spiritual realm.",
              "This tension between the ephemeral and the everlasting offers listeners a contemplative space to reflect on their own place in the cosmos.",
              "Interpreting the Missa solemnis is an intimate journey, one that is shaped by individual perspectives, experiences, and beliefs.",
              "While Beethoven\u2019s intentions and inspirations provide a foundation, the beauty of the work lies in its ability to evoke personal revelations, making each encounter with it a unique and transformative experience.",
              "The sheer magnitude and depth of the Missa solemnis can be overwhelming for first-time listeners.",
              "A guided approach can help in navigating its vast landscape, allowing for a more profound appreciation of its many facets.",

              "It had grown far beyond being suitable for any liturgical occasion.",
              "In between work on his last three piano sonatas, he worked steadily on the Mass throughout 1821 and 1822, and as soon as it was done he embarked on another huge composition, the Ninth Symphony.",
              "The first performance of the Mass, arranged by another of Beethoven\u2019s noble patrons, the Russian Prince Galitsin, took place in St.",
              "Petersburg in April 1824.",

              "Much of his energy in the last few years of his life was consumed with concern about the many handwritten copies of the Mass that he had offered on subscription in the hope of being handsomely paid for each.",
              "Eventually he assigned the work to the publisher Schott, in Mainz, but it did not appear until shortly after his death.",
              "An earlier Mass by Beethoven, the Mass in C, composed in 1807, was modeled on Haydn\u2019s Masses.",
              "Unlike many of his middle-period works, it does not expand the conventions of the form or reveal any of the Herculean strength that Beethoven was already displaying in his symphonies.",
              "So the Missa Solemnis is a document that tells us much about Beethoven\u2019s faith and his concept of the divine.",
              "Although brought up a Catholic, Beethoven was a son of the Enlightenment who thought deeply about religion and preferred to fashion his own faith rather than accept any rigid dogma from the Catholic church or any other.",
              "He felt deep humility before a divine power inconceivably greater than himself, and his turning in his last years towards a contemplative vision after the self-asserting extroversion of the middle years has a decidedly religious ring.",
              "Deafness forced him to regard himself as the most wretched of God\u2019s creatures, but God was not cursed.",
              "God was the embodiment of all that was divine in humanity and in nature and, for Beethoven, a personal, omnipotent father of the brotherhood of mankind.",
              "The worship of Christ played no part in his religious universe.",
              "The grandeur of the Missa solemnis is Beethoven\u2019s way of representing God\u2019s majesty.",
              "Rather than hearing it as a declaration of faith (as most obviously expressed in the words of the Credo) we should look beyond the words to the music\u2019s invocation of a numinous God beyond our understanding.",
              "To achieve this, the music had also to reach out beyond conventional musical language to sounds that themselves defy our understanding: we can no more easily grasp the inner nature of this music than we can define the divinity of God himself.",
              "Certain features of the music stand out.",
              "The chorus is kept busily occupied throughout, often being required to sing across a wide range, with angular, leaping figures, or at an uncomfortable pitch.",
              "Violent contrasts of loud and soft are common.",
              "The independence of the voices and the stamina required of all singers are exceptional.",
              "In his late works Beethoven had an obsessive interest in fugue, so that those portions of the Mass conventionally treated as fugues (the concluding sections of both the Gloria and the Credo) reveal a determination to outdo a long tradition of fugal writing, leaving Bach and Handel in the dust.",
              "\u201cPleni sunt c\u0153li\u201d (in the Sanctus) and \u201cDona nobis pacem\u201d (in the Agnus Dei) are also set as fugues, and when not concerned with elaborate fugal processes Beethoven prefers a freely imitative style which brings out each voice in turn.",
              "The orchestra is the big virtuoso instrument that Beethoven had himself developed in the process of writing eight symphonies, sometimes overpowering in its force, often used with the utmost delicacy.",
              "The solo singers are not provided with solo arias and duets, as they might be in a Mozart Mass, but intertwine with the chorus often on equal terms. Two movements stand out in terms of style: the Benedictus is prefaced with a beautifully rich passage for divided lower strings supported by flutes and bassoon.",
              "Into this calm scene high flutes and solo violin descend like a dove from heaven, and the basses announce the Benedictus itself.",
              "At first this is an extended languorous violin solo with occasional pianissimo interventions from the brass.",
              "Then the solo voices take up the melody, and finally the chorus joins the texture, never hurried, lost in contemplation.",
              "The final movement, the Agnus Dei, indulges in some direct pictorialism when trumpets and drums remind us of the military culture without which it would not be necessary to offer a prayer for peace.",
              "Beethoven, like Haydn, could not escape the presence of military men in his midst or the real threat of war, as Napoleon left no corner of Europe untouched by his campaigns.",
              "When the Missa solemnis was written, peace had returned to the world they knew, although Beethoven was looking far beyond the immediate present to an ideal world in which freedom, brotherhood, and love would prevail under the beneficent gaze of the Almighty.",

              "The \"War of the Romantics\" is a term used by some music historians to describe the schism among prominent musicians in the second half of the 19th century.",
              "Musical structure, the limits of chromatic harmony, and program music versus absolute music were the principal areas of contention.",
              "The opposing parties crystallized during the 1850s.",
              "The most prominent members of the conservative circle were Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim, Clara Schumann, and the Leipzig Conservatoire, which had been founded by Felix Mendelssohn.",
              "Their opponents, the radical progressives mainly from Weimar, were represented by Franz Liszt and the members of the so-called New German School (German: Neudeutsche Schule), and by Richard Wagner.",
              "The controversy was German and Central European in origin;",
              "musicians from France, Italy, and Russia were only marginally involved.",
              "Clara Schumann, Joseph Joachim and Johannes Brahms were early key members of a conservative group of musicians.",
              "This core of supporters maintained the artistic legacy of Robert Schumann, Clara's husband, who had died in 1856.",
              "[citation needed][1] While Robert Schumann had been a progressive critic and editor of the influential music periodical Neue Zeitschrift fu\u0308r Musik, which he had founded in 1834, he was never a true admirer of Liszt.",
              "[2] However, as Schumann maintained exceptionally enthusiastic and artistically fruitful friendships with the emerging vanguard of radical romantics \u2014 Liszt in particular \u2014 as well as with musical conservatives such as Mendelssohn and Gade, he remained cordial with Liszt at first.",
              "He praised Liszt's piano playing in Neue Zeitschrift and reviewed his Leipzig concerts in 1840 favorably.",
              "[2] However, as Lisztomania swept through Europe after 1842, both he and Clara believed that Liszt had become self-deluded.",
              "[3] After Schumann sold the Neue Zeitschrift to Franz Brendel in 1845, it became an enthusiastic supporter of Liszt and his circle.",
              "[4] It also openly played down Mendelssohn and other conservative composers.",
              "[4] Though the final break between Liszt and the Schumanns would not come until 1848, the editorial turn that Neue Zeitschrift had taken would color their relations for the rest of their lives.",
              "[4] While Liszt remained cordial and at times generous on a professional level toward the Schumanns, they became openly hostile to him.",
              "[5] Clara Schumann had long been the more conservative aesthete in the Schumann marriage.",

              "[6] Joachim, who was a friend of both Clara and Brahms, joined them in his opposition to Liszt and the New German School.",
              "A child prodigy, Joachim at 17 had become professor of violin at the Leipzig Conservatory, where he forged close ties with Mendelssohn, the Schumanns and Ferdinand David.",
              "[7] Two years later, he became concertmaster of the Weimar Court Orchestra under Liszt's direction.",
              "[8] His three years in Weimar left him with poor impressions of Liszt's conducting and compositions.",
              "[8] His opinion of Liszt's music and that of the rest of the New German School was reinforced by his correspondence with Brahms and Clara.",
              "[9] Brahms's personal experience with Liszt had been limited to a single visit to Weimar in 1853, when he presented some of his compositions to a group that included Liszt, Peter Cornelius and Joachim Raff.",
              "After Liszt played some of Brahms's work, he performed his own B-minor Piano Sonata.",
              "[10] Brahms was impressed neither with Liszt's music nor with that of most of the rest of the New German School.",
              "[11] The exception was Wagner.",
              "[11] The critic Eduard Hanslick was very influential on the conservatives' behalf, as his view of music as \"form moving in sound\" meshed with their own.",

              "he then switched his allegiance to Brahms.[13][a 1][a 2] It was Bu\u0308low who called Brahms the third of the Three Bs and dubbed that composer's First Symphony \"The Tenth,\" after Beethoven's nine.",
              "[14] Pohl, brought by Liszt to serve as Weimar's unofficial critic-in-residence, championed Liszt, Berlioz and Wagner in print.",
              "[15] He also took Eduard Hanslick to task for claiming music could not be programmatic.",
              "[16] There were several attempts, with Liszt at the centre, to create a lasting and formal society.",
              "The Neu-Weimar-Verein was one attempt to form a club.",
              "It lasted a few years and published minutes of their meetings.",
              "The Tonku\u0308nstler-Versammlung (Congress of Musical Artists), which first met in Leipzig in June 1859, was a more successful attempt at forming an organization.",
              "(See New German School.)",
              "It eventually led to the founding in 1861 of the Allgemeine Deutsche Musikverein (ADMV), the 'United German Musical Union', which espoused Liszt's musical enthusiasms. Though Austrian composer Anton Bruckner took no part in the debate between conservatives and progressives, his symphonies were seen as part of the latter due to their advanced harmony, massive orchestration and extended time-scale.",
              "[17] His adulation for Wagner, which included the dedication of his Third Symphony and the quotes from Wagner's operas incorporated into that work, helped cement this impression.",
              "[17] A central point of disagreement between these two groups of musicians was between traditional and new musical forms. This was an outgrowth of the debate on the viability of the symphony genre, which had grown in the hands of Ludwig van Beethoven from one intended for entertainment to a form that included social, moral and cultural ideals.",
              "[18] Liszt and his circle favored new styles in writing and forms that would blend music with narrative and pictorial ideas.",
              "[19] Toward this end, and with the motto \"New wine required new bottles\" in mind, Liszt developed the symphonic poem.",
              "[20] The Leipzig/Berlin school championed the forms used by the classic masters, forms codified by musicologists such as Adolf Bernhard Marx of the early 19th century.",
              "The validity of program music was also a point of contention.",
              "In his 1854 book, Vom Musikalisch-Scho\u0308nen, Hanslick stated that music did not and could not represent anything specific other than itself.",
              "[12] It could suggest realistic impressions in the manner of Hector Berlioz, as well as impressions and feelings, such as those represented by the movement headings in the score of Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.",
              "[a 3] This view was not considered novel in itself.",
              "[12] \"What was new,\" according to musicologist and Liszt biographer Alan Walker, \"was that [Hanslick] was a musician addressing musicians, and he found a large audience.\"",
              "[12] Between the first and second of this book's nine editions, the first six of Liszt's symphonic poems were published and the Faust Symphony premiered under Liszt's baton.",
              "[12] Hanslick revised his text to mention Liszt and those works specifically.",
              "[12] One significant event out of many was the signing of a Manifesto against the perceived bias of the Neue Zeitschrift fu\u0308r Musik.",
              "This effort, whose author was almost certainly Brahms, received at first four signatures, among them those of Brahms and Joachim, though more were canvassed and eventually more were obtained.",
              "Before the later signatories could put their names to the document, however, it found its way into the editorial offices of the Berliner Musik-Zeitung Echo, and from there was leaked to the Neue Zeitschrift itself, which parodied it on May 4, 1860.",
              "Two days later [21] it made its official appearance also in the Berliner Musik-Zeitung Echo with more than twenty signatures, including Woldemar Bargiel, Albert Dietrich, Carl Reinecke, and Ferdinand Hiller.",
              "The manifesto read: Signing the manifesto might have caused Joachim some heartache.",
              "While he did not care for Liszt's music or his promotion of the New German School, he had limited his comments to his friends and musical associates.",
              "[23] He did not share them with Liszt until 1857, four years after he had left Weimar.",
              "[24] The manifesto became a catalyst for spreading the conflict to the German press at large.",
              "[25] Liszt, for his part, did not debate the manifesto;",
              "instead, he let his music make his points for him.",
              "[6] The 'war' was carried out through compositions, words, and even with scenes at concerts.",
              "At the premiere of Brahms's first piano concerto in Leipzig, there was a reversal of sorts.",
              "The concerto, which was his first orchestral piece to be performed publicly, was met with hissing.",
              "Conservative critics hated the piece, while those who supported the New German School praised it.",
              "[26] Reputations were at stake and partisans sought to embarrass their adversaries with public slights;",
              "the Weimar school held an anniversary celebration of the Neue Zeitschrift in Schumann's birthplace Zwickau and conspicuously neglected to invite members of the opposing party (including Clara Schumann).",
              "Musicians on one side saw the dispute as pitting Brahms' effective and economical sonata and classical forms against some of Liszt's works which appeared in comparison almost formless.",
              "Those on the other saw, on the Lisztian side, musical form best fitting musical content, pitted against works reusing old forms without any feeling for their growth and reason.",
              "[citation needed] Wagner poked fun at the conservative side in his essay On Conducting, when he portrayed them as 'a musical temperance society' awaiting a Messiah.",
              "[citation needed] The attitudes of the Weimar side were also often inconsistent.",
              "By 1859 Liszt himself was becoming more interested in writing church music and embracing the conservative ideals of the Catholic Church.",
              "He retained a fascination with the music of Meyerbeer (having composed piano transcriptions of music from his operas), a composer despised by both the New German School and by Wagner (whose 1850 essay Jewishness in Music, reprinted and extended in 1868, is an anti-Meyerbeer diatribe).",
              "Moreover, Liszt's concepts of programme music, (e.",
              "g. in his symphonic poems), were diametrically opposed to Wagner's ideals of music drama as expressed in the latter's essay The Artwork of the Future.",
              "[citation needed] Although actual hostility between the two sides was to subside over the years, the 'war' was a clear demarcation between what was seen to be 'classical music' and 'modern music', categories which still persist (although differently defined) to the present day.",

The man who could improvise the most intricate fantasies on the spur of the moment took infinite pains in the shaping of a considered composition.
