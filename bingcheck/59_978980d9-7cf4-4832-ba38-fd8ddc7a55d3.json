    "query": "What is the most common cause of death in the world and how has this trend changed over the past decade?",
    "response": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the most common cause of death in the world in 2019 was **ischaemic heart disease**, responsible for 16% of the world's total deaths[^1^]. This was followed by **stroke** (11%), **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease** (6%), **lower respiratory infections** (6%) and **neonatal conditions** (4%)[^1^]. These top 10 causes of death accounted for 55% of the 55.4 million deaths worldwide[^1^].\n\nThe trend over the past decade shows that deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are on the rise, while deaths from communicable diseases are declining. NCDs accounted for 74% of deaths globally in 2019, up from 71% in 2010[^1^]. The largest increase in deaths was for ischaemic heart disease, rising by more than 2 million to 8.9 million deaths in 2019[^1^]. Diabetes also entered the top 10 causes of death, following a significant percentage increase of 70% since 2000[^1^].\n\nOn the other hand, deaths from HIV/AIDS have fallen by 51% during the last 20 years, moving from the world\u2019s 8th leading cause of death in 2000 to the 19th in 2019[^1^]. Deaths from diarrhoeal diseases have also gone down substantially, from 2.6 million in 2000 to 1.5 million in 2019[^1^]. Lower respiratory infections remained the world\u2019s most deadly communicable disease, but the number of deaths has decreased by 460,000 since 2000[^1^].\n\nThese trends reflect the progress made in improving health outcomes around the world, as well as the challenges that remain in addressing the burden of NCDs and their risk factors[^2^] [^4^].",

              "As a result, for many people in these countries detection is often late in the course of the disease and people die at a younger age from CVDs and other noncommunicable diseases, often in their most productive years.",

              "At the household level, evidence is emerging that CVDs and other noncommunicable diseases contribute to poverty due to catastrophic health spending and high out-of-pocket expenditure.",
              "At the macro-economic level, CVDs place a heavy burden on the economies of low- and middle-income countries.",
              "The key to cardiovascular disease reduction lies in the inclusion of cardiovascular disease management interventions in universal health coverage packages, although in a high number of countries health systems require significant investment and reorientation to effectively manage CVDs.",
              "Evidence from 18 countries has shown that hypertension programmes can be implemented efficiently and cost-effectively at the primary care level which will ultimately result in reduced coronary heart disease and stroke.",

Some researchers have suggested that it may be useful to reduce socioeconomic disparity to reduce disease burden [25].",

              "51 Accordingly, the US death burden caused by non-communicable diseases, particularly COPD, substantially decreased (by 54%) from 1990 to 2010.",
              "52 In some low income regions, such as Oceania, and western, eastern, and central sub-Saharan Africa, household air pollution from solid fuels was the leading risk factor for COPD, rather than smoking, and this finding was more evident in women.",

              "Ultimately, equitable resource allocation and massive investments in regions with the most DALYs must be made to reduce the burden of COPD more effectively, with recognition that much less attention is paid to chronic respiratory diseases compared with other non-communicable diseases.",
              "61 Also, the data reported here showed the substantial variations in the burden of COPD between countries, which should prompt the authorities of the most affected countries to fund new epidemiological surveys to enable a thorough understanding of the natural history of COPD.",

              "The study had several limitations.",
              "Firstly, only a small number of high quality epidemiological databases were available to estimate the burden of COPD.",
              "Secondly, some risk factors, such as genetic predisposition, although rare, could not be taken into account in our estimations.",
              "Thirdly, incorporating claims data into the input record might make the evidence unreliable because the validity is highly dependent on the bias correction process.",
              "Underdiagnosis of COPD is likely because of relief of respiratory symptoms by limiting activities that reduce the patient\u2019s likelihood of seeking medical attention.",
              "Also, poor access to spirometry and lack of expertise in performing and interpreting spirometry data are important contributors to underdiagnosing COPD.",
              "33 Fourthly, many countries do not have efficient systems for registering deaths, and therefore only verbal autopsy studies could be relied on for estimates of deaths.",
              "However, as previous studies did not differentiate between the distinct types of chronic respiratory diseases, this information could not be included for reporting the death estimates related to COPD,2 suggesting possible underestimation of the evidence.",
              "Improving vital registration systems might improve the accuracy of these data and allow better management of the disease burden.",
              "These limitations highlight the importance of improving the accuracy of data collection and the use of more integrated case definitions, which would make comparisons between countries more valid.",
              "COPD is a major public health problem with extensive healthcare and economic costs.",
              "Although the point prevalence, death, and DALY rates declined during the study period, the corresponding counts are increasing.",

              "The greatest decline in LRI deaths attributable to risk factors was household air pollution from solid fuels, which may be attributed to the Chinese government\u2019s programs to effectively reduce household air pollution from solid fuels [26].",

              "However, the rate of decline in the burden of LRIs has slowed in recent years.",
              "The Chinese health system should focus on new approaches to LRI prevention, including: providing greater access to healthcare, expanding interventions, addressing in-country disparities, and further efforts to focus on the management of LRI risk factors to reduce preventable deaths from LRI in children under 5 years of age.",
