    "query": "What are the most significant differences between the culinary traditions of Northern and Southern Italy, and how have these regional differences evolved over time to become a prominent aspect of Italian cuisine?",
    "response": "That's a great question. The culinary traditions of Northern and Southern Italy are very diverse and reflect the cultural and geographical differences between the two regions. According to [^2^], some of the main differences are:\n\n- Northern Italian cuisine consists of heavy meat dishes and cream sauces, while Southern Italian foods have robust flavors with fresh herbs and light sauces enhanced with extra-virgin olive oil[^1^] [^4^].\n- Northern Italian dishes feature more risotto and pasta dishes compared to Southern Italian, which relies more on bread and pizza[^2^] [^3^]. The starch of choice in the north is either rice or polenta, while in the south it is durum wheat[^3^].\n- Northern Italian food is driven by the land, with ideal conditions for raising cattle, sheep, and goats. Meats like beef and veal are key in Northern cuisine, along with buttery and creamy cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano, Asiago, and Gorgonzola[^2^] [^3^]. Southern Italian food is driven by the sea, with more seafood and lamb dishes. The cheeses are mainly made with goat or sheep's milk, such as mozzarella, ricotta, and pecorino[^3^] [^4^].\n- Southern Italy is more influenced by Mediterranean cuisines, such as Greek and Arabic, and uses more spices and chile peppers to add heat and flavor to their dishes. Northern Italy is more influenced by French and German cuisines, and uses more herbs and truffles to enhance their dishes[^3^] [^5^].\n\nThese regional differences evolved over time due to various factors, such as climate, geography, history, trade, immigration, and politics. For example, tomatoes, which are now a staple of Southern Italian cuisine, were introduced from the Americas in the 16th century. Rice, which is now a staple of Northern Italian cuisine, was brought by Arab traders in the Middle Ages. The unification of Italy in 1861 also contributed to the development of a national identity and a shared culinary heritage[^3^] [^5^].\n\nI hope this answer helps you understand the differences between Northern and Southern Italian cuisine better. If you want to learn more about specific dishes or regions, I can help you with that too.",

              "It has its roots in a similar dish in ancient Rome, but instead of using the sweetness of figs to mellow the strong and bitter taste of the liver, the Venetian version used the sweetness of caramelized onions, which are more readily available in the area.",

              "It requires a very long preparation process that\u2019s why it is usually reserved for special and festive occasions.",
              "Venison is marinated for a minimum of 12 hours in vinegar and pepper, and then slow-simmered in vegetables, garlic, spices like cloves and cinnamon, and interestingly enough, Grappa.",
              "Grappa is a popular after-dinner drink in Italy, and is a specialty of this region.",
              "As with most Northern Italian dishes it is typically served with polenta or egg pasta.",

              "These two things come together in a rich, elegant dish that showcases the unique personality of the region.",
              "Ravioli, or stuffed pasta is a huge part of Northern Italian tradition, with many shapes and variations depending on the area.",
              "It made its first appearance in Italian cuisine in the 1500s and was originally only for aristocrats and nobles.",
              "Over time, it became more accessible to common people, who modified the fillings based on what they had available, which likely explains why ravioli has so many different versions and variations.",
              "Ravioli is thin pasta dough that contains a filling of meat, seafood, cheese, or vegetables, and can be served either in a broth or a sauce.",
              "It is typically square-shaped, although round shapes exist as well.",

              "It can be used as a substitute to potatoes or pasta.",
              "Polenta is said to have originated as a staple food for Italian farmers.",
              "The city of Alba in Piedmont in northern Italy is known as the \u201cWhite Truffle Capital of The World\u201d.",
              "Every year, from September to December, foodies, and enthusiasts flock to this picturesque city to catch a whiff of this highly prized tuber that grows abundantly in the forests in this region.",
              "Truffles grow underground near hardwood trees like oaks and hazelnuts and belong to the tuber family.",
              "They are pale gold in color, and lumpy in shape, looking almost like potatoes.",
              "While they also grow in other regions, the white truffle from Alba, known as tuber magnatum, is the most desired.",
              "It is also the most expensive, because of its unique flavor, which is due to the unique climate and composition of the soil in the region.",
              "White truffles have an earthy, musky aroma and taste, with notes of garlic or shallots.",
              "They are shaved finely and sprinkled raw on pasta, risottos, and other dishes, which immediately elevates the flavor and aroma of the dish.",
              "As an interesting side note, Alba is also the town where Nutella and Ferrero chocolates come from.",
              "The province of Modena in the Emilia-Romagna region in Northern Italy is known for its Balsamic vinegar.",
              "Balsamic vinegar is a dark-colored vinegar made from freshly crushed grape juice, including the seeds, stems, and seeds, and aged for years in wooden barrels.",

              "Cured meat or \u201csalumi\u201d in Italian, is a big part of Italian cuisine no matter where you go.",
              "There are some, though, that are more prized than others, and enjoy protected status.",
              "Protected Designation of Origin and other similar titles ensure that only products that are produced in the specific area, following the strict manufacturing and approval processes, are the only ones allowed to be called by that particular product name or brand name.",
              "This protects the integrity of the product, especially of a high-quality, heritage food.",

              "Prosciutto Di San Daniele PDO and Prosciutto di Parma PDO are just two products that enjoy that special status.",
              "Prosciutto, in Italian, can refer to any type of processed ham, cured and uncooked or cooked, processed in any region.",

              "It can only be called Prosciutto di San Daniele if it meets all of the requirements.",
              "Similarly, Prosciutto di Parma or Parma Ham can only be called as such if sourced from approved areas in North Central Italy and produced in the Parma region of Emilia-Romagna, using the age-old traditions that are closely monitored by the Parma Ham Consortium.",
              "This makes sense both from a commercial and practical point of view, as it allows manufacturers to control the quality of the product and protect the name.",
              "Practically speaking, it is also quite difficult to replicate it elsewhere anyway.",
              "The specific mix of climate and environment, the lifestyle and diet of the pigs, and the way they are raised play a huge role in the final flavor of the product, all of which are unique to the region.",
              "To learn more about prosciutto and Parma Ham, check out the article Parma Ham vs. Prosciutto \u2013 The #1 Important Difference on the site.",
              "Continuing our cured meat journey, we come to speck, related to prosciutto but also markedly different.",
              "Speck is a type of cured meat that is also lightly smoked, unlike prosciutto.",
              "Authentic speck also has protected status, known as Speck Alto Adige IGP or Indication of Geographic Protection, which means that if your speck is authentic, there should be at least one stage of the production process that is done within a specified geographical location.",
              "Speck is darker brown in color and also has a denser texture.",
              "It is cured with juniper and bay leaf, so it has more of a smoky and savory taste than its cousins.",
              "It is also more aromatic than prosciutto.",
              "It is a specialty of the South Tyrol or Alto Adige region in the northernmost part of Italy, bordering Austria.",
              "At first glance, bresaola can look like any other typical cured Italian meat.",
              "However, what sets it apart from the others is that it isn\u2019t actually a cured pork product, but rather, it is made with beef, and lean beef at that.",
              "Bresaola is a specialty of the Lombardy region of Italy and is made from a single cut of beef, specifically the eye of the round cut, which is a leaner cut.",
              "It is cured with a mix of salt, white pepper, nutmeg, and other spices depending on the artisan making it.",
              "It is typically cured for at least 85 days.",
              "It has a darker color than prosciutto, almost purple, but can be served and used in the same way.",

              "\u201d Cheese that\u2019s specifically called Parmigiano Reggiano is a product with protected status, which means that authentic Parmigiano Reggiano can only come from the areas of Parma, Reggio Emilia, parts of Bologna, Modena, and Mantua in Lombardy.",
              "There is a very specific region where it can be processed and produced, and it is also closely monitored for quality.",
              "This means that all other cheeses called Parmesan or Parmigiano outside of these areas are different.",
              "Not to say that they are not good, but just that they cannot authentically be called Parmigiano Reggiano, and may differ in quality and taste.",
              "In the U.",
              "S.",
              ", Parmesan cheese isn\u2019t really regulated, so that packet of grated parmesan cheese in the grocery store isn\u2019t really the same as the one you would get in Italy.",
              "Some artisan producers may produce cheese in a similar style, but for a true experience of the real thing, it\u2019s a good idea to get one that is produced specifically in the designated Parmigiano Reggiano areas.",
              "Fontina is a semihard cheese traditionally made from the milk of unpasteurized cows in the Aosta Valley in northern Italy.",
              "The area has been making fontina cheese in this way since the 12th century.",
              "Fontina cheese from this area is sharper and more pungent than fontina produced from other areas, and it also has protected status, meaning, the specific kind of Fontina cheese must be made in this area and made in a specific way (milk must be used whole, within two hours of milking), with milk from a specific breed of cows (Valdostana breed).",
              "Fontina cheese made in other areas is usually called by a different name, fontal.",
              "Fontina cheese is pale yellow in color and has a smooth texture with little holes called eyes.",
              "It is rich, pungent, and strong tasting, and also creamy with a nutty and buttery flavor.",

              "Its most popular use is in the coffee-flavored dessert, Tiramisu.",
              "It is white in color, creamy, and very easy to spread.",
              "It is sweeter and less acidic than cream cheese or cre\u0300me Fraiche and has a buttery flavor due to its high butterfat content.",
              "It originated in the region of Lombardy, in an area south of Milan between Lodi and Abbiategraso, likely in the 16th or 17th century.",

              "Young gorgonzola is soft, creamy, and can be buttery, while more mature gorgonzola can be sharper and stronger, and more pungent.",
              "Gorgonzola can be added to pizzas and pastas for an interesting flavor and texture, and because of its pretty color and texture, also makes a nice addition to your cheeseboard.",

              "It is a common misconception that Italian cuisine is entirely about pizza, rice, and pasta.",
              "Indeed, saying Italian cuisine is all about carb-based dishes is a bit like reading the first chapter of a book and then putting it down thinking you know the entire story.",
              "And the proof of this definitely lies in the wonderfully-rich gastronomic repertoire of the northern Italian regions: Liguria, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte, Val d\u2019Aosta, Lombardy, Trentino-Alto Adige, Veneto, and Friuli-Venezia Giulia.",
              "The French southern perimeter, bordering Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, Italy inevitably showcases deep and varied influences from its neighboring countries, as well as the geography that shapes and determines these lands.",
              "Due to the colder and more rigid climate compared to the sun-drenched South, dishes in the northern regions tend to be richer and heartier, privileging slow brazing and stewing techniques over frying and boiling;",
              "tomato sauces and olive oil are replaced by stock or wine and butter;",
              "and the quintessential Mediterranean herbs such as basil and oregano are replaced by sage and rosemary.",
              "Moreover, the production of high-quality meat and cheeses is primarily due to the excellent cattle breeds largely present in the most northern regions.",
              "But now let\u2019s delve into each region and find out what speciality they have to offer!",
              "Rolling out in the north-west in a thin half-moon shape, Liguria is the most southern of the northern regions, not only geographically but specifically for its Mediterranean culinary culture.",
              "This is particularly exemplified by the use of pasta, olive oil, and basil in the traditional dish Trofie al Pesto.",
              "Trofie is a spiral-shaped type of pasta which is typically cooked al dente and almost exclusively eaten with freshly grounded pesto alla Genovese: a true symbol of Ligurian identity!",

              "Classed as the second most southern region of Northern Italy for its wide use of Mediterranean ingredients, Emilia-Romagna is possibly the one region in Italy that holds most of the world-renowned Italian foods and dishes.",

              "The name of the region derives from the Latin Pedemontium (at the foot of the mountains), referring to its position at the foot of the majestic Alps, which have indeed influenced its cuisine with the large use of butter, lard, mountain-based cheeses, and truffles.",
              "Indeed, Piemonte, and more precisely the town of Alba, is home to the most prestigious type of truffle that exists in Italy.",
              "The tuber magnatum pico is a species of white truffle with a pale golden outer layer and a spongy texture which stands out for its distinctively sharp, aromatic and earthy flavor.",

              "Other than being a symbol of traditional peasant food, Bagna cauda proudly symbolizes conviviality and friendship and, in fact, is often eaten with friends.",

              "Tucked up north and encircled by the Alps is Valle d\u2019Aosta: a tiny region with a strong linguistic and cultural identity that is one of the five autonomous regions in Italy.",
              "Due to its particular geomorphologic construction, its culinary culture has little in common with other regions, being rather a perfect symbol of pure Alpine cuisine.",
              "The first major landmark of its Alpine cuisine is undoubtedly represented by cheese fondue, prepared with the local Fontina cheese.",
              "Like many dishes in the Alpine cuisine, fonduta holds an important ritualistic value: it is typically served in a cast iron pot which is warmed by a candle and placed at the center of the table to be shared among friends \u2013 again, as a symbol of love and friendship.",
              "Mocetta, or motsetta, is a traditional cold cut meat made from the meat from cows\u2019 thighs which have been aged and preserved following incredibly ancient techniques.",
              "Mocetta is seasoned with garlic, bay leaves, rosemary, and sage and then salted and left to rest in a cool place for about 90 days.",
              "Once ready, mocetta is sliced into very thin, weightless slices, and it\u2019s traditionally eaten on black bread with butter and a drizzle of honey.",

              "Polenta can be savored on its own as a main course, relished as a side together with a hearty meat stew, or even allowed to cool and cut into slices which can then be grilled or fried.",
              "Lombardy is one of the largest and richest regions in Italy.",
              "It boasts a wide variety of landscapes and ancient settlements which confer it one of the most heterogeneous cuisines in the country.",
              "Lombardy has substantial influences from Swiss and Germanic gastronomy \u2013 the early inhabitants of the region were, in fact, a Germanic tribe, the Longobards.",
              "Risotto alla Milanese is probably the most iconic dish from the city of Milan.",
              "This simple and creamy risotto will blow you away with the first forkful;",
              "and the secret lies in the perfect combination of a few simple ingredients such as butter, white wine, Parmesan, and saffron, the golden ingredient that makes this dish simply unique!",
              "With its distinctive blue veins and pungent smell, Gorgonzola is one of the most popular and internationally renowned cheeses, protected by the PDO designation.",
              "Gorgonzola can be soft and creamy or more tangy and crumbly if it\u2019s more mature.",
              "The cheese originated in the town of Gorgonzola, though its origins are still widely debated.",
              "According to folklore, Gorgonzola was invented by mistake by a young cheesemaker who was very much in love with his master\u2019s daughter and, distracted by the sight of his loved one, mixed two different curds, thus forming a strange type of cheese.",
              "Clearly a serendipitous event!",

              "The northern half of the region (Alto Adige or Su\u0308dtirol) is in fact ethnically and linguistically German and as such presents very little, if any, similarities with the Italian way of cooking.",
              "First there is undoubtedly canederli: large gnocchi made with stale bread soaked in milk, eggs, and smoked bacon which can be savored in a broth or seasoned with butter and cheese.",
              "The term is an Italian adaptation of the German Semmelkno\u0308del, which goes to prove how both the etymology and original concept of the dish are rooted in the German culture, while representing at the same time a culinary source of Italian pride.",
              "Another typical dish from Trentino, which many will also associate with German-speaking countries, is of course apple strudel.",
              "Despite its wide association with countries like Germany and Austria, there is evidence that the origins of this cake are actually Turkish.",
              "The Turks, who ruled Hungary and large parts of the Balkans in the 1600s, prepared a similar cake called baklava, which underwent several transformations to the current form of the apple strudel.",
              "Among Italian regions, apple strudel is most popular in Trentino-Alto Adige, due to the large cultivation of apples.",
              "Strauben are typical sweet pancakes from the Su\u0308dtirol area.",
              "They are thin and large snail-shaped pancakes, made of a mixture of flour, eggs, milk, sugar, and butter, with the magic addition of a small glass of Grappa to give it that extra boost of flavor.",

              "Curving around the northern part of the Adriatic Sea is the Veneto region, chiefly famous for its large production of wine and delicious, fresh seafood.",
              "Veneto was historically dominated by the city of Venezia, establishing solid trades with the Arabs who introduced many foods and spices, such as rice and certain types of fish.",
              "One of the most popular fish dishes is in fact baccala\u0300 alla Vicentina, a culinary symbol from the city of Vicenza.",
              "Baccala\u0300 is essentially cod which has been preserved in salt or left to dry out naturally.",

              "Risi e Bisi is a traditional pea risotto from the cities of Vicenza and Venezia.",

              "It first appeared in cookbooks, in fact, in the 1960s, and the original recipes accounts for a base of Savoiardi biscuits drenched in coffee and topped by a generous layer of soft mascarpone cream made with egg yolk and sugar.",
              "Nothing else!",
              "The original recipe, in fact, does not include liqueur as many believe, although this versatile dessert can be adapted and made in various different ways such as white chocolate and pistachio tiramisu\u0300 or even with a berry coulis.",

              " There is no doubt that if you were to name the most internationally renowned Italian foods, many of them would probably come from the South: pizza, carbonara, and ice cream are just a few.",
              "Indeed, the South of Italy accounts for a large number of Italian cultural stereotypes: just think of the typical Neapolitan man singing passionately in the streets and gobbling down his pizza Margherita while waving his hands as he tries to continue talking.",
              "This is of course only a cliche\u0301, though it goes to exemplify just how rich in cultural images and traditions the South of Italy is.",
              "Consisting of six regions, Molise, Campania, Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, and Sicilia, Southern Italy has historically been a very poor and rudimental land marked by sharp contrasts, with the poorest parts of society subsisting on a diet largely made of wheat and vegetables while the nobility of the Regno delle Due Sicilie feeding on luxurious and sophisticated foods.",
              "The warm Mediterranean climate, however, lasting for a large part of the year mean the lands were constantly fertile with a steady and permanent cultivation of grains and vegetables, providing a constant and varied supply of food.",
              "However, one thing has solidly unified social classes and eradicated cultural differences among the various southern Italian regions, and this is the common use of major landmark ingredients which colorfully sum up the Italian culinary essence: tomatoes, a wide variety of soft cheeses, and the magic touch of Mediterranean herbs such as oregano and basil.",
              "Let\u2019s round up some of the most popular Southern Italian dishes.",
              "The first of the southern Italian regions we come across is Molise, Italy\u2019s second-smallest region, almost entirely covered in mountains except for a thin strip of coastline bathed by the Adriatic Sea.",
              "The geographical morphology of the region is reflected in the cuisine, stemming from old inland farming traditions and largely based on seasonal crops with a large production of cheeses.",
              "Dating as far back as the VII Century B.",
              "C, Caciocavallo is one of the oldest cheeses ever produced.",
              "It is a real source of local pride for the towns of Agnone, Capracotta, and Vastogirardi.",
              "Caciocavallo is made with raw cow\u2019s milk and has a hard rind and a straw-yellow color which tends to brown when it\u2019s very mature.",
              "Related: Top 20 Most Popular Italian Cheeses It is aged in natural caves for a minimum of three months: initially, it has a soft and delicate taste, but it becomes increasingly strong and spicy as it matures.",
              "Locals from Molise often eat it grilled and accompany it with fresh Italian bread.",
              "It must be tried at least once in your life!",
              "Soppressata is an incredibly popular dry-cured pork salami renowned throughout the country, though it is not generally known it is originally from Molise.",
              "The pork loin and neck are finely minced with a small amount of lard.",
              "The minced meat is then spiced with peppercorns and salt and placed to dry in a specific device under which it is pressed and shaped, hence the term soppressata, meaning, in this context, squashed.",
              "The salami is considered to be ready after a maturation period of about 5 months and is then typically savored on a charcuterie board together with a selection of cheeses.",
              "The ancient pastoral traditions from Molise are deliciously revived in this hearty recipe, evoking the authentic flavors of the small mountain town of Capracotta.",
              "Pezzata is a chunky meat stew made with lamb which is slow-cooked in large pots of water to which potatoes, a few tomatoes, and sometimes other vegetables and herbs are then added to enrich the flavor and aroma of this dish.",
              "A true symbol of peasant cuisine, pezzata was invented in fact during the period of transhumance, when animals who didn\u2019t survive high altitude journeys would serve the purpose of feeding the shepherds.",
              "Campania boasts a large number of Italy\u2019s most renowned produce known worldwide, thanks to the fertile volcanic soils of Mount Vesuvius, where the quintessential Italian tomato, San Marzano, is produced, representing the foundation of many of the local recipes.",
              "The Queen of Italian cuisine is undoubtedly and unquestionably its most celebrated symbol, pizza Margherita.",
              "Representing the quintessential colors of the country, pizza is certainly a lot older than Italy itself!",
              "Dating back to the Greeks and Romans, who would eat round discs made of fried dough with squashed tomatoes and cheese on top, to the 1700s when the modern concept of Pizza came about, this wonderful invention is commonly attributed to Don Raffaele Esposito, a Neapolitan cook who in 1899 was summoned to prepare a delicacy to honor King Umberto I and Queen Margherita.",
              "What would pizza Margherita be without its most essential ingredients?",
              "Made from the milk of Mediterranean buffalos, this type of Mozzarella is appreciated for its uniquely soft texture, delicate taste, and nourishing properties.",
              "In fact the milk from the buffalo was once used by farmers as an energizing and sustaining drink.",
              "However, due to its rapid acidification and natural coagulation processes, it was soon transformed into a new produce that could be stored for longer periods and transported more easily.",
              "This is how the delicious mozzarella di bufala originated.",
              "\u201cBright like the sun, sweet like love\u201d, this is how limoncello is poetically described by the locals of the Amalfi Coast and Sorrento, the beautiful coastline crowded by bright yellow lemon trees.",
              "It is here that the symbolic drink has been prepared in homes for centuries.",
              "Some people think that limoncello was drunk by fishermen and farmers in the 1600s, especially in the morning, to fight the cold, while others claim that the first recipe was created in a monastery to delight the monks between prayers.",
              "Whatever the truth, limoncello represents a traditional source of Italian pride all over the world, proudly boasting the designation of Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).",
              "Its alcohol percentage is usually around 30 to 35 percent, which is why it is typically savored slowly in a small liqueur glass after meals.",
              "Pastiera Napoletana is a traditional Italian dessert made of custard that originates from the city of Naples.",
              "The classic recipe calls for a short crust pastry filled with a delicious ricotta cream and dusted with icing sugar on top.",
              "Probably due to the myths about origins, pastiera is thought to represent today a symbol of life and rebirth.",
              "Related: 15 Most Popular Italian Pies & Cakes According to legend, in fact, a couple of shipwrecked fishermen managed to return to land and were saved by the leftover food from the day before, what they called \u201cla pasta di Ieri\u201d, which over time became one word, pastiera.",
              "The cuisine of Puglia boasts a wide variety of excellent products and simple dishes due in large part to the fact that for millennia Puglia had predominantly been an agricultural land.",
              "The main culinary protagonists in fact are a great variety of fresh vegetables and olives, as well as the abundant production of durum wheat, giving the locals the reputation of authentic pasta makers.",
              "Taralli Pugliesi are a gastronomic symbol of the local cuisine of Puglia.",
              "These ring-shaped hard crackers are simply made with flour, water, white wine, and a sprinkle of fennel seeds to add a fresh aftertaste.",
              "These versatile snacks are an excellent addition to an aperitivo and can be savored on their own or accompanied by a board of cheese and olives and a glass of local red wine;",
              "though watch out, or you may find yourself finishing the whole packet all at once!",
              "For many people focaccia is associated with the northern region of Liguria, but don\u2019t you dare say that to a person from Puglia!",
              "In fact, despite the use of the same terminology, the two foods are made in very different ways and hold very different culinary origins and purposes.",
              "In Puglia, tradition dictates that breakfast or mid-morning snacks are typically enjoyed with a slice of richly-seasoned focaccia barese topped with succulent cherry tomatoes, tangy olives, and a generous sprinkle of oregano, which will undoubtedly set you up for the day!",
              "A traditional culinary symbol from Bari, Orecchiette con Cime di Rapa is a delicious first course dish made with a small dome-shaped type of pasta cooked in a delicious garlicky sauce made with turnip greens.",
              "Orecchiette, literally meaning small ears for their distinctive shape, is a typical type of pasta from the Puglia region.",
              "You will often see a row of elderly women sitting on chairs just outside their homes making orecchiette by hand, placing them neatly on large wooden trays for the pasta to dry.",
              "A true ethnographic and culinary experience!",
              "If you have ever been to Lecce, you will probably have noticed that, unlike the rest of Italy, the typical breakfast is a delicious and fragrant pastry cake filled with irresistible hot custard cream, the so-called pasticciotto Leccese.",
              "These delicious short-crust pastry shells are a true symbol of Salento Bakery.",
              "They date back to 1745 when the owner of the Ascalone pastry shop in Galatina had to improvise with the only raw materials he had available to create a cake to offer to the devotees of the Basilica of San Paolo who had come to celebrate the patron saint.",
              "They are one of the most delicious Italian pastries and they are just simply amazing.",
              "To the west of Puglia lies Basilicata, once called Lucania before being conquered by the Romans.",
              "Later on, Emperor Augustus denominated it Basilicata, which derives from the Greek basilikos, meaning governor and prince, thus conferring it values of pride and nobility.",
              "Despite it being bathed on its south border by the Mediterranean Sea, the traditional cuisine of Basilicata is largely meat-based due to the wide consumption of meat by the Lucani, the ancient population who lived in the region.",
              "Agnello alla Lucana is a simple and humble traditional dish from Basilicata, that\u2019s hard not to appreciate!",
              "The secret of its simplicity lies in the slow oven-cooking of the lamb, placed in a big casserole with peppers, garlic, and rosemary.",
              "The final touch is given by the generous dash of vinegar which makes the top of the lamb sweet and sour and deliciously crispy!",
              "Agnello alla Lucana is not missed on any local\u2019s table during family Sunday lunches.",
              "Pecora alla pignata, also known as cutturidd, is another traditional lamb stew specialty from the Alta Murgia area on the east of Basilicata.",
              "The name of the recipe comes from pignata, a special terracotta pot which is typically used to prepare the dish.",
              "According to tradition, lampascioni, a local type of onion, and wild chicory are usually added to mitigate the strong flavor of the sheep, after which the pot is not closed by a lid but by a disc of pasta obtained by blending semolina with water.",
              "Lagane e ceci is a traditional dish simply made with lagane pasta, a wider version of tagliatelle, cooked in a creamy chickpea broth with garlic, leeks, and laurel.",
              "This warming dish is truly soul-satisfying on a cold winter\u2019s day and it is also known as the piatto del brigante, literally the dish of the brigands as it was believed to be the most popular dish among the ancient Lucanian brigands of the 19th century.",
              "On the most southern tip of the Italian peninsula is the region of Calabria, known for its strong and intense culinary flavors and closely tied to history, tradition, and religious festivities.",
              "Due to the heat and dryness of the climate, people from Calabria have always placed great importance on preserving their foods, which is why vegetables and animal produce are often laden with salt and oil, which undoubtedly helped to confer it the reputation of having a rich yet flavor-filled cuisine.",
              "The first emblem of the cuisine from Calabria is certainly \u2018nduja, a super soft and spicy sausage made with lard, bacon, jowl, and less noble parts of the pig, to which abundant chili pepper is added, conferring it its typical bright red color.",
              "\u2018Nduja is traditionally from the town of Spilinga, in the province of Vibo Valentia, but it is widely produced in many other municipalities throughout the region.",
              "It can be spread on bread croutons or used to cook pasta and risotto dishes, though it is on pizza that locals really appreciate it!",
              "Typically referred to as \u201cthe fish \u2018nduja\u201d, or \u201ccaviar of the south\u201d, Sardella is nothing more than a mixture of \u2018nduja and small local fish flavored with chili pepper and fennel.",
              "This southern specialty has a decidedly strong and distinctive spicy flavor, which makes it perfect to spread on bread and to accompany with a warming glass of red or white wine.",
              "The recipe is thought to belong to Crucoli, a town in the province of Crotone, but it is also produced in Ciro\u0300 Marina and Trebisacce.",
              "Peperoncini ripieni is a traditional appetizer from Calabria made with tasty round chilies stuffed with a filling of tuna, anchovies, and capers.",
              "Peperoncini are typically prepared in the summer, when the round chilies are just ripe and succulent enough, but they are then preserved in big jars filled with olive oil, which will make them last for long periods of time.",
              "This simple yet delicious specialty is typically combined with soft, mild cheeses such as goat cheese or Robiola, as well as grilled meats.",
              "Finally we come to Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, famous for its culinary fusion of multicultural flavors that developed over the centuries as a result of the multiple invasions by Arabs, Greeks, Normans, and Spanish.",
              "Sicilian cuisine today is largely based on the wide use of fresh vegetables, such as eggplant and tomatoes, as well as on the widespread use of spices and aromatic herbs.",
              "Arancino undoubtedly deserves first place in the countless list of culinary symbols of the region.",
              "Arancini are breaded and deep-fried balls made of rice and with a delicious ragu\u0300 sauce filling.",
              "These small and delicious delicacies are indeed responsible for having divided the population over the decades over those who refer to it as Arancino, as in Catania, and those who call it Arancina, around Palermo.",
              "But on one thing they definitely agree, the origins of this dish are rooted in Arab culture as they would typically create a mixture of saffron rice, season it with lamb, and then roll it in the palm of their hands.",
              "Moreover, there is evidence that Arabs would usually tend to name their dishes with fruit names, which goes to prove that the people in Palermo were probably getting it right.",
              "Pasta alla Norma is by all accounts the most exquisite expression of simple yet healthy and nourishing cuisine.",
              "Eggplants are the main protagonists of this dish, originally made with rigatoni pasta, cooked in a rich and garlicky tomato sauce with the previously saute\u0301ed eggplant.",
              "The dish is finally garnished with fresh flakes of Ricotta cheese and a few leaves of basil.",
              "Despite its humble and unpretentious essence, this wonderful specialty was in fact named after a renowned lyrical composition, Norma, by Vincenzo Bellini, a famous Sicilian composer of the 19th Century.",
              "Last but not least, the ultimate Sicilian specialty that you have to try at least once in your life.",
              "Cassata Siciliana is a liqueur-drenched sponge cake made with almond and pistachio paste and filled with a creamy mixture of ricotta and chocolate chips.",
              "Cassata is the Sicilian dessert par excellence, you will find it in almost every bakery in Sicily, elegantly decorated with icing sugar and candied fruits arranged in perfect geometric shapes.",

              "It is a common misconception that Italian cuisine is entirely about pizza, rice, and pasta.",
              "Indeed, saying Italian cuisine is all about carb-based dishes is a bit like reading the first chapter of a book and then putting it down thinking you know the entire story.",
              "And the proof of this definitely lies in the wonderfully-rich gastronomic repertoire of the northern Italian regions: Liguria, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte, Val d\u2019Aosta, Lombardy, Trentino-Alto Adige, Veneto, and Friuli-Venezia Giulia.",
              "The French southern perimeter, bordering Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, Italy inevitably showcases deep and varied influences from its neighboring countries, as well as the geography that shapes and determines these lands.",
              "Due to the colder and more rigid climate compared to the sun-drenched South, dishes in the northern regions tend to be richer and heartier, privileging slow brazing and stewing techniques over frying and boiling;",
              "tomato sauces and olive oil are replaced by stock or wine and butter;",
              "and the quintessential Mediterranean herbs such as basil and oregano are replaced by sage and rosemary.",
              "Moreover, the production of high-quality meat and cheeses is primarily due to the excellent cattle breeds largely present in the most northern regions.",
              "But now let\u2019s delve into each region and find out what speciality they have to offer!",
              "Rolling out in the north-west in a thin half-moon shape, Liguria is the most southern of the northern regions, not only geographically but specifically for its Mediterranean culinary culture.",
              "This is particularly exemplified by the use of pasta, olive oil, and basil in the traditional dish Trofie al Pesto.",
              "Trofie is a spiral-shaped type of pasta which is typically cooked al dente and almost exclusively eaten with freshly grounded pesto alla Genovese: a true symbol of Ligurian identity!",
              "For more local delights, check out our story on the most popular Ligurian foods.",
              "Classed as the second most southern region of Northern Italy for its wide use of Mediterranean ingredients, Emilia-Romagna is possibly the one region in Italy that holds most of the world-renowned Italian foods and dishes.",
              "Originally from the town of Bologna, ragu\u0300 alla Bolognese is a timeless symbol of hearty, nourishing, soul-satisfying cuisine.",
              "This slow-cooked meat-based tomato sauce, sometimes flavored with laurel and red wine, can require up to 3 hours of simmering!",
              "Ragu\u0300 is typically savored during long Sunday lunches with tagliatelle or used to make the epic lasagne.",
              "In the north-west of Italy, outlining a large portion of the southern French border, is Piemonte, a rural and industrial region with an authentic alpine identity.",
              "The name of the region derives from the Latin Pedemontium (at the foot of the mountains), referring to its position at the foot of the majestic Alps, which have indeed influenced its cuisine with the large use of butter, lard, mountain-based cheeses, and truffles.",
              "Indeed, Piemonte, and more precisely the town of Alba, is home to the most prestigious type of truffle that exists in Italy.",
              "The tuber magnatum pico is a species of white truffle with a pale golden outer layer and a spongy texture which stands out for its distinctively sharp, aromatic and earthy flavor.",
              "Growing up to 9 cms in diameter, these precious culinary gems are a prestigious symbol of Italian haute cuisine.",
              "Whether grated over egg tagliatelle or blended into a creamy risotto, they enhance any simple and humble dish with a sophisticated taste.",
              "Editor\u2019s Note: The town of Alba is known to the culinary aficionados for Piazza Duomo, one the best, and most expensive restaurants in the world.",
              "Bagna cauda is a traditional stew from Piemonte made with anchovies, garlic, and fresh seasonal vegetables.",
              "Other than being a symbol of traditional peasant food, Bagna cauda proudly symbolizes conviviality and friendship and, in fact, is often eaten with friends.",
              "It is typically placed at the center of the table and served in terracotta pots, called dian, into which everyone dips their own pieces of bread.",
              "A delicious ritual to share in front of the fire on a cold winter\u2019s night.",
              "Panna cotta is one of the most renowned desserts in Italy.",
              "This simple and delicate pudding is simply made with cream, milk, sugar, and gelatin, which confers its typical wobbly texture.",
              "Panna cotta was said to have been invented by a Hungarian woman in the Langhe area in Piemonte.",
              "Its simplicity and tender consistency make it one of the most popular desserts in the country, to be typically served with a raspberry coulis or a caramel sauce.",
              "Tucked up north and encircled by the Alps is Valle d\u2019Aosta: a tiny region with a strong linguistic and cultural identity that is one of the five autonomous regions in Italy.",
              "Due to its particular geomorphologic construction, its culinary culture has little in common with other regions, being rather a perfect symbol of pure Alpine cuisine.",
              "The first major landmark of its Alpine cuisine is undoubtedly represented by cheese fondue, prepared with the local Fontina cheese.",
              "Like many dishes in the Alpine cuisine, fonduta holds an important ritualistic value: it is typically served in a cast iron pot which is warmed by a candle and placed at the center of the table to be shared among friends \u2013 again, as a symbol of love and friendship.",
              "Mocetta, or motsetta, is a traditional cold cut meat made from the meat from cows\u2019 thighs which have been aged and preserved following incredibly ancient techniques.",
              "Mocetta is seasoned with garlic, bay leaves, rosemary, and sage and then salted and left to rest in a cool place for about 90 days.",
              "Once ready, mocetta is sliced into very thin, weightless slices, and it\u2019s traditionally eaten on black bread with butter and a drizzle of honey.",
              "Don\u2019t forget to pair it with local red wine to maximize the wonderful outburst of taste!",

              "Concia means seasoned.",
              "Maize flour cooked in milk and water is combined with local cheeses such as Fontina and Toma, which give it a sharp kick and a wonderfully creamy consistency.",
              "Polenta can be savored on its own as a main course, relished as a side together with a hearty meat stew, or even allowed to cool and cut into slices which can then be grilled or fried.",
              "Lombardy is one of the largest and richest regions in Italy.",
              "It boasts a wide variety of landscapes and ancient settlements which confer it one of the most heterogeneous cuisines in the country.",
              "Lombardy has substantial influences from Swiss and Germanic gastronomy \u2013 the early inhabitants of the region were, in fact, a Germanic tribe, the Longobards.",
              "Risotto alla Milanese is probably the most iconic dish from the city of Milan.",
              "This simple and creamy risotto will blow you away with the first forkful;",
              "and the secret lies in the perfect combination of a few simple ingredients such as butter, white wine, Parmesan, and saffron, the golden ingredient that makes this dish simply unique!",
              "With its distinctive blue veins and pungent smell, Gorgonzola is one of the most popular and internationally renowned cheeses, protected by the PDO designation.",
              "Gorgonzola can be soft and creamy or more tangy and crumbly if it\u2019s more mature.",
              "The cheese originated in the town of Gorgonzola, though its origins are still widely debated.",
              "According to folklore, Gorgonzola was invented by mistake by a young cheesemaker who was very much in love with his master\u2019s daughter and, distracted by the sight of his loved one, mixed two different curds, thus forming a strange type of cheese.",
              "Clearly a serendipitous event!",
              "Last but not least, Lombardia is home to one of the culinary symbols of Italian Christmas.",

              "Moving east we come across the Trentino-Alto Adige region, once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, of which it still reflects its lasting cultural legacies.",
              "The northern half of the region (Alto Adige or Su\u0308dtirol) is in fact ethnically and linguistically German and as such presents very little, if any, similarities with the Italian way of cooking.",
              "First there is undoubtedly canederli: large gnocchi made with stale bread soaked in milk, eggs, and smoked bacon which can be savored in a broth or seasoned with butter and cheese.",
              "The term is an Italian adaptation of the German Semmelkno\u0308del, which goes to prove how both the etymology and original concept of the dish are rooted in the German culture, while representing at the same time a culinary source of Italian pride.",
              "Another typical dish from Trentino, which many will also associate with German-speaking countries, is of course apple strudel.",
              "Despite its wide association with countries like Germany and Austria, there is evidence that the origins of this cake are actually Turkish.",
              "The Turks, who ruled Hungary and large parts of the Balkans in the 1600s, prepared a similar cake called baklava, which underwent several transformations to the current form of the apple strudel.",
              "Among Italian regions, apple strudel is most popular in Trentino-Alto Adige, due to the large cultivation of apples.",
              "Strauben are typical sweet pancakes from the Su\u0308dtirol area.",
              "They are thin and large snail-shaped pancakes, made of a mixture of flour, eggs, milk, sugar, and butter, with the magic addition of a small glass of Grappa to give it that extra boost of flavor.",
              "The term Strauben (from the German straub, meaning twisted) refers to their typical coiled shape and they are usually prepared during local street festivals and traditional village fairs.",
              "Whether sprinkled with a generous amount of icing sugar or topped with delicious berry jam, these pancakes are decidedly unique and incredibly versatile!",
              "Curving around the northern part of the Adriatic Sea is the Veneto region, chiefly famous for its large production of wine and delicious, fresh seafood.",
              "Veneto was historically dominated by the city of Venezia, establishing solid trades with the Arabs who introduced many foods and spices, such as rice and certain types of fish.",
              "One of the most popular fish dishes is in fact baccala\u0300 alla Vicentina, a culinary symbol from the city of Vicenza.",
              "Baccala\u0300 is essentially cod which has been preserved in salt or left to dry out naturally.",
              "The fish is slow-cooked for hours with the addition of milk, which helps to flatten its strong flavor.",
              "Baccala\u0300 alla Vicentina is usually served with white polenta, which derives from white cornmeal and tends to be softer and more delicate than the standard yellow one.",
              "Alternatively, it can be served as an antipasto and savored on delicious garlic-rubbed croutons.",
              "Risi e Bisi is a traditional pea risotto from the cities of Vicenza and Venezia.",
              "This incredibly creamy risotto is simply made with peas, butter, Parmesan, and a few cubes of smocked bacon which are saute\u0301ed to give an initial burst of flavor.",
              "In the 19th century, people would cry out on the streets \u201cRisi e bisi e fragole\u201d (Rice, peas, and strawberries).",
              "These three ingredients, symbolizing the Italian tricolor flag, represented the Venetian equivalent of the \u201cViva Verdi\u201d, shouted in Milan against the Austrian occupiers.",
              "A simple yet delicious dish with a strong historical importance.",
              "The king of all desserts, tiramisu\u0300 is the quintessential Italian dessert per eccellenza, despite its origins being very recent.",
              "It first appeared in cookbooks, in fact, in the 1960s, and the original recipes accounts for a base of Savoiardi biscuits drenched in coffee and topped by a generous layer of soft mascarpone cream made with egg yolk and sugar.",
              "Nothing else!",
              "The original recipe, in fact, does not include liqueur as many believe, although this versatile dessert can be adapted and made in various different ways such as white chocolate and pistachio tiramisu\u0300 or even with a berry coulis.",
              "Simply irresistible!",
              "In the far north east of the country, on the border with Slovenia, lies Friuli\u00ad-Venezia Giulia, another region which was once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and thus showcases strong Germanic and Slavic influences.",

              "Frico with potatoes can be eaten almost anywhere in Friuli, but especially in the provinces of Pordenone and Udine, and in the Dolomites.",
              "Don\u2019t forget to accompany it with a glass of red wine!",
              "The meeting point between the culinary cultures of Hungary and Friuli-Venezia Giulia lies in the northern Italian reinterpretation of this hearty meat stew.",
              "Goulash was in fact the staple dish of the Gulya\u0301s, a nomadic group of Hungarian shepherds who devised a method for preserving and transporting meat by cooking it for hours in a rich sauce made with wine and spices.",
              "The use of paprika, which characterizes this dish, only appeared in the 19th Century, when the recipe began to be widely spread to the surrounding countries, absorbing local culinary customs. Goulash can be eaten by itself or served with polenta or rice.",
              "Made with traditional capuzi garbi (the local name for pickled cabbage), this simple and humble cabbage and bean soup is a symbol of old gastronomic traditions and a true source of pride for the locals of Trieste.",
              "The garlic is initially saute\u0301ed with laurel and a few small cubes of pork, to which the cabbage, beans, and broth are then added, and it is simmered for a few hours until it\u2019s ready to eat.",

              "The fish is slow-cooked for hours with the addition of milk, which helps to flatten its strong flavor.",
              "Baccala\u0300 alla Vicentina is usually served with white polenta, which derives from white cornmeal and tends to be softer and more delicate than the standard yellow one.",
              "Alternatively, it can be served as an antipasto and savored on delicious garlic-rubbed croutons.",
              "Risi e Bisi is a traditional pea risotto from the cities of Vicenza and Venezia.",

              "In the 19th century, people would cry out on the streets \u201cRisi e bisi e fragole\u201d (Rice, peas, and strawberries).",
              "These three ingredients, symbolizing the Italian tricolor flag, represented the Venetian equivalent of the \u201cViva Verdi\u201d, shouted in Milan against the Austrian occupiers.",
              "A simple yet delicious dish with a strong historical importance.",
              "The king of all desserts, tiramisu\u0300 is the quintessential Italian dessert per eccellenza, despite its origins being very recent.",
              "It first appeared in cookbooks, in fact, in the 1960s, and the original recipes accounts for a base of Savoiardi biscuits drenched in coffee and topped by a generous layer of soft mascarpone cream made with egg yolk and sugar.",
              "Nothing else!",
              "The original recipe, in fact, does not include liqueur as many believe, although this versatile dessert can be adapted and made in various different ways such as white chocolate and pistachio tiramisu\u0300 or even with a berry coulis.",
              "Simply irresistible!",
              "In the far north east of the country, on the border with Slovenia, lies Friuli\u00ad-Venezia Giulia, another region which was once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and thus showcases strong Germanic and Slavic influences.",

              "Don\u2019t forget to accompany it with a glass of red wine!",
              "The meeting point between the culinary cultures of Hungary and Friuli-Venezia Giulia lies in the northern Italian reinterpretation of this hearty meat stew.",
              "Goulash was in fact the staple dish of the Gulya\u0301s, a nomadic group of Hungarian shepherds who devised a method for preserving and transporting meat by cooking it for hours in a rich sauce made with wine and spices.",
              "The use of paprika, which characterizes this dish, only appeared in the 19th Century, when the recipe began to be widely spread to the surrounding countries, absorbing local culinary customs. Goulash can be eaten by itself or served with polenta or rice.",

              "Home - Food Contrary to what most people believe, Italy is not just about pasta and pizza.",
              "While they certainly made those two things world-famous, Italy boasts of other delicious specialties that vary from region to region, from meat and seafood dishes to soups and stews, vegetables, rice, and desserts.",
              "The dishes are as different and as varied as the regions they originated from, each one making use of ingredients abundant in their area, while also being influenced by neighboring areas.",
              "Northern Italy is known for its risotto and hearty meat dishes like Osso Bucco.",
              "In this article, we\u2019ll travel to Northern Italy to learn more about its distinctive cuisine.",
              "Table of Contents Osso Bucco is a traditional, slow-cooked meat dish that originated in the Lombardy region of Italy.",
              "It consists of veal shanks braised in broth, white wine, vegetables like tomato, carrots, and celery, and optionally topped with gremolata\u2013a parsley, lemon zest, and garlic dressing.",
              "Its name means \u201cbone with a hole\u201d in Italian.",
              "Because veal shanks are a tougher cut of meat, it needs to be cooked longer to achieve the right texture.",
              "The melt-in-your-mouth texture of Osso bucco isn\u2019t an accident, it is the result of a long, slow, cooking process designed to get the optimal flavor and buttery texture out of the meat.",
              "Popular regional dishes usually showcase either the best ingredients or ingredients that are found in abundance in that region.",
              "This is especially the case with pesto, or Pesto alla Genovese, which originated in Genoa in the Ligurian region of Italy.",
              "Liguria is home to the best basil in Italy, and what better way to use it than in pesto, where it truly shines.",
              "Pesto is a well-loved pasta sauce known for its freshness and herbaceousness.",
              "It is traditionally made of basil leaves, pine nuts, garlic, salt, olive oil, and a hard cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano.",
              "Nowadays pesto can be found bottled everywhere, but it is simple enough to make at home, and frankly, it tastes better when you make it yourself.",
              "In simple dishes like this, using the best ingredients is imperative, as you can really taste the difference.",
              "Good quality olive oil, fresh basil, freshly crushed garlic and pine nuts truly make this dish work.",
              "It is typically a pasta sauce but can be served over meat or fish, roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, and bread and can even work as a dip.",
              "While the South of Italy is typically associated with its pizzas and pasta, the North of Italy is known for its meat dishes and rice dishes, specifically risotto.",
              "Risotto is a rice dish made with short-grain, high-starch rice like arborio or carnaroli, which is cooked in broth.",
              "The perfect risotto is creamy in consistency with the rice still al dente.",
              "There are many different types of risotto, depending also on the region where it is made.",
              "Risotto Alla Milanese or saffron risotto, is one of the most famous, and also has an interesting history.",
              "According to popular legend, the dish was invented by a glassmaker called Valerio of Flanders and his apprentice, known simply as Zafferano because of his fondness for using the spice in his work, to make the colors more vibrant.",
              "The story goes that Valerio of Flanders joked that his apprentice was so enamored with saffron that if given the chance, he would probably add it to his food and eat it.",
              "And that is what supposedly happened.",
              "On the wedding day of the daughter of Valerio of Flanders, it is said that Zafferano added some saffron to classic butter risotto, turning it into a pretty, golden-yellow hue.",
              "The guests were reportedly impressed with its color and flavor, and an iconic dish was born.",
              "The traditional accompaniment of Risotto Alla Milanese is Osso Bucco.",
              "Who doesn\u2019t love tiramisu?",
              "Tiramisu is perhaps Italy\u2019s most famous dessert but not everyone knows that it is actually a pretty recent invention.",
              "The place where it originated is a hotly contested one, a fight between two Northern Italian regions\u2013 Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia.",
              "The widespread belief is that a restaurateur named Ado Campeol, known as the \u201cfather of Tiramisu\u201d, first served it at his La Beccherie restaurant, located in Treviso in Veneto.",
              "It was said to be a version of the traditional Venetian dessert called Sbatudin.",
              "However, according to further research, it was found that tiramisu was actually first seen a few decades earlier, in the 1930s, and was the result of creative inspiration by Norma Pielli, whose family managed the Roma Hotel in Tolmezzo, Udine, in Friuli Venezia Giulia.",
              "The latter claim has won, as the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies awarded the claim to Friuli Venezia Giulia, adding it to the region\u2019s Traditional Food Products (PAT) list.",
              "Tiramisu in Italian means \u201cpick me up\u201d, and it is an apt name for the coffee-infused, sometimes liquor-infused layers of ladyfingers (savoiardi) filled with a mixture of whipped mascarpone cheese, eggs, sugar, and cocoa.",
              "Panna cotta is an Italian custard made with cream or milk, sugar, vanilla, and gelatin, although other flavorings may be added depending on the region.",

              "It is a simple, satisfying, creamy meal-ender that is considered a classic dessert in the Piedmont region.",
              "It can be served with a variety of sauces and toppings but when done right, is sufficiently satisfying on its own.",
              "Focaccia is a leavened, yeasted flatbread that looks quite similar to pizza, except that it is a bit thicker.",
              "Its shape can be rectangular or square, but it can also be round.",
              "It is usually savory but can be sweet as well.",
              "It is commonly flavored with herbs, spices, olive oil, and vegetables, but like pizza, the ingredients would depend on what region you are in.",
              "The Liguria region of Italy, specifically Genoa, is thought to be the birthplace of traditional Italian focaccia.",
              "Foccacia Genovese or Fugassa is a soft, spongy bread about 1\u20442 inch thick that is generously brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt, to get that distinctive crispy crust.",
              "It is likely the bread you think of when you think of Foccacia.",
              "It is simple, delicious, and is a nice accompaniment to various dishes.",
              "I actually make my focaccia this way, but sometimes I add rosemary for added aroma and flavor.",
              "The whole house smells amazing for hours after I make this!",
              "Risi e Bisi is a Venetian rice dish that was traditionally prepared as a springtime offering to the Doge of Venice, to celebrate the feast of San Marco on April 25.",
              "Spring is when fresh, young peas are in season, and where they are at their smallest, sweetest and softest, which lends an incomparable flavor to the simple dish.",
              "The texture of Risi e Bisi is somewhere between a risotto and a hearty, creamy soup, and though the ingredients are few and simple, is pretty satisfying when done right.",
              "In the absence of fresh, young peas, some expert cooks say that frozen or tinned varieties may work in some cases, although of course, the flavor would not be the same as when using fresh.",
              "Did you know that Italy also has its own version of cheese fondue?",
              "Known as fonduta, this version of the beloved cheese dish hails from the alpine area of Valle d\u2019Aosta in Northwestern Italy, an area bordered by France and Switzerland.",
              "Unlike the Swiss version, the Italian fonduta does not have white wine or garlic in it and is instead comprised of the famous Fontina cheese, milk, egg yolks, and flour.",
              "White truffles, a specialty of Piedmont in the same area, are sometimes added to the dish or served on the side.",
              "Like its Swiss cousin, fonduta is served with bread and is a dish that is meant to be shared with others.",
              "This liver dish is one of the most famous in Venetian culinary tradition.",
              "It has its roots in a similar dish in ancient Rome, but instead of using the sweetness of figs to mellow the strong and bitter taste of the liver, the Venetian version used the sweetness of caramelized onions, which are more readily available in the area.",
              "Sometimes vinegar, white wine, or lemon juice is also added to the mix to further balance the flavors out.",
              "Fegato Alla Veneziana is typically served with polenta, bread, or potatoes.",
              "The spaghetti Bolognese sauce we are used to is actually not the same as the Ragu Alla Bolognese common in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.",
              "The common usage of Bolognese sauce as we know it pertains to a tomato-based sauce with minced meat added.",
              "Ragu Alla Bolognese, however, is actually a more complex dish that involves several types of minced or chopped beef and pork, slow-cooked and simmered for a long period of time to produce a thick sauce.",
              "Ingredients like white wine, milk, and tomatoes help give the sauce depth and flavor.",
              "In Bologna, it is typically served with tagliatelle, but other flat and broad types of pasta may be used, as well as pasta with sturdier shapes like rigatoni.",
              "Hearty meat sauces do well with sturdier types of pasta, as they can more effectively scoop up those tender pieces of meat, unlike, for example, more delicate kinds of pasta like angel hair.",
              "Canederli is the Italian version of the Eastern and Central European kno\u0308del, or boiled bread dumplings.",
              "It is made from old bread, eggs, milk, and flour.",
              "In the Trentino region of Italy where it is a staple, it is commonly mixed with local cured meat like speck, cheese, and other flavorings.",
              "It is then boiled and served either in broth or soup or served as a side to other sauce-heavy dishes.",
              "It is a very common dish in the Trentino-Alto Adige area of Italy, which is flanked by Switzerland and Austria on its borders.",

              "Gnocchi is basically made up of a mixture of potatoes, eggs, and flour, which are then shaped into little lumps of dough, boiled, and then dressed up in various dressings and sauces.",
              "The most common way to serve them is by tossing them in a light butter sauce with fresh sage, but it is very versatile and can work with things like pesto or ragu.",
              "It can be as light or as hearty as you want it, depending on the choice of sauce and vegetables and cheese you choose to mix in with it.",
              "A popular Venetian appetizer made with salt cod, olive oil, lemon, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper.",

              "As with most Northern Italian dishes it is typically served with polenta or egg pasta.",
              "Another slow-cooked meat dish showcasing two of Piedmont\u2019s most prized products: beef and Barolo wine.",
              "Piedmontese beef is prized because of its leanness and natural tenderness, and Barolo wine, made from Nebbiolo grapes, is considered among the best wines in all of Italy.",
              "These two things come together in a rich, elegant dish that showcases the unique personality of the region.",
              "Ravioli, or stuffed pasta is a huge part of Northern Italian tradition, with many shapes and variations depending on the area.",
              "It made its first appearance in Italian cuisine in the 1500s and was originally only for aristocrats and nobles.",
              "Over time, it became more accessible to common people, who modified the fillings based on what they had available, which likely explains why ravioli has so many different versions and variations.",
              "Ravioli is thin pasta dough that contains a filling of meat, seafood, cheese, or vegetables, and can be served either in a broth or a sauce.",
              "It is typically square-shaped, although round shapes exist as well.",

              "It can be used as a substitute to potatoes or pasta.",
              "Polenta is said to have originated as a staple food for Italian farmers.",

              "This makes sense both from a commercial and practical point of view, as it allows manufacturers to control the quality of the product and protect the name.",
              "Practically speaking, it is also quite difficult to replicate it elsewhere anyway.",
              "The specific mix of climate and environment, the lifestyle and diet of the pigs, and the way they are raised play a huge role in the final flavor of the product, all of which are unique to the region.",
              "To learn more about prosciutto and Parma Ham, check out the article Parma Ham vs. Prosciutto \u2013 The #1 Important Difference on the site.",

              "At first glance, bresaola can look like any other typical cured Italian meat.",
              "However, what sets it apart from the others is that it isn\u2019t actually a cured pork product, but rather, it is made with beef, and lean beef at that.",
              "Bresaola is a specialty of the Lombardy region of Italy and is made from a single cut of beef, specifically the eye of the round cut, which is a leaner cut.",
              "It is cured with a mix of salt, white pepper, nutmeg, and other spices depending on the artisan making it.",
              "It is typically cured for at least 85 days.",

              "\u2018Nduja is traditionally from the town of Spilinga, in the province of Vibo Valentia, but it is widely produced in many other municipalities throughout the region.",
              "It can be spread on bread croutons or used to cook pasta and risotto dishes, though it is on pizza that locals really appreciate it!",
              "Typically referred to as \u201cthe fish \u2018nduja\u201d, or \u201ccaviar of the south\u201d, Sardella is nothing more than a mixture of \u2018nduja and small local fish flavored with chili pepper and fennel.",
              "This southern specialty has a decidedly strong and distinctive spicy flavor, which makes it perfect to spread on bread and to accompany with a warming glass of red or white wine.",
              "The recipe is thought to belong to Crucoli, a town in the province of Crotone, but it is also produced in Ciro\u0300 Marina and Trebisacce.",
              "Peperoncini ripieni is a traditional appetizer from Calabria made with tasty round chilies stuffed with a filling of tuna, anchovies, and capers.",
              "Peperoncini are typically prepared in the summer, when the round chilies are just ripe and succulent enough, but they are then preserved in big jars filled with olive oil, which will make them last for long periods of time.",
              "This simple yet delicious specialty is typically combined with soft, mild cheeses such as goat cheese or Robiola, as well as grilled meats.",
              "Finally we come to Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, famous for its culinary fusion of multicultural flavors that developed over the centuries as a result of the multiple invasions by Arabs, Greeks, Normans, and Spanish.",
              "Sicilian cuisine today is largely based on the wide use of fresh vegetables, such as eggplant and tomatoes, as well as on the widespread use of spices and aromatic herbs.",
              "Arancino undoubtedly deserves first place in the countless list of culinary symbols of the region.",
              "Arancini are breaded and deep-fried balls made of rice and with a delicious ragu\u0300 sauce filling.",
              "These small and delicious delicacies are indeed responsible for having divided the population over the decades over those who refer to it as Arancino, as in Catania, and those who call it Arancina, around Palermo.",
              "But on one thing they definitely agree, the origins of this dish are rooted in Arab culture as they would typically create a mixture of saffron rice, season it with lamb, and then roll it in the palm of their hands.",
              "Moreover, there is evidence that Arabs would usually tend to name their dishes with fruit names, which goes to prove that the people in Palermo were probably getting it right.",
              "Pasta alla Norma is by all accounts the most exquisite expression of simple yet healthy and nourishing cuisine.",
              "Eggplants are the main protagonists of this dish, originally made with rigatoni pasta, cooked in a rich and garlicky tomato sauce with the previously saute\u0301ed eggplant.",
              "The dish is finally garnished with fresh flakes of Ricotta cheese and a few leaves of basil.",
              "Despite its humble and unpretentious essence, this wonderful specialty was in fact named after a renowned lyrical composition, Norma, by Vincenzo Bellini, a famous Sicilian composer of the 19th Century.",
              "Last but not least, the ultimate Sicilian specialty that you have to try at least once in your life.",
              "Cassata Siciliana is a liqueur-drenched sponge cake made with almond and pistachio paste and filled with a creamy mixture of ricotta and chocolate chips.",
              "Cassata is the Sicilian dessert par excellence, you will find it in almost every bakery in Sicily, elegantly decorated with icing sugar and candied fruits arranged in perfect geometric shapes.",

              "Francesca and her children were taking private English lessons, and conversation flowed in English, though from time to time Roberta, her daughter, exclaimed in Italian at the effort involved.",
              "The meal started off with what Francesca called a light antipasto: plates of sliced raw fennel and bulbs of asparagus chicory (aka radichetta), zucchini involtini stuffed with tuna, polpettini fritti (fried mini meatballs, a specialty of Puglia), freshly baked bread, and ricotta forte (an aged, spreadable ricotta so strong it reminded me of horseradish), to be spread on crostini.",
              "The asparagus chicory was new to me.",
              "It was a bulb rather than a leafy green, with alien-like tentacles, and it had a pleasant bitterness and a texture similar to celery.",
              "These antipasti were succeeded by pepperoni con pangrattato (peppers with breadcrumbs) and cozze con pangrattato (mussels with breadcrumbs).",
              "The first dish\u2019s texture was melt-in-your-mouth, and the peppers had the most strikingly bright flavor.",
              "The mussels were served on the half shell in shallow puddles of olive oil \u2013 it was messy fun to slurp them up.",
              "The heavy pours of extra virgin olive oil boasted the quality and abundance of this most essential cooking ingredient.",
              "The antipasti underscored just how different the vegetables taste in Puglia \u2013 almost overrun with flavor.",
              "Whether it\u2019s the sun, the sea, the wind, or the soil, vegetables grown in Puglia are the best I\u2019ve ever had.",

              "Lampascioni are bulbs of the tassel hyacinth, and for many Pugliese they are the quintessential taste of home.",
              "If you mention lampascioni to someone born in Puglia, especially if they\u2019ve since moved to northern Italy or abroad, more often than not their eyes glimmer, a smile breaks out, and they say something like, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better on earth.",
              "\u201d From the perspective of a foreigner, it boggles the mind that anyone would dig them out of the ground and eat them.",
              "Lampascioni look like miniature onions but taste completely different.",
              "When I tried to prepare them, they oozed with a sticky goo, and when I bit into them they popped and the goo filled my mouth.",
              "The fact that they somewhat resemble eyeballs didn\u2019t help.",
              "But in theory, pickled or battered and deep fried, they taste delicious.",
              "Just try them in a restaurant before tackling the task of preparing them yourself.",
              "Vegetables like the lampascioni are an icon of Puglia\u2019s version of cucina povera \u2013 a style of cooking that helped give rise to the Mediterranean diet.",
              "Cucina povera has a meaning akin to \u201cmeals created or inspired by the limitations of poverty.",
              "\u201d Keys was first drawn to southern Italy because its inhabitants were healthy, yet they were near starvation for a significant portion of each year.",
              "The term cucina povera is used throughout Italy and is certainly applicable to countries around the globe.",
              "In Puglia, the practice creates a stripped down cuisine that strives to use every ingredient on hand, while still trying to use as little of each as possible.",
              "For example, pastas in Puglia, including the famous orecchiette, are made without eggs.",
              "Francesca served risotto con zucca e pancetta for the primo (first course).",
              "The squash had completely disintegrated, coloring the risotto orange, and the cheese and pancetta in the dish made it quite rich.",
              "At this point, I looked around the table to see what everyone was doing.",
              "Were they eating their whole portions?",
              "Were they slowing down?",
              "Gabriele had taken it all like a true champ, though I did notice he\u2019d shirked the vegetables during the antipasto.",
              "Roberta and Francesca, though, had left portions of their risotto on their plates.",
              "Thankfully, leaving a little on the plate was allowed.",
              "I finished mine anyway.",
              "The secondo was baked calamari \u2013 the tubular part stuffed with mussels, calamari tentacles, herbs, and who knows what else.",
              "This dish was one hundred percent sea.",
              "I didn\u2019t think I could eat any more, but Gabriele laughed and told me to find my second stomach.",
              "Somehow the suggestion helped, and when a big bowl of prawns was set before me, I managed to slowly peel the shells and eat.",
              "Cooked in tomato broth with oregano and served five to a bowl, the prawns were as red as lobsters and seemed half as big.",
              "Getting off the shells was a messy business, but I was glad to exert the effort, which gave me time to digest and maybe even burn a few calories.",
              "Thankfully, my second stomach had opened.",
              "The fruit course was next: heaping platters of pineapple, melon, and grapes.",
              "It gave me a chance to breathe, the sweet juice of the fruits slowly cooling the fire in my stomach.",
              "Frutta is an essential course for any big meal in Italy \u2013 as well as for the Mediterranean diet.",
              "For dessert, Francesca had made a berry tart with almond paste.",
              "The crust was pasta frolla, one of Italy\u2019s most important contributions to the world of pastry.",
              "Pasta frolla is very malleable when made right, and I\u2019ve seen chefs stretch it like pizza.",
              "Francesca\u2019s tart had a thin, crunchy crust that was topped with a layer of creamy almond paste, then a layer of fruit preserve, and it had one fresh strawberry in the middle.",
              "We decided to give ourselves a break, though, and sat outside on the patio to recoup.",
              "Francesca served espressi and homemade limoncello.",
              "Kristin and Roberta shared the hammock and everyone worked hard to stay awake \u2013 unsuccessfully.",
              "Gabriele disappeared inside.",
              "I let the scents from Francesca\u2019s kitchen mingle with those of the Italian countryside, and fell asleep in my chair.",

              "Puglia\u2019s restaurants are inexpensive \u2013 a liter of local house wine runs \u20ac5-10 and a normal antipasto della casa, which is sometimes the size of a two-course meal, costs between \u20ac10-15.",
              "The antipasto variety is a smorgasbord of the region\u2019s best dishes \u2013 mozzarella stuffed with ricotta, deep-fried anchovies that you eat whole, ceviche-style octopus, and a host of vegetable dishes that feature the flavorful bounty of the Mediterranean.",

              " There is no doubt that if you were to name the most internationally renowned Italian foods, many of them would probably come from the South: pizza, carbonara, and ice cream are just a few.",
              "Indeed, the South of Italy accounts for a large number of Italian cultural stereotypes: just think of the typical Neapolitan man singing passionately in the streets and gobbling down his pizza Margherita while waving his hands as he tries to continue talking.",
              "This is of course only a cliche\u0301, though it goes to exemplify just how rich in cultural images and traditions the South of Italy is.",
              "Consisting of six regions, Molise, Campania, Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, and Sicilia, Southern Italy has historically been a very poor and rudimental land marked by sharp contrasts, with the poorest parts of society subsisting on a diet largely made of wheat and vegetables while the nobility of the Regno delle Due Sicilie feeding on luxurious and sophisticated foods.",
              "The warm Mediterranean climate, however, lasting for a large part of the year mean the lands were constantly fertile with a steady and permanent cultivation of grains and vegetables, providing a constant and varied supply of food.",
              "However, one thing has solidly unified social classes and eradicated cultural differences among the various southern Italian regions, and this is the common use of major landmark ingredients which colorfully sum up the Italian culinary essence: tomatoes, a wide variety of soft cheeses, and the magic touch of Mediterranean herbs such as oregano and basil.",
              "Let\u2019s round up some of the most popular Southern Italian dishes.",

              "Due to the heat and dryness of the climate, people from Calabria have always placed great importance on preserving their foods, which is why vegetables and animal produce are often laden with salt and oil, which undoubtedly helped to confer it the reputation of having a rich yet flavor-filled cuisine.",

              "But on one thing they definitely agree, the origins of this dish are rooted in Arab culture as they would typically create a mixture of saffron rice, season it with lamb, and then roll it in the palm of their hands.",

              " Mediterranean cuisine is the food and methods of preparation used by the people of the Mediterranean Basin.",
              "The idea of a Mediterranean cuisine originates with the cookery writer Elizabeth David's book, A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950) and was amplified by other writers working in English.",
              "Many writers define the three core elements of the cuisine as the olive, wheat, and the grape, yielding olive oil, bread and pasta, and wine;",
              "other writers deny that the widely varied foods of the Mediterranean basin constitute a cuisine at all.",
              "A common definition of the geographical area covered, proposed by David, follows the distribution of the olive tree.",
              "The region spans a wide variety of cultures with distinct cuisines, in particular (going anticlockwise around the region) the Maghrebi, Egyptian, Levantine, Ottoman (Turkish), Greek, Italian, French (Provenc\u0327al), and Spanish, though some authors include additional cuisines.",
              "Portuguese cuisine, in particular, is partly Mediterranean in character.",
              "The historical connections of the region, as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region's climate and economy, mean that these cuisines share dishes beyond the core trio of oil, bread, and wine, such as roast lamb or mutton, meat stews with vegetables and tomato (for example, Spanish andrajos), vegetable stews (Provenc\u0327al ratatouille, Spanish pisto, Italian ciambotta),[1] and the salted cured fish roe, bottarga, found across the region.",
              "Spirits based on anise are drunk in many countries around the Mediterranean.",
              "The cooking of the area is not to be confused with the Mediterranean diet, made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich in olive oil, wheat and other grains, fruits, vegetables, and a certain amount of seafood, but low in meat and dairy products.",
              "Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients, including meat, are dealt with in the kitchen, whether they are health-giving or not.",
              "Various authors have defined the scope of Mediterranean cooking either by geography or by its core ingredients.",
              "Elizabeth David, in her A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950), defines her scope as \"the cooking of the Mediterranean shores\" and sketches out the geographical limits:[2] from Gibraltar to the Bosphorus, down the Rhone Valley, through the great seaports of Marseilles, Barcelona, and Genoa, across to Tunis and Alexandria, embracing all the Mediterranean islands, Corsica, Sicily, Sardinia, Crete, the Cyclades, Cyprus (where the Byzantine influence begins to be felt), to the mainland of Greece and the much disputed territories of Syria, the Lebanon, Constantinople, and Smyrna.",
              "[2] Despite this definition, David's book focuses largely on Spain, France, Italy, and Greece.",
              "[4] She defines this region as coextensive with the range of the olive tree: \"those blessed lands of sun and sea and olive trees\".",
              "[2] The olive's natural distribution is limited by frost and by availability of water.",
              "It is therefore constrained to a more or less narrow zone around the Mediterranean Sea, except in the Maghreb and in the Iberian Peninsula, where it is distributed more widely, and on the islands of the Mediterranean, where it is widespread.",
              "[5][2] The Tunisian historian Mohamed Yassine Essid similarly defines the region by the olive's presence, along with bread, wheat, and the grape as the \"basic products of Mediterranean folk cuisine\":[6] Mediterranean cuisine is defined by the presence of fundamental elements which are said to play a more important role than others, reflecting a community of beliefs and practices which transcend religions, languages and even societies.",
              "The olive tree, the emblematic tree on more than one account, traces the bounds of a frontier of landscapes and lives on either side of which the Mediterranean begins or ends.",
              "Above Montelimar, nicknamed \"Gates of Provence\", is the limit of the olive.",
              "[6] Other authors question that there is any such common core: The belief in a common core, emerging from a claim to authority over that kernel of \"Mediterranean-ness,\" is what underlies writing describing the culinary Mediterranean, yet it seems that only from far away does a unified Mediterranean exist.",
              "The closer one gets to that common core, the less it is visible, until the food of Umbria comes to seem entirely different from the food of Tuscany, and to compare either to the food of Greece would be absurd.",
              "The very idea of a Mediterranean ensemble\u2014be it onions and olive oil and tomatoes or some other combination entirely\u2014presupposes not only a shared history but a unified history, an imagined moment in which the Mediterranean presented a single culture that over time has, like a language, split and branched and flowered into the wild variety of contemporary cuisine.",
              "[4] Some writers include the cuisines of the eastern Adriatic coast of Dalmatia \u2013 Albanian, Montenegrin, and Croatian, while most do not mention them.",
              "Some writers also include areas not touching the Mediterranean Sea or supporting olive cultivation, including Serbian, Macedonian, and Portuguese cuisine.",
              "[7] Essid identifies the \"trinity\" of basic ingredients of traditional Mediterranean cuisine as the olive, wheat, and the grape, yielding oil, bread, and wine respectively.",
              "[6] The archaeologist Colin Renfrew calls this the \"Mediterranean triad\".",
              "[8] The olive appears to come from the region of Persia and Mesopotamia, at least 6,000 years ago.",
              "[9] It spread from there to nearby areas, and has been cultivated since the early Bronze Age (up to 3,150 BC) in southern Turkey, the Levant, and Crete.",
              "[10][11] The ten countries with the largest harvests (in 2011) are all near the Mediterranean (Portugal being the tenth largest): together, they produce 95% of the world's olives.",
              "[12] The olive yields bitter fruits, made edible by curing and fermentation, and olive oil.",
              "Some 90% of the fruit production (1996) goes into olive oil.",
              "[13] The Mediterranean region accounts for the world's highest consumption of olive oil: in 2014, the highest-consuming country, Greece, used 17 kg[a] per head;",

              "the United States for comparison used only 1 kg per head.",

              "Its ancestors include wild emmer wheat;",
              "this was hybridised, harvested and sown to create domestic strains with larger grains, in ears that shatter less readily than wild forms.[15] It was spread across the Mediterranean region as far as Spain by 5,000 BC.",
              "[16] Wheat is a staple food in the Mediterranean region.",
              "Wheat bread was already critically important in the empire of Ancient Rome, which included the entire region;",
              "at that time, around 2,000 years ago, North Africa was the \"breadbasket\" of the empire.",

              "[19] In turn, these are made into dishes such as the Greek dessert galaktoboureko (milk bo\u0308rek), consisting of filo pastry parcels around a custard made with semolina.",
              "[20] A widespread wheat dish from Turkey and the Levant to Iran and India is halva, a dessert of sweetened semolina with butter, milk, and pine kernels.",

              "Raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour.",
              "[23] The concept of a Mediterranean cuisine is very recent, probably dating from the publication of David's A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950).",
              "[24] David herself did not use the term, speaking instead of Mediterranean \"food\", \"cookery\", or \"cooking\".",
              "[25] The usefulness of the concept is disputed.",
              "Carol Helstosky, author of the book Food Culture in the Mediterranean (2009), is among the authors who use \"Mediterranean cuisine\" interchangeably with \"Mediterranean food\".",

              "Of course: we\u2019re talking about the jet-set here, certainly not about the majority of people, who very much, on the other hand, based their diet on the simple union of three things (and the products made of them): the vine, the olive, and cereals.",
              "This was called Mediterranean Triad and is still today considered central to the diet known worldwide as the Mediterranean diet.",
              "Wine, olive oil, and bread, then, plus healthy helpings of vegetables, legumes, and cheese: this is what the people of Rome would eat on daily basis.",
              "The coming of the Barbarians in the peninsula didn\u2019t only cause the end of the Roman Empire, but also that of such a tradition of, let us say, banqueting in style: this rugged-looking, harsh-speaking people from central and northern Europe had very little in common with Romans and their lifestyle.",
              "As it always happens when cultures meet and clash, the two influenced each other, also in the kitchen: the Barbarians (who, as a matter of fact, ended up being the last straw needed to provoke the fatal collapse of the Empire, but who embraced with pure eagerness all that was Roman culturally, spiritually and socially) introduced the consumption of butter and beer, whereas the Romans passed on to them a taste for wine and olive oil.",

              "After Constantine declared Christianity a legal religion of the Empire and especially after it became the sole Imperial religion with the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, under the reign of emperor Theodosius I, Christianity began exercising heavy regulations upon people\u2019s behaviors and habits, including the way they ate.",
              "Food and eating were strongly associated with sin and with sexuality: pride, of course, was Adam and Eve\u2019s sin, but it did manifest itself through the acts of a woman, who ate the forbidden fruit.",
              "As a consequence, spiritual perfection could be obtained through abstinence and fasting and, in particular, through renunciation to meat consumption.",
              "Very much up to the year 1000, the monks of Italy (and of the whole of Europe, as a matter of fact) ate a strict diet of bread and legumes, with very spare additions of cheese and eggs on allowed days, along with some seasonal fruit.",
              "The meat was considered a dangerous aliment not only for its symbolic meaning: it was refused as food both because its production involved an act of blatant violence, the killing of an animal, but also because it was considered an energetic food, which could provoke in its consumer\u2019s unclean desires and passions.",
              "In other words, Medieval Christians thought, meat could make you lose your chastity more easily than salad.",

              "During these days of the feast, food became one and only with celebrating and honoring the Lord, just as fasting and restrictions did during the rest of the week.",
              "Monasteries slowly but steadily abandoned those strict ascetic regulations that had characterized them up to that point and opened to the flavors and tastes of good food on special occasions, which also became moments of prayer and reflection.",

              "What did they eat in the early Middle Ages?",
              "Let\u2019s have a look into that side of the history of Italian cuisine!",
              "The social structure built around the castle and its lord had become, by the 11thcentury, organized in an autarchic economical system which allowed most of its members (craftsmen, members of the military, servants, peasants) to eat regularly and with relative ease.",
              "The lord of the castle, of course, was the one with the fuller stomach, but even to him and his family, food was far from being a gastronomic matter: up to when living in the cities flourished again, in Italy before than everywhere else, and people\u2019s mores became, once again, more refined, medieval banqueting remained closer to barbaric food feasts than to old, lavish and harmonious Roman banquets.",
              "In the later Middle Ages, town life blossomed again with the development of the comuni culture: this supported the inception of early productive cores upon which a whole new social class was to found its roots: the bourgeoisie.",
              "Craftsmen were hit by higher demands, dictated by the higher number of people living in urban areas, as well as by a steep increase in commerce, both within and without the borders of Italy as we know it today.",
              "The Crusades had opened up Europe to the idea of communicating with one\u2019s neighbor and products began to circulate with much ease: a new social class, that of merchants was born.",
              "It is, then, among this crafts and commerce crowd that the pleasure of good food became, once again, a symbol of social and economic status.",
              "Cooking returned to be a matter of enjoyment and refinement, a voyage among flavors and combinations.",
              "Meats and vegetables were once again roasted and braised, the old art of stewing and dressing dishes in rich, flavorsome sauces was rediscovered.",
              "The lords of the castle were going that extra mile to make things even more flamboyant, and embraced with flair the old imperial habit to present food and dishes on the plate spectacularly: birds were served decorated with their own feathers as if they were still living, pork was brought onto the table with its head still attached to the body, surrounded by pounds and pounds of sides.",
              "Such a rediscovery of old, traditional ideas in the kitchen, coincided with the introduction of new culinary elements especially on the lords\u2019 table: spices and cane sugar, introduced to Italy by the Arabs and grown in Sicily, substituted salt, pepper, or honey in many a dish and helped to create new flavors and recipes.",
              "It is, for instance, during the 13th century that sugared almonds (called confetti in Italy) were created and usually served as a sign of culinary distinction at the end of very important dinners: of course, we\u2019re talking about modern confetti, covered with a delicious sugar shell here, but the idea of having almonds or even aniseeds covered in a sweet shell was common already in Roman times.",
              "However, the Romans didn\u2019t know sugar, so they would use a paste of honey and flour instead.",
              "In general, almonds preparations became very popular, especially thanks to Sicilian cuisine and its love for Arabic flavors: it was in Sicily, for instance, that the Arabs introduced an ancestor of marzipan, which was to become a very popular medieval dessert.",
              "What many don\u2019t know is that, very probably, the most famous of all Sicilian dessert, the cassata, may have Arabic origins, too.",
              "The cake, made with sheep ricotta mixed with sugar, sponge cake, royal paste (a sweet paste made of almond flour and sugar) and candied fruit, was created during the Arab domination of island, between the 9th and the 11th century.",
              "Arabs had introduced sugar cane, lemons, and oranges to the cultures of Sicily and very soon they all became part of its cuisine: all these ingredients concurred, along with sheep ricotta, always produced in the South of Italy, and almonds, to create the cassata.",
              "Even its name may come from the Arabic word qas\u2019at, which means \u201csmall basket,\u201d and could indicate the container where the cake was made.",
              "However, other linguists think the name actually comes from the Latin caseum, which means \u201ccheese.",
              "\u201d Either way, the roots of the dish itself are certainly Middle Eastern, even though it changed greatly throughout the centuries: for instance, the pasta di mandorle \u2013 a paste made with almond flour and sugar, which is an ingredient of marzipan \u2013 began to be used only during the Norman period to cover cassate.",
              "Before then, they were encased in shortbread.",
              "Some place the origin of another delicious Italian sweet treat in the same period, and at the hand of the same people, the Arabs: it seems, in fact, that the history of gelato, the world famous Italian-style ice cream, is very much rooted on Sicilian soil and in Arabic culinary tradition.",
              "The Arabs commonly produced a sorbet-like concoction of sugar and fruit juices, turned into ice by keeping it immersed in a mixture of ice and salt.",
              "They exported the method in Sicily, where fruits were plenty, marine salt local produce, and ice came easily from the peaks of Mount Etna.",
              "Even though gelato as we know it became a fixture of European tables only in the 1600s, thanks to the popularity it reached in France, Arabic Sicily wins the medal for having been the first place in the western world where its ancestor was produced.",

              "More or less distinct areas in medieval Europe where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned.",
              "In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes and olives.",
              "In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually had to settle for cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import.",
              "Citrus fruits (though not the kinds most common today) and pomegranates were common around the Mediterranean.",
              "Dried figs and dates occurred quite frequently in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.",
              "[1] Olive oil was among the ubiquitous ingredients around the Mediterranean, but remained an expensive import in the north where oil of poppy, walnut, hazel and filbert was the most affordable alternative.",
              "Butter and lard, especially after the Black Death, was used in considerable quantities in the northern and northwestern regions, especially in the Low Countries.",
              "Almost universal in middle and upper class cooking all over Europe was the almond, which was in the ubiquitous and highly versatile almond milk, which was used as a substitute in dishes that otherwise required eggs or milk, though the bitter variety came along much later.",
              "[2] Though various forms of dishes consisting of batter or dough cooked in fat, like cre\u0302pes, fritters and doughnuts were common in most of Europe, they were especially popular among Germans and known as krapfen (Old High German: \"claw, hook\") and were quite similar to the deep-fried dough pastries of today.",
              "The extensive use of lard and butter for cooking and a diet that was perceived as especially fatty gained Germans a reputation as being the \"fat Germans\".",
              "The fasting regulations of the Catholic Church posed particular problems to the German population.",
              "Olives could not be cultivated and olive oil was an expensive import.",
              "Oils made from various nuts were available, but in relatively short supply.",
              "By far, the most common sources of fat were butter and, above all, lard.",
              "The price of fish was generally higher, and while it was unaffordable to most people for most of the time, the need to use fish for fasting days could mean considerable increases in expenses for the wealthier households.",
              "Mustard was used in other parts of Europe long before the Middle Ages, but seemed to be especially common in Germany.",
              "A 14th-century travel account by Eustache Deschamps, a French poet, shows his considerable discontent with the German custom of smearing generous amounts of mustard on just about every type of meat.",
              "[3] It was rare that recipes for use in dire situations were included in recipe collections, but one example from a cookbook in Low German has been preserved.",
              "[4] It gives instructions for a wartime stew consisting of any available greens and vegetables to be boiled in animal stomachs or intestines, an effective method in situations where no proper kitchenware would be available.",
              "In the First Margrave War, the city of Nuremberg was able to feed its citizens properly and still emerge victorious through careful planning, extensive stockpiling of grain and meat and strict control of prices by the town council.",
              "[5] The most common grains in Poland were millet (often made into kasza, a type of porridge) and wheat.",
              "Barley and oats were cultivated, but used mostly as animal feed or for brewing beer.",
              "Cabbage (especially as sauerkraut), kale, peas, broad beans, and onions were the most common vegetables.",
              "Dill and mustard were almost ubiquitous potherbs and parsley was used as a leafy green in stews, as a flavor additive, and applied as a coloring agent in dishes for the upper classes.",
              "Beef, pork and poultry (primarily chicken) were the most common meats, with the occasional appearance of mutton and lamb.",
              "Game, as elsewhere, was highly prized, but in short supply and usually limited to the high nobility, as hunting licenses were controlled by land owners.",
              "Fish was a staple, but unlike Germans, Poles tended to eat it only on fast days when meat was forbidden by the church.",
              "Beer was drunk by all social classes, and came in many different varieties and made from millet, wheat, barley, rye or oats sometimes in combination.",
              "Wheat beer was the most common.",
              "Labrador tea, a mildly toxic herb, was often used as an ingredient to increase intoxication.",
              "It was mixed with hops and then added to a barley and wheat beer to produce what was called \"thick beer\".",
              "Though often believed to be a common Slavic drink, mead was fairly expensive and primarily enjoyed at weddings and baptismal parties, though always overshadowed by the ever-present beer.",
              "It had a high standing as a ceremonial drink and used when arranging alliances and closing contracts.",
              "Wine was generally quite expensive and was enjoyed mostly by the nobility.",
              "Although there is evidence of a few vineyards in Poland, almost all wine had to be imported.",
              "A large variety of breads, like obwarzanki, were sold by vendors in Krako\u0301w as early as the 14th century and placki, flat cakes, came in a surprising number of varieties, including one variety with an apple topping, reminiscent of pizza.",
              "German bakers operating in Polish towns had much influence.",
              "Krepels (from German Krapfen, \"claw;",
              "hook\") were fried pastries with a cheese filling served with strawberries or other fruit, and resembled a modern empanada.",
              "[6] Relatively little is known about the eating habits of the Anglo-Saxons of the Early and High Middle Ages before the Norman conquest in 1066.",
              "Ale was the drink of choice of both commoners and nobles, and the known dishes included various stews, simple broths, soups and a hard pancake like bread called crumpet.",
              "[7] Bacons were also consumed.",
              "[8] The level of refinement was low, and international influence fairly insignificant.",
              "This all changed in the 11th century after the Norman invasion.",
              "With the invaders came a new and less provincial gentry, and new eating habits, especially for the nobility.",
              "While traditional British cooking today is not regarded with high esteem internationally, the Medieval Anglo-Norman cooks were considerably more refined and more cosmopolitan.",
              "It has previously been believed that the Anglo-Norman cuisine was mostly similar to that of France, but recent study has shown that many recipes had unique English traits.",
              "This was based partly on the different available foodstuffs on the British Isles, but more due to influence from Arab cuisine through the Norman conquest of Sicily.",
              "The Arab invaders in the 9th century had cultivated their lifestyle culturally and economically to such a degree that the Norman invaders inherited and adapted many of their habits, including cooking styles.",
              "Norman participation in the crusades also brought them into contact with Middle Eastern and Byzantine cooking.",
              "The subtlety (or entremet), the fanciful and highly decorative surprise dish used to separate one course from another, was brought to new levels of complexity and refinement by the English chefs.",
              "Among the specialties were pommes dore\u0301es (\"gilded apples\"), meatballs of mutton or chicken coloured with saffron or a glaze of egg yolk.",
              "The Anglo-Norman variant, pommes d'orange, were flavoured and coloured with the juice of bitter oranges.",
              "[9] The climate in the far north of Europe made cultivation of cereals even more difficult, and the wheat so popular in the south was a luxury in northern Europe.",
              "Wheat could cost at least twice as much as the most common grains, barley and rye.",
              "Barley was the most widely grown, but a great percentage of the harvest went into the extensive beer production, while rye was the principal bread grain.",
              "Like in the rest of Europe, oats was considered only fit as animal fodder and was eaten only when no other choice was available, and then usually as porridge or gruel.",
              "Though grains were in the highest regard among medieval Scandinavians and were among the most frequently mentioned foods, other vegetable foods were an indispensable part of the diet: peas, turnips, beans, carrots, onions, leeks and various greens and herbs all provided essential nutrients and vitamins.",
              "Kale, a form of cabbage, was especially important in Denmark and Sweden and was a valuable source of fresh food in the winter months, since it kept well and could be harvested (and even tasted better) after the first frost had set in.",
              "[10] Fish was of great importance to most of Scandinavia, and particularly so was the herring fishing in the Limfjord and Oresund.",
              "The great shoals of herring migrating from the Atlantic into the Baltic to feed were funnelled through certain narrow points and were caught in huge numbers.",
              "The amount of fish caught was more than enough to feed the local population and allowed for huge exports of smoked, and especially salted, fish.",
              "Great herring markets were organized in southern Scandinavia, most notably at Skano\u0308r in Scania, which was in the Middle Ages part of Denmark.",
              "From this market alone, merchant vessels of the Hanseatic League, the powerful medieval confederation of northern German cities, exported upwards of over 100,000 barrels of salted herring during many decades of the Late Middle Ages.",
              "[11] Of equal, or even greater importance was cod, often fished on the North Sea and Atlantic, dried to make stockfish, and imported as an important staple, particularly during fast and Lent.",
              "Many freshwater fish were also of great dietary or economic importance, such as salmon, eel, pike and bream.",
              "Cattle rearing was very widespread in Scandinavia, especially Denmark, where the Black Death had left huge field areas untended and well-suited for grazing.",
              "The majority of meat produced was consumed by the local population, but an export market for high-grade beef slowly built up after the 1360s, and had by the 17th century reached well over 100,000 animals per year.",
              "All this cattle meant not just meat, but also great quantities of dairy products, which consisted mostly of soured milk drinks, various cheeses and, also a major export product, butter.",
              "[12] Northern French cuisine had many similarities to the Anglo-Norman French across the channel, but also had its own specialties.",
              "Typical of the Northern French kitchen were the potages and broths, and French chefs excelled in the preparation of meat, fish, roasts, and the sauces that were considered appropriate to each dish.",
              "The use of dough and pastry, which was fairly popular in Britain at the time, was almost completely absent from recipe collections with the exception of a few pies.",
              "Nor were there any forms of dumplings or the fritters that were so popular in Central Europe.",
              "A common Northern French habit was to name dishes after famous and often exotic places and people.",
              "A specialty among finer French chefs was the preparation of so-called parti-colored dishes.",
              "These mimicked the late medieval fashion of wearing clothing with two colors contrasting one another on either side of the garment, a fashion that survived in the costumes of court jesters.",
              "The common Western European \"white dish\" (blanc manger) had a northern French variant where one side was colored bright red or blue.",
              "Another recipe in Du fait de cuisine from 1420 described an entremet consisting of a roasted boar's head with one half colored green and the other golden yellow.",
              "[13] Roman influence on the entire Mediterranean region was so considerable that to this day, the basic food in most of the region is still wheat bread, olives, olive oil, wine, cheese, and the occasional piece of meat or fish.",
              "The territories from the Atlantic to the Italian Peninsula, and especially the Catalan and Occitan-speaking areas were closely interrelated culturally and politically.",
              "The Muslim conquest of Sicily and southern Spain was highly influential on the cuisine by introducing new plants like lemons, pomegranates, eggplants and spices such as saffron.",
              "The coloring of food and many other cooking techniques were passed on by the Arab invaders to their European possessions and were gradually spread to regions further north.",
              "The Iberian Peninsula has a highly varied geography with a central Meseta, a vast, flat plateau, surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges and cut off from the rest of Europe by the Pyrenees.",
              "This meant that several distinct cultures co-existed on the peninsula with several unique cuisines.",
              "Since Ancient times it had been a colony of several Mediterranean cultures.",
              "The Phoenicians introduced the cultivation of olives and the Greeks brought the Malvasia grape, founding a wine industry that would become renowned in the Middle Ages.",
              "But it was the Roman Empire, of which the peninsula was the westernmost outpost, that had the biggest impact on Iberian cuisine.",
              "After the collapse of Roman rule, Visigothic invaders conquered most of the modern day Spain and Portugal in the 5th century.",
              "The Visigoths took on many Roman customs, like the focus on vegetables, and used Latin for official purposes.",
              "But it was the invasions of North African Muslims and the establishment of Al-Andalus that gave Iberian cuisine its unique nature.",
              "The Muslims brought with them the highly refined cuisine influenced by Arab courts in the Middle East.",
              "The center of this Arab civilization was Baghdad, at the time one of the largest cities in the world.",
              "The new rulers introduced many new customs and foodstuffs;",
              "goblets made of glass rather than metal, savory meat dishes cooked with fruit, spices and herbs like cinnamon, mastic, caraway, sesame and mint and the use of ground almonds or rice as thickeners and a fondness for adding tangy liquids like verjuice, tamarind and the juice of bitter oranges to produce a distinctly sweet-sour taste.",
              "The impact can clearly be seen in the multitude of Arab loanwords in Spanish;",
              "naranja \"orange\", azu\u0301car (\"sugar\"), alcachofa (\"artichoke\"), azafra\u0301n (\"saffron\") and espinaca (\"spinach\"), many of which eventually spread to other languages in Europe.",
              "The Spanish Muslims established the sequences of dishes which was to permeate the entire continent and which still forms the basis for many modern European meals;",
              "soup followed by meat dishes and finished off with sweets.",
              "It's also believed that escabeche, a vinegar-based dish, could very well be of Arab-Persian origin, though this has been contested.",
              "One of the earliest medieval cookbooks in a language other than Latin was Libre de Sent Sovi\u0301 (\"The Book of Saint Sophia\"), written in Catalan around 1324.",
              "A majority of its recipes call for bitter oranges, rose water and cider to achieve the popular tangy flavor of late medieval cuisine.",
              "It contains many fish recipes, but surprisingly enough, no mention of shellfish, which must have been one of the major food sources in the Catalan coastal regions.",
              "The highly influential Libre del Coch, in Catalan as well, was published in a printed edition in 1520, but is assumed to have been written no later than 1490.",
              "The typical medieval white dish (manjar blanco) seems to have appeared first in Catalonia in the 8th century and eventually evolved into a type of sweet pudding.",
              "While poorly represented in cookbooks, the most common food for the general population, other than the regular staples of bread, wine, garlic, onion and olive oil, included eggs, lamb, beef, kid and bacon.",
              "The Jewish population of Al-Andalus, the Sephardic Jews, developed their cuisine in close contact with Christians and Muslims. Influences went in both directions and lasted even after the expulsions and forced conversions of the Jewish population that followed the Reconquista.",
              "Among the specialties was adafina (from Arabic al dafina \"the buried treasure\"), a meat dish that was prepared by burying it in hot coals on the day before the Shabbat.",
              "Jewish fish pie dishes have survived in Spanish cuisine as empanadas de pescado.",
              "[14] The lucrative Mediterranean trade in spices, silk and other luxuries from Africa and Asia were shipped on the galleys of the powerful city-states of Genoa, Venice and Florence, making them phenomenally rich.",
              "Medieval Italy, meaning primarily the northern Italian Peninsula, was one of the few regions in medieval Europe where the distinction between nobility and prosperous commoners were more or less irrelevant, the result of a significant, rich and self-conscious middle class.",
              "This meant that the level of culinary refinement and diversity was especially great when compared to the rest of the continent.",
              "Italian cuisine was, and still is, better described as a multitude of highly varied regional cuisines, each with long traditions and their own specialties.",
              "Italian dishes can therefore be considered either traditional or imported.",
              "Being the hub of a vast trade network meant that there was greater access to foreign luxuries to influence the local cooking.",
              "Still, there was a great deal of conservatism and in general far more of local Italian foodstuffs were exported to the New World than the other way around, though the impact of important products such as vanilla, corn, kidney beans, and of course, the tomato, which had a considerable impact on the cooking south of Naples, even if this transition took some time.",
              "[15] Many Italian staples and internationally recognized favorites were invented and refined during the Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance;",
              "pasta was on everyone's dinner plate by the 13th century, though it was commonly made out of rice flour rather than durum wheat;",
              "pizza, the medieval Italian term for \"pie\", and tortes came in many varieties with a wide range of toppings, ranging from marzipan, and custards to chicken, eel, or even hemp;",
              "polenta made from French green lentils or barley;",
              "risotto;",
              "and a myriad of local or regional variants of sausage and cheese which was eaten by more or less everyone.",
              "As early as the Middle Ages, the cheeses, in particular, appear to have been highly specialized, from a fresh Tuscan to an aged Milanese from Tadesca, wrapped and shipped in tree bark.",
              "Medieval Italians also used eggs to a higher degree than many other regions, and the recipe collections describe herb omelettes (herboletos) and frittatas.",
              "Grapes as tasty morsels and lemons as a cooking ingredient was ubiquitous and, of course, olive oil of every conceivable kind was the cooking fat of choice in all regions, including the north, for dressing salads, frying, seasoning, marinading and preserving meats.",
              "[16] The cuisine of southern France, corresponding roughly to the extent of Occitania, had far more in common with Italian and Spanish cooking than with northern French cuisine.",
              "Ingredients that distinguished southern cooking included sugar, walnut oil, chickpeas, pomegranates and lemons, all of which were grown locally.",
              "While pomegranate seeds were occasionally used to decorate dishes in France and England, flavoring dishes with pomegranate juice was a practice unique to the Occitan areas.",
              "The use of butter and lard was rare, salted meat for frying was common, and the preferred methods of cooking tended to be dry roasting, frying, or baking.",
              "For the latter, a trapa, a portable oven that was filled with food and buried in hot ashes, was often used.",
              "Dishes still common today, like escabeche, a vinegar-based dish, and aillade (aioli), a garlic sauce (still made in Toulouse with walnut oil), were well-established in the Late Middle Ages.",
              "Evidence of influence from Muslim Spain can be found in recipes for matafeam, a Christian version of the originally Hispano-Jewish Shabbat stew adafina, but with pork rather than lamb.",
              "And, Raymonia (Occitan;",
              "Ital: Romania) is based on the Arabic Rummaniya, a chicken bruet with pomegranate juice, ground almonds, and sugar.",
              "Only one recipe collection is positively identified as being from southern France.",
              "The Modus viaticorum preparandorum et salsarum is a collection of 51 recipes.",
              "It was written ca.",
              "1380\u201390 in Latin with occasional words in Occitan.",
              "The Modus contains a Salsa de cerpol (Wild thyme sauce) and a Cofiment anguille (Confit of eel), which appear nowhere else but in Occitania.",
              "[17] A cookery book from northern Europe may have originated in Provence.",
              "Known from its incipit as Libellus de arte coquinaria, it is the Codex K version of the Harpestraeng Cookbook, which is part of a collection of medical papers written by, or belonging to, Dr.",

              "\"Realpolitik\" is the notion that politics must be conducted in terms of the realistic assessment of power and the self-interest of individual nation-states (and the pursuit of those interests by any means, often ruthless and violent ones) and Cavour used it superbly.",

              "In 1858, he formed an alliance with France, one that included a pledge of military support if necessary, against Austria, Italy's major obstacle to unification.",

              "Doubtful.",
              "But is speed really the only issue?",
              "That, too, is doubtful.",
              "It seems that of the two, Cavour alone understood the relationship between national and international events, and was thus able to manipulate foreign policy for his own ends.",
              "Garibaldi, a democrat, a warrior, and an anti-Catholic, was without question on the road to conflict with the monarchies of Europe.",
              "Cavour, with the added credibility of representing a monarch, blended perfectly with the political situation in Europe at the time.",
              "Cavour was a realist who practice realistic politics.",
              "He allied with France when necessary and with France's key enemy, Prussia, was necessary.",
              "By keeping the goal in mind, Cavour used international power to achieve his domestic goals.",
              "Garibaldi was forced to use his own grassroots strength, empowered by young Italian democrats interested in an idealistic future for their nation.",
