    "response": "That's a very interesting question. There are many unsolved mysteries in the world that fascinate people, and different people may have different opinions on which one is the most fascinating. However, based on the search results, some of the most popular and intriguing unsolved mysteries are:\n\n- The **Voynich Manuscript**, a 240-page book written in an unknown language or script with strange drawings of plants, diagrams and events. No one knows who wrote it, what it means or why it was made[^2^] [^1^].\n- The **Kryptos Sculpture**, a coded sculpture outside the CIA headquarters that contains four encrypted messages. Only three of them have been cracked so far, and the artist has given some clues to the fourth one, but it remains unsolved[^2^].\n- The **Incident at Dyatlov Pass**, where nine ski-hikers died mysteriously in the mountains of Russia in 1959. Their tent was ripped open from the inside, their bodies had signs of trauma, burns, blood loss and missing organs, and some of their clothes were radioactive. Various theories have been proposed, such as avalanche, animal attack, military testing, UFOs or infrasound[^2^] [^1^].\n- The **Havana Syndrome**, where dozens of American and Canadian diplomats and spies in Cuba reported hearing strange noises and suffering from various symptoms such as nausea, headache, dizziness, hearing loss and brain damage. The cause and source of the phenomenon are still unknown, and some suspect it may be a sonic weapon or a microwave attack[^3^].\n- The **Georgia Guidestones**, a granite monument in Georgia that has ten guidelines for humanity inscribed in eight languages. The identity of the person or group who commissioned and designed the monument is a mystery, as well as their purpose and motivation. Some see it as a message of peace and wisdom, while others see it as a sinister plot for a new world order[^6^].\n\nThese are just some examples of the many unsolved mysteries that exist in the world. Each one has its own theories and speculations, but none has been conclusively proven or debunked. What do you think about these mysteries? Do you have any favorite ones?",

              "The text, written in a language that has yet to be decoded, has confounded scholars, cryptologists and amateur sleuths for centuries.",
              "And last week, a hullaballoo erupted over a Times Literary Supplement piece by historical researcher and television writer Nicholas Gibbs, who claimed to have solved the enduring Voynich mystery.",
              "The manuscript, Gibbs theorized, is a woman\u2019s health manual, and each character of its elusive language represents medieval Latin abbreviations.",
              "Gibbs claimed to have decoded two lines of the text, and his work was initially met with enthusiasm.",
              "But alas, experts and enthusiasts were soon poking holes in Gibbs\u2019 theory.",
              "Lisa Fagin Davis, executive director of the Medieval Academy of America, told the Atlantic\u2019s Sarah Zhang that Gibbs\u2019 decoded text \u201cdoesn\u2019t result in Latin that makes sense.",
              "\u201d The most recent interpretation of the Voynich Manuscript may not have been sound, but it\u2019s certainly not the wackiest theory about the text\u2019s contents and origin.",
              "The manuscript has been attributed to everyone from ancient Mexican cultures to Leonardo da Vinci to aliens.",
              "Some say the book is a nature encyclopedia.",
              "Others claim it is an elaborate hoax.",
              "Why has the Voynich proved so baffling, so polarizing over the years?",
              "Here are six things to know about the elusive manuscript: It is divided into four sections, each of them very weird As Michael LaPointe explains in the Paris Review, the book begins with an herbal section featuring vibrant drawings of plants\u2014but nobody is quite sure what sort of plants they are supposed to be.",
              "Then comes the astrological section, which includes foldout drawings of celestial charts that do not seem to match up with any known calendar.",
              "The astrological wheels are dotted with little drawings of nude women, and in the subsequent balneological section, the nude drawings go wild.",
              "Illustrations depict naked women bathing in green liquid, naked women being propelled by jets of water, naked women supporting rainbows with their hands.",
              "Some scholars believe that one illustration shows naked women hanging out on a pair of ovaries.",

              "10 Chilling Theories Regarding The Dyatlov Pass Incident",
              "Jamie Frater Head Editor Jamie founded Listverse due to an insatiable desire to share fascinating, obscure, and bizarre facts.",
              "He has been a guest speaker on numerous national radio and television stations and is a five time published author.",
              "The events that occurred in the Ural Mountains at the beginning of February 1959, what would become known as the Dyatlov Pass incident, remain one of the 20th century\u2019s most mysterious encounters\u2014not least because we still don\u2019t have a satisfactory or widely accepted explanation for why nine experienced hikers lost their lives in brutal ways.",
              "Their tent was found in ruins, cut from the inside.",
              "Several of the hikers were discovered barefoot and almost naked near the original campsite around a month after their disappearance.",
              "What is interesting is that a trail of footprints\u2014some barefoot\u2014led from the tent and then simply stopped.",
              "The rest were discovered almost three months later, buried under snow in a ravine.",
              "Just what happened to them?",
              "Why did they leave their tent, some barefoot, in the middle of the night in brutally cold temperatures, an act that would certainly guarantee their deaths?",
              "Here are ten theories as to just what happened.",
              "The most obvious explanation would be that the group, for all their experience, were the unfortunate victims of a freak avalanche.",
              "Case solved, right?",
              "Well, not quite.",
              "First of all, the area has absolutely no history of avalanches, certainly none that would cause outright death.",
              "[1] Secondly, even if this was a freak occurrence that just happened to hit on the night when hikers just happened to be on that part of the mountainside, there was simply no evidence of an avalanche when searchers eventually combed the area in search of the missing hikers.",
              "Aside from there being no evidence of an avalanche, the injuries eventually discovered on the recovered bodies didn\u2019t line up with such an incident.",
              "Although this explanation was very much promoted at one time\u2014and even now, some people insist this is what happened\u2014it simply does not add up.",
              "Furthermore, such insistence, against the obvious facts, could be argued to suggest a cover-up of sorts.",
              "Okay, let\u2019s get this one out of way.",
              "It was a UFO!",
              "That is certainly the theory of some researchers.",
              "[2] And while there is no evidence to suggest they are correct, there are some interesting details to examine that might suggest involvement of a highly advanced craft from another world.",
              "For example, where two of the hikers were discovered, next to the burned-out remains of a campfire, there was substantial damage to the trees that overlooked their makeshift base.",
              "The damage was around 4.",
              "6 meters (15 ft) high.",
              "Some researchers have theorized that this was the result of a UFO hovering just above the treetops.",
              "Furthermore, some of the group who would be discovered months after they disappeared were found with pieces of skin, lips, and eyes apparently surgically removed.",
              "While some claim these \u201cinjuries\u201d were merely the result of decomposition, others say the seemingly precise cuts suggest intelligent action.",
              "Perhaps one of the most interesting claims is that the group met their grisly end at the hands\u2014or should that be claws\u2014of a Yeti or Bigfoot-like creature that inhabits the remote regions of the Ural Mountains.",
              "[3] The local Mansi tribe has legends of a Yeti-like creature called the Menk, and furthermore, it is said to roam the area of the incident.",
              "There is a famous picture recovered from the belongings of the group on Nikolai Thibeaux-Brignolle\u2019s camera.",
              "On a shot known as \u201cFrame 17,\u201d there is a strange picture that seems to show a figure that bears a resemblance to a Bigfoot-type creature.",
              "Some people believe that this \u201cfigure\u201d was actually one of the hikers returning from a raised piece of land, probably looking to get their bearings.",
              "The fact that it was the last picture Thibeaux-Brignolle took, though, leads to some people perhaps reading more into what there actually is.",
              "Or perhaps it wasn\u2019t a Bigfoot or one of the group?",
              "Perhaps, as our next entry looks at, it was something potentially more menacing.",
              "Less talked-about is the claim that the hikers were the unfortunate victims of escaped prisoners from the gulags in the region.",
              "[4] Many such prisoners, who very well may have been incarcerated since World War II and wouldn\u2019t be at all up to speed with world events, would have been imprisoned in these facilities.",
              "To them, the conflict could very much have still been taking place unless they had other, inside knowledge.",
              "Furthermore, being spotted by strangers could result in an attack from these desperate people\u2014themselves potentially hardened from the war and untold time behind bars with no freedom whatsoever.",
              "They would, one would imagine, weigh up the options of attacking a (relatively) small group against the risk of being reported to the Soviet authorities, which would lead to many years back in the brutal gulags.",
              "In addition to the potential threats from escaped gulag prisoners, the gulag authorities themselves were likely to shoot first and ask questions later, particularly in the region the hikers were.",
              "[5] We should bear in mind that they were off-course and somewhere they had not planned to be.",
              "Might the gulag authorities, perhaps conducting a standard patrol of the area or maybe looking for an escaped prisoner, have been a little eager for a potential apprehension and killed the hikers in error?",
              "Imagine the anger from the local population if this was to become known.",
              "Perhaps, then, a cover-up was decided upon?",
              "Note, however, that a potential hole in this theory and the one above is that the nearest gulag was reportedly about 100 kilometers (60 mi) from where the incident took place.",
              "While there is no proof that gulag guards killed the hikers and covered it up, there is certainly enough murkiness around the incident for people to be suspicious.",
              "Also, it was the Cold War, a time when distrust, even among a country\u2019s citizens, ran deep.",
              "In fact, the notion that the Cold War played a major part in this mysterious incident carries over into our next entry.",
              "There are some claims that the incident was a result of a CIA/KGB meeting involving the handing over of radioactive materials which ultimately resulted in the deaths of nine Soviet citizens.",
              "[6] There is no real proof to these claims, and they rely heavily on the simple fact that the Cold War was in its heyday at the time.",
              "And, if there was any chance at all that the United States could have been placed in a negative light, the Soviets would have taken it.",
              "However, there is reason to believe there could have been a type of \u201centrapment\u201d scenario unfolding.",
              "For example, there were considerable indications of radiation, both in the area itself and on some of the dead hikers.",
              "Rumors would surface that the incident was an attempt to plant radioactive materials on CIA agents \u201ccaught\u201d behind Soviet lines.",
              "Somehow, the operation went wrong, and the hikers were killed.",
              "If this theory was true, then that would mean that at least one of the hikers was a KGB operative.",
              "And that is the subject of our next entry.",
              "What\u2019s more, there is sufficient reason to believe that there really could have been a KGB presence in the Ural Mountains.",
              "There are several theories that the \u201chike\u201d into the mountains was secretly, and against the majority of the hikers\u2019 knowledge, a KGB operation.",
              "[7] Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of these claims is the fact that the oldest member of the group, 37-year-old Semyon (aka Alexander) Zolotaryov (second from right above), was not only a last-minute addition but also reportedly had extensive military and combat training.",
              "Why, exactly, was he there?",
              "Perhaps the tattoo on his body is worth paying more attention to by researchers into this most mysterious case?",
              "The tattoo read \u201cDAERMMUAZUAYA.",
              "\u201d According to those who have researched the word, there is no translation in any known language.",
              "Many assume it to be either a secret military tag or some kind of secret society moniker.",
              "If there is any truth to Zolotaryov, or any of the Dyatlov crew, being KGB agents, what their mission might have been is still anyone\u2019s guess.",
              "Some theories would persist that the deaths were the result of attacks from local tribes in the area, most notably the Mansi tribe.",
              "[8] There is no real evidence of this;",
              "the Mansi were largely peaceful and uninterested in the outside world.",
              "Furthermore, much like the details already mentioned when examining the apparent \u201cescape\u201d from their tent, there was no evidence in the surrounding snow\u2014which was largely undisturbed\u2014of such an approach by a tribe, who wouldn\u2019t have been thinking at all of covering their tracks, certainly not after an attack.",
              "And for an attack to happen at night in the middle of an apparent blizzard is even more unlikely.",
              "While they certainly make a convenient scapegoat, there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the Mansi, or any other tribe in the area, were responsible for these most sudden and strange deaths.",
              "It perhaps should be noted, tough, that the local tribes did refer to the mountain where the incident took place as the \u201cMountain of the Dead.",
              "\u201d Perhaps one of the most bizarre theories, albeit one that is grounded in scientific thought, is the gravity fluctuation theory.",
              "[9] What this theory essentially argues is that there was a sudden drop in gravity in a \u201ccorridor\u201d that the hikers were unfortunately camped in.",
              "This is a little-known (and unproven) phenomenon, but it does, at least in theory, explain the eventual location of the campers\u2019 bodies.",
              "For example, it is argued that those who first rushed outside the camp were essentially placed into a non-gravitational situation where they died instantly\u2014as if they were in a vacuum.",
              "The others were dragged from the tent, which would explain the \u201ctears from the inside.",
              "\u201d They were literally ripped from the tent due to the sudden and dramatic drop in gravity.",
              "It is argued that this unusual phenomenon occurs more than people realize but rarely results in such a drastic situation, as people aren\u2019t usually caught in the event.",
              "Some researchers even claim that if the hikers had simply kept their tent shut, they would have survived the rare incident.",
              "This theory could explain the mysterious deaths, reports of strange lights, and the air of secrecy with which the Soviet authorities handled the incident.",
              "Many rumors persisted in the area that the Soviets would regularly test secret weapons.",
              "Some have even claimed that \u201cneutron weapons\u201d were in use.",
              "[10] The injuries of some of the campers\u2014who had severe internal trauma but little external damage\u2014would certainly suggest some sort of advanced and secretive technology.",
              "Might it be possible that the Soviet military were testing weapons designed to \u201cscare\u201d the United States, for example, only to kill nine of its own citizens?",
              "Much like the gulag theories, this scenario would result in an instant and deep cover-up.",
              "Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of the whole dire and terrible situation is that of Yuri Yudin.",
              "[11] Only 24 hours into the ill-fated excursion, Yudin (pictured above being hugged) would come down with an illness, severe enough that he had to return to their set-off point.",
              "Knowing what we now know of the group\u2019s situation, it was perhaps the most well-timed illness in the entirety of the 20th century.",
              "Whatever the sickness was, it ultimately saved his life.",
              "Indeed, it perhaps makes one ponder the precariousness of our existence, where one circumstance seemingly as innocent and trivial as being too ill to participate can ultimately result in saving one\u2019s life.",
              "Regardless, the decision would allow Yudin to live to old age, which he did, although he never had anything of significance to add to the investigations into the deaths of his colleagues.",

              "Dispatched as a member of a search party investigating a group of nine experienced hikers\u2019 disappearance, Sharavin and his fellow rescuers spotted the corner of a tent peeking out beneath the snow, as he told BBC News\u2019 Lucy Ash in 2019.",
              "Inside, they found supplies, including a flask of vodka, a map and a plate of salo (white pork fat), all seemingly abandoned without warning.",
              "A slash in the side of the tent suggested that someone had used a knife to carve out an escape route from within, while footprints leading away from the shelter indicated that some of the mountaineers had ventured out in sub-zero temperatures barefoot, or with only a single boot and socks.",
              "Perplexed, the search party decided to toast to the missing group\u2019s safety with the flask found in their tent.",
              "\u201cWe shared [the vodka] out between us\u2014there were 11 of us, including the guides,\u201d Sharavin recalled.",

              "While the majority of the group appeared to have died of hypothermia, at least four had sustained horrific\u2014and inexplicable\u2014injuries, including a fractured skull, broken ribs and a gaping gash to the head.",
              "One woman, 20-year-old Lyudmila Dubinina, was missing both her eyeballs and her tongue.",
              "The wounds, said a doctor who examined the bodies, were \u201cequal to the effect of a car crash,\u201d according to documents later obtained by the St.",
              "Petersburg Times.",
              "Today, the so-called Dyatlov Pass Incident\u2014named after the group\u2019s leader, 23-year-old Igor Dyatlov\u2014is one of Russia\u2019s most enduring mysteries, spawning conspiracy theories as varied as a military cover-up, a UFO sighting, an abominable snowman attack, radiation fallout from secret weapons tests and a clash with the indigenous Mansi people.",
              "But as Robin George Andrews reports for National Geographic, new research published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment points toward a more \u201csensible\u201d explanation, drawing on advanced computer modeling to posit that an unusually timed avalanche sealed the hikers\u2019 fate.",
              "\u201cWe do not claim to have solved the Dyatlov Pass mystery, as no one survived to tell the story,\u201d lead author Johan Gaume, head of the Snow and Avalanche Simulation Laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, tells Live Science\u2019s Brandon Specktor.",
              "\"But we show the plausibility of the avalanche hypothesis [for the first time].\"",
              "In 2019, Russian authorities announced plans to revisit the incident, which they attributed not to a crime, but to an avalanche, a snow slab or a hurricane.",
              "The following year, the inquiry pinned the hikers\u2019 deaths on a combination of an avalanche and poor visibility.",
              "As the state-owned RIA news agency reported in July 2020, the official findings suggested that a torrent of snow slabs, or blocky chunks, surprised the sleeping victims and pushed them to seek shelter at a nearby ridge.",
              "Unable to see more than 50 feet ahead, the hikers froze to death as they attempted to make their way back to their tent.",
              "Given the official findings\u2019 lack of \u201ckey scientific details,\u201d as well as the Russian government\u2019s notorious \u201clack of transparency,\u201d however, this explanation failed to quell the public\u2019s curiosity, per National Geographic.",
              "Critics of the slab avalanche theory cite four main counterarguments, says Gaume to Live Science: the lack of physical traces of an avalanche found by rescuers;",
              "the more than nine-hour gap between the hikers building their camp\u2014a process that required cutting into the mountain to form a barrier against the wind\u2014and their panicked departure;",
              "the shallow slope of the campsite;",
              "and the traumatic injuries sustained by the group.",
              "(Asphyxiation is a more common cause of death for avalanche victims.)",
              "Gaume and co-author Alexander M.",
              "Puzrin, a geotechnical engineer at ETH Zu\u0308rich, used historical records to recreate the mountain\u2019s environment on the night of the Dyatlov incident and attempt to address these seeming inconsistencies.",
              "Then, the scientists write in the study, they simulated a slab avalanche, drawing on snow friction data and local topography (which revealed that the slope wasn\u2019t actually as shallow as it had seemed) to prove that a small snowslide could have swept through the area while leaving few traces behind.",
              "The authors theorize that katabatic winds, or fast-flowing funnels of air propelled by the force of gravity, transported snow down the mountain to the campsite.",
              "\u201c[I]t was like somebody coming and shoveling the snow from one place and putting it on the slope above the tent,\u201d Puzrin explains to New Scientist\u2019s Krista Charles.",
              "Eventually, the accumulating snow became too heavy for the slope to support.",
              "\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t made a cut in the slope, nothing would have happened,\u201d says Puzrin in a statement.",
              "\u201c[But] at a certain point, a crack could have formed and propagated, causing the snow slab to release.",

              "According to National Geographic, Gaume was so impressed by the movie\u2019s depiction of snow that he asked its creators to share their animation code with him.",
              "This simulation tool, coupled with data from cadaver tests conducted by General Motors in the 1970s to determine what happened to the human body when struck at different speeds, enabled the pair to show that heavy blocks of solid snow could have landed on the hikers as they slept, crushing their bones and causing injuries not typically associated with avalanches.",
              "If this was the case, the pair posits, those who had sustained less serious blows likely dragged their injured companions out of the tent in hopes of saving their lives.",
              "Jim McElwaine, a geohazards expert at Durham University in England who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, tells National Geographic that the slabs of snow would have had to be incredibly stiff, and moving at a significant speed, to inflict such violent injuries.",
              "Speaking with New Scientist, McElwaine adds that the research \u201cdoesn\u2019t explain why these people, after being hit by an avalanche, ran off without their clothes on into the snow.",
              "\u201d He continues, \u201cIf you\u2019re in that type of harsh environment it\u2019s suicide to leave shelter without your clothes on.",

              "I can\u2019t understand why else they would have behaved in that way unless they were trying to flee from someone who\u2019s been tracking them.",
              "\u201d Gaume, on the other hand, views the situation rather differently.",

              "A 2019 US academic study found \"brain abnormalities\" in the diplomats who had fallen ill, but Cuba dismissed the report.",
              "Canada also cut its embassy staff in Cuba after at least 14 of its citizens reported similar symptoms. The latest study was carried out by a team of medical and scientific experts who examined the symptoms of about 40 government employees.",
              "Many have suffered longstanding and debilitating effects, the report said.",
              "\"The committee felt that many of the distinctive and acute signs, symptoms and observations reported by (government) employees are consistent with the effects of directed, pulsed radio frequency (RF) energy,\" the report reads.",

              "Doctors, scientists, intelligence agents and government officials have all been trying to find out what causes \"Havana syndrome\" - a mysterious illness that has struck American diplomats and spies.",
              "Some call it an act of war, others wonder if it is some new and secret form of surveillance - and some people believe it could even be all in the mind.",
              "So who or what is responsible?",
              "It often started with a sound, one that people struggled to describe.",
              "\"Buzzing\", \"grinding metal\", \"piercing squeals\", was the best they could manage.",
              "One woman described a low hum and intense pressure in her skull;",
              "another felt a pulse of pain.",
              "Those who did not hear a sound, felt heat or pressure.",
              "But for those who heard the sound, covering their ears made no difference.",
              "Some of the people who experienced the syndrome were left with dizziness and fatigue for months.",
              "Havana syndrome first emerged in Cuba in 2016.",
              "The first cases were CIA officers, which meant they were kept secret.",
              "But, eventually, word got out and anxiety spread.",
              "Twenty-six personnel and family members would report a wide variety of symptoms. There were whispers that some colleagues thought sufferers were crazy and it was \"all in the mind\".",
              "Five years on, reports now number in the hundreds and, the BBC has been told, span every continent, leaving a real impact on the US's ability to operate overseas.",
              "Uncovering the truth has now become a top US national security priority - one that an official has described as the most difficult intelligence challenge they have ever faced.",
              "Hard evidence has been elusive, making the syndrome a battleground for competing theories.",
              "Some see it as a psychological illness, others a secret weapon.",
              "But a growing trail of evidence has focused on microwaves as the most likely culprit.",
              "In 2015, diplomatic relations between the US and Cuba were restored after decades of hostility.",
              "But within two years, Havana syndrome almost shut the embassy down, as staff were withdrawn because of concerns for their welfare.",
              "Initially, there was speculation that the Cuban government - or a hard-line faction opposed to improving relations - might be responsible, having deployed some kind of sonic weapon.",
              "Cuba's security services, after all, had been nervous about an influx of US personnel and kept a tight grip on the capital.",
              "That theory would fade as cases spread around the world.",
              "But recently, another possibility has come into the frame - one whose roots lay in the darker recesses of the Cold War, and a place where science, medicine, espionage and geopolitics collide.",
              "When James Lin, a professor at the University of Illinois, read the first reports about the mysterious sounds in Havana, he immediately suspected that microwaves were responsible.",
              "His belief was based not just on theoretical research, but first-hand experience.",
              "Decades earlier, he had heard the sounds himself.",
              "Since its emergence around World War Two, there had been reports of people being able to hear something when a nearby radar was switched on and began sending microwaves into the sky.",
              "This was even though there was no external noise.",
              "In 1961, a paper by Dr Allen Frey argued the sounds were caused by microwaves interacting with the nervous system, leading to the term the \"Frey Effect\".",
              "But the exact causes - and implications - remained unclear.",
              "Radio 4 - Crossing Continents The Mystery of Havana Syndrome In the 1970s, Prof Lin set to work conducting his experiments at the University of Washington.",
              "He sat on a wooden chair in a small room lined with absorbent materials, an antenna aimed at the back of his head.",
              "In his hand he held a light switch.",
              "Outside, a colleague sent pulses of microwaves through the antenna at random intervals.",
              "If Prof Lin heard a sound, he pressed the switch.",
              "A single pulse sounded like a zip or a clicking finger.",
              "A series of pulses like a bird chirping.",
              "They were produced in his head rather than as sound waves coming from outside.",
              "Prof Lin believed the energy was absorbed by the soft brain tissue and converted to a pressure wave moving inside the head, which was interpreted by the brain as sound.",
              "This occurred when high-power microwaves were delivered as pulses rather than in the low-power continuous form you get from a modern microwave oven or other devices.",
              "Prof Lin recalls that he was careful not to dial it up too high.",
              "\"I did not want to have my brain damaged,\" he told the BBC.",
              "In 1978, he found he was not alone in his interest, and received an unusual invitation to discuss his latest paper from a group of scientists who had been carrying out their own experiments.",
              "During the Cold War, science was the focus of intense super-power rivalry.",
              "Even areas like mind control were explored, amid fears of the other side getting an edge - and this included microwaves.",
              "Prof Lin was shown the Soviet approach at a centre of scientific research in the town of Pushchino, near Moscow.",
              "\"They had a very elaborate, very well-equipped laboratory,\" Prof Lin recalls.",
              "But their experiment was cruder than his.",
              "The subject would sit in a drum of salty seawater with their head sticking out.",
              "Then microwaves would be fired at their brain.",
              "The scientists thought the microwaves interacted with the nervous system and wanted to question Prof Lin on his alternative view.",
              "Curiosity cut both ways, and US spies kept close track on Soviet research.",
              "A 1976 report by the US Defense Intelligence Agency, unearthed by the BBC, says it could find no proof of Communist-bloc microwave weapons, but says it had learnt of experiments where microwaves were pulsed at the throat of frogs until their hearts stopped.",
              "The report also reveals that the US was concerned Soviet microwaves could be used to impair brain function or induce sounds for psychological effect.",
              "\"Their internal sound perception research has great potential for development into a system for disorienting or disrupting the behaviour patterns of military or diplomatic personnel.\"",
              "American interest was more than just defensive.",
              "James Lin would occasionally glimpse references to secret US work on weapons in the same field.",
              "And while Prof Lin was in Pushchino, another group of Americans not far away were worried that they were being zapped by microwaves - and that their own government had covered it up.",
              "For nearly a quarter of a century, the 10-storey US embassy in Moscow was bathed by a wide, invisible beam of low-level microwaves.",
              "It became known as \"the Moscow signal\".",
              "But for many years, most of those working inside knew nothing.",
              "The beam came from an antenna on the balcony of a nearby Soviet apartment and hit the upper floors of the embassy where the ambassador's office and more sensitive work was carried out.",
              "It had been first spotted in the 1950s and was later monitored from a room on the 10th floor.",
              "But its existence was a secret tightly held from all but a few working inside.",
              "\"We were trying to figure out just what might be its purpose,\" explains Jack Matlock, number two at the embassy in the mid-70s.",
              "But a new ambassador, Walter Stoessel, arrived in 1974 and threatened to resign unless everyone was told.",
              "\"That caused something like panic,\" recalls Mr Matlock.",
              "Embassy staff whose children were in a basement nursery were especially worried.",
              "But the State Department played down any risk.",
              "Then Ambassador Stoessel, himself, fell ill - with bleeding of the eyes as one of his symptoms. In a now declassified 1975 phone call to the Soviet ambassador to Washington, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger linked Stoessel's illness to microwaves, admitting \"we are trying to keep the thing quiet\".",
              "Stoessel died of leukaemia at the age of 66.",
              "\"He decided to play the good soldier\", and not make a fuss, his daughter told the BBC.",
              "From 1976 screens were installed to protect people.",
              "But many diplomats were angry, believing the State Department had first kept quiet, and then resisted acknowledging any possible health impact.",
              "This was a claim echoed decades later with Havana syndrome.",
              "What was the Moscow signal for?",
              "\"I'm pretty sure that the Soviets had intentions other than damaging us,\" says Matlock.",
              "They were ahead of the US in surveillance technology and one theory was that they bounced microwaves off windows to pick up conversations, another that they were activating their own listening devices hidden inside the building or capturing information through microwaves hitting US electronic devices (known as \"peek and poke\").",
              "The Soviets at one point told Matlock that the purpose was actually to jam American equipment on the embassy roof used to intercept Soviet communications in Moscow.",
              "This is the world of surveillance and counter-surveillance, one so secret that even within embassies and governments only a few people know the full picture.",
              "One theory is that Havana involved a much more targeted method to carry out some kind of surveillance with higher-power, directed microwaves.",
              "One former UK intelligence official told the BBC that microwaves could be used to \"illuminate\" electronic devices to extract signals or identify and track them.",
              "Others speculate that a device (even perhaps an American one) might have been poorly engineered or malfunctioned and caused a physical reaction in some people.",
              "However, US officials tell the BBC no device has been identified or recovered.",
              "After a lull, cases began to spread beyond Cuba.",
              "In December 2017, Marc Polymeropolous woke suddenly in a Moscow hotel room.",
              "A senior CIA officer, he was in town to meet Russian counterparts.",
              "\"My ears were ringing, my head was spinning.",
              "I felt like I was going to vomit.",
              "I couldn't stand up,\" he told the BBC.",
              "\"It was terrifying.\"",
              "It was a year after the first Havana cases, but the CIA medical office told him his symptoms didn't match the Cuban cases.",
              "A long battle for medical treatment began.",
              "The severe headaches never went away and in the summer of 2019 he was forced to retire.",
              "Mr Polymreopolous originally thought he had been hit by some kind of technical surveillance tool that had been \"turned up too much\".",
              "But when more cases emerged at the CIA which were all, he says, linked to people working on Russia, he came to believe he had been targeted with a weapon.",
              "But then came China, including at the consulate in Guangzhou in early 2018.",
              "Some of those affected in China contacted Beatrice Golomb, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who has long researched the health effects of microwaves, as well as other unexplained illnesses.",
              "She told the BBC that she wrote to the State Department's medical team in January 2018 with a detailed account of why she thought microwaves were responsible.",
              "\"This makes for interesting reading,\" was the non-committal response.",
              "Prof Golomb says high levels of radiation were recorded by family members of personnel in Guangzhou using commercially available equipment.",
              "\"The needle went off the top of the available readings.\"",
              "But she says the State Department told its own employees that the measurements they had taken off their own back were classified.",
              "A host of problems plagued early investigations.",
              "There was a failure to collect consistent data.",
              "The State Department and CIA failed to communicate with each other, and the scepticism of their internal medical teams caused tension.",
              "Only one out of the nine cases from China was initially determined by the State Department to match the criteria for the syndrome based on Havana cases.",
              "That left others who experienced symptoms angry, and feeling as if they were being accused of making it up.",
              "They began a battle for equal treatment, which is still going on today.",
              "As frustration grew, some of those affected turned to Mark Zaid, a lawyer who specialises in national security cases.",
              "He now acts for around two dozen government personnel, half from the intelligence community.",
              "\"This is not Havana syndrome.",
              "It's a misnomer,\" argues Mr Zaid, whose clients were affected in many locations.",
              "\"What's been going on has been known by the United States government probably, based on evidence that I have seen, since the late 1960s.\"",
              "Since 2013, Mr Zaid has represented one employee of the US National Security Agency who believed they were damaged in 1996 in a location which remains classified.",
              "Mr Zaid questions why the US government has been so unwilling to acknowledge a longer history.",
              "One possibility, he says, is because it might open a Pandora's Box of incidents that have been ignored over the years.",
              "Another is because the US, too, has developed and perhaps even deployed microwaves itself and wants to keep it secret.",
              "The country's interest in weaponising microwaves extended beyond the end of the Cold War.",
              "Reports say from the 1990s, the US Air Force had a project codenamed \"Hello\" to see if microwaves could create disturbing sounds in people's heads, one called \"Goodbye\" to test their use for crowd control, and one codenamed \"Goodnight\" to see if they could be used to kill people.",
              "Reports from a decade ago suggested these had not proved successful.",
              "But the study of the mind and what can be done to it has been receiving increased focus within the military and security world.",
              "\"The brain is being seen as the 21st Century battle-scape,\" argues James Giordano, an adviser to the Pentagon and Professor in Neurology and Biochemistry at Georgetown University, who was asked to look at the initial Havana cases.",
              "\"Brain sciences are global.",
              "It is not just the province of what used to be known as the West.\"",
              "Ways to both augment and damage brain function are being worked on, he told the BBC.",
              "But it is a field with little transparency or rules.",
              "He says China and Russia have been engaged in microwave research and raises the possibility that tools developed for industrial and commercial uses - for instance to test the impact of microwaves on materials - could have been repurposed.",
              "But he also wonders if disruption and spreading fear were also the aim.",
              "This kind of technology may have been around for a while - and even have been used selectively.",
              "But that would still mean something changed in Cuba to get it noticed.",
              "Bill Evanina was a senior intelligence official when the Havana cases emerged, and stepped down as the head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center this year.",
              "He has little doubt about what happened in Havana.",
              "\"Was it an offensive weapon?",
              "I believe it was,\" he told the BBC.",
              "He believes microwaves may have been deployed in recent military conflicts, but points to specific circumstances to explain a shift.",
              "Cuba, 90 miles off the Florida coast, has long been an ideal site to collect \"signals intelligence\" by intercepting communications.",
              "During the Cold War, it was home to a major Soviet listening station.",
              "When Vladimir Putin visited in 2014, reports suggested it was being re-opened.",
              "China also opened two sites in recent years, according to one source, while the Russians sent in 30 additional intelligence officers.",
              "But from 2015, the US was back in town.",
              "With its newly opened embassy and a beefed-up presence, the US was just beginning to establish its footing, collecting intelligence and pushing back against Russian and Chinese spies.",
              "\"We were in a ground fight,\" one person recalls.",
              "Then the sounds began.",
              "\"Who had the most to benefit from the closing of the embassy in Havana?\"",
              "asks Mr Evanina.",
              "\"If the Russian government was increasing and promulgating their intelligence collection in Cuba, it was probably not good for them to have the US in Cuba.\"",
              "Russia has repeatedly dismissed accusations it is involved, or has \"directed microwave weapons\".",
              "\"Such provocative, baseless speculation and fanciful hypotheses can't really be considered a serious matter for comment,\" its foreign ministry has said.",
              "And there have been sceptics about the very existence of Havana syndrome.",
              "They argue that the unique situation in Cuba supports their case.",
              "Robert W Baloh, a Professor of Neurology at UCLA, has long studied unexplained health symptoms. When he saw the Havana syndrome reports, he concluded they were a mass psychogenic condition.",
              "He compares this to the way people feel sick when they are told they have eaten tainted food even if there was nothing wrong with it - the reverse of the placebo effect.",
              "\"When you see mass psychogenic illness, there's usually some stressful underlying situation,\" he says.",
              "\"In the case of Cuba and the mass of the embassy employees - particularly the CIA agents who first were affected - they certainly were in a stressful situation.\"",
              "In his view, every-day symptoms like brain fog and dizziness are reframed - by sufferers, media and health professionals - as the syndrome.",
              "\"The symptoms are as real as any other symptoms,\" he says, arguing that individuals became hyper-aware and fearful as reports spread, especially within a closed community.",
              "This, he believes, then became contagious among other US officials serving abroad.",
              "There remain many unexplained elements.",
              "Why did Canadian diplomats report symptoms in Havana?",
              "Were they collateral damage from targeting nearby Americans?",
              "And why have no UK officials reported symptoms?",
              "\"The Russians have literally tried to kill people on British soil in recent years with radioactive materials, yet why are there no reported cases?\"",
              "asks Mark Zaid.",
              "\"I would probably put on pause the statement that no-one in the UK has experienced any symptoms,\" responds Bill Evanina, who says the US is now sharing details with allies to spot cases.",
              "Some instances may be unrelated.",
              "\"We had a bunch of military folk in the Middle East who claimed to have this attack - turned out they had food poisoning,\" says one former official.",
              "\"We need to separate the wheat from the chaff,\" reckons Mark Zaid, who says members of the public, some with mental health issues, approach him claiming to suffer from microwave attacks.",
              "One former official reckons around half the cases reported by US officials are possibly linked to attacks by an adversary.",
              "Others say the real number could be even smaller.",
              "A December 2020 report by the US National Academies of Sciences was a pivotal moment.",
              "Experts took evidence from scientists and clinicians as well as eight victims. \"It was quite dramatic,\" recalls Professor David Relman of Stanford, who chaired the panel.",
              "\"Some of these people literally were in hiding, for fear of further actions against them by whomever.",
              "There were actually precautions we had to take to ensure their safety.\"",
              "The panel looked at psychological and other causes, but concluded that directed, high energy, pulsed microwaves were most likely responsible for some of the cases, similar to the view of James Lin, who gave evidence.",
              "But even though the State Department sponsored the study, it still considers the conclusion only a plausible hypothesis and officials say they have not found further evidence to support it.",
              "The Biden administration has signalled it is taking the issue seriously.",
              "CIA and State Department officials are given advice on how to respond to incidents (including 'getting off the X' - meaning physically moving from a spot if they feel they are getting hit).",

              "Microwave weapons that could cause Havana Syndrome exist, experts say ...",
              "Russia and possibly China have developed technology capable of injuring brain and a US company made a prototype in 2004 Portable microwave weapons capable of causing the mysterious spate of \u201cHavana Syndrome\u201d brain injuries in US diplomats and spies have been developed by several countries in recent years, according to leading American experts in the field.",
              "A US company also made the prototype of such a weapon for the marine corps in 2004.",
              "The weapon, codenamed Medusa, was intended to be small enough to fit in a car, and cause a \u201ctemporarily incapacitating effect\u201d but \u201cwith a low probability of fatality or permanent injury\u201d.",
              "There is no evidence that the research was taken beyond the prototype phase, and a report on that stage has been removed from a US navy website.",
              "Scientists with knowledge of the project said that ethical considerations preventing human experimentation contributed to the project being shelved \u2013 but they said such consideration had not hindered US adversaries, including Russia, and possibly China.",
              "\u201cThe state of that science has for the most part been, if not abandoned, pretty much left fallow in the United States \u2013 but it has not been fallow elsewhere,\u201d said James Giordano, professor of neurology and ethics at Georgetown University Medical Center.",
              "Giordano, who is also senior fellow in biotechnology, biosecurity and ethics at the US Naval War College, was brought in as adviser by the government in late 2016 after about two dozen US diplomats began falling sick in Havana.",
              "He later took part in an assessment for US Special Forces Command on which countries were developing the technology and what they had achieved.",
              "\u201cIt became clear that some of the work that was conducted in the former Soviet Union was taken up again by Russia and its satellite proxies,\u201d Giordano said, adding that China had also developed directed energy devices to test the structure of various materials, with technology which could be adapted to weapons.",
              "A second major wave of brain injuries among US diplomats and intelligence officers took place in China in 2018.",
              "Giordano is restricted from giving details on which country had developed what kind of device but he said the new weapons used microwave frequencies, able to disrupt brain function without any burning sensation.",
              "\u201cThis was important \u2013 and rather frightening \u2013 to us, because it represented a state of advancement and sophistication of these types of instruments that heretofore had not been thought to be accomplished,\u201d he said.",
              "If a US adversary has succeeded in miniaturising the directed energy technology needed to inflict tissue damage from a distance, it makes such weapons a more plausible explanation for Havana Syndrome.",
              "More than 130 US officials, from the state department, CIA and national security council (NSC), have suffered from symptoms, including dizziness, loss of balance, nausea and headaches, first identified in Cuba.",
              "The impact on some of the victims has been debilitating and long-lasting.",
              "Some of the most recent incidents have involved NSC officials experiencing crippling symptoms in broad daylight in Washington.",
              "The state department, CIA and Pentagon have all launched investigations, but have yet to come to conclusions.",
              "A National Academy of Sciences report in December, found that the Havana Syndrome injuries were most likely caused by \u201cdirected pulsed radio frequency energy\u201d.",
              "Sceptics of the microwave weapon theory have pointed to decades of US efforts to build such a device during the cold war and since, without any confirmed success.",
              "They have also argued that a weapon capable of inflicting brain injury from a distance would be too unwieldy to use in urban areas.",
              "However, James Lin, the leading US authority on the biological impact of microwave energy, said a large apparatus would not be needed to focus energy on a small area, heating it a minute amount and causing \u201ca thermoelastic pressure wave\u201d that travels through the brain, causing damage to soft tissue.",
              "The pressure wave would initially be experienced by the target as sound.",
              "Many of the US diplomats, spies, soldiers and officials whose symptoms are being studied as part of the Havana Syndrome investigation reported hearing strange sounds at the onset of the attacks.",
              "\u201cYou can certainly put together a system in a couple of big suitcases that will allow you to put it in a van or an SUV,\u201d Lin, professor emeritus in the electrical and computer engineering department at the University of Illinois, said.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s not something that you need to have enormous amounts of space or equipment to do it.",
              "\u201d The microwave weapon project for the US Marine Corps, first reported in Wired, was first developed by a company called WaveBand Corporation.",
              "Codenamed Medusa \u2013 a contrived acronym for Mob Excess Deterrent Using Silent Audio \u2013 the weapon used the same technology as that suggested by Professor Lin, the \u201cmicrowave audio effect\u201d, which created rapid microwave pulses that slightly heated soft tissue in the brain, causing a shockwave inside the skull.",
              "WaveBand was given $100,000 for the prototype, which according to the specifications of the contract would \u201cbe portable, require low power, have a controllable radius of coverage, be able to switch from crowd to individual coverage, cause a temporarily incapacitating effect, have a low probability of fatality or permanent injury, cause no damage to property, and have a low probability of affecting friendly personnel\u201d.",
              "A navy document in 2004 (which has since been removed from the Navy Small Business Innovation Research site) said the hardware had been designed and built.",
              "\u201cPower measurements were taken and the required pulse parameters confirmed,\u201d it said.",
              "The document added: \u201cExperimental evidence of MAE [microwave auditory effect] was observed.",
              "\u201d WaveBand\u2019s former president and CEO, Lev Sadovnik, said he was limited in what he was allowed to say about the project, but said the immediate effects of MAE were disorientation and the impression of hearing sounds.",
              "Sadovnik said that a device capable of causing Havana Syndrome symptoms could be relatively portable.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s quite conceivable that you can hide it in a car, or in a van but it would not work over a long distance,\u201d he said.",
              "\u201cYou can do it through a wall, say, if you are in the next room in a hotel.",
              "\u201d Sadovnik said the Medusa prototype was not powerful enough to cause lasting harm, nor would that be allowed.",
              "But he said Russia was more advanced in understanding the human impact of microwave weapons \u2013 partly because it did not face the same ethical constraints.",
              "\u201cWe have here very strict limitations, of course, on human tests and animal testing,\u201d he said.",
              "\u201cThe Russians do not adhere to these standards.",
              "\u201d Giordano said that different political and ethical norms in Russia and China, create \u201cunique opportunities to advance bioscientific and technological development in ways that would be untenable in the United States and programs of our Nato allies\u201d.",
              "Although many US officials and victims believe that Russia is behind the attacks, there is so far no compelling evidence that Moscow is responsible.",
              "In some cases, Russian military intelligence (GRU) vehicles are reported to have been close to the scene of an apparent attack.",
              "But it would not be unusual for the GRU to tail US officials.",
              "The Russians certainly had a long history of using microwave technology against US diplomatic missions.",
              "The embassy in Moscow was found to be bathed in microwave radiation in the 1960s and early 1970s, though the intention behind it was never clear.",
              "That episode erupted into a scandal when it emerged the US government had withheld the fact from its own diplomats.",
              "At the same time, the US was spending huge amounts trying to develop its own directed energy weapons, both laser- and microwave-based.",
              "Mark Zaid, a lawyer representing some of the Havana Syndrome victims, has a CIA briefing slide appearing to date from the 1960s or 1970s which shows a building being hit by microwaves from a nextdoor structure.",
              "Zaid said the slide was among the personal effects left by a deceased agency officer.",
              "\u201cThe military loves death rays.",
              "Everybody loves death rays \u2013 and lasers had some of the characteristics of death rays so people kind of got excited about that,\u201d recalled Cheryl Rofer, who worked on laser and auditory weapon research in the 1970s at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.",
              "That auditory research eventually led to the Long Range Acoustic Device, or \u201csound cannon\u201d, used by some police forces against demonstrators last summer.",
              "But it did not lead to any \u201cdeath rays\u201d.",
              "\u201cThinking about something and actually building it are two different things,\u201d Rofer said.",
              "And the experience of seeing billions spent over the decades with little to show for it, has left her sceptical about new claims of microwave weapons development.",
              "\u201cThe military has a whole lot of money sloshing around, and they will try lots of different things, and some of them are good and some of them are not so good.",
              "\u201d Giordano said, however, that while development had stalled in the US, it had been continued by America\u2019s adversaries.",
              "The initial two dozen cases in Havana, he said, represented a field test of the equipment.",
              "He said that while the US focuses on expensive weapons for traditional warfare, Russia, China and others are \u201cvery interested in, and dedicated to, developing non-kinetic tools that can be leveraged below the threshold of what would formally be considered acts of war, so as to engage in processes of mass disruption\u201d."
