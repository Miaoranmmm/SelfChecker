    "query": "What is the most promising renewable energy source that is currently in development, and how does it compare to existing renewable energy technologies in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and scalability?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. There is no definitive answer to which renewable energy source is the most promising, as different sources have different advantages and disadvantages depending on various factors such as location, climate, availability, demand, etc. However, based on some of the recent data and trends, I can provide some general information and comparisons.\n\nAccording to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the most widely used renewable energy source in 2019 was hydropower, which accounted for 44% of global renewable electricity generation[^1^]. Hydropower is a mature and reliable technology that can provide large-scale and flexible electricity supply. However, it also has significant environmental and social impacts, such as disrupting ecosystems, displacing communities, and emitting greenhouse gases from reservoirs[^1^].\n\nSolar and wind power are the fastest-growing renewable energy sources, with their costs falling dramatically over the past decade. According to IRENA, the cost of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) projects fell by 82% between 2010 and 2020, while the cost of onshore and offshore wind projects fell by 39% and 29%, respectively[^9^]. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than fossil fuels in many regions of the world[^5^] [^6^] [^8^], and can provide clean and decentralized electricity for various applications. However, they also face challenges such as intermittency, grid integration, land use, and resource availability[^9^].\n\nOther renewable energy sources that are currently in development include bioenergy, geothermal, marine, hydrogen, and nuclear fusion. These sources have different potentials and limitations depending on their technical feasibility, environmental sustainability, economic viability, and social acceptability. For example, bioenergy can provide a versatile and dispatchable source of energy from organic waste or crops, but it can also compete with food production, emit pollutants, and affect biodiversity[^9^]. Geothermal energy can provide a stable and low-carbon source of heat and electricity from underground reservoirs, but it can also trigger earthquakes, release harmful gases, and require high upfront costs[^9^]. Marine energy can harness the power of waves, tides, currents, and temperature gradients in the oceans, but it is still at an early stage of development and faces technical challenges, environmental uncertainties, and regulatory barriers[^9^]. Hydrogen can be used as a clean fuel or energy carrier for various sectors such as transport, industry, and buildings, but it requires a large amount of renewable electricity to produce it from water electrolysis or other low-carbon methods[^2^]. Nuclear fusion can potentially offer a safe, abundant, and carbon-free source of energy from the fusion of light atoms such as hydrogen isotopes, but it is still far from being commercially viable and faces enormous scientific and engineering hurdles[^1^].\n\nAs you can see, there is no simple answer to which renewable energy source is the most promising. Each source has its own strengths and weaknesses that need to be carefully evaluated in terms of efficiency (how much energy output per unit of input), cost-effectiveness (how much money per unit of output), scalability (how much potential for expansion or replication), and other criteria such as environmental impact (how much greenhouse gas emissions or other pollutants per unit of output), social impact (how much benefit or harm to human health or well-being per unit of output), or security (how much reliability or resilience per unit of output). Ultimately, the best choice of renewable energy source may depend on the specific context and objectives of each project or policy.",

              "Including a 2019 baseline allowed for any changes over time to be characterized in absolute (US$) or relative (percentage increase or decrease) terms. As in 2015, we did not seek a baseline for floating offshore wind, given the limited number of commercial projects installed.",
              "For the 2019 baseline year, and for the focus year of 2035, we requested details on five core input components of LCOE: CapEx, OpEx, capacity factor, design life and WACC.",
              "For CapEx, we asked respondents to include only costs within the plant boundary.",
              "This means that the costs for electrical cabling within a plant are in scope, but that any needed substation, transmission line or grid interconnection costs are not.",
              "For offshore wind, it also means that CapEx is inclusive of within-plant array cabling, but that CapEx, and therefore LCOE estimates, do not include costs associated with offshore substations and the grid connection to land.",
              "The WACC represents the average return required by equity and debt investors.",

              "However, LCOEs can also be affected by factors that apply to the entire wind sector, such as overall wind technology advancement or a general move towards lower-quality or deeper-water wind sites.",
              "For 2025, 2035 and 2050, we asked respondents to provide estimates for a low-LCOE scenario (only a 10% chance that typical LCOE will be lower), a high-LCOE scenario (only 10% chance that typical LCOE will be higher) and a median-LCOE scenario (equally likely that LCOE will be higher or lower), considering only the broader, non-project-specific factors.",
              "Specifically, we asked respondents to focus on changes in the typical LCOE (that is, to ignore project-to-project variation) that might result from changes in factors that affect the industry as a whole.",
              "We further asked respondents to assume no changes in macroeconomic conditions, materials and commodity prices, and other factors not directly related to the wind energy business.",
              "Importantly, we asked the respondents to disregard the potential near-term impacts of COVID-19 in their responses.",

              "For each of the three wind applications, we also asked respondents to provide the geographic region for which their estimates applied.",
              "Additionally, we asked about several core project and site conditions that the respondent was thinking about when providing their typical LCOE estimate for 2019, and their median-cost scenario LCOE estimate for 2035.",
              "For onshore wind, we focused on average annual wind speed at a 100-m hub height, enabling a better understanding of how respondents expect typical site conditions to change over time.",
              "For fixed-bottom and floating offshore wind, we asked for further details, covering not only average annual wind speeds for typical projects in 2019 and 2035, but also typical water depth, distance to shore and project size.",
              "Each of these site characteristics can influence LCOE.",
              "As such, when paired with estimates of typical LCOE, they enable a deeper understanding of LCOE drivers.",
              "In addition to asking about LCOE, the five core LCOE inputs, and project and site conditions, we included several other questions in the survey.",
              "First, we sought information on expected turbine characteristics for onshore and offshore wind projects installed in 2035: nameplate capacity, hub height and rotor diameter.",
              "Second, we asked about the relative impact of various constraints that may limit further growth in turbine size, both onshore and offshore.",
              "Third, for onshore wind, we asked about the potential influence of different factors that might drive turbine choice for specific sites in 2035, whereas for offshore wind we explored possible trade-offs in the application of fixed-bottom and floating technology.",
              "Finally, for both onshore and offshore wind, we asked about the likely use in 2035 of various strategies to boost the value of wind to the electricity system.",
              "The responses to many of these supplemental questions are not addressed in the present paper, but are available separately61.",
              "Respondents could choose to answer questions related to onshore and offshore wind, or select just one of the two.",
              "We asked all respondents answering questions about offshore wind to provide a 2019 baseline for fixed-bottom offshore, but they could then elect to provide future LCOE estimates for fixed-bottom, floating or both.",
              "We offered respondents the choice of using US$ or Euros when taking the survey, and provided a currency calculator for those who were more familiar with other currencies.",
              "Additional details on all of these matters can be found in the survey (Supplementary Note 4).",
              "A limitation to an online survey format is that respondents may not fully comprehend precisely what is being asked of them, in part because they may choose to gloss over the textual instructions and explanations that precede the questions.",
              "There is little opportunity for the designer of the survey to interact with the respondents to clear up any such confusion.",
              "The result is that some questions may be left blank, and others answered but not as originally intended.",
              "This is true even with the most rigorously designed online elicitation.",
              "We were especially concerned about expert comprehension of a few of the key points noted earlier with respect to the LCOE questions.",
              "For example, we feared that respondents might think about project-level variations in costs, and establish the low- and high-cost scenarios in light of that project-level cost variation rather than differences in sector-wide advancements.",
              "We also feared that, despite our desires, respondents might consider macroeconomic factors in their estimates.",
              "Accordingly, in the survey we included relevant text and figures in multiple places to help the respondents understand the concepts of concern.",
              "We also feared that respondents might estimate low (10% chance of being lower) and high (10% chance of being higher) future CapEx, OpEx, capacity factor, design life and WACC, whereas we wanted the respondents to estimate low, high and median scenarios of future LCOE.",
              "Naturally, the LCOE that results from the 10th percentile of each of the five factors would have a probability of occurrence well lower than 10%.",
              "Here, too, we included relevant text in the survey.",
              "In addition to designing the survey to reduce these concerns, the survey contained optional open-ended questions asking respondents to elaborate on the characteristics of their low-, high- and median-LCOE scenarios.",
              "Many experts opted to leave these text fields blank.",
              "However, of the 140 respondents, 73 answered at least one of these open-ended descriptive questions.",
              "We were pleasantly surprised.",
              "After reviewing the responses, it is clear that many experts understood what we were looking for.",
              "There were exceptions, where the response suggested some consideration of project-level variation, for example.",
              "But these were limited in number.",
              "Unfortunately, during an early review of survey responses, we observed that a number of respondents\u2019 initial surveys were missing 2025 and 2050 LCOE estimates, probably due to browser compatibility issues with the original design of those questions.",
              "We reached out to these respondents to, in effect, reopen their surveys in case they wanted to offer estimates of those otherwise missing values.",
              "Also related to the 2025 and 2050 estimates, and perhaps again due to browser incompatibility, we observed a few cases where, for example, the low-case LCOEs were higher than the mid-case LCOEs.",
              "We also reached out to many of these experts, in case they wanted to revise their estimates.",
              "Even after these attempts, some missing values and inconsistencies remained.",
              "During data cleaning, we therefore removed estimates that featured these remaining inconsistencies.",
              "We conducted no other data cleaning;",
              "the data presented in this paper are otherwise as delivered to us through the survey instrument.",
              "Because of this limited data cleaning, the number of respondents to any individual question varies.",
              "Additionally, some questions were no doubt misinterpreted.",
              "Consequently, we place most emphasis on the median of the survey responses and, secondarily, on the interior 25th to 75th percentile ranges of responses.",
              "This is not to say that a full 50% of the respondents (those outside the interquartile range) misinterpreted the survey, and we present the full set of LCOE and 5-factor results in Supplementary Figs.",
              "3\u20138.",
              "But we believe that focusing on the median result from all respondents (rather than the mean, which is impacted more by outliers and the tails of the distribution) and the interquartile range of all responses are reasonable means of depicting the central tendencies and range of results from the elicitation, while at least partially addressing the possibility of question misinterpretation.",
              "The 2020 survey had many commonalities with the 2015 survey: consistent overall goals, numerous matching questions and similar functionality.",
              "This is to be expected because core goals of the 2020 effort were to update the earlier assessment and to compare the two sets of elicitation results.",
              "That said, a number of adjustments were made to the 2020 version of the survey, in part leveraging lessons learned from 2015 effort.",
              "Here we list the most notable revisions and briefly describe the underlying motivation for the changes.",
              "First, we paid particular attention to our survey sample, especially to try to enhance geographic diversity and carefully curate the leading-expert group.",
              "The result was greater geographic representation among the respondents than presumably otherwise would have been the case (though the respondents are still dominated by experts from North America and Europe) and heightened confidence in the selection and diversity of the leading-expert cohort.",
              "The former is especially important because wind power deployment has rapidly expanded outside of North America and Europe, especially in Asia;",
              "generally, past energy technology elicitations have focused on the United States and Europe, with wider regional coverage representing an important gap in the literature16.",
              "Second, with five intervening years, we updated the dates of our assessment\u2014to 2019, 2025, 2035 and 2050 instead of 2014, 2020, 2030 and 2050.",
              "We remained interested in assessing the starting point baseline (2014 for the 2015 survey, and 2019 for the 2020 survey);",
              "we also remained interested in long-term predictions, so we included the year 2050 in both surveys.",
              "The 2015 survey asked for estimates in 2020.",
              "In 2020, we would have gleaned little additional information asking for 2020 estimates when we were already asking for a 2019 baseline, so we shifted that assessment by five years, to 2025.",
              "With 2025 and 2050 estimates chosen, we felt that 2035 offered a useful intermediate point for the 2020 survey;",
              "selecting 2030 as we did under the 2015 survey would have placed relatively heavier weight on the near term than we preferred.",
              "Third, we required each respondent to provide a 2019 baseline LCOE estimate from which their future expectations are compared.",
              "In contrast, the 2015 survey offered respondents a predefined \u2018default\u2019 2014 baseline value and gave them the option (but not the obligation) to update that value.",

              "The majority of respondents in 2015 simply selected the default baseline value.",
              "While those respondents may truly have subscribed to the default value, many probably were seeking to reduce their time commitment on the survey.",
              "Our approach in 2020 closed that loophole, ensuring that respondents were more committed to their baseline, from which their future estimates are judged.",
              "By then comparing future cost estimates with respondent-specific baselines in percentage terms, we normalize for the very different baseline costs expected for different parts of the globe.",
              "Fourth, we asked each respondent for information on project and site conditions for their 2019 baseline and 2035 median-cost LCOE estimates.",
              "The responses to these questions enable a deeper understanding of LCOE expectations, specifically the degree to which they are likely to be impacted by systematic technology change or changes in project sites and characteristics.",
              "We had no analogous questions in the 2015 survey.",
              "When paired with estimates of typical LCOE, they enable a deeper understanding of LCOE drivers.",
              "Fifth, recognizing that many of our respondents probably do not have deep expertise in project finance, the 2020 survey included more information on WACC, offered a calculator that respondents could use to estimate WACC and provided additional guidance on this input parameter.",
              "Finally, we asked several questions that are related but not critical to the primary purposes of the survey;",
              "we did the same in 2015, but with a different set of supplemental questions.",

              "We can only speculate, but plausible reasons include cost pressures from increased use of competitive auctions, rapid growth in turbine size, speedier industrialization of non-turbine aspects especially offshore, and low interest rates and materials prices.",
              "\ufeffWith such dramatic advancements, it is tempting to believe that the opportunity for significant additional cost reduction might be tapped out.",
              "Recent survey findings suggest otherwise.",

              "There are greater absolute reductions in the levelized cost of energy for offshore wind compared with onshore wind, and a narrowing gap between fixed-bottom and floating offshore wind.",
              "Experts now anticipate future onshore and offshore costs that are half that which was predicted just five years ago, in 2015 (Figure 3).",

              "One need only look back to the wind cost forecasts and expectations published in or around 2015 to see that.",
              "One can also look to the recent survey results.",
              "For example, the 25th\u201375th percentile ranges in the best-guess median scenario (shown in Figure 3) suggest uncertainty in cost reductions.",

              "Under the low-cost scenario and across all applications, experts predict reductions of 38%\u201353% by 2035 and 54%\u201364% by 2050.",

              "It\u2019s a mixed bag.",
              "For onshore wind, the experts\u2019 perspectives for future levelized costs are pretty consistent with long-term historical learning.",
              "As shown in Figure 5, the experts are a bit more optimistic about future costs than several other forecasts, due to lower assumed starting-point baseline values, stronger percentage cost reductions, or both.",
              "Though not depicted in the figure, the experts also appear to be more optimistic than assumptions in most Integrated Assessment Models\u2014the models most typically used in climate change discussions.",

              "For offshore wind, survey results in terms of percentage cost reduction relative to a recent-year baseline are more conservative than many other recent forecasts.",
              "However, these differences are largely due to different baseline values: absolute LCOE estimates in 2030 and beyond are highly consistent across all of these sources, except the U.",

              "Most importantly, with a couple notable exceptions, uncertainty in future costs is not considered in the other forecasts.",
              "These forecasts largely offer point estimates.",

              "Sadly, the energy community does not have a strong history of successfully predicting the future\u2014few communities do.",
              "Humility noted, the research in Nature Energy does hold a couple important implications.",
              "First, there is significant uncertainty about future cost reductions.",
              "An expansive range of possibilities exist.",
              "This should give pause to those who use point forecasts for future costs, and demonstrates why modelers should account for cost uncertainties.",
              "More generally, the work illustrates the importance of fully considering uncertainty in energy policymaking, planning, investment, and research decisions.",
              "Second, notwithstanding the above caution, there is a risk of understating the cost reduction potential of wind, both onshore and offshore.",
              "It certainly happened in 2015.",
              "Wind energy cost reductions have accelerated over the last five years\u2014much more than earlier predicted.",
              "And experts anticipate significant future reductions, driven not only by reductions in installed costs but also lower operational expenses, higher capacity factors, longer design lives, and lower financing costs.",
              "As levelized costs decline, additional focus may turn to the value of wind in energy markets, and to the many barriers that hinder deployment \u2013 these and other important factors will be explored in more depth in forthcoming research led by NREL and Berkeley Lab, also leveraging the expert survey.",
              "Overall, these trends and expectations might enable wind to play a larger role in global energy supply than previously thought while facilitating energy-sector decarbonisation.",

              "Why did renewables become so cheap so fast? - Our World in Data",
              "For the world to transition to low-carbon electricity, energy from these sources needs to be cheaper than electricity from fossil fuels.",
              "Fossil fuels dominate the global power supply because until very recently electricity from fossil fuels was far cheaper than electricity from renewables.",
              "This has dramatically changed within the last decade.",
              "In most places in the world power from new renewables is now cheaper than power from new fossil fuels.",
              "The fundamental driver of this change is that renewable energy technologies follow learning curves, which means that with each doubling of the cumulative installed capacity their price declines by the same fraction.",
              "The price of electricity from fossil fuel sources however does not follow learning curves so that we should expect that the price difference between expensive fossil fuels and cheap renewables will become even larger in the future.",
              "This is an argument for large investments into scaling up renewable technologies now.",
              "Increasing installed capacity has the extremely important positive consequence that it drives down the price and thereby makes renewable energy sources more attractive, earlier.",
              "In the coming years most of the additional demand for new electricity will come from low- and middle-income countries;",
              "we have the opportunity now to ensure that much of the new power supply will be provided by low-carbon sources.",
              "Falling energy prices also mean that the real income of people rises.",
              "Investments to scale up energy production with cheap electric power from renewable sources are therefore not only an opportunity to reduce emissions, but also to achieve more economic growth \u2013 particularly for the poorest places in the world.",
              "The world\u2019s energy supply today is neither safe nor sustainable.",
              "What can we do to change this and make progress against this twin-problem of the status quo?",
              "To see the way forward we have to understand the present.",
              "Today fossil fuels \u2013 coal, oil, and gas \u2013 account for 79% of the world\u2019s energy production and as the chart below shows they have very large negative side effects.",
              "The bars to the left show the number of deaths and the bars on the right compare the greenhouse gas emissions.",
              "My colleague Hannah Ritchie explains the data in this chart in detail in her post \u2018What are the safest sources of energy?",
              "\u2019.",
              "This makes two things very clear.",
              "As the burning of fossil fuels accounts for 87% of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions, a world run on fossil fuels is not sustainable, they endanger the lives and livelihoods of future generations and the biosphere around us.",
              "And the very same energy sources lead to the deaths of many people right now \u2013 the air pollution from burning fossil fuels kills 3.",
              "6 million people in countries around the world every year;",
              "this is 6-times the annual death toll of all murders, war deaths, and terrorist attacks combined.",
              "1 It is important to keep in mind that electric energy is only one of several forms of energy that humanity relies on;",
              "the transition to low-carbon energy is therefore a bigger task than the transition to low-carbon electricity.",
              "2 What the chart makes clear is that the alternatives to fossil fuels \u2013 renewable energy sources and nuclear power \u2013 are orders of magnitude safer and cleaner than fossil fuels.",
              "Why then is the world relying on fossil fuels?",
              "Fossil fuels dominate the world\u2019s energy supply because in the past they were cheaper than all other sources of energy.",
              "If we want the world to be powered by safer and cleaner alternatives, we have to make sure that those alternatives are cheaper than fossil fuels.",
              "The world\u2019s electricity supply is dominated by fossil fuels.",
              "Coal is by far the biggest source, supplying 37% of electricity;",
              "gas is second and supplies 24%.",
              "Burning these fossil fuels for electricity and heat is the largest single source of global greenhouse gases, causing 30% of global emissions.",
              "3 The chart here shows how the electricity prices from the long-standing sources of power \u2013 fossil fuels and nuclear \u2013 have changed over the last decade.",
              "The data is published by Lazard.",
              "4 To make comparisons on a consistent basis, energy prices are expressed in \u2018levelized costs of energy\u2019 (LCOE).",
              "You can think of LCOE from the perspective of someone who is considering building a power plant.",
              "If you are in that situation then the LCOE is the answer to the following question: What would be the minimum price that my customers would need to pay so that the power plant would break even over its lifetime?",
              "LCOE captures the cost of building the power plant itself as well as the ongoing costs for fuel and operating the power plant over its lifetime.",
              "It however does not take into account costs and benefits at an energy system level: such as price reductions due to low-carbon generation and higher systemic costs when storage or backup power is needed due to the variable output of renewable sources \u2013 we will return to the aspect of storage costs later.",
              "5 This makes clear that it is a very crucial metric.",
              "If you as the power plant builder pick an energy source that has an LCOE that is higher than the price of the alternatives you will struggle to find someone who is willing to buy your expensive electricity.",
              "What you see in the chart is that within the last 10 years the price of electricity from nuclear became more expensive, gas power became less expensive, and the price of coal power \u2013 the world\u2019s largest source of electricity \u2013 stayed almost the same.",
              "Later we will see what is behind these price changes.",
              "If we want to transition to renewables, it is their price relative to fossil fuels that matters.",
              "6 This chart here is identical to the previous one, but now also includes the price of electricity from renewable sources.",
              "All of these prices \u2013 renewables as well as fossil fuels \u2013 are without subsidies.",
              "Look at the change in solar and wind energy in recent years.",
              "Just 10 years ago it wasn\u2019t even close: it was much cheaper to build a new power plant that burns fossil fuels than to build a new solar photovoltaic (PV) or wind plant.",
              "Wind was 22%, and solar 223% more expensive than coal.",
              "But in the last few years this has changed entirely.",
              "Electricity from utility-scale solar photovoltaics cost $359 per MWh in 2009.",
              "Within just one decade the price declined by 89% and the relative price flipped: the electricity price that you need to charge to break even with the new average coal plant is now much higher than what you can offer your customers when you build a wind or solar plant.",
              "It\u2019s hard to overstate what a rare achievement these rapid price changes represent.",
              "Imagine if some other good had fallen in price as rapidly as renewable electricity: Imagine you\u2019d found a great place to live back in 2009 and at the time you thought it\u2019d be worth paying $3590 in rent for it.",
              "If housing had then seen the price decline that we\u2019ve seen for solar it would have meant that by 2019 you\u2019d pay just $400 for the same place.",
              "7 I emphasized that it is the relative price that matters for the decision of which type of power plants are built.",
              "Did the price decline of renewables matter for the decisions of actual power plant builders in recent years?",
              "Yes it did.",
              "As you see in our Energy Explorer, wind and solar energy were scaled up rapidly in recent years;",
              "in 2019 renewables accounted for 72% of all new capacity additions worldwide.",
              "8 How can this be?",
              "Why do we see the cost of renewable energy decline so very fast?",
              "The costs of fossil fuels and nuclear power depend largely on two factors, the price of the fuel that they burn and the power plant\u2019s operating costs.",
              "9 Renewable energy plants are different: their operating costs are comparatively low and they don\u2019t have to pay for any fuel;",
              "their fuel doesn\u2019t have to be dug out of the ground, their fuel \u2013 the wind and sunlight \u2013 comes to them.",
              "What is determining the cost of renewable power is the cost of the power plant, the cost of the technology itself.",
              "To understand why solar power got so cheap we have to understand why solar technology got cheap.",
              "For this, let\u2019s go back in time for a moment.",
              "The first price point for usable solar technology that I can find is from the year 1956.",
              "At that time the cost of just one watt of solar photovoltaic capacity was $1,865 (adjusted for inflation and in 2019 prices).",
              "10 One watt isn\u2019t much.",
              "Today one single solar panel of the type homeowners put on their roofs produces around 320 watts of power.",
              "11 This means that at the price of 1956 one of today\u2019s solar modules would cost $596,800.",
              "12 At this price \u2013 more than half a million dollars for a single panel \u2013 solar was obviously hopelessly uncompetitive with fossil fuels.",
              "Then why didn\u2019t the history of solar technology end right there?",
              "There are two reasons why instead of dying, solar has developed to become the world\u2019s cheapest source of electricity today.",
              "Even at the very high price, solar technology did find a use.",
              "It is a technology that literally came from outer space.",
              "The very first practical use of solar power was to supply electricity for a satellite, the Vanguard I satellite in 1958.",
              "It was in this high-tech niche where someone was willing to pay for solar technology even at that extremely high price.",
              "The second important reason is that the price of solar modules declined when more of them were produced.",
              "More production gave us the chance to learn how to improve the production process: a classic case of learning-by-doing.",
              "The initial demand in the high-tech sector meant that some solar technology was produced and this initial production started a virtuous cycle of increasing demand and falling prices.",
              "The visualization shows this mechanism.",
              "To satisfy increasing demand more solar modules get deployed, which leads to falling prices;",
              "at those lower prices the technology becomes cost-effective in new applications, which in turn means that demand increases.",
              "In this positive feedback loop solar technology has powered itself forward ever since its early days in outer space.",
              "During the 1960s the main application of solar remained in satellites.",
              "But the virtuous cycle was set in motion and this meant that slowly, but steadily, the price of solar modules declined.",
              "With falling prices the technology came down from space to our planet.",
              "The first terrestrial applications in the 1970s were in remote locations where the connection to the wider electrical grid is costly \u2013 lighthouses, remote railroad crossings, or the refrigeration of vaccines.",
              "13 The data point for 1976 in the top left corner of the chart shows the state of solar technology at the time.",
              "Back then the price of a solar module, adjusted for inflation, was US-$106 per watt.",
              "And as you see on the bottom axis, global installed solar PV capacity was only 0.",
              "3 megawatts.",
              "Relative to 1956 this was already a price decline of 94%, but relative to the world\u2019s energy demand solar was still very expensive and therefore very small: a capacity of 0.",
              "3 megawatts is enough to provide electricity for about 20 people per year.",
              "14 The time-series in the chart shows how the price of solar modules changed from then until now.",
              "The so-called \u2018learning effect\u2019 in solar technology is incredibly strong: while the installed capacity increased exponentially, the price of solar modules declinedexponentially.",
              "The fact that both metrics changed exponentially can be nicely seen in this chart because both axes are logarithmic.",
              "On a logarithmic axis a measure that declines exponentially follows a straight line.",
              "This straight line that represents the relationship between experience \u2013 measured as the cumulative installed capacity of the technology \u2013 and the price of that technology is called the learning curve of that technology.",
              "The relative price decline associated with each doubling of experience is the learning rate of a technology.",
              "This is the virtuous cycle in action.",
              "More deployment means falling prices, which means more deployment.",
              "With solar technology it was for a long time the case that its increased deployment was made possible through government subsidies and mandates \u2013 arguably the most positive effect of these policies is that they too drove down the price of these new technologies along the learning curve.",
              "Paying for renewables at a high price point earlier allows everyone to pay less for them later.",
              "That more production leads to falling prices is not surprising \u2013 such \u2018economies of scale\u2019 are found in many corners of manufacturing.",
              "If you are already making one pizza, it isn\u2019t that much extra work to make a second one.",
              "What is truly mind blowing about solar technology is how very strong this effect is: For more than four decades each doubling of global cumulative capacity was associated with the same relative decline in prices.",
              "The advances that made this price reduction possible span the entire production process of solar modules:15 larger, more efficient factories are producing the modules;",
              "R&D efforts increase;",
              "technological advances increase the efficiency of the panels;",

              "the modules are more durable and live longer;",
              "market competition ensures that profits are low;",
              "and capital costs for the production decline.",
              "It is a myriad of small improvements across a large collective process that drives this continuous price decline.",
              "The learning rate of solar PV modules is 20.",
              "2%.",
              "16 With each doubling of the installed cumulative capacity the price of solar modules declines by 20.",
              "2%.",

              "Renewable energy sources are not the only case;",
              "the most well-known case is the computer and the corresponding historical development there is \u2018Moore\u2019s Law\u2019.",
              "If you are interested in getting your expectations about the future right, you are interested in how Moore\u2019s Law helps us to see the future of technological development, and you want to know about whether it is indeed the case that scaled-up production causes declining prices you can read the following information box that takes a deeper look at it.",
              "Solar modules are not the only technology where we see exponential progress.",
              "The case of exponential technological change that everyone knows of is Moore\u2019s law \u2013 the observation of Intel\u2019s co-founder Gordon Moore who noticed that the number of transistors on microprocessors doubled every two years.",
              "He first made this observation back in 1965 and until today this extraordinarily fast rate of technological progress still applies.",
              "Integrated circuits are the fundamental technology of computers and Moore\u2019s law is what has driven the exponential progress in computers in recent decades \u2013 computers became rapidly cheaper, more energy efficient, and faster.",
              "As you might have noticed Moore\u2019s law is not stated in the same way that I\u2019ve been looking at solar module prices.",
              "Moore\u2019s law describes technological change as a function of time;",
              "for solar, I am looking at price changes as a function of experience \u2013 measured as the total amount of solar modules that were ever installed.",
              "This relationship, that each doubling in experience leads to the same relative decline in prices, was discovered much earlier than Moore\u2019s law, by aerospace engineer Theodore Paul Wright in 1936.",
              "18 After him it is called Wright\u2019s Law.",
              "Moore\u2019s observation for the progress in computing technology can be seen as a special case of Wright\u2019s Law.",
              "19 Solar panels and computer chips are not the only technologies that follow his law.",
              "Have a look at our visualization of the price declines of 66 different technologies and the research referenced in the footnote20 How do we know that increasing experience is causing lower prices?",
              "After all it could be the other way around \u2013 production only increases after costs have fallen.",
              "In most settings this is difficult to disentangle empirically, but researchers Franc\u0327ois Lafond, Diana Greenwald, and Doyne Farmer found an instance where this question can be answered.",

              "\u2019, they study the price changes at a time when reverse causality can be ruled out, when demand was clearly not the consequence of lower prices: the demand for military technology in the Second World War.",
              "21 Their finding is that for technologies for which Wright\u2019s Law applies, it is mostly the cumulative experience that determines the price.",
              "As demand for weapons grew production experience increased sharply and prices declined.",
              "When the war was over and demand shrank, the price decline reverted back to a slower rate.",
              "This is suggesting that it is really the cumulative experience that is driving the price decline that we are interested in.",
              "If you want to know what the future looks like one of the most useful questions to ask is which technologies follow Wright\u2019s Law and which do not.",
              "Most technologies obviously do not follow Wright\u2019s Law \u2013 the prices of bicycles, fridges, or coal power plants do not decline exponentially as we produce more of them.",

              "The cost of coal that the power plant burns makes up about 40% of total costs.",
              "30This means that for all non-renewable power plants which have these fuel costs there is a hard lower bound to how much the cost of their electricity can possibly decrease.",
              "Even if the price for constructing the power plant would decline, the price of the fuel means that there is a floor below which the price of electricity cannot pass.",

              "But nuclear could still become more important in the future because it can complement renewables where these energy sources have their weaknesses: First, intermittency of electricity from renewables remains a challenge and a viable energy mix of the future post-carbon world will likely include all low-carbon sources, renewables as well as nuclear power.",
              "And second, the land use of renewables is large and a big environmental benefit of nuclear power is that it uses very little land.",

              "If the ledger accurately showed net CO2 emissions, then appropriate policies could provide the incentives needed to reduce those emissions.",
              "While such a system of complete accounting combined with effective accountability policies and incentives is possible, it does not exist today.",

              "In contrast to this positive local effect, the negative effects of bioenergy feedstock production at larger scales may be due to higher prices faced by consumers and competition of feedstocks with other food and feed crops.",

              "While the overall effects of bioenergy on food security outcomes were not significantly different on the basis of the edibility of the feedstocks examined, it is important to recognize the multiple implications of bioenergy production for achieving other environmental and societal goals of the SDGs that were not examined in this systematic review.",
              "The feedstocks that were classified as edible for human and livestock consumption on the basis of our edibility schematic are all classified as first-generation biofuels according to the IPCC classification scheme and none are classified as second-generation and third-generation biofuels44.",

              "Despite the absence of a difference between edible and inedible feedstocks in reducing conflicts between bioenergy production and food security, inedible first-generation biofuels (such as waste oils or Jatropha), as well as next-generation biofuels produced on marginal or degraded land, may have other positive environmental and societal benefits such as biodiversity conservation and continued provision of ecosystem services and mitigating climate change21.",
              "However, the conversion process to biofuel may be associated with higher costs and variable economic feasibility dependent on feedstock26.",

              "\u201d Ellsworth is among a group of scientists, including Kang-Kun Lee of Seoul National University, who published a perspective piece May 24 in Science outlining lessons from Pohang\u2019s failure.",
              "The Pohang earthquake stands out as by far the largest ever linked directly to development of what\u2019s known as an enhanced geothermal system, which typically involves forcing open new underground pathways for Earth\u2019s heat to reach the surface and generate power.",

              "Conventional geothermal resources have been generating power for decades in places where heat and water from deep underground can burble up through naturally permeable rock.",
              "In Pohang, as in other enhanced geothermal projects, injections cracked open impermeable rocks to create conduits for heat from the Earth that would otherwise remain inaccessible for making electricity.",
              "\u201cWe have understood for half a century that this process of pumping up the Earth with high pressure can cause earthquakes,\u201d said Ellsworth, who co-directs the Stanford Center for Induced and Triggered Seismicity and is a professor in the School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth).",
              "Here, Ellsworth explains what failed in Pohang and how their analysis could help lower risks for not only the next generation of geothermal plants, but also fracking projects that rely on similar technology.",
              "He also discusses why, despite these risks, he still believes enhanced geothermal can play a role in providing renewable energy.",
              "How does enhanced geothermal technology work?",
              "The goal of an enhanced geothermal system is to create a network of fractures in hot rock that is otherwise too impermeable for water to flow through.",
              "If you can create that network of fractures, then you can use two wells to create a heat exchanger.",
              "You pump cold water down one, the Earth warms it up, and you extract hot water at the other end.",
              "Operators drilling a geothermal well line it with a steel tube using the same process and technology used to construct an oil well.",
              "A section of bare rock is left open at the bottom of the well.",
              "They pump water into the well at high pressure, forcing open existing fractures or creating new ones.",
              "Sometimes these tiny fractures make tiny little earthquakes.",
              "The problem is when the earthquakes get too big.",
              "What led to the big earthquake in Pohang, South Korea?",
              "When they began injecting fluids at high pressure, one well produced a network of fractures as planned.",
              "But water injected in the other well began to activate a previously unknown fault that crossed right through the well.",
              "Pressure migrating into the fault zone reduced the forces that would normally make it difficult for the fault to move.",
              "Small earthquakes lingered for weeks after the operators turned the pumps off or backed off the pressure.",
              "And the earthquakes kept getting bigger as time went by.",
              "That should have been recognized as a sign that it wouldn\u2019t take a very big kick to trigger a strong earthquake.",
              "This was a particularly dangerous place.",
              "Pressure from the fluid injections ended up providing the kick.",
              "What are the current methods for monitoring and minimizing the threat of earthquakes related to fluid injection for geothermal or other types of energy projects?",
              "Civil authorities worldwide generally don\u2019t want drilling and injection to cause earthquakes big enough to disturb people.",
              "In practice, authorities and drillers tend to focus more on preventing small earthquakes that can be felt rather than on avoiding the much less likely event of an earthquake strong enough to do serious harm.",
              "With this in mind, many projects are managed by using a so-called traffic light system.",
              "As long as the earthquakes are small, then you have a green light and you go ahead.",
              "If earthquakes begin to get larger, then you adjust operations.",
              "And if they get too big then you stop, at least temporarily.",
              "That\u2019s the red light.",
              "Many geothermal, oil and gas projects have also been guided by a hypothesis that as long as you don\u2019t put more than a certain volume of fluid into a well, you won\u2019t get earthquakes beyond a certain size.",
              "There may be some truth to that in some places, but the experience in Pohang tells us it\u2019s not the whole story.",
              "What would a better approach look like?",
              "The potential for a runaway or triggered earthquake always has to be considered.",
              "And it\u2019s important to consider it through the lens of evolving risk rather than hazard.",
              "Hazard is a potential source of harm or danger.",
              "Risk is the possibility of loss caused by harm or danger.",
              "Think of it this way: An earthquake as large as Pohang poses the same hazard whether it strikes in a densely populated city or an uninhabited desert.",
              "But the risk is very much higher in the city.",
              "The probability of a serious event may be small, but it needs to be acknowledged and factored into decisions.",
              "Maybe you would decide that this is not such a good idea at all.",
              "For example, if there\u2019s a possibility of a magnitude 5.",
              "0 earthquake before the project starts, then you can estimate the damages and injuries that might be expected.",
              "If we can assign a probability to earthquakes of different magnitudes, then civil authorities can decide whether or not they want to accept the risk and under what terms. As the project proceeds, those conversations need to continue.",
              "If a fault ends up being activated and the chance of a damaging earthquake increases, civil authorities and project managers might say, \u201cwe\u2019re done.",
              "\u201d From everything you\u2019ve learned about what happened at Pohang, do you think enhanced geothermal development should slow down?",
