    "response": "That's a great question. There are many possible ways to reduce carbon emissions in the transportation sector, but they all require some combination of technological innovation, policy intervention, and behavioral change. Some of the strategies that have been proposed or implemented include:\n\n- Setting GHG emissions and fuel economy standards for cars and trucks[^1^].\n- Increasing the use of renewable fuels, such as biofuels and electricity, in place of fossil fuels[^1^] [^2^].\n- Improving the efficiency and design of vehicles, ships, and airplanes[^2^] [^3^].\n- Promoting low-carbon modes of transport, such as public transit, cycling, and walking[^2^].\n- Reducing the demand for travel and freight by encouraging teleworking, local sourcing, and compact urban planning[^2^].\n\nThese strategies can have different impacts on different types of transport, such as passenger or freight, road or rail, domestic or international. They also face different challenges and opportunities depending on the context and the stakeholders involved. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for decarbonizing the transport sector.\n\nSome of these strategies are already being implemented in some countries or regions, but they need to be scaled up and coordinated globally to achieve the necessary reductions in carbon emissions. According to some estimates, highly ambitious policies could cut transport emissions by 70% by 2050 compared to current levels[^2^]. However, this would require a radical transformation of the transport system and a strong commitment from governments, businesses, and consumers.",

              " In July, Member States of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the global regulatory body for shipping, adopted the Revised Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Strategy that sets a sectoral target of net-zero emissions by or around 2050.",
              "This is not only a crucial step for shipping, a sector that is excluded from the Paris Agreement, but for the international climate collaboration and the global economy.",
              "Shipping accounts for close to 3% of the global GHG emissions and plays a pivotal role in the global economy as the main transporter of energy, food, and materials.",
              "In 2018, the IMO adopted an Initial Greenhouse Gas Strategy, setting out to reduce emissions by half by 2050- a significant step at the time, but clearly unaligned with science-based trajectories and with the goals the same countries have signed up to under the Paris Agreement.",
              "Since its inception in conjunction with the adoption of the Initial Strategy, the Getting to Zero Coalition, an industry-led platform for collaboration within the maritime ecosystem, has therefore been urging policymakers at the IMO to adopt a zero by 2050 target, while members have in parallel been showing leadership through action in the form of concrete decarbonization projects.",
              "Furthermore, the Coalition, together with its knowledge partner UMAS and the UNFCCC High-Level Climate Champions highlighted the need for an uptake of at least five percent of zero-emission fuels by 2030, recognizing that this is required to put the sector on the right path to reach the long-term goal of zero by 2050.",
              "Importantly, the Revised Strategy does not only set a 2050 target, it also sets indicative emission reduction targets for 2030 (20% emissions reduction, striving for 30%) and 2040 (70% emissions reduction, striving for 80%), taking all greenhouse gas emissions from the full life cycle, i.",
              "e., from production to the combustion of fuels, into account.",
              "These targets combined set a clear pathway for the industry and provide a signal that immediate action is needed- 2030 is just around the corner.",
              "Besides targets for emissions reductions, the Strategy also now refers to ensuring a just and equitable transition.",
              "Furthermore, the IMO agreed on the development of a policy package in the coming two years to achieve these targets.",
              "The Revised Strategy is a key milestone not only for shipping but for global value chains at large.",
              "The targets provide industry- be it shipowners, cargo-owners, or energy suppliers- with clarity and help build confidence to invest in the transition.",
              "As the targets go beyond carbon emissions from the combustion by vessel only to encompassing all emissions from the entire fuel lifecycle, the Strategy indeed offers a strong demand signal for truly green fuels.",
              "By incentivizing investment in energy and fuel production, positive spill-over effects are to be expected also for the land-based energy transition, not least in the global south, where much of the untapped renewables potential can be found.",
              "The Strategy also refers to ensuring that the transition is just and equitable, which is key for the transition to be fully global with no country being left behind.",
              "The Revised Strategy is a major step forward, and an illustration of the key role that public-private partnerships across the whole value chain can play to shape decarbonization, even in hard to abate-sectors.",
              "The energy transition can only happen with the urgency and scale needed if national governments and international regulators establish policy frameworks that make zero emission shipping and fuel production commercially viable and globally available and accessible for all countries and companies alike.",
              "A combination of a fuel standard with an economic measure that will put a price on emissions will be explored in the next years.",
              "In addition to closing the competitiveness gap between traditional bunker fuels and the more costly clean fuels, a possible pricing mechanism could also generate revenue that can be reinvested into shipping as well as into wider decarbonization efforts, such as green electricity for marine fuels in all parts of the world.",
              "Revenues could also be employed to financially support developing countries, especially Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs).",
              "Delays in international action on climate change will have severe consequences for countries that are already affected by extreme weather events.",
              "These countries will be hit especially hard as investments in low-carbon shipping technologies will become more expensive the longer we wait.",
              "It is crucial for governments and industries to take immediate action on climate change to mitigate the damaging effects on vulnerable communities and economies.",
              "The longer we delay, the greater the economic and environmental impact will be, particularly for those who are most affected.",
              "Yet, the transition to a zero-emission future cannot be achieved based off the IMO\u2019s Revised Strategy alone.",
              "As highlighted in the Getting to Zero Coalition\u2019s Transition Strategy (2021), a full and Paris-aligned transition requires a myriad of actions, including at national, regional and industry levels.",
              "During the past years, industry has already started investing in the transition amid regulatory unclarity and a lacking ambition at the IMO.",
              "Getting to Zero Coalition members, for example, have been showing leadership through the development of concrete initiatives and collaborations.",
              "The fourth edition of the Mapping of Pilot and Demonstration Projects showed a surge in projects across the globe, various zero-emission shipping routes (I.",
              "e.",
              "Green Corridors) such as the Western Australia-East Asia Iron Ore Green Corridor have been launched and progress in energy supply and financial institutions has been critical.",
              "This has provided both governments and the wider industry with the confidence that a full and efficient transition is within reach.",
              "Public-private partnerships are crucial to bridge the gap between the set targets at the IMO and the action needed to achieve a Paris-aligned transition.",
              "Such action is necessary for leveraging the Strategy towards zero-emission investments at scale, for the sector to have a chance to meet the tight timeline.",
              "The recent developments at the IMO reflect the leadership shown by the industry in their efforts to decarbonize shipping.",
              "The sector is ready to move to a zero-emission future and has provided clear signals to fuel suppliers and cargo owners, as well as the global decarbonization effort.",
              "Public-private partnerships are now crucial to push the sector onto a Paris-aligned trajectory to unlock new opportunities and to support the transition for the international community as a whole.",
              "The Getting to Zero Coalition is an industry-led platform for collaboration that brings together leading stakeholders from across the maritime- and fuels value chains with the financial sector and others committed to making commercially viable zero-emission vessels a scalable reality by 2030, towards full decarbonization by 2050.",
              "It is managed by the Global Maritime Forum, who initially founded the Coalition together with the World Economic Forum and Friends of Ocean Action.",

              "The report also examines key uncertainties, such as the roles of bioenergy, carbon capture and behavioural changes in reaching net zero.",
              "The energy sector is the source of around three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions today and holds the key to averting the worst effects of climate change, perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has faced.",

              "Commitments made to date fall far short of what is required by that pathway.",
              "The number of countries that have pledged to achieve net zero emissions has grown rapidly over the last year and now covers around 70% of global emissions of CO2.",
              "This is a huge step forward.",
              "However, most pledges are not yet underpinned by near-term policies and measures.",
              "Moreover, even if successfully fulfilled, the pledges to date would still leave around 22 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions worldwide in 2050.",
              "The continuation of that trend would be consistent with a temperature rise in 2100 of around 2.",
              "1 \u00b0C.",
              "Global emissions fell in 2020 because of the Covid-19 crisis but are already rebounding strongly as economies recover.",
              "Further delay in acting to reverse that trend will put net zero by 2050 out of reach.",
              "In this Summary for Policy Makers, we outline the essential conditions for the global energy sector to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.",
              "The pathway described in depth in this report achieves this objective with no offsets from outside the energy sector, and with low reliance on negative emissions technologies.",
              "It is designed to maximise technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness and social acceptance while ensuring continued economic growth and secure energy supplies.",
              "We highlight the priority actions that are needed today to ensure the opportunity of net zero by 2050 \u2013 narrow but still achievable \u2013 is not lost.",
              "The report provides a global view, but countries do not start in the same place or finish at the same time: advanced economies have to reach net zero before emerging markets and developing economies, and assist others in getting there.",
              "We also recognise that the route mapped out here is a path, not necessarily the path, and so we examine some key uncertainties, notably concerning the roles played by bioenergy, carbon capture and behavioural changes.",
              "Getting to net zero will involve countless decisions by people across the world, but our primary aim is to inform the decisions made by policy makers, who have the greatest scope to move the world closer to its climate goals.",
              "The path to net zero emissions is narrow: staying on it requires immediate and massive deployment of all available clean and efficient energy technologies.",
              "In the net zero emissions pathway presented in this report, the world economy in 2030 is some 40% larger than today but uses 7% less energy.",
              "A major worldwide push to increase energy efficiency is an essential part of these efforts, resulting in the annual rate of energy intensity improvements averaging 4% to 2030 \u2013 about three-times the average rate achieved over the last two decades.",
              "Emissions reductions from the energy sector are not limited to CO2: in our pathway, methane emissions from fossil fuel supply fall by 75% over the next ten years as a result of a global, concerted effort to deploy all available abatement measures and technologies.",
              "Ever-cheaper renewable energy technologies give electricity the edge in the race to zero.",
              "Our pathway calls for scaling up solar and wind rapidly this decade, reaching annual additions of 630 gigawatts (GW) of solar photovoltaics (PV) and 390 GW of wind by 2030, four-times the record levels set in 2020.",
              "For solar PV, this is equivalent to installing the world\u2019s current largest solar park roughly every day.",
              "Hydropower and nuclear, the two largest sources of low-carbon electricity today, provide an essential foundation for transitions.",
              "As the electricity sector becomes cleaner, electrification emerges as a crucial economy-wide tool for reducing emissions.",
              "Electric vehicles (EVs) go from around 5% of global car sales to more than 60% by 2030.",
              "All the technologies needed to achieve the necessary deep cuts in global emissions by 2030 already exist, and the policies that can drive their deployment are already proven.",
              "As the world continues to grapple with the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is essential that the resulting wave of investment and spending to support economic recovery is aligned with the net zero pathway.",
              "Policies should be strengthened to speed the deployment of clean and efficient energy technologies.",

              "Fossil fuel subsidy phase-outs, carbon pricing and other market reforms can ensure appropriate price signals.",

              "Governments must lead the planning and incentivising of the massive infrastructure investment, including in smart transmission and distribution grids.",
              "Reaching net zero by 2050 requires further rapid deployment of available technologies as well as widespread use of technologies that are not on the market yet.",
              "Major innovation efforts must occur over this decade in order to bring these new technologies to market in time.",
              "Most of the global reductions in CO2 emissions through 2030 in our pathway come from technologies readily available today.",
              "But in 2050, almost half the reductions come from technologies that are currently at the demonstration or prototype phase.",
              "In heavy industry and long-distance transport, the share of emissions reductions from technologies that are still under development today is even higher.",
              "The biggest innovation opportunities concern advanced batteries, hydrogen electrolysers, and direct air capture and storage.",
              "Together, these three technology areas make vital contributions the reductions in CO2 emissions between 2030 and 2050 in our pathway.",
              "Innovation over the next ten years \u2013 not only through research and development (R&D) and demonstration but also through deployment \u2013 needs to be accompanied by the large-scale construction of the infrastructure the technologies will need.",
              "This includes new pipelines to transport captured CO2 emissions and systems to move hydrogen around and between ports and industrial zones.",
              "Clean energy innovation must accelerate rapidly, with governments putting R&D, demonstration and deployment at the core of energy and climate policy.",
              "Government R&D spending needs to be increased and reprioritised.",
              "Critical areas such as electrification, hydrogen, bioenergy and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) today receive only around one-third of the level of public R&D funding of the more established low-carbon electricity generation and energy efficiency technologies.",
              "Support is also needed to accelerate the roll-out of demonstration projects, to leverage private investment in R&D, and to boost overall deployment levels to help reduce costs.",
              "Around USD 90 billion of public money needs to be mobilised globally as soon as possible to complete a portfolio of demonstration projects before 2030.",
              "Currently, only roughly USD 25 billion is budgeted for that period.",
              "Developing and deploying these technologies would create major new industries, as well as commercial and employment opportunities.",
              "A transition of the scale and speed described by the net zero pathway cannot be achieved without sustained support and participation from citizens.",
              "The changes will affect multiple aspects of people\u2019s lives \u2013 from transport, heating and cooking to urban planning and jobs.",
              "We estimate that around 55% of the cumulative emissions reductions in the pathway are linked to consumer choices such as purchasing an EV, retrofitting a house with energy-efficient technologies or installing a heat pump.",
              "Behavioural changes, particularly in advanced economies \u2013 such as replacing car trips with walking, cycling or public transport, or foregoing a long-haul flight \u2013 also provide around 4% of the cumulative emissions reductions.",
              "Providing electricity to around 785 million people that have no access and clean cooking solutions to 2.",
              "6 billion people that lack those options is an integral part of our pathway.",
              "Emissions reductions have to go hand-in-hand with efforts to ensure energy access for all by 2030.",
              "This costs around USD 40 billion a year, equal to around 1% of average annual energy sector investment, while also bringing major co-benefits from reduced indoor air pollution.",
              "Some of the changes brought by the clean energy transformation may be challenging to implement, so decisions must be transparent, just and cost-effective.",
              "Governments need to ensure that clean energy transitions are people-centred and inclusive.",
              "Household energy expenditure as a share of disposable income \u2013 including purchases of efficient appliances and fuel bills \u2013 rises modestly in emerging market and developing economies in our net zero pathway as more people gain access to energy and demand for modern energy services increases rapidly.",
              "Ensuring the affordability of energy for households demands close attention: policy tools that can direct support to the poorest include tax credits, loans and targeted subsidies.",
              "Energy transitions have to take account of the social and economic impacts on individuals and communities, and treat people as active participants.",
              "The transition to net zero brings substantial new opportunities for employment, with 14 million jobs created by 2030 in our pathway thanks to new activities and investment in clean energy.",
              "Spending on more efficient appliances, electric and fuel cell vehicles, and building retrofits and energy-efficient construction would require a further 16 million workers.",
              "But these opportunities are often in different locations, skill sets and sectors than the jobs that will be lost as fossil fuels decline.",
              "In our pathway, around 5 million jobs are lost.",
              "Most of those jobs are located close to fossil fuel resources, and many are well paid, meaning structural changes can cause shocks for communities with impacts that persist over time.",
              "This requires careful policy attention to address the employment losses.",
              "It will be vital to minimise hardships associated with these disruptions, such as by retraining workers, locating new clean energy facilities in heavily affected areas wherever possible, and providing regional aid.",
              "In the net zero pathway, global energy demand in 2050 is around 8% smaller than today, but it serves an economy more than twice as big and a population with 2 billion more people.",
              "More efficient use of energy, resource efficiency and behavioural changes combine to offset increases in demand for energy services as the world economy grows and access to energy is extended to all.",
              "Instead of fossil fuels, the energy sector is based largely on renewable energy.",
              "Two-thirds of total energy supply in 2050 is from wind, solar, bioenergy, geothermal and hydro energy.",
              "Solar becomes the largest source, accounting for one-fifth of energy supplies.",
              "Solar PV capacity increases 20-fold between now and 2050, and wind power 11-fold.",
              "Net zero means a huge decline in the use of fossil fuels.",
              "They fall from almost four-fifths of total energy supply today to slightly over one-fifth by 2050.",
              "Fossil fuels that remain in 2050 are used in goods where the carbon is embodied in the product such as plastics, in facilities fitted with CCUS, and in sectors where low-emissions technology options are scarce.",
              "Electricity accounts for almost 50% of total energy consumption in 2050.",
              "It plays a key role across all sectors \u2013 from transport and buildings to industry \u2013 and is essential to produce low-emissions fuels such as hydrogen.",
              "To achieve this, total electricity generation increases over two-and-a-half-times between today and 2050.",
              "At the same time, no additional new final investment decisions should be taken for new unabated coal plants, the least efficient coal plants are phased out by 2030, and the remaining coal plants still in use by 2040 are retrofitted.",
              "By 2050, almost 90% of electricity generation comes from renewable sources, with wind and solar PV together accounting for nearly 70%.",
              "Most of the remainder comes from nuclear.",
              "Emissions from industry, transport and buildings take longer to reduce.",
              "Cutting industry emissions by 95% by 2050 involves major efforts to build new infrastructure.",
              "After rapid innovation progress through R&D, demonstration and initial deployment between now and 2030 to bring new clean technologies to market, the world then has to put them into action.",
              "Every month from 2030 onwards, ten heavy industrial plants are equipped with CCUS, three new hydrogen-based industrial plants are built, and 2 GW of electrolyser capacity are added at industrial sites.",
              "Policies that end sales of new internal combustion engine cars by 2035 and boost electrification underpin the massive reduction in transport emissions.",
              "In 2050, cars on the road worldwide run on electricity or fuel cells.",
              "Low-emissions fuels are essential where energy needs cannot easily or economically be met by electricity.",
              "For example, aviation relies largely on biofuels and synthetic fuels, and ammonia is vital for shipping.",
              "In buildings, bans on new fossil fuel boilers need to start being introduced globally in 2025, driving up sales of electric heat pumps.",
              "Most old buildings and all new ones comply with zero-carbon-ready building energy codes.",
              "1 Governments need to provide credible step-by-step plans to reach their net zero goals, building confidence among investors, industry, citizens and other countries.",
              "Governments must put in place long-term policy frameworks to allow all branches of government and stakeholders to plan for change and facilitate an orderly transition.",
              "Long-term national low-emissions strategies, called for by the Paris Agreement, can set out a vision for national transitions, as this report has done on a global level.",
              "These long-term objectives need to be linked to measurable short-term targets and policies.",
              "Our pathway details more than 400 sectoral and technology milestones to guide the global journey to net zero by 2050.",
              "Beyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development in our pathway, and no new coal mines or mine extensions are required.",
              "The unwavering policy focus on climate change in the net zero pathway results in a sharp decline in fossil fuel demand, meaning that the focus for oil and gas producers switches entirely to output \u2013 and emissions reductions \u2013 from the operation of existing assets.",
              "Unabated coal demand declines by 98% to just less than 1% of total energy use in 2050.",
              "Gas demand declines by 55% to 1 750 billion cubic metres and oil declines by 75% to 24 million barrels per day (mb/d), from around 90 mb/d in 2020.",
              "Clean electricity generation, network infrastructure and end-use sectors are key areas for increased investment.",
              "Enabling infrastructure and technologies are vital for transforming the energy system.",
              "Annual investment in transmission and distribution grids expands from USD 260 billion today to USD 820 billion in 2030.",

              " \u00a9 Shutterstock The maritime sector presently accounts for about 2.",
              "8% of all global greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions[1], mainly due to its rapid growth, its dependence on carbon-intensive bunkers, and the sheer size of its business (more than 80% of the world merchandise trade by volume is transported by sea).",
              "However, maritime transport is also one of the economic sectors with a greater potential to reduce its GHG emissions.",
              "Establishing a roadmap to the decarbonization of the maritime sector will require a consideration of three different fundamental aspects: technology, policy, and investment in research, development and innovation.",
              "Technological developments will be the key towards reducing the environmental impact of the maritime sector and achieving decarbonization goals by 2050.",
              "First of all, efforts must be made towards replacing the use of fossil fuels with others of renewable origin -and development of these new fuels must be carefully guided by criteria of sustainability, from a strategic viewpoint that takes into account their whole life cycle (as some \u201cgreen\u201d fuels may in the long term be even more polluting than fossil fuels if we consider the sources of energy used for their production).",
              "To this effect, fuels produced by electrolysis of water from renewable energies, such as e-hydrogen and e-ammonia, are currently considered to be the most sustainable options by many stakeholders.",
              "Secondly, as a consequence of the development of new fuels, changes will be needed in the propulsion systems of ships to enable them to run on said fuels;",
              "and great economic and technological efforts will have to be made to secure adequate access to their supply at a global scale by building new infrastructures (or adapting existing ones).",
              "Lastly, the maritime industry is working on the conceptual development and construction of ecological, zero-emission ships;",
              "and important technological efforts are also being made towards increasing the efficiency of ship engines and propellers, or the implementation of on-board energy sources, which can have a significant impact in reducing GHG emissions.",
              "Other methods of operational efficiency such as speed reduction, proper maintenance of the ship's hull and better planning of voyages are also key to reducing energy consumption.",
              "The initial GHG strategy[2] of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) set the target for the reduction of CO2 emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2050 (both figures as compared to the data of 2008)[3].",
              "To comply with these goals, IMO has devised a series of goal-based approach measures to reduce the carbon intensity of international shipping and encourage shipowners and operators to invest in technological, fuel-saving options.",
              "Some of these measures are still under development and aim at long term (research and development of fossil-free fuels, for instance) and medium term solutions (such as market-based measures, emissions cap-and-trade, bunkers levies, international maritime research fund).",
              "In the short term, however, measures that introduce the following important concepts will come into effect on 1 January 2023: Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI)[4]: formulated for existing vessels, this index calculates a vessel\u2019s CO2 emissions measured in grams of CO2 per tonne-mile (gCO2 /dwt-nm) based on the installed power of the main engine, fuel-oil consumption, and a CO2 conversion factor.",
              "From 1 January 2023, all vessels must have an EEXI technical file in place.",
              "EEXI verification shall take place at the vessel\u2019s first annual, intermediate or renewal survey (after 1 January 2023) for its International Energy Efficiency Certificate (IEEC).",
              "Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII)[5]: measures the energy efficiency of the vessels in grams of CO2 emitted per cargo capacity and nautical miles;",
              "and applies only for certain types of ships of 5,000GT and above engaged in international voyage of the following ships types: bulk carriers, gas carriers, tankers, container ships, general cargo ships, refrigerated cargo carriers, combination carriers, LNG carriers, vehicle carriers, Ro-Ro cargo vessels, Ro-Ro passenger vessels and cruise ships.",
              "The CII gives an annual rating to the ships ranging from A (most efficient) to E (least efficient).",
              "Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (Part III) (SEEMP)[6]: is mandatory for all vessels over 400GT and should be developed and regularly updated by shipowners.",
              "The SEEMP must include implementation of procedures to improve the energy efficiency of a ship in a cost-effective manner.",
              "Environmental regulations at the supranational or national level also play a vital role in the reduction of GHG emissions and in the transition to a new energy model, encouraging the maritime industry to invest in new technologies and infrastructures that will facilitate access to renewable energies.",
              "In the specific case of the European Union (EU), its initial nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement was to reduce GHG emissions by at least 40% by 2030 (compared to data of 1990)[7].",
              "In December 2020, an updated NDC was presented by the EU with a new goal for GHG reduction of at least 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels)[8].",
              "To achieve these climate targets, on 14 July 2021 the European Commission (EC) adopted a series of legislative proposals, commonly known as the \u201cFit for 55 package\u201d[9].",
              "The Fit for 55 package affects all industrial sectors, and for maritime transport it contains four particularly noteworthy proposals, which are still negotiated in the European institutions: Legislative proposals from the EU are considered complementary to the global regulatory framework;",
              "however, it is important to ensure that said legislative proposals are not in conflict with the international objectives reflected in the amendments to MARPOL Annex VI adopted by IMO to reduce the carbon intensity of maritime transport.",
              "The inclusion of maritime transport in the European CO2 emissions system could lead to a transfer of interoceanic transshipment scales to neighboring ports outside of the EU in order to pay lower taxes on their emissions in route, thereby reducing the competitiveness of maritime transport in the EU compared to other modes of transport and creating environmental havens outside the EU.",
              "Similarly, investing large sums of money on standardized targets for all EU ports as per the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation may lead to the creation of under-utilized infrastructures and therefore prove inefficient.",
              "In order to achieve the \u201c4th industry revolution\u201d in shipping and a better coupling of the maritime transport and energy sectors, investment in research, development and innovation must be scaled up significantly.",
              "Technological innovation is crucial to facilitate an energy transition in the shipping industry, which requires large investments on the part of manufacturers, suppliers, power and fuel producers, and other stakeholders.",
              "Subsidies and loans will also be essential to support the implementation of alternative fuel distribution infrastructures.",
              "Low-carbon targets and cleaner energy paths can be achieved by investing in, renewable energy alternatives, low-carbon technologies and energy efficiency measures.",
              "To summarize, maritime transport plays a critical role in the global trade and economy and its importance will tend to grow in the coming years;",
              "but this will result in an increase in its energy consumption which, under the current energy paradigm based on fossil fuels, would set back the GHG reduction goals established by IMO, the EU and others.",
              "International and European institutions must act collaboratively to ensure that efforts are made towards the reduction in emissions of GHGs, and to grant access to renewable energies for all parties concerned;",
