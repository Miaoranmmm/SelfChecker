    "query": "What is the historical and cultural significance behind the art form of calligraphy, and how has it evolved over time within different regions and languages?",
    "response": "Calligraphy is the art of beautiful handwriting. It has a long and rich history in many cultures and regions around the world. According to Britannica[^2^], the term may derive from the Greek words for \u201cbeauty\u201d (kallos) and \u201cto write\u201d (graphein). Calligraphy implies a sure knowledge of the correct form of letters and the skill to make them with such ordering and harmony that they are recognized as a work of art.\n\nOne of the most influential and ancient traditions of calligraphy is Chinese calligraphy, which dates back to the Shang dynasty (c. 1600\u20131046 BCE). Chinese calligraphy emerged as a prized visual art form sharing many of the same tools as painting, namely brush and ink[^4^]. The elevated status of calligraphy reflects the importance of the word in China. This was a culture devoted to the power of the word. From the beginning, emperors asserted their authority for posterity as well as for the present by engraving their own pronouncements on mountain sides and on stone steles erected at outdoor sites[^1^]. Calligraphy was well-respected, or even worshiped in history[^5^].\n\nChinese calligraphy has evolved over time into different styles and scripts, such as seal script, clerical script, regular script, running script and cursive script. Each style has its own characteristics and aesthetic appeal. Chinese calligraphy also influenced other Asian cultures, such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam, which adopted Chinese characters and developed their own styles of calligraphy.\n\nAnother major tradition of calligraphy is Islamic calligraphy, which developed in the 7th century CE with the spread of Islam and the Arabic language. Islamic calligraphy is closely associated with the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, which Muslims believe to be the word of God revealed to Prophet Muhammad. Islamic calligraphy is used to adorn mosques, monuments, manuscripts, coins, ceramics and other objects. Islamic calligraphy has various styles and scripts, such as Kufic, Naskh, Thuluth, Diwani and Nastaliq. Islamic calligraphy also influenced other regions where Islam spread, such as Persia, Turkey, India and Africa.\n\nWestern calligraphy has its roots in the Roman alphabet and the Latin language. It developed from the ancient Roman cursive script, which was used for everyday writing. Western calligraphy flourished in the Middle Ages with the rise of monasticism and manuscript production. Monks copied religious texts by hand using quill pens and ink on parchment or vellum. They also decorated the manuscripts with elaborate initials, borders and illustrations. Some of the most famous examples of medieval Western calligraphy are the Book of Kells, the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Carolingian minuscule.\n\nWestern calligraphy continued to evolve after the invention of printing in Europe in the mid-15th century. Printing reduced the demand for handwritten books but also stimulated new forms of artistic expression with letters. Calligraphers experimented with different styles and techniques of writing, such as Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical. Some of the most influential Western calligraphers include Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Ludovico degli Arrighi, Giovanni Battista Palatino, George Bickham and Edward Johnston.\n\nModern calligraphy is influenced by both traditional and contemporary sources. It incorporates elements from various cultures and languages, such as Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi and Cyrillic. It also uses different tools and materials, such as fountain pens, markers, brushes, digital devices and graffiti. Modern calligraphers express their creativity and individuality through their unique styles and designs.\n\nCalligraphy is a fascinating art form that reflects the history and culture of different regions and languages. It is also a living art form that continues to evolve and inspire people today.",

              "Chinese calligraphy, the stylized artistic writing of Chinese characters, the written form of Chinese that unites the languages (many mutually unintelligible) spoken in China.",
              "Because calligraphy is considered supreme among the visual arts in China, it sets the standard by which Chinese painting is judged.",
              "Indeed, the two arts are closely related.",
              "The early Chinese written words were simplified pictorial images, indicating meaning through suggestion or imagination.",
              "These simple images were flexible in composition, capable of developing with changing conditions by means of slight variations.",
              "The earliest known Chinese logographs are engraved on the shoulder bones of large animals and on tortoise shells.",
              "For this reason the script found on these objects is commonly called jiaguwen, or shell-and-bone script.",
              "It seems likely that each of the ideographs was carefully composed before it was engraved.",
              "Although the figures are not entirely uniform in size, they do not vary greatly in size.",
              "They must have evolved from rough and careless scratches in the still more distant past.",
              "Since the literal content of most jiaguwen is related to ancient religious, mythical prognostication or to rituals, jiaguwen is also known as oracle bone script.",
              "Archaeologists and paleographers have demonstrated that this early script was widely used in the Shang dynasty (c.",
              "1600\u20131046 bce).",
              "Nevertheless, the 1992 discovery of a similar inscription on a potsherd at Dinggongcun in Shandong province demonstrates that the use of a mature script can be dated to the late Neolithic Longshan culture (c.",
              "2600\u20132000 bce).",
              "It was said that Cangjie, the legendary inventor of Chinese writing, got his ideas from observing animals\u2019 footprints and birds\u2019 claw marks on the sand as well as other natural phenomena.",
              "He then started to work out simple images from what he conceived as representing different objects such as those that are given below: Surely, the first images that the inventor drew of these few objects could not have been quite so stylized but must have undergone some modifications to reach the above stage.",
              "Each image is composed of a minimum number of lines and yet is easily recognizable.",
              "Nouns no doubt came first.",
              "Later, new ideographs had to be invented to record actions, feelings, and differences in size, colour, taste, and so forth.",
              "Something was added to the already existing ideograph to give it a new meaning.",
              "The ideograph for \u2018deer,\u2019 for instance, is , not a realistic image but a much simplified structure of lines suggesting a deer by its horns, big eye, and small body, which distinguish it from other animals.",
              "When two such simple images are put side by side, the meaning is \u2018pretty,\u2019 \u2018prettiness,\u2019 \u2018beautiful,\u2019 \u2018beauty,\u2019 etc.",
              ", which is obvious if one has seen two such elegant creatures walking together.",
              "However, if a third image is added above the other two, as , it means \u2018rough,\u2019 \u2018coarse,\u2019 and even \u2018haughty.",
              "\u2019 This interesting point is the change in meaning through the arrangement of the images.",
              "If the three creatures were not standing in an orderly manner, they could become rough and aggressive to anyone approaching them.",
              "From the aesthetic point of view, three such images could not be arranged side by side within an imaginary square without cramping one another, and in the end none would look like a deer at all.",
              "Jiaguwen was followed by a form of writing found on bronze vessels associated with ancestor worship and thus known as jinwen (\u201cmetal script\u201d).",
              "Wine and raw or cooked food were placed in specially designed cast bronze vessels and offered to the ancestors in special ceremonies.",
              "The inscriptions, which might range from a few words to several hundred, were incised on the insides of the vessels.",
              "The words could not be roughly formed or even just simple images;",
              "they had to be well worked out to go with the decorative ornaments outside the bronzes, and in some instances they almost became the chief decorative design themselves.",
              "Although they preserved the general structure of the bone-and-shell script, they were considerably elaborated and beautified.",
              "Each bronze or set of them may bear a different type of inscription, not only in the wording but also in the manner of writing.",
              "Hundreds were created by different artists.",
              "The bronze script\u2014which is also called guwen (\u201cancient script\u201d), or dazhuan (\u201clarge seal\u201d) script\u2014represents the second stage of development in Chinese calligraphy.",
              "When China was united for the first time, in the 3rd century bce, the bronze script was unified and regularity enforced.",
              "Shihuangdi, the first emperor of Qin, gave the task of working out the new script to his prime minister, Li Si, and permitted only the new style to be used.",
              "The following words can be compared with similar words in bone-and-shell script: This third stage in the development of Chinese calligraphy was known as xiaozhuan (\u201csmall seal\u201d) style.",
              "Small-seal script is characterized by lines of even thickness and many curves and circles.",
              "Each word tends to fill up an imaginary square, and a passage written in small-seal style has the appearance of a series of equal squares neatly arranged in columns and rows, each of them balanced and well-spaced.",
              "This uniform script had been established chiefly to meet the growing demands for record keeping.",
              "Unfortunately, the small-seal style could not be written speedily and therefore was not entirely suitable, giving rise to the fourth stage, lishu, or official style.",
              "(The Chinese word li here means \u201ca petty official\u201d or \u201ca clerk\u201d;",
              "lishu is a style specially devised for the use of clerks.)",
              "Careful examination of lishu reveals no circles and very few curved lines.",
              "Squares and short straight lines, vertical and horizontal, predominate.",
              "Because of the speed needed for writing, the brush in the hand tends to move up and down, and an even thickness of line cannot be easily achieved.",
              "Lishu is thought to have been invented by Cheng Miao (240\u2013207 bce), who had offended Shihuangdi and was serving a 10-year sentence in prison.",
              "He spent his time in prison working out this new development, which opened up seemingly endless possibilities for later calligraphers.",
              "Freed by lishu from earlier constraints, they evolved new variations in the shape of strokes and in character structure.",
              "The words in lishu style tend to be square or rectangular with a greater width than height.",
              "While stroke thickness may vary, the shapes remain rigid;",
              "for instance, the vertical lines had to be shorter and the horizontal ones longer.",
              "As this curtailed the freedom of hand to express individual artistic taste, a fifth stage developed\u2014zhenshu (kaishu), or regular script.",
              "No individual is credited with inventing this style, which was probably created during the period of the Three Kingdoms and Xi Jin (220\u2013317).",
              "The Chinese write in regular script today;",
              "in fact, what is known as modern Chinese writing is almost 2,000 years old, and the written words of China have not changed since the first century of the Common Era.",
              "\u201cRegular script\u201d means \u201cthe proper script type of Chinese writing\u201d used by all Chinese for government documents, printed books, and public and private dealings in important matters ever since its establishment.",
              "Since the Tang period (618\u2013907 ce), each candidate taking the civil service examination was required to be able to write a good hand in regular style.",
              "This imperial decree deeply influenced all Chinese who wanted to become scholars and enter the civil service.",
              "Although the examination was abolished in 1905, most Chinese up to the present day try to acquire a hand in regular style.",
              "In zhenshu each stroke, each square or angle, and even each dot can be shaped according to the will and taste of the calligrapher.",
              "Indeed, a word written in regular style presents an almost infinite variety of problems of structure and composition, and, when executed, the beauty of its abstract design can draw the mind away from the literal meaning of the word itself.",
              "The greatest exponents of Chinese calligraphy were Wang Xizhi and his son Wang Xianzhi in the 4th century.",
              "Few of their original works have survived, but a number of their writings were engraved on stone tablets and woodblocks, and rubbings were made from them.",
              "Many great calligraphers imitated their styles, but none ever surpassed them for artistic transformation.",
              "Wang Xizhi not only provided the greatest example in the regular script, but he also relaxed the tension somewhat in the arrangement of the strokes in the regular style by giving easy movement to the brush to trail from one word to another.",
              "This is called xingshu, or running script.",
              "This, in turn, led to the creation of caoshu, or grass script, which takes its name from its resemblance to windblown grass\u2014disorderly yet orderly.",
              "The English term cursive writing does not describe grass script, for a standard cursive hand can be deciphered without much difficulty, but grass style greatly simplifies the regular style and can be deciphered only by seasoned calligraphers.",
              "It is less a style for general use than for that of the calligrapher who wishes to produce a work of abstract art.",
              "Technically speaking, there is no mystery in Chinese calligraphy.",
              "The tools for Chinese calligraphy are few\u2014an ink stick, an ink stone, a brush, and paper (some prefer silk).",
              "The calligrapher, using a combination of technical skill and imagination, must provide interesting shapes to the strokes and must compose beautiful structures from them without any retouching or shading and, most important of all, with well-balanced spaces between the strokes.",
              "This balance needs years of practice and training.",
              "The fundamental inspiration of Chinese calligraphy, as of all arts in China, is nature.",
              "In regular script each stroke, even each dot, suggests the form of a natural object.",
              "As every twig of a living tree is alive, so every tiny stroke of a piece of fine calligraphy has the energy of a living thing.",
              "Printing does not admit the slightest variation in the shapes and structures, but strict regularity is not tolerated by Chinese calligraphers, especially those who are masters of the caoshu.",
              "A finished piece of fine calligraphy is not a symmetrical arrangement of conventional shapes but, rather, something like the coordinated movements of a skillfully composed dance\u2014impulse, momentum, momentary poise, and the interplay of active forces combining to form a balanced whole."

              "All educated men and some court women were expected to be proficient at it, an expectation which remained well into modern times.",
              "Far more than mere writing, good calligraphy exhibited an exquisite brush control and attention to composition, but the actual manner of writing was also important with rapid, spontaneous strokes being the ideal.",
              "The brushwork of calligraphy, its philosophy, and materials would influence Chinese painting styles, especially landscape painting, and many of the ancient scripts are still imitated today in modern Chinese writing.",
              "The highly flexible brushes used in calligraphy were made from animal hair (or more rarely a feather) cut to a tapering end and tied to a bamboo or wood handle.",
              "The ink used was made by the writer himself by rubbing a dried cake of animal or vegetable matter mixed with minerals and glue against a wet stone.",

              "300 BCE), and then paper (from c.",
              "100 CE) were the most common writing surfaces, but calligraphy could also appear on such everyday objects as fans, screens, and banners.",
              "The best material was paper, though, and the invention of finer quality paper - credited to Cai Lun in 105 CE - helped the development of more artistic styles of calligraphy because its absorbency captured every nuance of the brushstroke.",
              "A connoisseurship quickly developed, and calligraphy became one of the six classic and ancient arts alongside ritual, music, archery, charioteering, and numbers.",
              "Accomplished Chinese calligraphers were expected to use varying thicknesses of brushstroke, their subtle angles, and their fluid connection to each other - all precisely arranged in imaginary spaces on the page - to create an aesthetically pleasing whole.",

              "Consequently Chinese calligraphers sought inspiration by watching natural phenomena.",
              "The most famous of all, Wang Xizhi, was fond of watching geese because the graceful and easy movement of their necks reminded him of wielding the brush, and the monk Huai-su was said to have appreciated the infinite variety possible in the cursive style of calligraphy known as grass-script by observing summer clouds wafted by the wind.",
              "(201-202) There were five main scripts in ancient Chinese calligraphy: Seal script, as its name suggests, was a formal style used for seals and other official documents because it has strokes of an even thickness and fewer direction changes, which made it easier for carvers to reproduce.",
              "Clerical script with its heavy stroke endings was also formal and reserved for record keeping by clerks and officials.",
              "Later, it became the common script for inscriptions.",
              "Both Seal and Clerical script were revived as artistic scripts in the 17th and 18th centuries CE.",

              "The more flamboyant Cursive script was the most popular choice for artistic expression and used too in the notes added to paintings.",
              "Finally, Drafting script, sometimes also called Grass script, was so called because it was the quickest to produce and 'wildest' in that the artist stretched convention to its limits so that some characters become difficult to recognise immediately.",

              "Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322 CE) was another celebrated calligrapher who produced such precise characters placed neatly into square boxes on his paper that printers used his script for their own type blocks.",
              "Examples of the scripts and styles created by these masters were often copied onto wood or stone to preserve them and from which ink rubbings (bei) were made.",
              "Thus, the paper copies could be distributed and the scripts could be imitated by lesser calligraphers everywhere.",
              "Such copies were also useful to emperors who wished to promote one style over another during their reign, and they have become an invaluable record of the evolution of Chinese calligraphy which continues to be consulted and imitated today.",
              "Examples of famous calligraphy survive in the form of letters, introductions to books, pieces of prose, religious texts, notes made on paintings, and engraved stele, tombstones and tablets, where the stonemason faithfully copied the work of a noted calligrapher.",
              "Examples of fine calligraphy by famous writers were even collected in ancient times, especially in the libraries of emperors or even buried with them in their tombs.",
              "So valued were these pieces that forgeries were made and sold as genuine to collectors.",
              "As another indicator of the value put on examples of calligraphy by great past masters, the actual meaning of the text is often irrelevant to prices and collectibility.",

              "Another influence of calligraphy skills on painting was the importance given to composition and the use of blank space.",
              "Finally, calligraphy remained so important that it even appeared on paintings to describe and explain what the viewer was seeing, indicate the title (although by no means all paintings were given a title by the original artist) or record the place it was created and the person it was intended for.",
              "Eventually, such notes and even poems became an integral part of the overall composition and an inseparable part of the painting itself.",

              "From the 7th century CE, owners frequently added their own seal in red ink, for example, and if a piece changed hands, then the new owner would add their seal so that the history of the work's ownership can sometimes be traced back hundreds of years.",

              "Chinese calligraphy is an art form in which writers and artists use specific brushes, ink, and water to write Chinese characters.",
              "This practice unites the fields of writing and art and has been around for over 3000 years.",
              "The art of Chinese calligraphy involves a writing instrument or a brush.",
              "The hairs on the brush were originally made from animal hair, but today most people use synthetic brushes as they are more affordable and long-lasting.",
              "Chinese calligraphy works by applying ink onto one of three types of surfaces: The ink was historically made from soot and animal glue and was then applied to the writing surface with a brush.",
              "These days, many modern water-based inks are easier and safer to use.",
              "Chinese calligraphy originated in China over 3000 years ago during the Xia Dynasty (2070-1600 BCE).",
              "The characters used to be etched into animal bones, a practice known as \u7532\u9aa8\u6587 or \u2018jia\u030cgu\u030cwe\u0301n\u2019.",
              "The main reason for Calligraphy\u2019s invention was that it allowed people to write much faster and allowed for a larger segment of the population to be able to read.",
              "There were many different Chinese dialects, and calligraphy created an easily understandable symbol set.",
              "While most languages use different letters or symbols to form words, the characters in Chinese calligraphy are pictures based on real-life objects.",
              "It is thought to have started as an imitation of the shapes of natural objects, such as trees and waves.",
              "This helped various Chinese communities to have a common script that was based on more universal images.",
              "Over time, Chinese calligraphy has evolved into a more abstract style with specific rules for shaping strokes and arranging patterns on paper.",
              "Since calligraphy is an art form that has dramatically evolved, there are many different forms and interpretations of this ancient practice.",
              "However, some styles are more popular or commonly used than others.",
              "Here are the main five types of Chinese calligraphy scripts: The most common script used today is the semi-cursive script.",
              "It has been used in China for over a thousand years and was developed to be written quickly while still looking aesthetically pleasing.",
              "There are several other styles of calligraphy that are less frequently adopted, such as seal, grass, or bird style, clerical style with archaic features, cursive official, and the modern cursive script.",
              "Calligraphy was first written using a sharp, hard object like an animal bone or bamboo chopstick to scratch characters onto the surface.",
              "These days, black ink and various types of brushes are used to create Chinese calligraphy.",

              "The ink used in calligraphy can vary depending on what you write, but it must always be water-based and not too thick or thin.",
              "Paintbrushes use thicker paint which will clog up the tip while thinner paints can give more detailed work as they flow more easily.",
              "Paper or Silk Paper is the most common material used for calligraphy, but silk can also be used if you are practicing ancient-style characters.",
              "It is important to use paper that does not have a rough texture, as this will affect how smoothly your brushstroke goes across it.",
              "Look for a paper that has a smooth surface and is not too thin or thick.",
              "You\u2019ll also want to make sure that it has the right amount of absorbency because if it is too absorbent, the ink will bleed through.",

              "Most people go with characters that are relatively simple or characters they find really beautiful.",
              "However, a good suggestion for newbies is to practice the character for \u2018eternal\u2019 or \u2018forever\u2019 which is \u6c38 (yo\u030cng).",
              "The reason \u6c38 (yo\u030cng) is such a good character to practice is that it includes all 8 of the basic strokes in Chinese characters.",
              "The second step is picking out which Chinese calligraphy style suits you best: running or clerical?",
              "You may even want to try both styles before making up your mind, as this will help give you more of an appreciation for each one.",
              "After choosing and practicing on paper for a while, you can then try writing on silk.",
              "You should be sat up straight with your shoulders relaxed and your feet on the floor.",
              "Remember that the thickness of the stroke in Chinese calligraphy is very important, so if your posture is poor and your centre of gravity is all \u2018skewiff\u2019, it\u2019s definitely going to affect your work.",

              "Lishu is thought to have been invented by Cheng Miao (240\u2013207 bce), who had offended Shihuangdi and was serving a 10-year sentence in prison.",
              "He spent his time in prison working out this new development, which opened up seemingly endless possibilities for later calligraphers.",

              "In zhenshu each stroke, each square or angle, and even each dot can be shaped according to the will and taste of the calligrapher.",
              "Indeed, a word written in regular style presents an almost infinite variety of problems of structure and composition, and, when executed, the beauty of its abstract design can draw the mind away from the literal meaning of the word itself.",
              "The greatest exponents of Chinese calligraphy were Wang Xizhi and his son Wang Xianzhi in the 4th century.",

              "Wang Xizhi not only provided the greatest example in the regular script, but he also relaxed the tension somewhat in the arrangement of the strokes in the regular style by giving easy movement to the brush to trail from one word to another.",
              "This is called xingshu, or running script.",
              "This, in turn, led to the creation of caoshu, or grass script, which takes its name from its resemblance to windblown grass\u2014disorderly yet orderly.",
              "The English term cursive writing does not describe grass script, for a standard cursive hand can be deciphered without much difficulty, but grass style greatly simplifies the regular style and can be deciphered only by seasoned calligraphers.",
              "It is less a style for general use than for that of the calligrapher who wishes to produce a work of abstract art.",
              "Technically speaking, there is no mystery in Chinese calligraphy.",
              "The tools for Chinese calligraphy are few\u2014an ink stick, an ink stone, a brush, and paper (some prefer silk).",
              "The calligrapher, using a combination of technical skill and imagination, must provide interesting shapes to the strokes and must compose beautiful structures from them without any retouching or shading and, most important of all, with well-balanced spaces between the strokes.",
              "This balance needs years of practice and training.",
              "The fundamental inspiration of Chinese calligraphy, as of all arts in China, is nature.",
              "In regular script each stroke, even each dot, suggests the form of a natural object.",
              "As every twig of a living tree is alive, so every tiny stroke of a piece of fine calligraphy has the energy of a living thing.",
              "Printing does not admit the slightest variation in the shapes and structures, but strict regularity is not tolerated by Chinese calligraphers, especially those who are masters of the caoshu.",
              "A finished piece of fine calligraphy is not a symmetrical arrangement of conventional shapes but, rather, something like the coordinated movements of a skillfully composed dance\u2014impulse, momentum, momentary poise, and the interplay of active forces combining to form a balanced whole."

              "In Chinese calligraphy, Chinese characters can be written according to five major styles.",
              "These styles are intrinsically linked to the history of Chinese script.",
              "When used in decorative ornamentation, such as book covers, movie posters, and wall hangings, characters are often written in ancient variations or simplifications that deviate from the modern standards used in Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese or Korean.",
              "Modern variations or simplifications of characters, akin to Chinese Simplified characters or Japanese shinjitai, are occasionally used, especially since some simplified forms derive from cursive script shapes in the first place.",
              "The Japanese syllabaries of katakana and hiragana are used in calligraphy;",
              "the katakana were derived from the shapes of regular script characters and hiragana from those of cursive script.",
              "In Korea, the post-Korean War period saw the increased use of hangul, the Korean alphabet, in calligraphy.",
              "In Vietnam, recent calligraphy tends to use chu\u031b\u0303 Quo\u0302\u0301c ngu\u031b\u0303 in parallel with chu\u031b\u0303 Ha\u0301n and chu\u031b\u0303 No\u0302m.",
              "The seal script (often called \"small seal\" script) is the formal script of the Qi\u0301n system of writing, which evolved during the Eastern Zho\u0304u dynasty in the state of Qi\u0301n and was imposed as the standard in areas Qi\u0301n gradually conquered.",
              "Although some modern calligraphers practice the most ancient oracle bone script as well as various other scripts older than seal script found on Zho\u0304u dynasty bronze inscriptions, seal script is the oldest style that continues to be widely practiced.",
              "Today, this style of Chinese writing is used predominantly in seals, hence the English name.",
              "Although seals (name chops), which make a signature-like impression, are carved in wood, jade and other materials, the script itself was originally written with brush and ink on bamboo books and other media, just like all other ancient scripts.",
              "Most people today cannot read the seal script, so it is considered an \u2018ancient\u2019 script, generally not used outside the fields of calligraphy and carved seals.",
              "However, because seals act like legal signatures in the cultures of China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, and because vermillion seal impressions are a fundamental part of the presentation of works of art such as calligraphy and painting, seals and therefore seal script remain ubiquitous.",
              "The clerical script (often simply termed li\u0300shu\u0304;",
              "and sometimes called \"official\", \"draft\", or \"scribal\" script) is popularly thought to have developed in the Ha\u0300n dynasty and to have come directly from seal script, but recent archaeological discoveries and scholarship indicate that it instead developed from a roughly executed and rectilinear popular or \u2018vulgar\u2019 variant of the seal script as well as from seal script itself, resulting first in a \u2018proto-clerical\u2019 version in the Warring States period to Qin dynasty,[1] which then developed into clerical script in the early Western Ha\u0300n dynasty, and matured stylistically thereafter.",
              "Clerical script characters are often \"flat\" in appearance, being wider than the preceding seal script and the modern standard script, both of which tend to be taller than they are wide;",
              "some versions of clerical are square, and others are wider.",
              "Compared with the preceding seal script, forms are strikingly rectilinear;",
              "however, some curvature and some seal script influence often remains.",
              "Seal script tended towards uniformity of stroke width, but clerical script gave the brush freer rein, returning to the variations in width seen in early Zho\u0304u brushwork.",
              "Most noticeable is the dramatically flared tail of one dominant horizontal or downward-diagonal stroke, especially that to the lower right.",
              "This characteristic stroke has famously been called 'silkworm head and wild goose tail' (\u8836\u982d\u96c1\u5c3e ca\u0301nto\u0301u ya\u0300nwe\u030ci in Chinese) due to its distinctive shape.",
              "The archaic clerical script or \u2018proto-clerical\u2019 of the Chinese Warring States period to Qi\u0301n dynasty and early Ha\u0300n dynasty can often be difficult to read for a modern East Asian person, but the mature clerical script of the middle to late Ha\u0300n dynasty is generally legible.",
              "Modern calligraphic works and practical applications (e.",
              "g., advertisements) in the clerical script tend to use the mature, late Ha\u0300n style, and may also use modernized character structures, resulting in a form as transparent and legible as regular (or standard) script.",
              "The clerical script remains common as a typeface used for decorative purposes (for example, in displays), but other than in artistic calligraphy, adverts and signage, it is not commonly written.",
              "The semi-cursive script (also called \"running\" script, \u884c\u66f8) approximates normal handwriting in which strokes and, more rarely, characters are allowed to run into one another.",
              "In writing in the semi-cursive script, the brush leaves the paper less often than in the regular script.",
              "Characters appear less angular and instead rounder.",
              "In general, an educated person in China or Japan can read characters written in the semi-cursive script with relative ease, but may have occasional difficulties with certain idiosyncratic shapes.",
              "The cursive script (sometimes called \"sloppy script\", \u8349\u66f8) is a fully cursive script, with drastic simplifications requiring specialized knowledge;",
              "hence it is difficult to read for those unfamiliar with it.",
              "Entire characters may be written without lifting the brush from the paper at all, and characters frequently flow into one another.",
              "Strokes are modified or eliminated completely to facilitate smooth writing and to create a beautiful, abstract appearance.",
              "Characters are highly rounded and soft in appearance, with a noticeable lack of angular lines.",
              "Due to the drastic simplification and ligature involved, this script is not considered particularly legible to the average person, and thus has never achieved widespread use beyond the realm of literati calligraphers.",
              "The cursive script is the source of Japanese hiragana, as well as many modern simplified forms in Simplified Chinese characters and Japanese shinjitai.",
              "The regular script (often called \"standard\" script or simply \u6977\u4e66 ka\u030cishu\u0304) is one of the last major calligraphic styles to develop, emerging between the Chinese Ha\u0300n dynasty and Three Kingdoms period, gaining dominance in the Southern and Northern dynasties, and maturing in the Tang dynasty.",
              "It emerged from a neatly written, early period semi-cursive form of clerical script.",
              "As the name suggests, the regular script is \"regular\", with each of the strokes placed slowly and carefully, the brush lifted from the paper and all the strokes distinct from each other.",
              "The regular script is also the most easily and widely recognized style, as it is the script to which children in East Asian countries and beginners of East Asian languages are first introduced.",
              "For learners of calligraphy, the regular script is usually studied first to give students a feel for correct placement and balance, as well as to provide a proper base for the other, more flowing styles.",
              "In the regular script samples to the right, the characters in the left column are in Traditional Chinese while those to the right are in Simplified Chinese.",
              "There is also a large family of native Japanese calligraphic styles known as edomoji, characters created in the Edo period of Japanese history, such as sumo\u0304moji (sumo letters) used to write sumo\u0304 wrestling posters, kanteiryu\u0304, used for kabuki, higemoji, and so on.",
              "These styles are typically not taught in Japanese calligraphy schools.",
              "Chinese and Korean people can read edomoji, but the style has a distinct Japanese feel to it.",
              "[citation needed] It is therefore commonly used in China and Korea to advertise Japanese restaurants.",
              "A Vietnamese calligraphic script known as Le\u0323\u0302nh thu\u031b (\u4ee4\u66f8) as its name suggest, it is mainly found in imperial edicts starting from the Revival Le\u0302 dynasty.",
              "The writing script is defined by its distinct sharp upward hooks.",
              "Munjado is a Korean decorative style of rendering Chinese characters in which brush strokes are replaced with representational paintings that provide commentary on the meaning.",
              "[2] The characters thus rendered are traditionally those for the eight Confucian virtues of humility, honor, duty, propriety, trust, loyalty, brotherly love, and filial piety.",
              "The huaya is a stylized calligraphic signature traditionally used by emperors, politicians, artists and craftsman across East Asia."

              "In religious buildings, verses from the Qur\u02bea\u0304n were inscribed on the walls for the edification of the faithful, whether carved in stone or stucco or executed in faience tiles.",

              "Both sides of the leaves were used for writing.",
              "Long rectangular strips were gathered on top of one another, holes were drilled through all the leaves, and the book was held together by string.",

              "Before this time, most Qur\u2019anic calligraphy was found on papyrus, parchment (goat skin), stones, or leaves.",
              "The regard with which the art of calligraphy was held also led to scientific developments.",
              "The eleventh century Tunisian scientist, Ibn Badis, wrote in his book, \u2018Umdat al-Kuttab (Staff of the Scribes), about many topics, including on how to prepare different types of inks, how to produce different colours of ink, how to produce mixtures, and on the art and science of secret writing and on how to make paper.",

              "Qalams can be made from a variety of materials\u2014while thicker pens often are made from bamboo, thinner ones can be fashioned out of rose stems. These can range from 24-30 cm in length, with the width determined by what kind of script the pen will be used for.",
              "After this, they are \u201cseasoned\u201d for up to four years.",
              "They are then cut by placing the pen on a flat surface called a makta, which is often made of ivory or wood.",

              "2 This tongue is then split so that the opening can hold the ink needed.",
              "Finally, the tip of the tongue is cut at an oblique angle.",
              "For very fine scripts, the nib is cut to an angular chisel-edge and slit mid-way to facilitate the flow of ink in right-to-left strokes.",
              "3 The smallest end of reed or bamboo in diameter is cut.",
              "Reeds and bamboo grow in such a way that the base is always wider, the top narrower.",
              "This narrower part also tends to be harder, which makes it better suited for calligraphy.",
              "For that reason the narrower end is cut.",
              "4 The width of the pen and the angular cut specifies which script will be written with the pen.",
              "For example, Naskh and Thuluth have a more acute angle then Ta\u2019liq, around 30 degrees, while Ta\u2019liq is nearly flat, with only a slight incline of about 10 degrees.",

              "7 The consistency of the ink can be improved by adding egg white and honey drops to the gum Arabic.",
              "In any case, the ink is made by mixing the gum arabic powder and water together until it forms a thick syrup.",
              "After that, the syrup is mixed with the lamp black, usually in a mortar and pestle of some kind.",
              "After that, it can take up to an hour to moisten all the powder.",
              "Once all of the powder is wet, more pigment is added until it becomes a thick and sticky paste.",
              "This paste needs to be stirred up to thirty more hours until it becomes completely smooth.",

              "For calligraphy on paper, specialised materials and techniques are required to dye and coat with aged starch.",

              "In contrast, Turkey, under the direction of President Mustafa Kamal Pasha, did just the opposite.",
              "Instead of adopting the Arabic alphabet, he tried to \u201cwesternize\u201d Turkish language by using the Latin alphabet as opposed to the Arabic alphabet to write Turkish.",

              "The poetry of the Arabs consisted in the beginning of praise and satirical poems thought to be full of magical qualities.",
              "The strict rules of the outward form of the poems (monorhyme, complicated metre) even in pre-Islamic times led to a certain formalism and encouraged imitation.",
              "Another early poetic form was the elegy, as noted in the work of the Arab female poet al-Khansa\u0304\u02be (died after 630).",
              "For the most part, however, Goethe\u2019s statement that the stories of The Thousand and One Nights have no goal in themselves shows his understanding of the character of Arabic belles lettres, contrasting them with the Islamic religion, which aims at \u201ccollecting and uniting people in order to achieve one high goal.",
              "\u201d Poets, on the other hand, rove around without any ethical purpose, according to the Qur\u02bea\u0304n.",
              "For many pious Muslims, poetry was something suspect, opposed to the divine law, especially since it sang mostly of forbidden wine and of free love.",
              "The combination of music and poetry, as practiced in court circles and among the mystics, has always aroused the wrath of the lawyer divines who wield so much authority in Islamic communities.",
              "This opposition may partly explain why Islamic poetry and fine arts took refuge in a kind of unreal world, using fixed images that could be correctly interpreted only by those who were knowledgeable in the art.",
              "The ambiguity of Persian poetry, which oscillates between the worldly, the divine, and often the political level, is typical of Islamic writings.",
              "Especially in Iran and the countries under its cultural influence, this kind of poetry formed the most important part of literature.",
              "Epic poetry of all kinds developed exclusively outside the Arabic-speaking countries;",
              "Western readers look in vain for an epical structure in such long poems (as in the case of the prose-romances of the Arabs) and find instead a rather aimless representation of facts and fictions.",
              "A similar characteristic even conditions innumerable historical works in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, which, especially in classical times, contain much valuable information, put together without being shaped into a real work of art;",
              "only rarely does the historian or philosopher reach a comprehensive view.",
              "The first attempt at a philosophy of history, Ibn Khaldu\u0304n\u2019s Muqaddimah, in the 14th century, was rarely studied by his Arab compatriots.",
              "The accumulation of large amounts of material, which is carefully organized up to the present, seems typical of all branches of Islamic scholarship, from theology to natural sciences.",
              "There are many minute observations and descriptions but rarely a full view of the whole process.",
              "Later, especially in the Persian, Turkish, and Indo-Muslim areas, a tendency to overstress the decorative elements of prose is evident, and the contents even of official chronicles are hidden behind a network of rhymed prose, which is often difficult to disentangle.",
              "This tendency is illustrated in all branches of Islamic art: the lack of \u201carchitectural\u201d formation.",
              "Instead, there is a kind of carpetlike pattern;",
              "the Arabic and Persian poem is, in general, judged not as a closed unity but rather according to the perfection of its individual verses.",
              "Its main object is not to convey a deep personal feeling but to perfect to the utmost the traditional rules and inherited metaphors, to which a new image may sometimes be added.",
              "Thus, the personality of the poet becomes visible only through the minimal changes of expression and rhythm and the application of certain preferred metaphors, just as the personality of the miniature painter can be detected by a careful observation of details, of his way of colouring a rock or deepening the shade of a turban.",
              "The same holds true for the arabesques, which were developed according to a strict ritual to a mathematical pattern and were refined until they reached a perfection of geometrically complicated figures, as in the dome of the Karatay Medrese in Konya (1251);",
              "it corresponds both to the most intricate lacelike Ku\u0304fic inscriptions around this dome and to the poetical style of Jala\u0304l al-Di\u0304n Ru\u0304mi\u0304, who wrote in that very place and during those years.",
              "His immortal mystical poems comprise thousands of variations on the central theme of love.",
              "Although such a perfect congruency of poetry and fine arts is not frequently found, the precept about Persian art that \u201cits wings are too heavy with beauty\u201d can also be applied to Persian poetry.",
              "Thus, the tile work of a Persian mosque, which combines different levels of arabesque work with different styles of writing, is reminiscent of the way Persian poetry combines at least two levels of reality.",
              "And a perfect harmony is reached in some of the miniature manuscripts of Iran, Muslim India, or Ottoman Turkey, which, in their lucid colours and fine details of execution, recall both the perfection of the calligraphy that surrounds them on delicate paper and the subtlety of the stories or poems that they accompany or illustrate.",
              "Those accustomed to the Western ideals of plasticity or form in the fine arts and literature or to the polyphonic interweaving of melodic lines in music have some difficulties in appreciating this art.",

              "Music, differentiated as it may be in the countries between Morocco and India, follows the same model: variations of highest subtlety on a comparatively simple given subject or theme.",
              "Drama and opera in the Western sense did not develop in the Islamic countries until the 19th century, and the art of the novel is also a comparatively recent development.",
              "There was no reason for drama: in the Muslim perception, God is the only actor who can do whatever he pleases, whose will is inscrutable.",
              "Humans are, at best, puppets on a string, behind whose movements those with insight detect the hand of the play master.",
              "Neither is the problem of personal guilt and absolution posed as it is in the West, nor is a catharsis, or purging of emotion, needed through drama.",
              "The atomist theory, widely accepted in Islam since the 10th century, leaves no room for a \u201cdramatic\u201d movement;",
              "it teaches that God creates everything anew in every moment, and what is called a \u201claw of nature\u201d is nothing but God\u2019s custom, which he can interrupt whenever he pleases.",
              "It is true that certain other forms are found in the more folkloristic arts of Islam.",
              "Every region has produced poetry, in regional languages, that is livelier and more realistic than the classical court poetry, but poetry limited to one region tends to become restricted to certain fixed forms that can be easily imitated.",
              "Attempts at drama in Islam come from these more popular spheres in Iran (and, rarely, in Lebanon and Iraq), where the tragic events of the murder of H\u0323usayn (680) at Karbala were dramatized in strange forms, using the vocabulary of traditional Persian poetry and theology.",
              "Thus, strangely hybrid forms emerge in the Islamic arts, highly interesting for the historian of religion and the student of literature but not typical of the classic Islamic ideals.",
              "Popular illustrations of tales and legends and those of some of the heroes of the Shi\u02bfah are similarly interesting but atypical.",
              "In modern times, of course, there have been imitations of all forms of Western literary and visual arts: paintings in the Impressionist or Cubist style;",
              "the use of free verse instead of the stern classical forms;",
              "and novels, dramas, motion pictures, and music combining Western and Eastern modes.",
              "Belief in the Qur\u02bea\u0304nic dictum \u201cWhatever is on earth will perish save His face\u201d discouraged artistic endeavour on a large scale, but the Prophetic tradition (Hadith) \u201cVerily God is beautiful and loves beauty\u201d has inspired numberless artists and artisans, writers and poets, musicians, and mystics to develop their arts and crafts as a reflection of that divine beauty.",
              "A theory of aesthetics comprising the various artistic expressions of the Muslim peoples has yet to be written.",
              "Although there have been a number of studies in literary criticism, the formal indebtedness of some of the best modern poets and painters to the Islamic heritage has yet to be fully articulated.",
              "It is notable that the arts of the Islamic peoples have had relatively little impact on other cultures, certainly far less than their artistic merit would appear to warrant.",
              "Europe has known art objects of Islamic origin since the early Middle Ages, when they were brought home by the Crusaders or manufactured by the Arabs in Sicily and Spain.",
              "Much admired and even imitated, they formed part of the material culture in those times, so much so that even the coronation robes of the German emperor were decorated with an Arabic inscription.",
              "At the same time, Islamic motives wandered into the belles lettres of Europe, and Islamic scientific books formed a basis for the development of Western science.",
              "Islamic culture as such, however, was rather an object of hatred than of admiration;",
              "a more objective appreciation of both the works of art and of literature did not start until the mid-17th century, when travelers told of the magnificent buildings in Iran and Mughal India and the first works from Persian literature were translated, influencing German classical literature.",
              "Indian miniatures inspired Rembrandt, just as European paintings were imitated by Islamic, especially Mughal, artists.",
              "Persian carpets were among the most-coveted gifts for princes and princesses.",
              "A bias against the cultures of the East persisted, however, until after the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment.",
              "The indefatigable work of the British scholars at Fort William at Calcutta (now Kolkata) brought new literary treasures to Europe, where they were studied carefully by specialists in the emerging field of Islamic studies.",
              "Poets such as Goethe in Germany in the early 19th century paved the way for a deeper understanding of Islamic poetry.",
              "Islamic literatures, however, continue to be known to the larger Western public almost exclusively by The Thousand and One Nights (translated first in the early 18th century), Omar Khayyam\u2019s roba\u0304\u02bfiyya\u0304t (\u201cquatrains\u201d), and the lyrics of H\u0323a\u0304fez\u0323.",
              "Even experts who were aware of the immense wealth of the literatures in the different Islamic languages (such as Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu) until the 20th century rarely appreciated the literatures from an aesthetic viewpoint;",
              "rather, they used them as a source for lexicography and for philological and historical research.",
              "The situation in Islamic fine arts and architecture was similar.",
              "Although the beauty of the Alhambra, for example, had already inspired European scholars and artists in the early 19th century, a thorough study of Islamic art as an independent field began only in the 20th century.",
              "Interest in the music of Islamic peoples, the arabesque-like uniformity of which seems strange to Western ideals of harmony, was also slow to develop."

              "The most important principle governing art was aniconism\u2014the religious prohibition of figurization and representation of living creatures.",
              "Underlying this prohibition is the assumption that God is the sole author of life and that a person who produces a likeness of a living being seeks to rival God.",
              "The tradition ascribed to the Prophet that a person who makes a picture of a living thing will be asked on the Day of Judgment to infuse life into it, whether historically genuine or not, doubtless represents the original attitude of Islam.",
              "In the Qur\u02bea\u0304n (3:49, 5:113), reflecting an account in a New Testament apocryphal work, it is counted among the miracles of Jesus that he made likenesses of birds from clay \u201cby God\u2019s order,\u201d and, when he breathed into them, they became real birds, again, \u201cby God\u2019s order.",

              "To understand the development of modern Western calligraphy it is important to survey historical writing styles\u2014some of which profoundly influenced subsequent work\u2014as well as how the materials of writing have been used.",
              "Most calligraphy is done with pen and ink on paper or parchment, although brushes and chisels are also used for making large letters on various surfaces.",
              "Later judgments about how the tip of a pen (usually a quill or reed) was cut, the angle at which it was held, and the formation of individual letters are conjectures based on the evidence of images of people writing, subsequent calligraphic practices, and the letters themselves.",
              "Very few artifacts and no treatises on the practice of writing are known to have existed before the 15th century, although instructions and descriptions of quill cutting published in the 16th century probably reflect long-standing practices.",
              "The Latin and vernacular handwriting of western Europe descends in a nearly unbroken line to the present day from the 1st century ad.",
              "The script used throughout the Roman Empire for books and occasionally for formal documents is known as rustic capitals.",
              "The pen used to write this script was cut with a broad end and held so that its thickest strokes fell at an oblique, nearly perpendicular angle to the line of writing.",
              "As is the case for most formal alphabets, the pen was lifted from the writing surface to make the serifs and other strokes for each single letter.",
              "The rustic alphabet consists only of capital, or majuscule, letters, most of which are contained between a single pair of horizontal lines.",
              "The letters B, L, and F are sometimes taller than the other capitals to distinguish them from R, I, and E, which are similar in appearance.",
              "This elaborate script, whose letter forms were used for inscriptions as well as manuscripts, is called rustic only by comparison with the magnificent square capitals typical of Roman imperial inscriptions.",
              "Both styles existed simultaneously, but very few manuscripts written in square capitals survive from ancient times.",
              "Square capitals, which require many more separate marks to make a single letter, are more often seen on inscriptions cut with a chisel that copied letters designed with a brush.",
              "Brushes were also used for large writing such as that seen in the graffiti in Pompeii.",
              "The business hand of the 1st century, used for correspondence and for most documents, private and official alike, is known as cursive capitals.",
              "Here the pen, cut to a narrow point, was held at an oblique angle similar to that used for rustic capitals, but the pen was lifted less often (and the writing was faster).",
              "This cursive handling led to new and simpler letter forms such as (two strokes) for D (three strokes) and (two strokes) for E (four strokes).",
              "Some of these new forms are in effect minuscule, in that parts of them ascend or descend beyond a pair of lines that define the height of letters such as n or x (e.",
              "g., ascending letters such as d and descending letters such as p) instead of maintaining the uniformity in height of square capitals.",
              "Cursive capitals were also sometimes joined to following letters, further reducing the number of times the pen was lifted during the writing.",
              "This Roman style is hardly considered a calligraphic script, but it demonstrates how a formal alphabet was modified through rapid writing.",
              "From the 2nd to the early 4th century, parchment was replacing papyrus as the standard writing material for books, and the codex was replacing the roll as their standard form.",
              "The evidence that survives from this period, during which biblical and other Christian literature was beginning to be copied extensively, is fragmentary, and its interpretation is still controversial.",
              "The main line of development, however, is clear enough.",
              "The elaborate letter forms of rustic capitals, with their numerous pen lifts, began to be abandoned, and experiments were made with new book hands in which the simplified letter forms of cursive capitals were written with a broad pen, sometimes held obliquely in the traditional way and sometimes held \u201cstraight,\u201d so that its thickest strokes fell at right angles to the line of writing.",
              "It was probably the use of a straight pen that produced, for example, the conversion of cursive capital (axis oblique) into the fully minuscule d (axis vertical).",
              "For the 4th and 5th centuries, the evidence is more abundant, and it is known that two new book hands and a new business hand came into use.",
              "The older of the book hands, called uncials (a name given this style by the 17th-century French paleographer Jean Mabillon), was originally written with a square-edged pen, perhaps cut at an oblique angle;",
              "but, from the 6th century onward, a pen without an oblique cut seems to have been used, leading to a rounder-looking letter.",
              "Occasionally these letters were written with several lifts and manipulations of the pen, which led one paleographer to dub them \u201cartificial\u201d uncials.",
              "Although they incorporate several cursive letter forms (, , h) and introduce two forms peculiar to this type of alphabet (, ), uncials generally constitute a capital alphabet similar to Greek capitals of the 4th century, such as those seen in the Codex Sinaiticus.",
              "P and F are the only letters that consistently descend below the writing line.",
              "From the 4th to the early 7th century, most Christian books\u2014biblical, patristic, and liturgical\u2014were written in the uncial script, and even for pagan literature uncial almost entirely superseded rustic capitals.",

              "The younger of the two new book hands is called half uncial.",
              "This script was less popular than uncials and never broke their monopoly on biblical and liturgical texts, although, like uncial script, half uncial was still being written in the 8th century and even, as a display script, in the 9th century.",
              "Half uncial differs from early uncial script in its minuscule appearance;",
              "only one letter (N) remained more or less unchanged from the capital form.",
              "The distinguishing letter forms in half uncial are a, b, d, g, h, l, m, r, and s.",
              "There was no attempt to confine letters between a single pair of lines, as they had gained distinctive ascenders and descenders.",
              "The new business hand of the 4th century and after is known as cursive minuscule.",
              "Like cursive capitals, it was written with a pointed pen, but the pen was held more or less straight.",
              "It uses basically the same letter forms as half uncials, although the frequency in cursive minuscule of ligatures between letters tends to conceal the fundamental likeness between the two hands.",
              "The letter forms that distinguish cursive minuscule and half uncials from rustic and cursive capitals and from uncials were developed during the obscure period between the 1st and 4th centuries.",
              "The question of whether these forms developed in the sphere of the book hands or of the business hands is still undecided, but, whatever their origin, their importance for the subsequent history of European handwriting is paramount.",
              "They provided the material on which the Carolingian minuscule, which first appeared in the late 8th century, was based, and that script (including its modifications) dominated Europe until the end of the Middle Ages.",
              "Only in one other period were new letter forms evolved, between the 13th and the 15th centuries, in the group of scripts known as Gothic cursives;",
              "and the influence of these late innovations was ultimately canceled out, thanks to the revival of Carolingian minuscule in a pure form by the Italian humanists at the beginning of the 15th century."

              "The phonetic values of some letters changed, some letters were lost and gained, and several writing styles (\"hands\") developed.",
              "Two such styles, the minuscule and majuscule hands, were combined into one script with alternate forms for the lower and upper case letters.",
              "Modern uppercase letters differ only slightly from their classical counterparts, and there are few regional variants.",
              "The Latin alphabet started out as uppercase serifed letters known as Roman square capitals.",
              "The lowercase letters evolved through cursive styles that developed to adapt the inscribed alphabet to being written with a pen.",
              "Over the ages many dissimilar stylistic forms of each letter evolved but, when not becoming a recognised subform to transliterate exotic tongues, denoted the same letter.",
              "After the evolution from the Western Greek Alphabet through Old Italic alphabet, G developed from C, the consonantal I (namely J) from a flourished I, V and U split likewise and the Germanic-centred ligature of VV became W, the letter thorn \u00de was introduced from the runic alphabet but was lost in all except Icelandic, and s would be normally written as a long s (s), and when coming before z, it formed the ligature \u00df, which has survived in German to this day as a separate letter.",

              "In general, however, the Romans did not use the traditional (Semitic-derived) names as in Greek, but adopted the simplified names of the Etruscans, which derived from saying the sounds of the letters: the vowels stood for themselves, the names of the stop consonant letters were formed by adding the neutral vowel e, which in Latin became /e\u02d0/ (except for K and Q, which were distinguished from C by appending the vowel which followed them in Etruscan orthography), and the names of the continuant consonants were formed by preceded the sound with /e/.",

              "Repetition like this in books that we know circulated in a specific, closed social milieu reveals a certain expectation of iconography.",
              "People expected to see a physician depicted a certain way.",
              "When a work circulates in a group with such shared expectations, these expectations are then reflected in the product.",
              "As such, artists sought to represent figures that would be easily recognisable to readers.",
              "Reading in the Middle Ages was a social activity in more ways than one (reading out loud, sharing books in a closed group).",
              "As such, how books were created and produced indicates how they were being shared and read, and the influence of collective social expectations on the process.",
