              "Using the LOD score which describes the likelihood that two genes are near each other on a chromosome, and thus will be inherited together, areas of strong or suggestive linkage with inheritance of synesthesia were found.",
              "[6] The area with the highest LOD score in the genome of an individual with auditory-visual synesthesia has been shown to be linked with autism as well,[7] another disorder with sensory and perceptual abnormalities.",
              "Other regions of linkage include genes that are related to the development of the cerebral cortex (TBR1), dyslexia, and apoptosis (EFHC1),[8] the last of which could be potentially related to the retention of the neonatal synesthetic pathways in the universal synesthesia/pruning hypothesis.",
              "This hypothesis posits that every person is born a synesthete and the \u2018extra\u2019 connections are pruned during normal neurodevelopment in non-synesthetes, and not pruned in synesthetes.",
              "[9] More potential support for that hypothesis comes from another region identified with strong linkage, which contains a gene (DPYSL3) which is involved in axonal growth, neuroplasticity, and neuronal differentiation.",
              "[10] Additionally, this gene is not expressed in the adult brain but is highly expressed in the late-fetal and early post-natal brain and spinal cord, providing more support for a universal \u201cneonatal synesthesia\u201d that is pruned away through natural development.",
              "[11] Another genome scan [12] revealed a different area of linkage for an individual with colored sequence synesthesia: one which associates days of the week with colors.",
              "In that individual, the linked region contained genes that produces proteins important for intercellular communication (GABARAPL2), genes that are involved in brain development (NDRG4), genes linked to neuron myelination (PLLP), genes that produce enzymes involved in neuronal pruning (KATNB1), genes that produce Apoptosis inhibitors expressed in fetal brains (CIAPIN1), and genes that produce proteins that have differential expression in individuals with schizophrenia (GNAO1).",
              "Due to the prevalence of synesthesia among the first-degree relatives of synesthetes,[13] there is evidence that synesthesia might have a genetic basis, however the monozygotic twins case studies indicate there is an epigenetic component.",

              "Synesthesia \u2014 a neurological phenomenon that causes unusual connections between senses or cognitive pathways, like associating numbers or sounds with colors, has been described in literature dating back to the ancient Greeks, with the first medical description appearing in a German physician's thesis from 1812.",
              "In 1880, Charles Darwin's cousin Francis Galton, published a paper in Nature on the phenomenon.",
              "Imaging studies have demonstrated increased structural and functional connectivity in a number of regions of the brain among people with synesthesia, but any molecular basis for the condition has eluded scientists, with previous linkage studies searching for shared genetic loci across multiple families yielding limited success.",
              "But now a new study from researchers at the Max Planck Institute and Radboud University in the Netherlands and the UK's Cambridge University has, for the first time, identified specific genes that are linked to synesthesia.",
              "Because of a lack of candidate genes, lead author Simon Fisher, DPhil, director of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics and professor of language and genetics at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, and his colleagues applied whole-exome sequencing to three families who all have sound-color synesthesia affecting multiple relatives across at least three generations.",
              "Published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on March 20, the analysis identified rare genetic variants that align with synesthesia in each family \u2014 a total of 37 genes of interest.",
              "They further pinpointed six genes, COL4A1, ITGA2, MYO10, ROBO3, SLC9A6, and SLIT2, that are all associated with axonogenesis and expressed during early childhood when longitudinal studies have shown that synesthetic associations are formed.",
              "\u201cThese results are consistent with neuroimaging-based hypotheses about the role of hyperconnectivity in the etiology of synesthesia and offer a potential entry point into the neurobiology that organizes our sensory experiences,\u201d the authors wrote.",

              "Fisher explained.",
              "\u201cThis is fascinating, because it is consistent with well-established prior findings of altered connectivity in neuroimaging of synesthesia, and so the pattern fits with a prominent hypothesis about how synesthesia develops,\u201d he continued.",
              "\u201cThis means that, although we confirm the genetic heterogeneity of synesthesia, we at the same time show that the candidate genes cluster in shared pathways that are well aligned with neurobiological accounts, offering us potential entry points into the relevant mechanisms.\u201d Synesthesia comes in many varieties: in grapheme-color synesthesia, numbers and letters trigger a color experience, although the color associations differ from person to person.",

              "For sound-color and grapheme-color forms, there are robust, well-accepted methods for validating whether someone is indeed synesthetic, by presenting them with many different primary stimuli and assessing the consistency of their color responses over repeated presentations.",
              "\u201d Neuroimaging studies such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans have also documented differences in brain region activation among synesthetes compared to non-synesthetes, but those studies have yielded somewhat inconsistent results \u2014 perhaps because of the differing forms that synesthesia takes.",
              "Overall, however, there is some consistent evidence suggesting that color-selective region V4 of the posterior-inferior temporal cortex and parieto-occipital junction is involved with word-color synesthesia.",

              "Synesthesia (American English) or synaesthesia (British English) is a perceptual phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.",
              "[1][2][3][4] For instance, people with synesthesia may experience colors when listening to music, see shapes when smelling certain scents, or perceive tastes when looking at words.",
              "People who report a lifelong history of such experiences are known as synesthetes.",
              "Awareness of synesthetic perceptions varies from person to person with the perception of synesthesia differing based on an individual's unique life experiences and the specific type of synesthesia that they have.",
              "[5][6] In one common form of synesthesia, known as grapheme\u2013color synesthesia or color\u2013graphemic synesthesia, letters or numbers are perceived as inherently colored.",
              "[7][8] In spatial-sequence, or number form synesthesia, numbers, months of the year, or days of the week elicit precise locations in space (e.",
              "g., 1980 may be \"farther away\" than 1990), or may appear as a three-dimensional map (clockwise or counterclockwise).",
              "[9][10] Synesthetic associations can occur in any combination and any number of senses or cognitive pathways.",
              "[11] Little is known about how synesthesia develops.",
              "It has been suggested that synesthesia develops during childhood when children are intensively engaged with abstract concepts for the first time.",
              "[12] This hypothesis\u2014referred to as semantic vacuum hypothesis\u2014could explain why the most common forms of synesthesia are grapheme-color, spatial sequence, and number form.",
              "These are usually the first abstract concepts that educational systems require children to learn.",
              "The earliest recorded case of synesthesia is attributed to the Oxford University academic and philosopher John Locke, who, in 1690, made a report about a blind man who said he experienced the color scarlet when he heard the sound of a trumpet.",
              "[13] However, there is disagreement as to whether Locke described an actual instance of synesthesia or was using a metaphor.",
              "[14] The first medical account came from German physician Georg Tobias Ludwig Sachs in 1812.",
              "[14][15][16] The term is from the Ancient Greek \u03c3\u03c5\u0301\u03bd syn, 'together', and \u03b1\u03b9\u0313\u0301\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 aisthe\u0304sis, 'sensation'.",
              "[13] There are two overall forms of synesthesia: For example, in chromesthesia (sound to color), a projector may hear a trumpet, and see an orange triangle in space, while an associator might hear a trumpet, and think very strongly that it sounds \"orange\".",
              "[citation needed] Synesthesia can occur between nearly any two senses or perceptual modes, and at least one synesthete, Solomon Shereshevsky, experienced synesthesia that linked all five senses.",
              "[17] Types of synesthesia are indicated by using the notation x \u2192 y, where x is the \"inducer\" or trigger experience, and y is the \"concurrent\" or additional experience.",
              "For example, perceiving letters and numbers (collectively called graphemes) as colored would be indicated as grapheme-color synesthesia.",
              "Similarly, when synesthetes see colors and movement as a result of hearing musical tones, it would be indicated as tone \u2192 (color, movement) synesthesia.",
              "While nearly every logically possible combination of experiences can occur, several types are more common than others.",
              "In one of the most common forms of synesthesia, individual letters of the alphabet and numbers (collectively referred to as \"graphemes\") are \"shaded\" or \"tinged\" with a color.",
              "While different individuals usually do not report the same colors for all letters and numbers, studies with large numbers of synesthetes find some commonalities across letters (e.",
              "g., A is likely to be red).",
              "[18] Some authors had argued that the term synaesthesia may not be correct when applied to the so-called grapheme-colour synesthesia and similar phenomena in which the inducer is conceptual (e.",
              "g. a letter or number) rather than sensory (e.",
              "g. sound or color).",
              "They have postulated that the term ideasthesia is a more accurate description.",
              "[19][20] Another common form of synesthesia is the association of sounds with colors.",
              "For some, everyday sounds can trigger seeing colors.",
              "For others, colors are triggered when musical notes or keys are being played.",
              "People with synesthesia related to music may also have perfect pitch because their ability to see and hear colors aids them in identifying notes or keys.",
              "[21] The colors triggered by certain sounds, and any other synesthetic visual experiences, are referred to as photisms. According to Richard Cytowic,[3] chromesthesia is \"something like fireworks\": voice, music, and assorted environmental sounds such as clattering dishes or dog barks trigger color and firework shapes that arise, move around, and then fade when the sound ends.",
              "Sound often changes the perceived hue, brightness, scintillation, and directional movement.",
              "Some individuals see music on a \"screen\" in front of their faces.",
              "For Deni Simon, music produces waving lines \"like oscilloscope configurations \u2013 lines moving in color, often metallic with height, width, and, most importantly, depth.",
              "My favorite music has lines that extend horizontally beyond the 'screen' area.\"",
              "Individuals rarely agree on what color a given sound is.",
              "Composers Franz Liszt and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov famously disagreed on the colors of musical keys.",
              "Those with spatial sequence synesthesia (SSS) tend to see ordinal sequences as points in space.",
              "People with SSS may have superior memories;",
              "in one study, they were able to recall past events and memories far better and in far greater detail than those without the condition.",
              "They can also see months or dates in the space around them, but most synesthetes \"see\" these sequences in their mind's eye.",
              "Some people see time like a clock above and around them.",
              "[22][23][24] A number form is a mental map of numbers that automatically and involuntarily appear whenever someone who experiences number-forms synesthesia thinks of numbers.",
              "These numbers might appear in different locations and the mapping changes and varies between individuals.",
              "Number forms were first documented and named in 1881 by Francis Galton in \"The Visions of Sane Persons\".",
              "[25] In auditory\u2013tactile synesthesia, certain sounds can induce sensations in parts of the body.",
              "For example, someone with auditory\u2013tactile synesthesia may experience that hearing a specific word or sound feels like touch in one specific part of the body or may experience that certain sounds can create a sensation in the skin without being touched (not to be confused with the milder general reaction known as frisson, which affects approximately 50% of the population).",
              "It is one of the least common forms of synesthesia.",
              "[26] Ordinal-linguistic personification (OLP, or personification) is a form of synesthesia in which ordered sequences, such as ordinal numbers, week-day names, months, and alphabetical letters are associated with personalities or genders (Simner & Hubbard 2006).",
              "Although this form of synesthesia was documented as early as the 1890s,[27][28] researchers have, until recently, paid little attention to it (see History of synesthesia research).",
              "This form of synesthesia was named \"OLP\" in the contemporary literature by Julia Simner and colleagues[29] although it is now also widely recognised by the term \"sequence-personality\" synesthesia.",
              "Ordinal linguistic personification normally co-occurs with other forms of synesthesia such as grapheme\u2013color synesthesia.",
              "Misophonia is a neurological disorder in which negative experiences (anger, fright, hatred, disgust) are triggered by specific sounds.",
              "Cytowic suggests that misophonia is related to, or perhaps a variety of, synesthesia.",
              "[1] Edelstein and her colleagues have compared misophonia to synesthesia in terms of connectivity between different brain regions as well as specific symptoms.[1] They formed the hypothesis that \"a pathological distortion of connections between the auditory cortex and limbic structures could cause a form of sound-emotion synesthesia.\"",
              "[30] Studies suggest that individuals with misophonia have a normal hearing sensitivity level but the limbic system and autonomic nervous system are constantly in a \"heightened state of arousal\" where abnormal reactions to sounds will be more prevalent.",
              "[31] Newer studies suggest that depending on its severity, misophonia could be associated with lower cognitive control when individuals are exposed to certain associations and triggers.",
              "[32] It is unclear what causes misophonia.",
              "Some scientists believe it could be genetic, others believe it to be present with other additional conditions, however there is not enough evidence to conclude what causes it.",
              "[33] There are no current treatments for the condition, but it could be managed with different types of coping strategies.",
              "[33] These strategies vary from person to person, some have reported the avoidance of certain situations that could trigger the reaction: mimicking the sounds, cancelling out the sounds by using different methods like earplugs, music, internal dialog and many other tactics.",
              "Most misophonics use these to \"overwrite\" these sounds produced by others.",
              "[34] This is a form of synesthesia where individuals feel the same/similar sensation as another person (such as touch).",
              "For instance, when such a synesthete observes someone being tapped on their shoulder, the synesthete involuntarily feels a tap on their own shoulder as well.",
              "People with this type of synesthesia have been shown to have higher empathy levels compared to the general population.",
              "This may be related to the so-called mirror neurons present in the motor areas of the brain, which have also been linked to empathy.",
              "[35] This is another form of synesthesia where certain tastes are experienced when hearing words.",
              "For example, the word basketball might taste like waffles.",
              "The documentary 'Derek Tastes of Earwax' gets its name from this phenomenon, in references to pub owner James Wannerton who experiences this particular sensation whenever he hears the name spoken.",
              "[36][37] It is estimated that 0.",
              "2% of the synesthesia population has this form of synesthesia, making it one of the rarest forms.[38] Kinesthetic synesthesia is one of the rarest documented forms of synesthesia in the world.",
              "[39] This form of synesthesia is a combination of various different types of synesthesia.",
              "Features appear similar to auditory\u2013tactile synesthesia but sensations are not isolated to individual numbers or letters but complex systems of relationships.",
              "The result is the ability to memorize and model complex relationships between numerous variables by feeling physical sensations around the kinesthetic movement of related variables.",
              "Reports include feeling sensations in the hands or feet, coupled with visualizations of shapes or objects when analyzing mathematical equations, physical systems, or music.",
              "In another case, a person described seeing interactions between physical shapes causing sensations in the feet when solving a math problem.",
              "Generally, those with this type of synesthesia can memorize and visualize complicated systems, and with a high degree of accuracy, predict the results of changes to the system.",
              "Examples include predicting the results of computer simulations in subjects such as quantum mechanics or fluid dynamics when results are not naturally intuitive.",
              "[18][40] Other forms of synesthesia have been reported, but little has been done to analyze them scientifically.",
              "There are at least 80 types of synesthesia.",
              "[39] In August 2017 a research article in the journal Social Neuroscience reviewed studies with fMRI to determine if persons who experience autonomous sensory meridian response are experiencing a form of synesthesia.",
              "While a determination has not yet been made, there is anecdotal evidence that this may be the case, based on significant and consistent differences from the control group, in terms of functional connectivity within neural pathways.",
              "It is unclear whether this will lead to ASMR being included as a form of existing synesthesia, or if a new type will be considered.",
              "[41] Some synesthetes often report that they were unaware their experiences were unusual until they realized other people did not have them, while others report feeling as if they had been keeping a secret their entire lives.",
              "[42] The automatic and ineffable nature of a synesthetic experience means that the pairing may not seem out of the ordinary.",
              "This involuntary and consistent nature helps define synesthesia as a real experience.",
              "Most synesthetes report that their experiences are pleasant or neutral, although, in rare cases, synesthetes report that their experiences can lead to a degree of sensory overload.",
              "[18] Though often stereotyped in the popular media as a medical condition or neurological aberration,[citation needed] many synesthetes themselves do not perceive their synesthetic experiences as a handicap.",
              "On the contrary, some report it as a gift \u2013 an additional \"hidden\" sense \u2013 something they would not want to miss.",
              "Most synesthetes become aware of their distinctive mode of perception in their childhood.",
              "Some have learned how to apply their ability in daily life and work.",
              "Synesthetes have used their abilities in memorization of names and telephone numbers, mental arithmetic, and more complex creative activities like producing visual art, music, and theater.",
              "[42] Despite the commonalities which permit the definition of the broad phenomenon of synesthesia, individual experiences vary in numerous ways.",
              "This variability was first noticed early in synesthesia research.",
              "[43] Some synesthetes report that vowels are more strongly colored, while for others consonants are more strongly colored.",
              "[18] Self-reports, interviews, and autobiographical notes by synesthetes demonstrate a great degree of variety in types of synesthesia, the intensity of synesthetic perceptions, awareness of the perceptual discrepancies between synesthetes and non-synesthetes, and the ways synesthesia is used in work, creative processes, and daily life.",
              "[42][44] Synesthetes are very likely to participate in creative activities.",
              "[40] It has been suggested that individual development of perceptual and cognitive skills, in addition to one's cultural environment, produces the variety in awareness and practical use of synesthetic phenomena.",
              "[6][44] Synesthesia may also give a memory advantage.",
              "In one study, conducted by Julia Simner of the University of Edinburgh, it was found that spatial sequence synesthetes have a built-in and automatic mnemonic reference.",
              "Whereas a non-synesthete will need to create a mnemonic device to remember a sequence (like dates in a diary), a synesthete can simply reference their spatial visualizations.",
              "[45] As of 2015, the neurological correlates of synesthesia had not been established.",
              "[47] Dedicated regions of the brain are specialized for given functions.",
              "Increased cross-talk between regions specialized for different functions may account for the many types of synesthesia.",
              "For example, the additive experience of seeing color when looking at graphemes might be due to cross-activation of the grapheme-recognition area and the color area called V4 (see figure).",
              "[46] This is supported by the fact that grapheme\u2013color synesthetes can identify the color of a grapheme in their peripheral vision even when they cannot consciously identify the shape of the grapheme.",
              "[46] An alternative possibility is disinhibited feedback, or a reduction in the amount of inhibition along normally existing feedback pathways.",
              "[48] Normally, excitation and inhibition are balanced.",
              "However, if normal feedback were not inhibited as usual, then signals feeding back from late stages of multi-sensory processing might influence earlier stages such that tones could activate vision.",
              "Cytowic and Eagleman find support for the disinhibition idea in the so-called acquired forms[3] of synesthesia that occur in non-synesthetes under certain conditions: temporal lobe epilepsy,[49] head trauma, stroke, and brain tumors.",
              "They also note that it can likewise occur during stages of meditation, deep concentration, sensory deprivation, or with use of psychedelics such as LSD or mescaline, and even, in some cases, marijuana.",
              "[3] However, synesthetes report that common stimulants, like caffeine and cigarettes do not affect the strength of their synesthesia, nor does alcohol.",
              "[3]: 137\u201340 A very different theoretical approach to synesthesia is that based on ideasthesia.",
              "According to this account, synesthesia is a phenomenon mediated by the extraction of the meaning of the inducing stimulus.",
              "Thus, synesthesia may be fundamentally a semantic phenomenon.",
              "Therefore, to understand neural mechanisms of synesthesia the mechanisms of semantics and the extraction of meaning need to be understood better.",
              "This is a non-trivial issue because it is not only a question of a location in the brain at which meaning is \"processed\" but pertains also to the question of understanding \u2013 epitomized in e.",
              "g., the Chinese room problem.",
              "Thus, the question of the neural basis of synesthesia is deeply entrenched into the general mind\u2013body problem and the problem of the explanatory gap.",
              "[50] Due to the prevalence of synesthesia among the first-degree relatives of people affected,[51] there may be a genetic basis, as indicated by the monozygotic twins studies showing an epigenetic component.",
              "[medical citation needed] Synesthesia might also be an oligogenic condition, with locus heterogeneity, multiple forms of inheritance, and continuous variation in gene expression.",
              "[medical citation needed] While the exact genetic loci for this trait haven't been identified, research indicates that the genetic constructs underlying synesthesia are most likely more complex than the simple X-linked mode of inheritance that early researchers believed it to be.",
              "[8] Further, it remains uncertain as to whether synesthesia perseveres in the genetic pool because it provides a selective advantage, or because it has become a byproduct of some other useful selected trait.",
              "[52] Women have a higher chance of developing synesthesia, as demonstrated in population studies conducted in the city of Cambridge, England where females were 6 times more likely to have it.",
              "[51] As technological equipment continues to advance, the search for clearer answers regarding the genetics behind synesthesia will become more promising.",
              "Although often termed a \"neurological condition,\" synesthesia is not listed in either the DSM-IV or the ICD since it usually does not interfere with normal daily functioning.",
              "[53] Indeed, most synesthetes report that their experiences are neutral or even pleasant.",
              "[18] Like perfect pitch, synesthesia is simply a difference in perceptual experience.",
              "The simplest approach is test-retest reliability over long periods of time, using stimuli of color names, color chips, or a computer-screen color picker providing 16.",
              "7 million choices.",
              "Synesthetes consistently score around 90% on the reliability of associations, even with years between tests.",
              "[1] In contrast, non-synesthetes score just 30\u201340%, even with only a few weeks between tests and a warning that they would be retested.",
              "[1] Many tests exist for synesthesia.",
              "Each common type has a specific test.",
              "When testing for grapheme\u2013color synesthesia, a visual test is given.",
              "The person is shown a picture that includes black letters and numbers.",
              "A synesthete will associate the letters and numbers with a specific color.",
              "An auditory test is another way to test for synesthesia.",
              "A sound is turned on and one will either identify it with a taste or envision shapes.",
              "The audio test correlates with chromesthesia (sounds with colors).",
              "Since people question whether or not synesthesia is tied to memory, the \"retest\" is given.",
              "One is given a set of objects and is asked to assign colors, tastes, personalities, or more.",
              "After a period of time, the same objects are presented and the person is asked again to do the same task.",
              "The synesthete can assign the same characteristics because that person has permanent neural associations in the brain, rather than memories of a certain object.",
              "[medical citation needed] Grapheme\u2013color synesthetes, as a group, share significant preferences for the color of each letter (e.",
              "g., A tends to be red;",
              "O tends to be white or black;",
              "S tends to be yellow, etc.)",
              "[18] Nonetheless, there is a great variety in types of synesthesia, and within each type, individuals report differing triggers for their sensations and differing intensities of experiences.",
              "This variety means that defining synesthesia in an individual is difficult, and the majority of synesthetes are completely unaware that their experiences have a name.",
              "[18] Neurologist Richard Cytowic identifies the following diagnostic criteria for synesthesia in his first edition book.",
              "However, the criteria are different in the second book:[1][2][3] Cytowic's early cases mainly included individuals whose synesthesia was frankly projected outside the body (e.",
              "g., on a \"screen\" in front of one's face).",
              "Later research showed that such stark externalization occurs in a minority of synesthetes.",
              "Refining this concept, Cytowic and Eagleman differentiated between \"localizers\" and \"non-localizers\" to distinguish those synesthetes whose perceptions have a definite sense of spatial quality from those whose perceptions do not.",
              "[3] Estimates of prevalence of synesthesia have ranged widely, from 1 in 4 to 1 in 25,000\u2013100,000.",
              "However, most studies have relied on synesthetes reporting themselves, introducing self-referral bias.",
              "[54] In what is cited as the most accurate prevalence study so far,[54] self-referral bias was avoided by studying 500 people recruited from the communities of Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities;",

              "[55] This study also concluded that one common form of synesthesia \u2013 grapheme\u2013color synesthesia (colored letters and numbers) \u2013 is found in more than one percent of the population, and this latter prevalence of graphemes\u2013color synesthesia has since been independently verified in a sample of nearly 3,000 people in the University of Edinburgh.",
              "[56] The most common forms of synesthesia are those that trigger colors, and the most prevalent of all is day\u2013color.",
              "[55] Also relatively common is grapheme\u2013color synesthesia.",
              "We can think of \"prevalence\" both in terms of how common is synesthesia (or different forms of synesthesia) within the population, or how common are different forms of synesthesia within synesthetes.",
              "So within synesthetes, forms of synesthesia that trigger color also appear to be the most common forms of synesthesia with a prevalence rate of 86% within synesthetes.",

              "All the way back to the late sixties, there has been this consistent finding that synesthetes can have enhanced memory.",
              "So, we're thinking about how synesthesia might reflect a more general propensity for us to use multiple senses and multiple pieces of information in trying to remember something.",
              "But the synesthetes essentially get this for free because every time they experience a number they also get the color, and they have an additional advantage because they've learned over a lifetime of experience that this color goes with this number and this number goes with those colors.",
              "So, they can use each cue symmetrically to retrieve the other bit of information.",
              "JS: I think it's also important to point out that it's not all good news for synesthetes.",

              "We found that synesthetes are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety disorder.",
              "BF: Simner cautions that such association studies are still in their nascent stages and causative relationships have yet to be established.",
              "But the results will hopefully encourage additional research that will help us better understand the brain.",
              "There are lots of competing theories about how the brains of people with synesthesia produce such unusual blending of the senses and why the sensory combinations can manifest so differently in individuals, but none have yet produced definitive answers.",
              "Hubbard described one theory using the example of grapheme-color synesthesia.",
              "EH: One model is this idea of what we call the hyper-connectivity model.",
              "We know that there are brain regions that are involved in visual word recognition and they lie adjacent to brain areas that are involved in color processing.",
              "And it's been known since the 1880s that synesthesia runs in families.",
              "And so, if we think that there is some genetic factor that causes either excessive connectivity or reduction in the typical pruning process, these brain areas would remain connected such that whenever somebody sees a letter or a number, they would then also cross-activate these color selective areas and that would lead to the experience of seeing colors in addition to seeing the letters or numbers.",
              "BF: Hubbard says MRI scans of synesthetes\u2019 brains often reveal two key differences: thicker gray matter, which is the brain tissue containing neuron cell bodies, and greater connectivity or wiring between widespread regions of the brain.",
              "Despite the atypical features and functionality revealed in brain scans, Hubbard reminds us that we shouldn\u2019t view the brain activity of people with synesthesia as abnormal.",
              "They simply represent one end of a spectrum where sensory inputs can trigger stronger and more widespread brain activity than in people without synesthesia.",
              "EH: It is a variant in our normal everyday perception that a significant minority of the population experience.",
              "BF: In addition to brain imaging studies and psychological screening, scientists have also begun to search for genes that might predispose individuals to developing synesthesia by looking for gene variants in families with a higher than average number of synesthetes.",
              "So far, these studies have uncovered some basic patterns.",
              "EH: A large number of genes were ones that were all involved in basic neurodevelopmental processes like axon guidance, axon wayfinding, potentially some aspects of synapse stabilization and pruning.",
              "BF: Synesthesia is also more common in children than in adults, especially children who grew up bilingual.",
              "This suggests that synesthesia may arise or subsequently disappear during the process of normal brain development.",
              "And contrary to recent theories, women are not more likely to have synesthesia than men.",
              "JS: I've gone out into the population and individually screened seventeen and a half thousand people for synesthesia at this point, and in every study I've done, at every age I've done, I have never once found a significant difference between men and women or boys and girls.",
              "So, I'm fairly confident to say that the earlier finding of more women was a reporting bias.",
              "BF: So far, there are no documented cases of synesthesia naturally appearing after people reach adulthood.",
              "JS: When synesthesia does spontaneously arise in an adult, it tends to be the result of trauma or disease or something that would allow us to label that as an acquired synesthesia rather than the kind of developmental synesthesias we\u2019ve been talking about.",
              "BF: Such was the case of a man who became blind from a brain injury but began seeing colors whenever he heard people speak the names of numbers.",
              "Or a man with retinitis pigmentosa who, after going blind, noticed a red cartoon-like face begin to appear in his visual field, which then gained detail and 3-D depth over time.",
              "He also saw flashing, swirling, or jumping visions of objects he touched with his hands.",
              "Acquired synesthesia is very rare.",
              "But as scientists reach out to the public more and more, they\u2019re finding that developmental synesthesia is a lot more common than once thought.",
              "JS: So, the question of how common synesthesia is, is something that's been around in the literature for the last couple hundred years.",
              "The prevalence of synesthesia is probably at least 4 percent.",
              "That's from a study we ran in 2005 where we screened for around 128 different types of synesthesia.",
              "It might feel quite rare, but when you scale that up to the population of the planet, that's equivalent to the entire population of the United States.",
              "There are many important variants of synesthesia that we didn't test for.",
              "We did not include personality synesthesia, spatial synesthesia, mirror-touch synesthesia.",
              "So, I would suggest that the prevalence of synesthesia is somewhat higher than that.",
              "BF: So much still remains to be learned about synesthesia.",
              "One question in particular is, from an evolutionary standpoint, why is synesthesia so common relative to other rare genetic variants and why has it stuck around in the population?",
              "EH: One possibility is it does confer an advantage and we haven't been able to identify that advantage.",
              "My general take on this is that it's also quite likely that it's sort of evolutionarily neutral.",
              "If it wasn't selected against, it would be here present in the population as a consequence of all of the other genetic variability that gives rise to the brain systems that we have.",
              "JS: Yes, so something a bit like earlobe size.",
              "It's a variation in the population that\u2019s not going to be screened out anytime soon, so it continues.",
              "A lot of the debate today has been centered around the question of whether synesthetes are qualitatively different to the average person or whether they exist on a continuum with the average person, and I think we've decided that, either way, understanding synesthetes\u2019 brains is a fundamental tool, if you like, to understand the average brain.",

              "Although that theory has not received widespread support, Cytowic's case studies and his popular 1993 book, \"The Man Who Tasted Shapes,\" heightened synesthesia's prominence and prompted psychologists and neuroscientists to examine the condition experimentally.",

              "Several competing theories have emerged, but all require further testing.",
              "Baron-Cohen and his colleagues propose that synesthesia results from a genetically driven overabundance of neural connections in the brain.",

              "In synesthesia, Baron-Cohen and his colleagues posit, the brain's architecture is different.",
              "Synesthetes' brains, they believe, are equipped with more connections between neurons, causing the usual modularity to break down and giving rise to synesthesia.",
              "Daphne Maurer, PhD, a psychologist at McMaster University, has further speculated that all humans may be born with the neural connections that allow synesthesia, but that most of us lose those connections as we grow.",
              "Naropa University psychologist Peter Grossenbacher, PhD, agrees that there's likely a genetic root to synesthesia, and like Baron-Cohen's group, he and his colleagues have teamed with molecular geneticists to probe the question.",
              "But Grossenbacher and his colleagues suspect a different brain mechanism.",
              "\"We don't need to posit some abnormal architecture of connections in order to account for synesthesia,\" Grossenbacher argues.",
              "Instead, he proposes that in the brains of synesthetes, \"feed-backward\" connections that carry information from high-level multisensory areas of the brain back to single-sense areas are not properly inhibited.",
              "Ordinarily, information processed in such multisensory areas is allowed to return only to its appropriate single-sense area.",
              "But in synesthetes' brains, Grossenbacher argues, that inhibition is disrupted somehow, allowing the different senses to become jumbled.",
              "Grossenbacher believes his view is consistent with the fact that hallucinogenic drugs can temporarily induce synesthesia.",
              "\"I don't think that new connections are forming in the brains of those individuals for a few hours and then disappearing,\" he says.",
              "\"What's much more sensible is that existing connections become used in a way that's neurochemically altered for a few hours.\"",

              "Baron-Cohen agrees, \"Neuroimaging is the best thing we've got at the moment, but the spatial resolution isn't good enough to allow us to see whether the individual connections in the brain are cross-wired.\"",
              "Post-mortem examinations would allow closer inspection of what's different about synesthetes' brains, Grossenbacher and Baron-Cohen agree.",
              "But, so far, no known synesthetes have died and left their brains to science.",
              "Implications For psychologists, interest in synesthesia extends far beyond just the study of the few individuals who experience the phenomenon.",

              "\"It tells us something about the nature of perception and what makes things perceptually similar to one another.",
              "Synesthesia may help us to understand how the concept of similarity is embedded within the nervous system.\"",
              "In addition, Dixon suggests, the fact that synesthetic perception interferes with the perception of physical stimuli highlights an important aspect of cognition.",
              "\"We tend to think of our experiences, and especially the visual system, as being bottom-up,\" he remarks.",
              "\"But there are many instances where meaning goes back down and influences our lower-order perception of the world.",
              "Synesthesia is just one very rare and exceptional example of that.\"",
              "The possibility that synesthesia has genetic roots is equally tantalizing, says Grossenbacher--especially if it turns out that a single gene controls the condition, as some have speculated.",
              "\"If indeed something as central to mental life as [synesthesia] is controlled by a single gene, this might be rather a new kind of gene to know about,\" says Grossenbacher.",

              "Drug-induced synesthesia may happen at higher doses.",
              "That might indicate that a person needs treatment for an overdose of those drugs.",
              "However, the treatment can vary depending on the drug in question.",
              "Generally, the treatments for these are supportive, helping minimize other more serious symptoms such as seizures or agitation.",
              "The developmental and acquired types of synesthesia aren\u2019t preventable.",
              "The only preventable form is drug-induced synesthesia.",
              "Drugs that can cause it are illegal in many places, but there are exceptions for religious or traditional uses.",
              "Limiting your exposure to or intake of these drugs in those situations can make it less likely that you\u2019ll experience drug-induced synesthesia.",
              "Scientists and researchers have worked to describe and understand synesthesia since the 1800s, but skepticism about this was also very common.",
              "It wasn\u2019t until the 1990s that imaging technologies like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) allowed scientists to see activity in specific brain areas.",
              "Those technologies were key in confirming that synesthesia is real.",
              "But research shows synesthesia often has a learned component.",
              "Some examples of this are learning the alphabet, counting and numbers, or the names of days and months of the year.",
              "And there\u2019s evidence that synesthesia may be something people develop very early in life to help themselves learn and retain information.",
              "Research also shows you can \u201ctrain\u201d yourself to have a synesthesia-like response with practice.",
              "But the effect is temporary and can fade if you don\u2019t use it.",

              "Synesthesia isn\u2019t common, but it isn\u2019t rare, either.",
              "Experts estimate at least 4% of people worldwide experience it.",
              "However, that number may be higher because there are so many possible forms of synesthesia.",

              "Experts know that some forms of synesthesia are rare, but there\u2019s no way to know which form is rarest.",
              "A major reason for this is that many people have synesthesia and don\u2019t know what it is or think that everyone experiences it.",
              "But the available research shows that taste- and smell-based forms of synesthesia are less common, while sight-, hearing- and touch-based forms of synesthesia are more common.",

              "Julia Simner, PhD: Thanks very much for the invitation.",
              "Mills: Some of our listeners have probably heard of synesthesia, or at least the most common forms of it like people seeing colors when they hear music.",
              "But synesthesia is a lot more varied than people may realize.",
              "And you've written and tested for 128 different types.",
              "What types are out there?",
              "What are the differences and the commonalities?",
              "Simner: So it's quite hard to estimate exactly how many types of synesthesia there are because some could be quite well hidden, but the ones we know most about are the ones that people can realize most readily and report to us most easily.",
              "And I think for that reason, we tend to think of the most common types of synesthesia as being the ones that trigger unusual color perceptions.",
              "So experiencing colors when you are reading words, looking at numbers, listening to music, and then perhaps more obscurely, swimming.",
              "So different swimming strokes are causing different color perceptions.",
              "Perhaps even reading Braille, also, and watching signers in sign language, all of these are known to trigger colors.",
              "But as I said, although people talk about colors most often in the context of synesthesia, I think it may be that colors are just the easiest to report, because there are many different other synesthetic sensations.",
              "So you could experience flavors that flood the mouth.",
              "So you're reading and your mouth is being bombarded with sensations of Yorkshire pudding or processed peas or bitter lemon or nice orange fruit sweets, which is what Julia tastes of, my name Julia, or perhaps less pleasant tastes, so the taste of ear wax or other things that you wouldn't want in your mouth, maybe vomit and so on.",
              "So that's also another type of synesthesia we know about.",
              "But to answer your question, there are many different kinds of synesthesia.",
              "They can trigger colors, tastes, smells, textures, bodily feelings, and the compulsion even to put your body into certain shapes or formations.",
              "So I remember a very rare case from many years ago of a professor who had an urge to form shapes with his body in response to different words that he heard.",
              "So many types.",
              "Mills: You said your name has a flavor.",
              "Is that universal or\u2014how does your name have a flavor?",
              "Simner: Yeah, that's a good point.",
              "So what I described to you, and I think he wouldn't mind me mentioning this at all.",
              "What I described to you was the taste of the name Julia, as experienced by synesthete, James Wannerton.",
              "James Wannerton is a particularly special and important synesthete.",
              "For me, not only have I studied James for the last 20 years, but James has been an amazing advocate for the synesthesia community.",
              "He is the president of the UK Synesthesia Association, and he has taken part in so much outreach himself to help people to understand the condition.",
              "And for James, the name Julia tastes of orange fruit sweets.",
              "It's actually a branded fruit sweet.",
              "Yeah.",
              "And the interesting thing is most people call me Jools Simner.",
              "They use my nickname Jools.",
              "But with James, we don't do that because Jools does not taste as nice as Julia.",
              "Jools has a bit of an unpleasant taste.",
              "James politely tells me it tastes of porridge.",
              "I think it may actually taste of drool or saliva because we know that there are links between the word that triggers synesthesia and the type of taste experienced.",
              "And from my 20 years of research, I rather suspect that Jools tastes of drool, which is why we use the name Julia.",
              "Mills: So do people with music and color synesthesia actually see colors in the world around them when they hear music, or is it more like just something in their mind's eye?",
              "Simner: So the answer to that depends on the synesthete you're speaking to, because there are several different ways that synesthetes can experience their colors.",
              "So this was captured quite nicely by our colleagues, Mike Dixon and Daniel Smilek and their team in Canada.",
              "They were able to name projector synesthetes versus associator synesthetes.",
              "So associator synesthetes experienced their colors somewhere in the mind's eye like a kind of strong internal mental imagery.",
              "Projector synesthetes will see their colors projected out in the outside world.",
              "So a couple of examples, if you have colored letters and numbers and are a projector synesthete, you may see those colors superimposed onto the text that you're reading, or, I'm sure he wouldn't mind me describing, or as described to me by synesthesia scientist Julian Asher, those colors can be projected out there in the world floating in space.",
              "So Julian Asher is a geneticist who helped us to understand the genetics of synesthesia.",
              "And he told me that when he was a young boy, his parents would take him to the symphony and he assumed that the house lights dimmed so that people could see the colors better.",
              "Because for him, the orchestra has colors floating above it.",
              "And he actually thought, \"Why else would anybody dim the house lights apart from to see the synesthetic colors better?\"",
              "Mills: That's amazing.",
              "Simner: So in your mind or in the outside world.",
              "Yeah.",
              "And sometimes experience in unusual ways.",
              "I remember a student of mine from 20 years ago who experienced pain as colors.",
              "And for her, the colors were a cone that projected from her head in color.",
              "And if she thought very hard about the shape of the cone, she could moderate the pain of the headache.",
              "Mills: How common is synesthesia and what's the prevalence in the population.",
              "Do we know?",
              "Simner: Well, yes.",
              "So this is something I've spent quite a lot of the last 20 years looking into.",
              "Our first estimates for commonness were based on asking synesthetes to come forward.",
              "So there was a very nice study by Simon Baron-Cohen and his colleagues in 1996.",
              "And they placed an advert in the newspaper in Cambridge, U.",
              "K.",
              ", and it describes synesthesia and it asks synesthetes to come forward.",
              "And he found that the prevalence of synesthesia was one in 2000 from that study.",
              "Now, of course, unfortunately, and of course, they knew this, they would be radically underestimating because they were relying on synesthetes to buy the newspaper that day, to read the article, to come forward, which are lots of things that filter out people through that process.",
              "So in 2000, and in the early 2000s, my colleague, Jamie Ward and I decided to, instead of relying on synesthetes to come forward, we started to go out into the general population.",
              "We would gather large groups of people together and screen every single one of them.",
              "And this gave us a sort of better estimate really of the prevalence of synesthesia.",
              "And since then, I've individually screened almost 20,000 people for synesthesia.",
              "And from that, we have a quite a good idea that synesthesia is at least 4.",
              "4% in the population.",
              "So at least 1 in 23 people have synesthesia.",
              "In that study, we were looking at around 140 different types of synesthesia, but we had missed out some quite crucial types.",
              "So we also know independently that around 10% of people see time or numbers or letters mapped out in space.",
              "Now that would add another sort of 10% to that figure that I gave earlier.",
              "We also know that at least 1 to 2% of the population have personalities for letters, numbers, days of the week, months of the year.",
              "So we would have to add that on as well.",
              "But it does really come down to what you think synesthesia is.",
              "If you think these numbers are getting quite high, they are.",
              "But you might want to question whether the numbers mapped out in space, whether the time mapped out in space is a synesthesia, because 10% of the population experiencing that makes us start to question, \"Well, is this really synesthesia at all?\"",
              "But a very simple answer is at least 4% of the population.",
              "Now that's an interesting prevalence because that feels small, 4.",
              "4% feels small, but it's actually equivalent to the entire population of the United States in the world.",
              "So if you were to gather all synesthetes together, that would be 307 million synesthetes worldwide, which is somewhat approximating the USA population.",
              "So it's a rare condition, but not insignificant.",
              "Mills: Do you know is it more common in men or women or is it equally distributed?",
              "Simner: See, that's a very nice question again, because it speaks to methodologies.",
              "So this early study of prevalence conducted by placing an advert in the newspaper and asking synesthetes to come forward, gave the very, very strong impression that it was a female trait, because I think something like eight times as many female synesthetes were found as males.",
              "So it put across the message that synesthesia was a female trait, and that stayed with us for about a decade.",
              "However, it turns out that that was a trick of the methodology, a confound in the methodology, because in fact, we know from many other studies that women with unusual conditions are simply more likely to come forward.",
              "So what we actually have is a condition which is balanced across the senses.",
              "When you go out and screen people through a large population, you find the same number of male and female synesthetes.",
              "But when you ask them to come forward, the men hold back and the women reach out to scientists.",
              "Mills: I mentioned in the introduction that in the past couple of decades, scientists have begun using brain scans to understand what's happening in the brains of people with synesthesia.",
              "What have they found?",
              "Do the brains of people with synesthesia look different or function differently from the brains of people who don't have it?",
              "Simner: Yeah.",
              "I think brain imaging in synesthesia has been the most important scientific step forward in 200 years.",
              "I remember giving synesthesia lectures and synesthesia talks before the advent of these brain imaging findings.",
              "And I would spend the entire talk trying to persuade people that synesthesia was real.",
              "Now, somewhere around 2005, we got a sudden proliferation of imaging studies.",
              "And that was wonderful because now when I give synesthesia talks, the first thing I do is show the brain of a synesthete in an fMRI image, for example, and the brain of a control.",
              "And they're so very different that I no longer have to struggle to persuade people on genuineness.",
              "So what do they show?",
              "These brain imaging studies show very nicely that the brains of synesthetes are different to those of people without synesthesia.",
              "They're different in their functionality.",
              "So in fMRI, we can see that color selective regions or regions close to color areas in the visual cortex will light up in response to reading black and white numbers for synesthetes, when obviously for controls, those same regions would only light up if they were exposed to color in the real world.",
              "And also some very nice data from our Dutch colleagues have shown that synesthetes have different structural qualities in their brain, so differences in their white matter coherence in different parts of the brain.",
              "So greater white matter connectivity near color selective regions, for example.",
              "Also, other interesting differences, differences in frontal areas, differences in parietal areas that might be linked to a greater binding.",
              "So binding is where we bring together different features of the world.",
              "So for example, if I look at a green apple, the greenness is in one part of my brain, the shape of the apple is in another part of my brain.",
              "The binding region helps to bring those pieces of information together.",
              "And synesthetes have differences in parietal areas that deal with binding, almost as if they're over-binding features.",
              "They're not only binding the colors of apples to the shapes of apples, they're binding the colors of apples to letters and numbers and music and so on.",
              "So yeah, brain imaging has really revolutionized what we do.",
              "Mills: So do researchers like you have any theories as to why synesthesia develops, and is it hereditary?",
              "Is there a cause or you're just born with it?",
              "Simner: So on the question of inheritance, it does seem to be genetically endowed in some way, rather than\u2014well, for a start, we do know, first of all, that it passes down through families.",
              "So a study back in 2005 with my colleague, Jamie Ward, showed that if you have synesthesia in the family, you're much more likely to have it sort of\u2014you're more likely to have it popping up through generations than\u2014much more likely than you expect from chance alone.",
              "So it's passing through families.",
              "Now, of course it could be learned.",
              "It could be parents teaching children, but we know that's not the case for several reasons.",
              "First of all, parents and children are likely to have very different kinds of synesthesia.",
              "So what's being passed on is a predisposition for synesthesia, but you might have a parent with colored letters whose son has tasty words.",
              "And so that suggests it's not being taught through the generations.",
              "And quite often for that reason, families are not aware that they have so much synesthesia going on.",
              "So if I'm a person with colored letters, why would I suddenly ask my child, \"What's the taste of Tuesday?\"",
              "It wouldn't happen.",
              "So quite often, you get these families with multiple variants appearing and then there are more direct genetics findings.",
              "So I mentioned earlier, Julian Asher did some pioneering research with Simon Baron-Cohen on the genetics.",
              "More recently, the Max Planck Institute in Nijmegen has got a fantastic genetics project going on, screening hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, hopefully thousands and thousands of synesthetes and finding hotspots on chromosomes that are suggestive of synesthesia.",
              "Unfortunately, it's not a clean picture.",
              "Sometimes in the genetics, it's quite easy to point to genes.",
              "What we're finding is that different families and different variants of synesthesia seem to have different genetic profiles.",
              "So it hasn't been a very easy task or a very clean picture, but we have got these areas on the genome that are hotspots, if you like, for certain kinds of synesthesia in certain families.",
              "Mills: If a person with synesthesia experiences trauma such as a blow to the head, or even a very high fever, is that something that could make the synesthesia disappear and conversely, if you didn't have it, but then you experienced the blow to the head, could it trigger synesthesia?",
              "Or is that just an off the wall question?",
              "Simner: Actually, I think both those things are true.",
              "There are rare cases of acquired synesthesia after trauma.",
              "There are also cases of synesthesia disappearing under certain circumstances.",
              "Now, it's not very well studied because obviously, we can't replicate this very well in the lab and nor would we want to, because I wouldn't be the person to take away a synesthete's synesthesia, but there are cases.",
              "There's anecdotal reports.",
              "There's some really reliable anecdotal reports.",
              "So there is a case of a very prominent synesthete who very sadly experienced the Japanese earthquake and felt for some time afterwards that his synesthesia was deadened and that was quite troubling thing for him to deal with.",
              "Luckily, it's come back.",
              "I've had also synesthetes contacting me, asking me about medication.",
              "They're on a medication and suddenly their synesthesia is attenuated.",
              "When we give large surveys to synesthetes and ask them for self-reports, sometimes reports of caffeine making differences, but it's very hard for us to pin this down in the lab.",
              "So quite often, you'll find these reports in case study journals, which are really useful.",
              "Mills: So one thing that you've written about that I found surprising was that people are not always reliable reporters of whether they have synesthesia.",
              "Some people with it don't realize they have it.",
              "Some nonsynesthetes will say that they do.",
              "Why is that?",
              "And how do you test to determine whether someone actually has synesthesia?",
              "Simner: So the first time I came across this, I was really surprised by quite how inaccurate self-report is in synesthesia.",
              "Let me answer this by telling you how we verify synesthesia first of all.",
              "So we have a very nice test for synesthesia that seems robust and has been used since 1989, early 90s.",
              "Again, this was a very nice test that Simon Baron-Cohen was able to pioneer.",
              "So we test synesthetes by looking for a trait called consistency over time.",
              "So what we do is we ask synesthetes to tell us their associations.",
              "And in fact, we do this in more sophisticated ways.",
              "So for example, we have tests that show the letters and numbers in a random order.",
              "Every time a grapheme appears, the synesthete is required to choose the specific synesthetic color from a really fine grain color palette that has 16 million colors.",
              "So an A will appear, the synesthete will choose the exact shade of red.",
              "A seven will appear, the synesthete will choose their exact shade of green and so on.",
              "And once they get to the end of the test, we surprise synesthetes and we'll repeat it.",
              "So they do the whole thing over and over again.",
              "And they can do this anything from twice to maybe three times.",
              "And what we have at the end is each letter or number with the colors given to it over time by the same synesthete.",
              "And then we can use a technique that allows us to look at color distances.",
              "So when I ask you for the color of A the first time, and the second time, I plot those colors in space, I say, \"How close are they in space?\"",
              "Now, if you are consistent, those colors will be very close in color space.",
              "You'll have said the same shade of red twice.",
              "If you ask a control, they'll be inventing it, making it up, very inconsistent, very large distances in color space.",
              "So we can quantify the consistency of a synesthete in terms of this is in color space, and this shows us that synesthetes are very, very, very consistent.",
              "You're not going to fool them.",
              "If you say, \"What color is seven?\"",
              "they're always going to tell you exactly the same shade of, I don't know, subtle lime green.",
              "They're going to be spot on, and controls are going to be inconsistent.",
              "And so we have a threshold of consistency, synesthetes have to be above the threshold in order to be validated as a synesthete.",
              "So when we run these tests, we usually start by saying, \"First of all, this is synesthesia.",
              "Have you got synesthesia?\"",
              "And you would think that everybody who says yes goes on to be consistent and everybody who says no goes on to be inconsistent.",
              "But actually, what we find is that for every true, consistent synesthete who says they have synesthesia, there are five nonsynesthetes saying they have synesthesia, and the reasons are actually not too surprising.",
              "There's a tiny bit of social desirability.",
              "It's quite nice to say you have something interesting.",
              "But actually, there are lots of artists who say they have synesthesia because what they have is a really fine grain appreciation for color.",
              "And that's quite easy to confuse.",
              "So lots of the nonsynesthetes reporting synesthesia are artists, some of them are just sort of\u2014some of them are just mistaken.",
              "Some of them are just not concentrating, but all in all, if I ever now review papers on synesthesia where there's no consistency testing, it's dead in the water because you don't know you have synesthetes.",
              "Mills: So you were talking about artists and creative types.",
              "Is it more likely that a person who is creative and is an artist would have synesthesia?",
              "Is there actually some association?",
              "Simner: Sure.",
              "Yes.",
              "There seems to be.",
              "So, first of all, if you look within creative disciplines, you're more likely to find synesthetes.",
              "Now that makes it difficult because artists are more likely to inaccurately say they have synesthesia, but there's still more synesthesia among artistic people.",
              "So you have to really use these careful tests, but yes, you find synesthetes more likely to go into artistic professions and those professions are tied to their synesthesia, so more musicians with colored music synesthesia, for example.",
              "We can also find evidence of higher creativity with lab tests.",
              "So for example, a test of creativity that's quite well known is the Remote Associates Test.",
              "And in that test, you're given three words such as\u2014you're given three words and you have to provide the fourth word that links them all.",
              "Okay.",
              "And I have to think carefully about this.",
              "So I don't reveal the linking word, but an example might be boot.",
              "This is tough.",
              "Boot, ground, summer.",
              "Okay.",
              "Now those three words are linked by one other word and the other word is camp.",
              "So boot camp, summer camp, camp ground.",
              "And this is a test of creativity and synesthetes perform very well in this test.",
              "We also have evidence that this creativity is starting quite early.",
              "So we have recently finished a large ERC funded project.",
              "So European Research Council funded us to look at synesthesia in children for five years.",
              "And we can even see those creativity traits emerging early in children.",
              "So when we find children with synesthesia from the general population, so we're not relying on people to come forward.",
              "We've screened thousands of children.",
              "We've found the synesthetes among them.",
              "And we look at their personality, and the children don't really realize they're special.",
              "Their parents don't know that their children have synesthesia, but everybody concurs that these synesthetes are higher in the trait of openness to experiences, which is linked to intellectual curiosity, but also creativity.",
              "So children themselves feel that they're more creative in their personalities.",
              "Their parents feel they have more creative personalities.",
              "And we can see this really a young age, from the age of around\u2014I think the children we tested were between six and 10.",
              "And we can see these effects emerging if not by six, then by seven or eight.",
              "So yes, creative population.",
              "Mills: You've done research that's found that even though most people do not have synesthesia, they do have cross sensory experiences or associations.",
              "For example, associating higher pitched tones with brighter colors.",
              "Can you tell us about that research and how it relates to synesthesia?",
              "Simner: Sure.",
              "This is always an area of research that can really play with my head because we look at many different sensory domains and we look at how they cross over in many different ways.",
              "So I'm going to think carefully.",
              "So the one that you just described is actually a great finding by among other people, my colleague, Jamie Ward.",
              "He has shown that people will systematically associate the pitch of music with colors in several ways.",
              "So for example, higher pitch.",
              "So imagine a test where I play you sounds, and I ask you to choose colors and you feel like you're randomly picking because I play you a high pitched sound or a low pitched sound, a stringed instrument, a piano.",
              "And I just asked you to pick colors and you're willing to do this task, although you suspend disbelief because you think you're going to be random.",
              "And actually, people are very, very consistent.",
              "Higher pitched sound maps to more luminant colors.",
              "So imagine a piano.",
              "Imagine I'm on a piano and I'm tinkling on the high notes and I'm crashing on the low notes.",
              "And I say to you, \"Which one of those is pale yellow?\"",
              "And you are much more likely to say that the pale yellow is the higher pitched note and maybe deep dark purple is the low pitched note.",
              "So there's that association, but there are many, many, many of these associations.",
              "So we have shown that if you give people an identical sweetie, an identical candy, and it either has a rough surface or a smooth surface, they will think that the candy is more sour with the rough surface, even though it has the identical ingredients.",
              "And here's something quite fun.",
              "We have recently been looking at the same phenomenon in dogs.",
              "So research in collaboration with my colleague, David Reby, and our student, Anna Korzeniowska, who's leading this research.",
              "We have taken domestic dogs into the lab and we show them different objects.",
              "So they're either objects of a different size or they're elevated differently in space.",
              "And we play sounds and we train the dogs in advance to go to the object that's making a sound.",
              "And what we find is that they're much more likely to target the small object when the sound is high pitched and the large object when the sound is low pitched.",
              "And similarly, when the sound is high pitched, they look up to an object up in space and when the sound is low pitched, they look down to an object on the ground.",
              "So this shows associations between on the one hand, sound, and on the other hand, the visual property of size or the visual property of elevation in space.",
              "And that's some really exciting work that's been really fun to conduct.",
              "Mills: Wow, that's amazing.",
              "So let me change gears a little bit, because in addition to synesthesia, you study a variety of other brain and sensory differences.",
              "For example, as I said earlier, misophonia which is an extreme aversion to specific sounds, and aphantasia, which is the inability to picture things in your mind's eye.",
              "These seem like really disparate concepts, but how do they tie together?",
              "Simner: That's such a good question because\u2014 Mills: Or do they?",
              "Simner: Yeah.",
              "That's a really good question because I found myself working in synesthesia for a couple of decades and then being introduced to other sensory differences, finding them fascinating, berating myself for not having focus, for effectively coming away from synesthesia and then finding out over time that these different conditions are tied by kind of invisible thread.",
              "So all of them are sensory differences and they all share certain traits in common.",
              "For example, in terms of well-being, so we find that people with these sensory differences, even synesthesia that's sometimes considered a gift, can have impairments in their well-being, can have problems in their well-being.",
              "So for example, in synesthesia, we found that people with synesthesia, with verified synesthesia, are significantly more likely to experience anxiety disorder than other people.",
              "And we were really surprised about this.",
              "We weren't looking at particularly troubling variants.",
              "We were looking at colored letters and numbers, higher rates of anxiety disorder.",
              "We've just finished a similar study in child synesthetes and 30% of our child synesthetes under 10 qualify for sort of the category of anxiety disorder, which is really high, usually in children its around\u2014In our controls, we found it at around less than 10, synesthetes at 30%.",
              "Mills: Wow.",
              "Simner: And similarly, in these other disciplines, similarly in these other sensory differences.",
              "So misophonia itself is almost defined by difficulties in well-being.",
              "So misophonia can give rise to great anxiety as well as\u2014so misophonia is an extreme hatred of certain sounds.",
              "And those sounds tend to be bodily sounds like coughing or chewing or crunching or swallowing.",
              "And it can really give rise to these incredible differences in well-being, anxiety, rage, uncontrollable feelings really that we know are also linked to brain structure.",
              "And what we found in children as young as 10 is that children that we've been able to recognize as having misophonia showing serious differences in their well-being, again, elevated anxiety as you might expect, but also poor quality of life, poorer satisfaction in life.",
              "And then there's also the link with autistic like traits.",
              "So the more we look at these sensory differences, the more we see parallels with and overlaps with autism.",
              "Now it's not the case that having synesthesia means you're autistic, but it does mean that you're elevated on tests of autism in certain areas.",
              "So in misophonia, for example, you're significantly more likely to be diagnosed or recognized as having autism than the average person.",
              "In synesthesia, you're elevated on the traits of attention to detail.",
              "In synesthesia, you're elevated on the autistic trait of attention to detail and in misophonia and in aphantasia, you're elevated in the autistic traits of social difficulties and imagination.",
              "And so, yes, there's this overlap of autistic traits.",
              "There's this overlap with well-being, poorer well-being.",
              "So the more I look at many different sensory conditions, the more I'm convinced that they all really fit together in a kind of coherent whole.",
              "Mills: Well, here's one I'll throw at you.",
              "So we had a guest a few months back, did an episode on face blindness.",
              "And one of the people is someone I know who has been diagnosed with face blindness and she recently also learned that she has aphantasia.",
              "Have you looked at those connections?",
              "Simner: We have.",
              "We have and we are actually.",
              "So I think in self-report, people with aphantasia report being poorer at faces on average and a very nice study we're conducting here at Sussex led by my PhD student, Carla Dance in collaboration with my colleague Graham Hole, who's a witness recognition, the face recognition expert.",
              "They're able to give identikits to people with aphantasia.",
              "And they'll show you a face and then we also want to reconstruct the face using these identikits and then we give the reconstructed face to a group of controls and ask them \"How similar is this reconstructed face with the original?\"",
              "And we do that once for our people with aphantasia and once for controls and we're in the middle of doing that study right now, and we can see trends in the direction that we'd expect, but we need to finish that study to find out exactly whether it's significant.",
              "But it does look at the moment as if it's trending in the direction of what we would expect, which is poorer face recall for people with aphantasia.",
              "Although I need to add something.",
              "This is only typical of the average aphantasic.",
              "Okay.",
              "So what we actually find is a real spread, and it's quite interesting because I have aphantasia myself, but I'm almost a super recognizer.",
              "So when I perform tests of face recognition, I'm almost good enough to work for the police.",
              "How am I doing that?",
              "How am I doing that?",
              "I have no mental imagery, but I just know very\u2014I'm just able to pick out a face in the crowd very well.",
              "So there you go.",
              "It's a spread, but the average person is less good than controls.",
              "Mills: So I was just wondering if particularly misophonia and aphantasia are debilitating to the people who have these syndromes and is it possible to help someone learn to diminish, say an aversion to sounds or to teach people how to see things in their mind's eye?",
              "Simner: Yeah, definitely.",
              "And I think that is definitely happening a lot more for misophonia.",
              "So misophonia is defined as a kind of almost chronic condition.",
              "And misophonia is also really a topic of focus for clinicians.",
              "A lot of clinicians are trying to find out exactly how we can fix this problem.",
              "There are some long-term clinical treatment options.",
              "Cognitive behavioral therapy has been tried, a tinnitus retraining therapy, a counterconditioning therapy.",
              "They aim to reconceptualize the individual's relationship with sound or they re-pair unpleasant sounds with more pleasant responses.",
              "Some approaches combined therapy with gentle exposure.",
              "It's still quite a young science.",
              "It's still quite a young science.",
              "There isn't really an outstanding treatment that's emerging above all others.",
              "We're just trying\u2014clinicians are just trying different options at the moment, but nothing\u2014some of them are effective, but not across the board.",
              "Aphantasia is an interesting one.",
              "People aren't really trying to improve imagery at the moment in aphantasics.",
              "I know personally, I found out I had aphantasia around 10 years ago, just having an interesting chat with a colleague about synesthetes.",
              "And I said to him, \"These synesthetes are reporting that they can see pictures in their mind's eye.",
              "So if I say pig, they literally see an image of a pig.\"",
              "And I was speaking to my colleague Bob Logie, who said, \"Well, that's what everybody does, isn't it?\"",
              "And I said, \"No, you don't understand.",
              "They see a picture in their mind.\"",
              "He said, \"Yeah, that's what everybody does.\"",
              "So from that moment 10 years ago, I have tried\u2014personally speaking, I've tried to construct images.",
              "I haven't had a great deal of success to be honest, although that's an N of one, so who knows?",
              "So maybe we might try it, but really, the difference between aphantasia and misophonia is that people with aphantasia were getting on fine.",
              "They're just getting on fine with their life.",
              "They really have no idea they're different.",

              "Citation numbers are available from Dimensions Synesthesia is a fairly common condition in which individuals experience atypical responses (such as color experiences) in association with certain types of stimuli (such as non-colored letters).",
              "Although synesthesia has been described for centuries, only very recently has there been an explosive growth of systematic scientific examinations of this condition.",
              "In this article, we review and critically evaluate current methods for both assessing synesthesia and examining its psychological basis, including the \u201ctest-retest\u201d procedure, online battery assessments, and behavioral experiments.",
              "We highlight the limitations of these methods for understanding the nature of this complex condition and propose potential solutions to address some of these limitations.",
              "We also provide a set of markers that aid in distinguishing synesthesia from other closely related psychological phenomena.",
              "Synesthesia is a condition in which individuals experience atypical responses to certain types of stimuli, in addition to the typical responses elicited by those stimuli.",
              "For example, a synesthete may perceive tastes when seeing certain shapes or might perceive colors when seeing achromatic letters.",
              "Synesthesia comes in many forms, covering a wide range of sensory interactions both cross-modally and within a single modality1.",
              "Over the years, a variety of research programs have emerged to better understand this condition.",
              "Some research on synesthesia is focused on determining how and why synesthetic associations are developed or acquired, and the patterns, if any, that govern them (Watson et al.",
              ", 2010, 2012;",
              "Witthoft and Winawer, 2013).",
              "Other research has been devoted to determining the nature and characteristic features of synesthetic associations, raising questions, for example, regarding the types of stimuli that can trigger synesthetic responses (Ramachandran et al.",
              ", 2002).",
              "But perhaps the most pressing questions pertaining to synesthetic associations concern their psychological kind.",
              "Are they genuinely perceptual, as many claim?",
              "In other words, are synesthetic responses the outputs of sensory modalities, exhibiting features that correspond to the sensory qualities of stimuli such as color, shape, and sound?",
              "Or are they purely cognitive responses?",
              "Are they mnemonic associations?",
              "Or are they some combination thereof?",
              "While significant steps forward have been taken in synesthesia research in the past couple of decades, there is still further to go when it comes to establishing conclusive answers to these questions using objective measures.",
              "Some of the biggest strides are being made using neuroimaging techniques that are helping to reveal the neural basis of synesthesia.",
              "While we think these techniques are particularly promising for understanding synesthesia, in this short review, we focus instead on surveying and critically evaluating popular behavioral strategies for assessing and understanding synesthesia.",
              "We highlight the limitations of these strategies when it comes to both accurately assessing cases of synesthesia and examining the nature of the responses involved, and we propose potential solutions to some of these limitations along the way.",
              "In order to assess or diagnose a psychological condition, one must, of course, know what to look for.",
              "Although much about synesthesia is still unknown, and novel forms and varieties of the condition may manifest themselves, it will nonetheless be useful to highlight some characteristics of synesthesia that serve to distinguish it from other perceptual phenomena, such as visual imagery and certain forms of imagistic memory.",
              "There are three such characteristic features: (1) automaticity, (2) reliability, and (3) consistency2.",
              "First, there is ample evidence that synesthetic associations are automatic in nature (Lupia\u0301n\u0303ez and Callejas, 2006;",
              "Jarick et al.",
              ", 2011).",
              "They are typically produced outside the intentional control of the individual and cannot be directly inhibited.",
              "The automaticity of synesthesia helps to distinguish it from paradigm cases of mental imagery.",
              "While hearing a certain sound may lead one to imagine certain scenes or colors, for example, such visual imagery is typically under a significant degree of intentional control.",
              "One can usually start or stop imagining something at will.",
              "This is not to deny that synesthetic responses have qualities\u2014for example, shapes and colors\u2014that are similar to or even the same as those exhibited by mental imagery.",
              "However, synesthetic responses are, at the very least, distinguishable from mental imagery in virtue of their automaticity.",
              "Second, it is typically the case that synesthetes reliably experience synesthetic responses when presented with triggering stimuli.",
              "When synesthetes come into perceptual contact with the triggering stimulus, their responses will be induced.",
              "These responses are not transient or inconsistent, though they may sometimes be when induced neuropharmacologically, for example, by psychoactive, hallucinogenic substances3.",
              "Indeed, synesthesia is often present from early childhood onwards (Cytowic, 2002).",
              "This helps to distinguish the condition from ordinary associations grounded in memory.",
              "One sometimes has vivid mnemonic imagery associated with specific smells or sounds, for example, and these memories may sometimes even arise automatically.",
              "But it is uncommon for these to be reliably generated and persistent throughout an individual's life in the way that synesthetic responses are reported to be.",
              "Finally, although there is variability across synesthetes, synesthetic associations within an individual appear to remain relatively consistent over time in that the same types of stimuli (e.",
              "g., specific auditory tones) tend to elicit the same types of synesthetic responses (e.",
              "g., specific colors)4,5 (Dixon et al.",
              ", 2000).",
              "This feature, too, helps to distinguish synesthetic associations from ordinary mental imagery, which displays more flexible associations.",
              "But as (Simner 2012) argues, consistency may not be central to synesthesia in the way that many have supposed.",
              "The problem is that many of the tests used to assess synesthesia, as we will see, treat consistency as the main measure of synesthetic association.",
              "As a result, the synesthetes who are examined in the psychological literature are all those that exhibit consistency in their associations.",
              "This bias may have created an inflated sense of how common this characteristic really is among synesthetic associations, to the point where it has become a defining feature of the condition.",
              "We therefore restrict ourselves to the following claim: when consistency is present, this provides evidence in favor of the relevant association being a synesthetic one.",
              "However, when consistency is absent, this is not evidence against the relevant association being a synesthetic one.",
              "Given that assessment strategies are used as diagnostic tools for establishing whether a given individual is a synesthete, it is important that they are able to establish that certain reported associations exhibit each of these characteristics and perhaps others that remain to be identified.",
              "One of the more widely accepted measures for determining whether one has synesthesia is the test-retest procedure, known as the \u201ctest of genuineness\u201d (TOG) among synesthesia researchers.",
              "The TOG is considered by some to be the \u201cgold standard\u201d of synesthesia assessment.",
              "In this procedure, synesthetes are asked to indicate, either through verbal report or color swatch matching, the character of their synesthetic responses to certain stimuli, and then they are retested\u2014often without warning\u2014as much as a year or more later (Baron-Cohen et al.",
              ", 1987;",
              "Cytowic, 2002;",
              "Asher et al.",
              ", 2006).",
              "The rationale is that if a person has synesthesia, their consistency of responses at the retest phase will be significantly higher than those without synesthesia, who are told to simply assign associations to the same set of stimuli.",
              "For example, Baron-Cohen et al.",
              "(1993) found that 92.",
              "3% of the reported synesthetes they tested gave consistent responses when they were retested one year later without warning, whereas this was true of only 37.",
              "6% of control subjects who were tested one week later with warning.",
              "This finding, and others like it, are made all the more impressive by the fact that synesthetic responses are often very precise, for example, sometimes with highly specific hues and shades in grapheme-color synesthesia (Eagleman et al.",
              ", 2007).",
              "In cases where there is a high consistency of responses, therefore, it is likely the result of a stable association.",
              "The TOG can therefore provide strong evidence that reported associations possess one of the common characteristics of synesthesia.",
              "If one fails the TOG, however, in line with our earlier caveats, this alone is not evidence against a reported association being a synesthetic one, since it may simply be that the association is not consistent.",
              "The TOG faces a number of shortcomings.",
              "Response consistencies over time do not by themselves indicate whether the associations in question are automatic, or whether they are instead, in some cases, being conjured up at will.",
              "Moreover, they do not by themselves establish the reliability of the associations, as typically only two instances of each association are observed\u2014once in the testing phase and then again in the retest phase.",
              "In addition, this procedure provides no evidence as to whether the associations are cognitive, perceptual, mnemonic, or some combination of these.",
              "It might be that some individuals who are classified as having grapheme-color synesthesia may simply have better or stronger memories overall, as it has been reported in at least one case study (Smilek et al.",
              ", 2002;",
              "see also Tammet, 2009, p.",

              ", 2011).",
              "They may thus have robust mnemonic associations of certain colors with certain letters or numbers, though these enhanced memory effects may be modest in size (see Yaro and Ward, 2007;",
              "Rothen et al.",
              ", 2012)6.",
              "When taking the TOG, some individuals may simply be voluntarily associating in memory rather than automatically perceiving the color red with the letter \u201cA,\u201d just as one may recall his or her grandmother's face when smelling freshly baked chocolate chip cookies.",
              "These associations, which may in some other cases be automatic, could have been learned early on in childhood, such as through television, books, toys, or refrigerator magnets (see Witthoft and Winawer, 2006, 2013) (Figure 1).",
              "Though voluntarily associating with superior memory is unlikely to account for all cases in which consistency is displayed, our point here is that it may be operative in enough cases that the reliability of the TOG is diminished.",
              "Figure 1.",
              "Letter-color associations may have been acquired early on in development through common associations between letters and colors, as illustrated in these toys.",
              "We propose that this issue may possibly be addressed by adding to the TOG a further test and retest using stimuli that are not claimed by self-reported synesthetes to yield synesthetic associations, such as stimuli from a sensory modality that does not produce synesthetic responses.",
              "For example, a grapheme-color synesthete could be tested with auditory stimuli.",
              "The results of this test-retest for non-synesthetic associations could then be compared with those involving the reportedly synesthetic associations.",
              "This would control for the role that superior memory may play in generating the consistent results within each individual.",
              "We also note some complications regarding the role of memory in synesthetic associations.",
              "We may distinguish among three types of sensory associations: (1) associations between a stimulus and a response that are generated by willful perceptual imagery (whether mnemonically based or not), (2) associations between a stimulus and a response that are generated by automatic perceptual imagery that are also mnemonically based, and (3) associations between a stimulus and a response that are generated by automatic perceptual imagery, but that are not mnemonically based.",
              "We are inclined not to view the first kind of association as synesthetic, since it is not automatic in character.",
              "We take the third kind of association to be very similar to, if not the same, as non-imagery based synesthetic associations.",
              "There is a question, however, about whether the second type of association is properly understood as synesthetic association, involving as it does an indirect pathway between the stimulus and response\u2014going through mnemonic systems and then back to perceptual systems, rather than directly through perceptual systems. We leave this question open for future theorizing.",
              "Given the subjective nature of the responses generated by synesthesia, especially problematic are online assessments or batteries for this condition (e.",
              "g., Eagleman et al.",
              ", 2007).",
              "In these assessments, individuals are given a battery of tests aiming to capture any synesthetic responses the online test takers may possess.",
              "These assessments suffer from two main flaws.",
              "The first is a problem for online assessments or batteries more generally, which is that the way in which one responds on such batteries cannot be directly monitored.",
              "Thus, subjects may use inappropriate strategies, may take the battery on several occasions (see Birnbaum, 2004), may not respond consistently just to get through the assessment faster, or may use notes or visual aids to produce their consistent responses.",
              "They may also use other cues, such as spatial ones to indicate a \u201cperceived\u201d color on a color bar or wheel that might increase accuracy and consistency in their responses.",
              "For example, if a color bar always has the same colors in the same order from the top to the bottom of a monitor, as in some synesthesia batteries, subjects may use position on the bar relative to the monitor, as well as other potential screen landmarks, to increase their precision7.",
              "The inability to verify whether subjects are responding appropriately to the assessment, while a general problem with online tests, is especially problematic in the case of assessing synesthesia, where there are already difficulties in classifying the condition, and in determining how to carry these assessments out so as to capture its main subjective features.",
              "In addition, there is a bias present in such assessments since many of those who take the test believe themselves to already have synesthesia8.",
              "Another problem with the online battery is that, like the TOG, it cannot establish the automaticity or reliability of synesthetic associations.",
              "It is therefore not comprehensive in the way that a serious assessment of a psychological condition must be if it is to achieve reliable results.",
              "In addition, though frequency estimates of synesthesia are not commonly based solely on such measures, any that are (e.",
              "g., Novich et al.",
              ", 2011 regarding the frequency of types of synesthesia) should be interpreted cautiously.",
              "We acknowledge that there is a benefit in using online batteries in that they allow researchers to cast a much wider net than laboratory studies and to thereby collect data on a larger pool of individuals.",
              "But we propose that, in order for the larger set of data to guide research appropriately, these tests be used in tandem with laboratory studies to validate the results collected online.",
              "In this section, we explore three commonly used paradigms for examining the character of synesthetic responses.",
              "We stress some concerns with the current state of the literature, and offer some potential remedies.",
              "Early attempts to explore the nature of synesthetic associations made use of a variation of the Stroop task (Stroop, 1935;",
              "MacLeod, 1991), in which color naming responses are substantially delayed for words that spell out incompatible colors (e.",
              "g., naming the color red when the word \u201cGREEN\u201d is printed or displayed in red).",
              "In this variation, synesthetes are presented with graphemes that are written in a color that is either congruent or incongruent with the synesthetic colors that they report associating with these graphemes.",
              "So, for example, if a synesthete reports associating the letter \u201cA\u201d with the color red, she would be presented with a red \u201cA\u201d in the congruent condition, and an \u201cA\u201d in some other color in the incongruent condition.",
              "The subjects are then asked to name aloud the color of the grapheme.",
              "Synesthetes tend to respond more slowly on incongruent trials than on congruent trials compared with controls, for whom no effect on reaction times is found (Dixon et al.",
              ", 2000;",
              "Mattingley et al.",
              ", 2001;",
              "Lupia\u0301n\u0303ez and Callejas, 2006).",
              "The Stroop task is a valuable tool for establishing the automaticity of synesthetic associations.",
              "The slower reaction times on the incongruent trials are interpreted as an inability to inhibit the interfering synesthetic response\u2014and this is a key characteristic of automatic association.",
              "As this is not something that the TOG or online battery tests probe, we propose that a more comprehensive assessment of synesthesia may combine these tests with a Stroop-like test, so that the automatic dimension of the condition may be examined.",
              "In general, a successful assessment strategy for synesthesia may need to combine multiple tests in order to get a clearer profile of the condition within any given individual.",
              "But, as others have noted (e.",
              "g., Hubbard et al.",
              ", 2005;",
              "Gheri et al.",
              ", 2008), these results do not help to establish that synesthetic responses are perceptual in nature since the interference could be due to purely cognitive rather than perceptual processes.",
              "Indeed, Elias et al.",
              "(2003) used this variant of the Stroop paradigm to compare the performance of a grapheme-color synesthete and a control who was trained on semantic color-number associations using a set of specific cross-stitch knitting patterns over a period of 8 years.",
              "For example, the number 5 might indicate that one should use red thread, and would thereby be strongly associated with the color red.",
              "They found that both the synesthete and the semantically trained subject were slower to name colors of numbers that were incongruent with their specific associations, suggesting that interference in this Stroop paradigm need not be perceptual in nature.",
              "Colizoli et al.",
              "(2012) similarly found Stroop interference effects in a training study using non-synesthetes.",
              "In light of these results, the Stroop paradigm, like the test-retest procedure, may be inappropriate for objectively establishing the perceptual character of synesthesia, at least when used in isolation.",
              "There are two obstacles to this conclusion, however.",
              "The first is that other training studies using non-synesthetes have not found interference effects post-training (Rothen et al.",
              ", 2011;",
              "Kusnir and Thut, 2012), so further research is needed in order to determine whether interference in the Stroop paradigm can be the result of learned, non-perceptual associations.",
              "Second, the magnitude of the interference found in studies with trained non-synesthetes may be smaller than that found for synesthetes in the Stroop task, though direct comparisons between studies is difficult because of the different stimuli and scales that were used (see also Elias et al.",
              ", 2003, in which the trained non-synesthete displayed more interference on one of the tasks).",
              "This suggests a more subtle difference between synesthetic automaticity and that of non-synesthetic associations.",
              "Using neuroimaging along with the Stroop task will help to establish both the perceptual nature of synesthesia, if perceptual regions of the brain such as color areas are activated, as well as the automaticity of these effects, given that the Stroop task is a reliable measure of this feature.",
              "Another popular paradigm used to understand synesthetic associations explores the relationship between synesthesia and attention.",
              "In a visual search task, one is presented with an array of stimuli and asked to respond to the presence or absence of a \u201ctarget\u201d stimulus that differs from the other \u201cdistractor\u201d stimuli on the basis of some visual feature, such as color, orientation, or shape.",
              "When the target stimulus differs from the distractor stimuli with respect to just one of these features, it tends to grab attention, regardless of the number of distractors.",
              "One commonly offered explanation for this is that individual features of stimuli are processed automatically and in parallel by different parts of the visual system before they are bound together by attention, and thus seem to \u201cpop-out\u201d from the feature search visual array (Treisman and Gelade, 1980).",
              "Applying this to synesthesia, the rationale is that if a synesthetic color exhibits this pop-out effect during a visual search task on which the target differs from distractors on the basis of a unique feature, then it must be processed preattentively in the same way that veridical colors are in such tasks.",
              "To test this hypothesis, Ramachandran and Hubbard (2001) conducted a pioneering study, where they briefly presented two projector synesthetes and forty controls with arrays of achromatic graphemes, where one group of graphemes formed an embedded shape (square, rectangle, triangle, or diamond).",
              "For example, the array might consist of a triangle of 2 s amongst background filled with 5s.",
              "The particular graphemes used to form the embedded shape were predicted to trigger synesthetic colors for the two synesthetes.",
              "Participants in the experiment were asked to identify the embedded shape.",
              "The two synesthetes were significantly better than controls at successfully identifying the embedded shape from a set of four options, presumably because the graphemes induced colors that popped out from the background.",
              "However, other studies seeking to replicate this result have not all been successful, and some with even larger samples of synesthetes (see Table 1).",
              "Table 1.",
              "A summary of studies testing the performance of synesthetes using visual search tasks.",
              "Studies using a more traditional visual search paradigm, in which participants are not asked to identify an embedded shape, but rather to locate a single target stimulus among distractors, have come up with mixed results.",
              "For example, Palmeri et al.",
              "(2002) found that the synesthete WO, who associates a specific color with the digit \u201c2,\u201d was both significantly faster than the controls at spotting a target \u201c2\u201d among a set of \u201c5\u201d s and showed a significantly smaller effect of set size on search time.",
              "Laeng et al.",
              "(2004) also found superior performance in one synesthete using the same task.",
              "However, others have not arrived at the same findings (see Table 1).",
              "Until these contradictory results across studies can be sorted out, the general conclusion that synesthetes outperform controls on visual search tasks, either the embedded figure variant or the single target version, is not warranted.",
              "A further concern is that it is not clear that the superior performance of synesthetes, in cases where it is indeed present, is due to synesthetic responses preattentively generating the pop-out effect.",
              "Ward et al.",
              "(2010) examined this very assumption.",
              "They conducted a study with 36 synesthetes, using Ramachandran and Hubbard's embedded-figure task, but this time including an assessment of the synesthetes' self-reports during the experiment.",
              "They found that, although synesthetes did tend to outperform the controls, most synesthetes reported that they did not experience synesthetic responses across the entire array during the task.",
