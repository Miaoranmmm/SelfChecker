              "The Time Machine - Wikipedia",
              "The Time Machine is a post-apocalyptic science fiction novella by H.",
              "G.",
              "Wells, published in 1895.",
              "The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle or device to travel purposely and selectively forward or backward through time.",
              "The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle or device.",
              "[1] Utilizing a frame story set in then-present Victorian England, Wells' text focuses on a recount of the otherwise anonymous Time Traveller's journey into the far future.",
              "A work of future history and speculative evolution, Time Machine is interpreted in modern times as a commentary on the increasing inequality and class divisions of Wells' era, which he projects as giving rise to two separate human species: the fair, childlike Eloi, and the savage, simian Morlocks, distant descendants of the contemporary upper and lower classes respectively.",
              "[2][3] It is believed that Wells' depiction of the Eloi as a race living in plenitude and abandon was inspired by the utopic romance novel News from Nowhere (1890), though Wells' universe in the novel is notably more savage and brutal.",
              "[4] In his 1931 preface to the book, Wells wrote that The Time Machine seemed \"a very undergraduate performance to its now mature writer, as he looks over it once more\", though he states that \"the writer feels no remorse for this youthful effort\".",
              "However, critics have praised the novella's handling of its thematic concerns, with Marina Warner writing that the book was the most significant contribution to understanding fragments of desire[clarify] before Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams, with the novel \"[conveying] how close he felt to the melancholy seeker after a door that he once opened on to a luminous vision and could never find again\".",
              "[5] The Time Machine has been adapted into two feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions and many comic book adaptations.",
              "It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media productions.",
              "Wells had considered the notion of time travel before, in a short story titled \"The Chronic Argonauts\" (1888).",
              "This work, published in his college newspaper, was the foundation for The Time Machine.",
              "He frequently stated that he had thought of using some of this material in a series of articles in the Pall Mall Gazette, but in response to a request by W.",
              "E.",
              "Henley, the editor of National Observer, he rewrote \"The Chronic Argonauts\" into a series of seven loosely connected and fictionalized essays which were anonymously published in the newspaper from 17 March to 23 June 1894.",
              "[6][7] The series was never completed as Henley stepped down from his role as editor in National Observer.",
              "With his encouragement, Wells continued to work on the story, and at the end of the year when Henley was given the position as editor of Heinemann's periodical The New Review, he arranged for the story to be published there in serialized form in the January to May 1895 editions instead, which Wells was paid \u00a3100 (equal to about \u00a312,000 today) for.",
              "[8][9][10] Henry Holt and Company published the first book edition (possibly prepared from a different manuscript)[11] on 7 May 1895;",
              "Heinemann published an English edition on 29 May.",
              "[8] These two editions are different textually and are commonly referred to as the \"Holt text\" and \"Heinemann text\", respectively.",
              "Nearly all modern reprints reproduce the Heinemann text.",
              "[12] The story reflects Wells's own socialist political views, his view on life and abundance, and the contemporary angst about industrial relations.",
              "It is also influenced by Ray Lankester's theories about social degeneration[13] and shares many elements with Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel Vril, the Power of the Coming Race (1871).",
              "[14] It is also thought that Wells' Eloi race shares many features with the works of other English socialists, most notably William Morris and his work News from Nowhere (1890), in which money is depicted as irrelevant and work is merely undertaken as a form of pleasure.",
              "[4] Other science fiction works of the period, including Edward Bellamy's novel Looking Backward: 2000\u20131887 (1888) and the later film Metropolis (1927), dealt with similar themes.",
              "[citation needed] In his later reassessment of the book, published as the 1931 preface to The Time Machine, Wells wrote that the text seemed to him \"a very undergraduate performance to its now mature writer, as he looks over it once more\", though he also claims that \"the writer feels no remorse for this youthful effort\".",
              "His preface also notes that the text has \"lasted as long as the diamond-framed safety bicycle, which came in at about the date of its first publication\", and is \"assured it will outlive him\", attesting to the power of the book.",
              "[5] Based on Wells's personal experiences and childhood, the working class literally spent a lot of their time underground.",
              "His own family would spend most of their time in a dark basement kitchen when not being occupied in their father's shop.",
              "[15] Later, his own mother would work as a housekeeper in a house with tunnels below,[16] where the staff and servants lived in underground quarters.",
              "[17] A medical journal published in 1905 would focus on these living quarters for servants in poorly ventilated dark basements.",
              "[18] In his early teens, Wells became a draper's apprentice, having to work in a basement for hours on end.",
              "This work is an early example of the Dying Earth subgenre.",
              "The portion of the novella that sees the Time Traveller in a distant future where the sun is huge and red also places The Time Machine within the realm of eschatology;",
              "that is, the study of the end times, the end of the world, and the ultimate destiny of humankind.",
              "[citation needed][19] Holt, Rinehart & Winston re-published the book in 2000, paired with The War of the Worlds, and commissioned Michael Koelsch to illustrate a new cover art.",
              "[20] A Victorian English scientist and gentleman inventor, identified by a narrator simply as the Time Traveller, lives in Richmond, Surrey.",
              "He explains to his weekly dinner guests that time is a fourth dimension and demonstrates a tabletop model machine for travelling through it.",
              "He reveals he has built a machine capable of carrying a person through time.",
              "At dinner the following week, a weary, bedraggled Traveller stumbles into the room and recounts to his guests what he has experienced on his journey to the future.",
              "In the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device.",
              "At first, he thinks nothing has happened but soon finds out he went five hours into the future.",
              "He continues forward and sees his house disappear and turn into a lush garden.",
              "The Traveller stops in A.",
              "D.",
              "802,701, where he meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike humanoids.",
              "They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings and adhere to a fruit-based diet.",
              "His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline.",
              "They appear happy and carefree but fear the dark, particularly moonless nights.",
              "They give no response to mysterious nocturnal disappearances, possibly because the mere thought of it frightens them.",
              "After exploring the area around the Eloi's residences, the Traveller reaches the top of a hill overlooking what was once London and finds only the ruins of what had once been an impressive metropolis.",
              "He concludes that the entire planet has become a garden, with little trace of human society or engineering from the hundreds of thousands of years prior, and that communism[21] has at last been achieved.",
              "He also theorizes that intelligence springs from necessity;",
              "with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.",
              "Returning to the site where he arrived, the Traveller is shocked to find his machine missing;",
              "it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure, resembling a sphinx, with heavy doors locked from the inside.",
              "Luckily, the machine cannot travel through time without its levers, which he had removed before leaving it.",
              "Later, he encounters the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night.",
              "Deducing that this second race must have taken his time Machine, he explores one of many \"wells\" that lead to the Morlocks' dwellings, where he discovers them operating the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise of the Eloi possible.",
              "He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has diverged into two species: the favored aristocracy has become the intellectually degraded Eloi, and their mechanical servants have become the brutal, light-fearing Morlocks.",
              "Before narrowly escaping the tunnels, the Traveller also observes the \"underworlders\" eating a strange meat, which he cannot at first identify.",
              "He later comes to the horrific realization that the Morlocks raise the Eloi like cattle and then use them as a food supply.",
              "Meanwhile, he rescues an Eloi named Weena from drowning, as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and with time, they develop an affectionate relationship.",
              "He takes Weena with him on an expedition to \"The Palace of Green Porcelain\", a distant structure which turns out to be a derelict museum.",
              "Here, the Traveller finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to recover his machine.",
              "He plans to take Weena back to his own time.",
              "Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest for the night.",
              "They are eventually attacked by Morlocks, and Weena faints.",
              "The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to repel the Morlocks turns into a forest fire;",
              "Weena and the Morlocks are lost in the blaze, and the Traveller is devastated over his loss.",
              "The Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not understanding that he can use it to escape.",
              "He reattaches the levers before travelling further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time.",
              "There, he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: reddish, crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies, in a world covered in simple lichenoid vegetation.",
              "He continues to make jumps forward through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.",
              "Overwhelmed, he returns to his own time, arriving at the laboratory just three hours after he originally left.",
              "He arrives late to his own dinner party, whereupon, after eating, the Traveller relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his pocket.",
              "The original narrator relates that he returned to the Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey and promising to return in a short time.",
              "After waiting for three years, however, the Narrator states that the Traveller has not returned from his journey.",
              "A section from the thirteenth chapter of the serial published in New Review (May 1895, partway down p.",

              "[23][24][25] It was drafted at the suggestion of Wells's editor, William Ernest Henley, who wanted Wells to \"oblige your editor\" by lengthening the text with, among other things, an illustration of \"the ultimate degeneracy\" of humanity.",

              "G.",
              "Wells, published in 1895.",
              "The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle or device to travel purposely and selectively forward or backward through time.",
              "The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle or device.",
              "[1] Utilizing a frame story set in then-present Victorian England, Wells' text focuses on a recount of the otherwise anonymous Time Traveller's journey into the far future.",
              "A work of future history and speculative evolution, Time Machine is interpreted in modern times as a commentary on the increasing inequality and class divisions of Wells' era, which he projects as giving rise to two separate human species: the fair, childlike Eloi, and the savage, simian Morlocks, distant descendants of the contemporary upper and lower classes respectively.",
              "[2][3] It is believed that Wells' depiction of the Eloi as a race living in plenitude and abandon was inspired by the utopic romance novel News from Nowhere (1890), though Wells' universe in the novel is notably more savage and brutal.",
              "[4] In his 1931 preface to the book, Wells wrote that The Time Machine seemed \"a very undergraduate performance to its now mature writer, as he looks over it once more\", though he states that \"the writer feels no remorse for this youthful effort\".",
              "However, critics have praised the novella's handling of its thematic concerns, with Marina Warner writing that the book was the most significant contribution to understanding fragments of desire[clarify] before Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams, with the novel \"[conveying] how close he felt to the melancholy seeker after a door that he once opened on to a luminous vision and could never find again\".",
              "[5] The Time Machine has been adapted into two feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions and many comic book adaptations.",
              "It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media productions.",
              "Wells had considered the notion of time travel before, in a short story titled \"The Chronic Argonauts\" (1888).",
              "This work, published in his college newspaper, was the foundation for The Time Machine.",
              "He frequently stated that he had thought of using some of this material in a series of articles in the Pall Mall Gazette, but in response to a request by W.",
              "E.",
              "Henley, the editor of National Observer, he rewrote \"The Chronic Argonauts\" into a series of seven loosely connected and fictionalized essays which were anonymously published in the newspaper from 17 March to 23 June 1894.",
              "[6][7] The series was never completed as Henley stepped down from his role as editor in National Observer.",
              "With his encouragement, Wells continued to work on the story, and at the end of the year when Henley was given the position as editor of Heinemann's periodical The New Review, he arranged for the story to be published there in serialized form in the January to May 1895 editions instead, which Wells was paid \u00a3100 (equal to about \u00a312,000 today) for.",
              "[8][9][10] Henry Holt and Company published the first book edition (possibly prepared from a different manuscript)[11] on 7 May 1895;",

              "[8] These two editions are different textually and are commonly referred to as the \"Holt text\" and \"Heinemann text\", respectively.",
              "Nearly all modern reprints reproduce the Heinemann text.",
              "[12] The story reflects Wells's own socialist political views, his view on life and abundance, and the contemporary angst about industrial relations.",
              "It is also influenced by Ray Lankester's theories about social degeneration[13] and shares many elements with Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel Vril, the Power of the Coming Race (1871).",
              "[14] It is also thought that Wells' Eloi race shares many features with the works of other English socialists, most notably William Morris and his work News from Nowhere (1890), in which money is depicted as irrelevant and work is merely undertaken as a form of pleasure.",
              "[4] Other science fiction works of the period, including Edward Bellamy's novel Looking Backward: 2000\u20131887 (1888) and the later film Metropolis (1927), dealt with similar themes.",
              "[citation needed] In his later reassessment of the book, published as the 1931 preface to The Time Machine, Wells wrote that the text seemed to him \"a very undergraduate performance to its now mature writer, as he looks over it once more\", though he also claims that \"the writer feels no remorse for this youthful effort\".",
              "His preface also notes that the text has \"lasted as long as the diamond-framed safety bicycle, which came in at about the date of its first publication\", and is \"assured it will outlive him\", attesting to the power of the book.",
              "[5] Based on Wells's personal experiences and childhood, the working class literally spent a lot of their time underground.",
              "His own family would spend most of their time in a dark basement kitchen when not being occupied in their father's shop.",

              "He later comes to the horrific realization that the Morlocks raise the Eloi like cattle and then use them as a food supply.",
              "Meanwhile, he rescues an Eloi named Weena from drowning, as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and with time, they develop an affectionate relationship.",
              "He takes Weena with him on an expedition to \"The Palace of Green Porcelain\", a distant structure which turns out to be a derelict museum.",

              "He reattaches the levers before travelling further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time.",
              "There, he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: reddish, crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies, in a world covered in simple lichenoid vegetation.",

              "[25] Time travel to the past is theoretically possible in certain general relativity spacetime geometries that permit traveling faster than the speed of light, such as cosmic strings, traversable wormholes, and Alcubierre drives.",
              "[26][27]: 33\u2013130 The theory of general relativity does suggest a scientific basis for the possibility of backward time travel in certain unusual scenarios, although arguments from semiclassical gravity suggest that when quantum effects are incorporated into general relativity, these loopholes may be closed.",
              "[28] These semiclassical arguments led Stephen Hawking to formulate the chronology protection conjecture, suggesting that the fundamental laws of nature prevent time travel,[29] but physicists cannot come to a definite judgment on the issue without a theory of quantum gravity to join quantum mechanics and general relativity into a completely unified theory.",

              "some point in the causal future of the world line is also in its causal past, a situation that can be described as time travel.",
              "Such a solution was first proposed by Kurt Go\u0308del, a solution known as the Go\u0308del metric, but his (and others') solution requires the universe to have physical characteristics that it does not appear to have,[23]: 499 such as rotation and lack of Hubble expansion.",
              "Whether general relativity forbids closed time-like curves for all realistic conditions is still being researched.",
              "[32] Wormholes are a hypothetical warped spacetime permitted by the Einstein field equations of general relativity.",
              "[33]: 100 A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced propulsion system, and then brought back to the point of origin.",
              "Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance.",
              "For both these methods, time dilation causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become \"younger\", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer;",
              "however, time connects differently through the wormhole than outside it, so that synchronized clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.",
              "[23]: 502 This means that an observer entering the \"younger\" end would exit the \"older\" end at a time when it was the same age as the \"younger\" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside.",
              "One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine;",
              "[23]: 503 in essence, it is more of a path through time than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.",
              "According to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as \"exotic matter\".",
              "More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various energy conditions, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions.",
              "However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition,[33]: 101 and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the Casimir effect in quantum physics.",
              "[34] Although early calculations suggested that a very large amount of negative energy would be required, later calculations showed that the amount of negative energy can be made arbitrarily small.",
              "[35] In 1993, Matt Visser argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other.",
              "[36] Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for causality violation to take place.",
              "However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex \"Roman ring\" (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.",
              "[37] Another approach involves a dense spinning cylinder usually referred to as a Tipler cylinder, a GR solution discovered by Willem Jacob van Stockum[38] in 1936 and Kornel Lanczos[39] in 1924, but not recognized as allowing closed timelike curves[40]: 21 until an analysis by Frank Tipler[41] in 1974.",
              "If a cylinder is infinitely long and spins fast enough about its long axis, then a spaceship flying around the cylinder on a spiral path could travel back in time (or forward, depending on the direction of its spiral).",
              "However, the density and speed required is so great that ordinary matter is not strong enough to construct it.",
              "A similar device might be built from a cosmic string, but none are known to exist, and it does not seem to be possible to create a new cosmic string.",
              "Physicist Ronald Mallett is attempting to recreate the conditions of a rotating black hole with ring lasers, in order to bend spacetime and allow for time travel.",
              "[42] A more fundamental objection to time travel schemes based on rotating cylinders or cosmic strings has been put forward by Stephen Hawking, who proved a theorem showing that according to general relativity it is impossible to build a time machine of a special type (a \"time machine with the compactly generated Cauchy horizon\") in a region where the weak energy condition is satisfied, meaning that the region contains no matter with negative energy density (exotic matter).",
              "Solutions such as Tipler's assume cylinders of infinite length, which are easier to analyze mathematically, and although Tipler suggested that a finite cylinder might produce closed timelike curves if the rotation rate were fast enough,[40]: 169 he did not prove this.",
              "But Hawking points out that because of his theorem, \"it can't be done with positive energy density everywhere!",
              "I can prove that to build a finite time machine, you need negative energy.\"",
              "[31]: 96 This result comes from Hawking's 1992 paper on the chronology protection conjecture, where he examines \"the case that the causality violations appear in a finite region of spacetime without curvature singularities\" and proves that \"there will be a Cauchy horizon that is compactly generated and that in general contains one or more closed null geodesics which will be incomplete.",
              "One can define geometrical quantities that measure the Lorentz boost and area increase on going round these closed null geodesics.",
              "If the causality violation developed from a noncompact initial surface, the averaged weak energy condition must be violated on the Cauchy horizon.\"",
              "[29] This theorem does not rule out the possibility of time travel by means of time machines with the non-compactly generated Cauchy horizons (such as the Deutsch-Politzer time machine) or in regions which contain exotic matter, which would be used for traversable wormholes or the Alcubierre drive and black hole.",
              "When a signal is sent from one location and received at another location, then as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or slower, the mathematics of simultaneity in the theory of relativity show that all reference frames agree that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event.",
              "When the signal travels faster than light, it is received before it is sent, in all reference frames.",
              "[43] The signal could be said to have moved backward in time.",
              "This hypothetical scenario is sometimes referred to as a tachyonic antitelephone.",
              "[44] Quantum-mechanical phenomena such as quantum teleportation, the EPR paradox, or quantum entanglement might appear to create a mechanism that allows for faster-than-light (FTL) communication or time travel, and in fact some interpretations of quantum mechanics such as the Bohm interpretation presume that some information is being exchanged between particles instantaneously in order to maintain correlations between particles.",
              "[45] This effect was referred to as \"spooky action at a distance\" by Einstein.",
              "Nevertheless, the fact that causality is preserved in quantum mechanics is a rigorous result in modern quantum field theories, and therefore modern theories do not allow for time travel or FTL communication.",
              "In any specific instance where FTL has been claimed, more detailed analysis has proven that to get a signal, some form of classical communication must also be used.",
              "[46] The no-communication theorem also gives a general proof that quantum entanglement cannot be used to transmit information faster than classical signals.",
              "A variation of Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics provides a resolution to the grandfather paradox that involves the time traveler arriving in a different universe than the one they came from;",
              "it's been argued that since the traveler arrives in a different universe's history and not their own history, this is not \"genuine\" time travel.",

              "Postcolonial and queer theorists, in particular, celebrate anachronism as a visible site of dislocation that calls what counts as timely and what constitutes history into question.",
              "Footnote 1 Espousing what Bliss Cua Lim calls \u201ctemporal critique,\u201d postcolonial theorists show that the homogenous, empty time upon which Western history depends relegates non-Western people and practices to a previous historical moment.",
              "Footnote 2 In turn, queer theorists question the \u201cstraight time\u201d of history\u2014the way linear time reinforces heteronormative patterns of development and depends upon reproductive futurity.",
              "Footnote 3 For both fields, embracing anachronism becomes a way to rethink contemporaneity as untimely coexistence and to claim lived relationships to the past that dominant forms of historicism obscure.",
              "While several Victorianist scholars have theorized the productive potential of anachronisms, many scholars still associate Victorians with uniform, shared time that understands untimely irruptions as chronological mistakes.",
              "Footnote 4 Victorians, the story goes, sought to organize time, integrate social difference, manage anachronisms. Take, for instance, Dipesh Chakrabarty, who turns to John Stuart Mill to explain the forms of European historicism that he critiques.",
              "For Chakrabarty, Mill's sense of a shared developmental path\u2014a universal but uneven pattern of development\u2014\u201cconsigned Indians, Africans, and other \u2018rude\u2019 nations to an imaginary waiting room of history.",
              "\u201dFootnote 5 Mill's shared time, according to Chakrabarty, becomes a way to measure supposed cultural backwardness.",
              "In turn, Lee Edelman draws on Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol and George Eliot's Silas Marner to show reproductive futurism's integrative force.",
              "According to Edelman, these Victorian texts assimilate queer figures like Ebenezer Scrooge and Silas Marner into communal forms through temporality.",
              "Their narratives replace Scrooge and Marner's anti-social pleasure in and from the past\u2014what Edelman calls \u201cthe closed economy of the backward gaze\u201d\u2014with the normative social structure of futurity.",
              "Footnote 6 Chakrabarty and Edelman suggest, in quite different ways, that Victorian writers integrate social difference into shared time in order to prevent the unruly possibilities of untimely orientations, to close down alternative ways of being in the world.",
              "But although the Victorian period was a time of temporal and historical standardization, it was also a time of anachronism.",
              "In fact, one of the first stories of time travel, \u201cAn Anachronism, or Missing One's Coach\u201d (1838), suggests that anachronism conceives of temporality as a mode of relation that encourages social and historical difference rather than a sequential order that disciplines and ultimately integrates this difference.",
              "\u201cAn Anachronism\u201d is a story about radical historical discontinuity.",
              "The narrative follows an antiquarian whose unease with the present leads him to seek comfort in reflecting on the forgotten past and speculating about the unknown future.",
              "He misses his coach, travels back in time, and meets the venerable Bede, who asks him to describe the future (the antiquarian's present).",
              "Although the antiquarian greets Bede's \u201cwell-known and smiling face\u201d with familiarity and recognition, the story reveals that they do not even share a language.",
              "Footnote 7 Bede has never heard of Leeds, does not understand what \u201cprinted\u201d means, and fails to grasp the nineteenth-century man's irony.",
              "Footnote 8 More importantly, Bede cannot understand what the modern man means by \u201cimprovement.",
              "\u201dFootnote 9As the modern man describes the discovery of new continents, the expansion of the British empire, and the growing triumph of reason, he concludes that selfishness, ignorance, and poverty have actually increased.",
              "Over the course of their difficult conversation, the venerable Bede confronts a future that fills him with both wonder and horror.",
              "Because their conversation defamiliarizes assumptions about history and progress, it also raises questions about the \u201canachronism\u201d that the story's title refers to.",
              "Does the antiquarian become an anachronism when he travels back to the \u201cwildness of another age?",
              "\u201dFootnote 10 Or, is he an anachronism from the outset because he finds comfort in \u201cretrospective or anticipative\u201d thought but resents the intrusion of the present?",
              "Footnote 11 Or is the venerable Bede the anachronism insofar as he appears in what was previously an 1837 landscape but cannot understand the stories of the present?",
              "I suggest that the story's title introduces anachronism as a singular noun\u2014\u201can anachronism\u201d\u2014only to resist locating anachronism in just one person or landscape to highlight how the encounter between times unsettles assumptions about shared time and continuous development.",
              "When the nineteenth century and the eighth century collide, there is no correct chronology and no easily identifiable historical error: time is out of joint.",
