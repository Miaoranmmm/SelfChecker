    "query": "Can you explain the science behind the process of aging, and how do lifestyle choices and genetics impact the rate and quality of aging in individuals?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. Aging is a complex process that involves many factors, both genetic and environmental. According to some sources[^1^] [^4^], aging is driven by the loss of information in cells, which leads to errors in gene expression and cellular function. Some of these errors are caused by mutations in DNA, but others are caused by changes in the epigenome, which is the set of instructions that tells cells which genes to turn on or off. The epigenome can be influenced by external factors, such as diet, smoking, physical activity, and stress[^2^] [^7^].\n\nSome researchers have identified genetic variants that affect lifespan, either by increasing or decreasing the risk of certain diseases or by influencing the immune system or blood cholesterol levels[^2^]. However, these genetic factors are not deterministic, and they can be modified by lifestyle choices. For example, smoking can reduce lifespan by about 7 years, while losing 1 kilogram of weight can increase it by 2 months[^2^]. Similarly, education can have a positive impact on lifespan, possibly by enhancing cognitive function and social engagement[^2^].\n\nTherefore, aging is not a simple or inevitable outcome of our genes, but rather a dynamic and multifactorial process that can be influenced by our choices and environment. Some lifestyle factors that may promote healthy aging include staying physically active, eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, going to the doctor regularly, managing stress, and engaging in social and mental activities[^2^] [^6^].",

However, major challenges have been encountered in the performance of reproducible experiments and the extraction of meaningful data;",
              "early studies particularly in higher eukaryotes found few changes in common, and it is only with more recent meta-analyses of giant cross-sectional datasets that a consensus is starting to emerge on a set of gene expression changes that are associated with ageing.",

              "Gene expression changes can be reactive to alterations in cellular and organismal physiology, and if those alterations reproducibly occur during ageing then the responsive events form an age-associated gene expression programme;",

              "The common model organisms used by molecular biologists inhabit disparate environments and will certainly have evolved different life history strategies to deal with the interplay between longevity and fecundity, implying that such programmes will display considerable variation across organisms. Conversely, of course, this suggests that any highly conserved aspects of age-associated gene expression represent core signatures of the ageing process and general responses to it.",
              "Gene expression is not the only molecular outcome of ageing.",
              "Many pathological changes may have no associated gene expression response, and key signalling and metabolic changes act primarily at the level of translation, post-translational modifications or metabolite abundance, differences that only indirectly affect the gene expression pattern if at all.",

              "These disparities imply that ageing follows a different course in each tissue, rather than comprising a universal molecular programme in diverse tissues.",
              "An obvious confounding factor is changing cell composition;",
              "for example blood, the most routinely sampled tissue in human studies, changes dramatically with age.",
              "Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell samples from young donors are rich in nai\u0308ve T cells whereas such populations from old donors contain greater frequencies of memory T cells (reviewed in Arnold et al.",
              "2011).",
              "It is highly plausible that increased exposure to infections and other immunological challenges that naturally accompany age provide the major driver for such changes.",
              "It is also possible that processes such as homeostatic expansion have independent effects upon the ageing T cell repertoire unrelated to extrinsic antigen exposure.",
              "Either way, these pressures on blood cell population composition cause problems when trying to identify cell-intrinsic gene expression changes in T cells across organismal lifespan.",
              "Disentangling cell-intrinsic signatures of age-linked gene expression within a cell population of fluid composition therefore requires extensive cell purification, which is often impractical in the large studies required to achieve useful statistical power.",
              "Studies of smaller model organisms meet similar problems, for example, profound age-linked differences in gene expression are expected in ageing female flies because they become thinner and stop producing eggs.",
              "Although this problem can be avoided by assaying males or individual body parts such as heads, similar problems are likely to be encountered.",
              "A further complication comes from the assumed linearity of age-linked gene expression change, which is widespread and seemingly logical given the progressive nature of the ageing process.",
              "Time-course analyses in budding yeast are broadly in accord with this idea (Cruz et al.",
              "2017;",
              "Janssens et al.",
              "2015), but studies in worms and flies have revealed a significant number of genes following non-linear trajectories across the life-course including some with their apex or nadir at middle age (Lund et al.",

              "Pletcher et al.",
              "2002).",
              "More extreme conclusions have arisen in a number of human cross-sectional studies, which have reported the greatest expression variability at middle age (Gheorghe et al.",

              "2016;",
              "Remondini et al.",
              "2010), with some aged samples being more closely related to young samples.",
              "This may or may not reflect a survivor effect, in other words that the donors of old tissue never underwent the gene expression changes linked with pathology at middle age and therefore survived to old age.",
              "Such differences have the potential to be hugely informative as to the order of events and the hierarchy of cause and effect in ageing, but show that simple comparisons of young versus old, as performed in many model organism studies, probably miss important events in the gene expression landscape.",
              "The only real solution to these problems is to search for age-linked gene expression changes that are conserved across tissues and across organisms, and follow clear ageing trajectories.",
              "This requires cross species comparisons of gene expression data derived at high resolution across the life course using in vivo samples as opposed to ageing in cell culture.",
              "Recent studies have discovered consistent changes in related categories of genes across disparate datasets (see below), though these have required highly replicated sample sets at multiple time points or large cross-sectional meta-analyses to overcome confounding effects.",
              "Some very detailed meta-analyses have also directly addressed the question of whether conserved gene expression signatures can be detected across different cell types and organisms, identifying specific genes differentially expressed across datasets (de Magalhaes et al.",

              "However, it is not clear that general dietary restriction is absolutely required to gain these benefits, with recent research in Drosophila showing that calorie content is not the primary driver of ageing and that extended lifespan can be combined with normal fecundity through appropriate choice of dietary amino acid composition (Mair et al.",

              "Similar effects may well distort measurements of age-linked gene expression change in higher eukaryotic cells as ageing impacts many highly expressed housekeeping genes that make up a substantial fraction of the transcriptome.",
              "mRNA levels are determined by rate of mRNA synthesis balanced by rate of degradation and/or mRNA loss through cell division, and are therefore not a direct measure of gene expression.",
              "Furthermore, the effect of increased mRNA level is very much dependent on ribosome availability, with a limited pool of ribosomes needing to prioritise translation and providing an unequal representation in the nascent proteome of mRNA abundance.",

              "Some of the physiological alterations caused by DNA damage in turn boost genome instability, thereby amplifying the deterioration of homeostasis during ageing.",
              "The strong mechanistic link between DNA damage and ageing, and the role of DNA as the primary template for all cellular functions, suggest DNA damage as a candidate for the primary cause of ageing.",
              "However, there are at least three important arguments against this proposition.",
              "First, if DNA damage is central to the ageing process, improving DNA repair would be expected to extend lifespan\u2014however, there is little evidence for such an effect104,105,106.",
              "DNA damage comprises many distinct chemical alterations, the repair of which depends on the delicately balanced activities of at least seven core multi-enzyme pathways and many more accessory processes that encompass hundreds of genes, many of which have additional roles.",
              "Thus, the function of DNA repair in longevity cannot be generally improved by simply upregulating the activity of one or few genes.",
              "DNA repair in long-lived species has evolved over millions of years under specific selection conditions largely driven by environmental genotoxins, such as high fluxes of UV radiation or natural compounds.",
              "Moreover, as well as DNA repair, cellular systems affecting generation and outcome of DNA damage, such as metabolism, antioxidant defence, cell death, senescence and mutagenesis also have a role.",
              "Second, reliable quantification of spontaneous DNA damage in animal or human tissues is technically extremely difficult, limiting efforts to demonstrate age-related increases to levels that impair cellular function and explain age-related pathologies (Box 2).",
              "However, DNA mutations, a consequence of erroneous DNA repair, can be determined accurately and have been shown to accumulate with age in humans and mice in a tissue-specific manner42,107,108,109,110.",
              "Nevertheless, while there is no doubt that accumulating mutations cause cancer and, possibly, increased cancer risk with age, it remains unknown whether their frequency is high enough to account for the loss of tissue function and increased disease risk with age.",
              "However, as well as causing mutations, accumulating DNA damage also interferes with gene expression and replication, causing replication and transcription stress, senescence, functional decline and cell death, all major drivers of ageing (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "A third, more recent argument against DNA damage-centric theories of ageing is the small number of DNA repair genes emerging from genome-wide association studies of ageing-related diseases or extreme longevity.",
              "However, the complexity of the genetics of ageing and longevity make the discovery of genetic associations with common variants in generally underpowered studies highly unlikely.",
              "Extreme longevity is rare and individual age-related diseases often involve genes not necessarily related to systemic ageing, such as lipoprotein genes.",
              "Nevertheless, a meta-analysis of more than 400 genome-wide association studies of five major categories of age-related diseases did identify genome-maintenance pathways111, and genome maintenance was also the top pathway associated with the age of natural menopause112.",
              "Age of natural menopause is strongly linked with a wide variety of ageing pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis, as well as longevity113.",
              "These findings are consistent with the observation in both humans and mice that the vast majority of rare genetic progeroid syndromes, in which multiple, bona fide ageing-associated diseases develop early in life, are caused by mutations in DNA repair genes6 (Box 1).",
              "Thus, although they are not invalid, all three arguments against a major role of DNA damage in ageing are unconvincing in view of the sheer complexity of DNA repair processes and the abundant evidence that only DNA repair dysfunction\u2014and not defects in proteostasis, antioxidant defence, immune response or any other physiological defence system\u2014is associated with systemic premature ageing.",
              "Collectively, the evidence indicates that DNA damage is the most likely molecular driver of ageing.",
              "DNA damage and the DDR lead to broad cellular and physiological end points that can explain the entire spectrum of ageing phenotypes, from atrophy to inflammation and cancer (Fig.",
              "2).",
              "This understanding is not new: it has been known since the 1940s that rodents exposed to radiation exhibit multiple symptoms of premature ageing114, and the first proposals that DNA damage was the main driver of ageing stem from the 1960s115.",
              "More recently, the validity of these old observations have been underscored by the notion that DNA-targeting chemotherapies and radiotherapies for cancer result in long-term accelerated, multi-organ ageing7.",
              "DNA damage has probably been a primary cause of ageing since the origin of life.",
              "When DNA became the genetic material, it was already far more stable than RNA, the presumed initial carrier of genetic information.",
              "The subsequent increased length of DNA templates put a premium on faithful replication and repair, which became prerequisites for rejuvenation amid the intrinsic instability of nucleic acids even during early evolution when life was not much more than compartmentalized DNA, and well before the various homeostatic alterations of ageing had evolved.",
              "A serious challenge for linking DNA lesions to ageing has remained the methodological difficulty of accurately measuring the wide variety of chemical alterations in DNA.",
              "Key problems are the limited sensitivity and/or specificity of technologies to detect physiological levels of DNA damage and the occurrence of artefacts (such as oxidation) during DNA isolation and handling or due to interrupted DNA-metabolizing reactions (for example, topoisomerase reactions) when cells are lysed.",
              "Most lesions can only be determined in a semiquantitative or relative manner, or after exposure to unphysiologically high levels of genotoxic agents.",
              "Only some lesion types can be directly identified (but not quantified in absolute terms) through lesion-specific antibodies towards cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, (6-4) photoproducts or 8-oxo-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine structures or rough overall DSB and single-strand break assessment through the COMET assay, which has high variability.",
              "High performance liquid chromatography combined with advanced mass spectrometric methodologies can detect specific chemical alterations of nucleosides121.",
              "There are only a few examples of highly sensitive assays reporting reliable quantification of spontaneous oxidative DNA damage, most notably 8-oxo-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine and cyclopurine lesions.",
              "Cyclopurines are endogenous transcription-blocking DNA lesions that have been shown to increase from a density of 2 to 4 per Mbp in young mice to 10\u201320 per Mbp in old mice122.",
              "Damaged DNA can be detected indirectly by long-range PCR123, the decline in transcription of large genes resulting in a shift towards mRNAs of small genes in the ageing transcriptome of post-mitotic tissues43, or detection of transcription-blocking lesions by strand-biased, PCR-based next-generation sequencing of DNA protected by elongating RNA polymerases124.",
              "Specific types of DNA lesions that are amenable to either antibody binding or enzymatic modification have been mapped by high-throughput sequencing.",
              "Third-generation sequencing technologies are rapidly advancing to detect specific DNA modifications even in low amounts of DNA125.",
              "The formation of DNA repair complexes such as foci formation of \u03b3H2AX, 53BP1, Rad51 and other repair or signalling proteins at DSB sites and at sites of DNA damage-induced replication stress are also useful indicators.",
              "When erroneous repair or lesion bypass during replication results in mutations, sequencing methods can be applied to detect the altered DNA sequence in single cells.",
              "Somatic mutations increase linearly during ageing in multiple tissues and species, including humans82.",
              "However, quantitative estimates of the total landscape of spontaneous DNA damage in humans or animals are lacking.",
              "Time-dependent accumulation of DNA damage of endogenous and exogenous origin and its consequences progressively hamper cellular function and increase susceptibility to developing the chronic ailments of ageing.",
              "Interventions that aim to alleviate the root cause of ageing-associated multimorbidity should therefore be targeted at restoring genome integrity by reducing DNA damage and augmenting DNA repair.",
              "Reducing exogenous DNA damage\u2014for example, through UV protection and avoidance of tobacco smoking\u2014has already proved to lower risks of ageing-associated disease.",
              "Dietary interventions might be able to reign in some endogenous sources of DNA damage, but the majority of spontaneous lesions remain unavoidable.",
              "Augmenting DNA repair has remained a great challenge owing to the intricate complexity of the repair machineries.",
              "The highly lesion-specific photolyase repair enzymes\u2014which are active in many species but not placental mammals\u2014are exceptions.",
              "Ectopic expression of this enzyme is indeed sufficient to prevent UV-induced carcinogenesis in mice116.",
              "However, more sophisticated repair systems are needed to repair the wide range of DNA lesions that occur.",
              "Master regulators of DNA repair affecting multiple DNA repair systems have remained unknown to date, but could be discovered in future.",
              "Genetic screens using model organisms may be suitable for investigations of such mechanisms augmenting genome stability.",
              "Since the initial proposal that DNA damage was the main cause and DNA repair was the main determinant of ageing117,118, and the subsequent discovery that DNA repair defects can accelerate the development of a wide range of age-related pathologies119, great strides have been made in unravelling the mechanistic links between DNA damage and nearly every aspect of the ageing process.",

              "8 min read An international study 13 years in the making demonstrates for the first time that degradation in the way DNA is organized and regulated \u2014 known as epigenetics \u2014 can drive aging in an organism, independently of changes to the genetic code itself.",
              "The work shows that a breakdown in epigenetic information causes mice to age and that restoring the integrity of the epigenome reverses those signs of aging.",
              "Get more HMS news here Findings are published online Jan.",
              "12 in Cell.",
              "\u201cWe believe ours is the first study to show epigenetic change as a primary driver of aging in mammals,\u201d said the paper\u2019s senior author, David Sinclair, professor of genetics in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School and co-director of the Paul F.",
              "Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research.",
              "The team\u2019s extensive series of experiments provide long-awaited confirmation that DNA changes are not the only, or even the main, cause of aging.",
              "Rather, the findings show, chemical and structural changes to chromatin \u2014 the complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes \u2014 fuel aging without altering the genetic code itself.",
              "Harvard Medicine magazine in your inbox \u201cWe expect the findings will transform the way we view the process of aging and the way we approach the treatment of diseases associated with aging,\u201d said co-first author Jae-Hyun Yang, research fellow in genetics in the Sinclair lab.",
              "The authors say that because it\u2019s easier to manipulate the molecules that control epigenetic processes than to reverse DNA mutations, the work points to new avenues that focus on epigenetics rather than genetics to prevent or treat age-related damage.",
              "First, the results need to be replicated in larger mammals and in humans.",
              "Studies in nonhuman primates are currently underway.",
              "\u201cWe hope these results are seen as a turning point in our ability to control aging,\u201d said Sinclair.",
              "\u201cThis is the first study showing that we can have precise control of the biological age of a complex animal;",
              "that we can drive it forwards and backwards at will.",
              "\u201d Perhaps the most burning question for those who study aging is what causes it.",
              "For decades, a reigning theory in the field was that aging arises from an accumulation of changes to DNA, primarily genetic mutations, which over time prevent more and more genes from functioning properly.",
              "These malfunctions, in turn, cause cells to lose their identity, so that tissues and organs break down, leading to disease and, ultimately, death.",
              "In recent years, however, studies have increasingly hinted that there\u2019s more to the story.",
              "For instance, some researchers found that some people and mice with high mutation rates don\u2019t show signs of premature aging.",
              "Others observed that many types of aged cells have few or no mutations.",
              "Researchers started wondering what else works with or instead of DNA changes to cause aging.",
              "A list of possible culprits grew.",
              "Among them were epigenetic changes.",
              "A component of epigenetics is the physical structures such as histones that bundle DNA into tightly compacted chromatin and unspool portions of that DNA when needed.",
              "Genes are inaccessible when they\u2019re bundled up but available to be copied and used to produce proteins when they\u2019re unspooled.",
              "Thus, epigenetic factors regulate which genes are active or inactive in any given cell at any given time.",
              "By acting as a toggle for gene activity, these epigenetic molecules help define cell type and function.",
              "Since each cell in an organism has basically the same DNA, it\u2019s the on-off switching of particular genes that differentiates a nerve cell from a muscle cell from a lung cell.",
              "\u201cEpigenetics is like a cell\u2019s operating system, telling it how to use the same genetic material differently,\u201d said Yang, who is co-first author with Motoshi Hayano, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Sinclair lab who is now at Keio University School of Medicine in Tokyo.",
              "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Sinclair\u2019s lab and others showed in yeast and mammals that epigenetic changes accompany aging.",
              "Yet they couldn\u2019t tell whether these changes drove aging or were a consequence of it.",
              "It wasn\u2019t until the current study that Sinclair\u2019s team was able to disentangle epigenetic from genetic changes and confirm that a breakdown in epigenetic information does, in fact, contribute to aging in mice.",
              "The team\u2019s main experiment involved creating temporary, fast-healing cuts in the DNA of lab mice.",
              "These breaks mimicked the low-grade, ongoing breaks in chromosomes that mammalian cells experience every day in response to things like breathing, exposure to sunlight and cosmic rays, and contact with certain chemicals.",
              "In the study, to test whether aging results from this process, the researchers sped the number of breaks to simulate life on fast-forward.",
              "The team also ensured that most of the breaks were not made within the coding regions of the mice\u2019s DNA \u2014 the segments that make up genes.",
              "This prevented the animals\u2019 genes from developing mutations.",
              "Instead, the breaks altered the way DNA is folded.",
              "Sinclair and colleagues called their system ICE, short for inducible changes to the epigenome.",
              "At first, epigenetic factors paused their normal job of regulating genes and moved to the DNA breaks to coordinate repairs.",
              "Afterward, the factors returned to their original locations.",
              "But as time passed, things changed.",
              "The researchers noticed that these factors got \u201cdistracted\u201d and did not return home after repairing breaks.",
              "The epigenome grew disorganized and began to lose its original information.",
              "Chromatin got condensed and unspooled in the wrong patterns, a hallmark of epigenetic malfunction.",
              "As the mice lost their youthful epigenetic function, they began to look and act old.",
              "The researchers saw a rise in biomarkers that indicate aging.",
              "Cells lost their identities as, for example, muscle or skin cells.",
              "Tissue function faltered.",
              "Organs failed.",
              "The team used a recent tool developed by Sinclair\u2019s lab to measure how old the mice were, not chronologically, in days or months, but \u201cbiologically,\u201d based on how many sites across the genome lost the methyl groups normally attached to them.",
              "Compared to untreated mice born at the same time, the ICE mice had aged significantly more.",
              "Next, the researchers gave the mice a gene therapy that reversed the epigenetic changes they\u2019d caused.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s like rebooting a malfunctioning computer,\u201d said Sinclair.",
              "The therapy delivered a trio of genes \u2014 Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, together named OSK \u2014 that are active in stem cells and can help rewind mature cells to an earlier state.",
              "(Sinclair\u2019s lab used this cocktail to restore sight in blind mice in 2020.)",
              "The ICE mice\u2019s organs and tissues resumed a youthful state.",
              "The therapy \u201cset in motion an epigenetic program that led cells to restore the epigenetic information they had when they were young,\u201d said Sinclair.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s a permanent reset.",
              "\u201d How exactly OSK treatment achieved that remains unclear.",
              "At this stage, Sinclair says the discovery supports the hypothesis that mammalian cells maintain a kind of backup copy of epigenetic software that, when accessed, can allow an aged, epigenetically scrambled cell to reboot into a youthful, healthy state.",
              "For now, the extensive experiments led the team to conclude that \u201cby manipulating the epigenome, aging can be driven forwards and backwards,\u201d said Yang.",
              "The ICE method offers researchers a new way to explore the role of epigenetics in aging and other biological processes.",
              "Because signs of aging developed in the ICE mice after only six months rather than toward the end of the average mouse life span of two and a half years, the approach also saves time and money for researchers studying aging.",
              "Researchers can also look beyond OSK gene therapy in exploring how lost epigenetic information might be restored in aged organisms. \u201cThere are other ways to manipulate the epigenome, like drugs and small molecule chemicals that induce gentle stress,\u201d said Yang.",
              "\u201cThis work opens a door for applying those other methods to rejuvenate cells and tissues.",
              "\u201d Sinclair hopes the work inspires other scientists to study how to control aging to prevent and eliminate age-related diseases and conditions in humans, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, neurodegeneration, and frailty.",
              "\u201cThese are all manifestations of aging that we\u2019ve been trying to treat with medicines when they arise, which is almost too late,\u201d he said.",
              "The goal would be to address the root causes of aging to extend human health span: the number of years that a person remains not just alive but well.",
              "Medical applications are a long way off and will take extensive experiments in multiple cell and animal models.",
              "But, Sinclair said, scientists should think big and keep trying in order to achieve such dreams. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about taking someone who\u2019s old or sick and making their whole body or a specific organ young again, so the disease goes away,\u201d he said.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s a big idea.",
              "It\u2019s not how we typically do medicine.",
              "\u201d The study marks the culmination of 10 years of Yang\u2019s career as a postdoctoral researcher.",
              "But there were moments along the way when he thought he\u2019d never see the work completed.",
              "As the scope expanded year after year, with colleagues and critics urging Yang to add more experiments and incorporate new technologies, the project often felt overwhelming.",
              "Yang sometimes listened to those who asked whether it was all worth it.",
              "At one point he drafted an email to Sinclair saying he wanted to quit the project.",
              "\u201cLuckily,\u201d said Sinclair, \u201che didn\u2019t send it.",
              "\u201d The problem wasn\u2019t Yang\u2019s skills or dedication.",
              "Rather, the work was the most ambitious ever attempted in the lab.",
              "Sinclair thinks it may represent one of the hardest projects undertaken in science in recent years.",
              "\u201cYou don\u2019t get many chances in life to do a project like this,\u201d he said.",
              "\u201cIt took an incredible amount of mental and physical labor to get to this point.",
              "Jae and the team demonstrated so much resilience as we got rejected and re-reviewed and did six more years of experiments until we ended up with a body of work that answers one of the most important questions in biology.",
              "I\u2019m really proud of the team.",
              "\u201d Seeing the findings published at long last not only offers professional satisfaction but also feels poignant on a personal level, Sinclair said.",
              "\u201cThis project began when I was 39.",
              "I\u2019m now 53,\u201d he said.",

              "During embryonic development, environmental conditions can be modulated by two different principal factors: the lifestyle of the mother, which necessarily implies embryo exposures, and the anatomical/phenotypic circumstances of the mother, such as size of the uterus and placenta.",
              "It is a period where nutrient supply and chemical exposure have a critical influence on the epigenome [88] and any resulting epigenetic dysregulation could lead to disease development during adult life.",

              "The identification of aberrant methylation in genes such as Cip1/p21 and p16 INK4a [182], genes of the cadherin and laminin families [183], and the inactivation of the RB1/p16 and p53 pathways in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [184], as well as other studies, supports the notion that important epigenetic changes are mediated by chronic sun or UV radiation exposure.",
              "These and other findings have allowed the identification of genes with aberrant methylation that could be used as molecular markers which are commonly perturbed in malignant skin lesions (10) [185\u2013187], and the development of new therapies to reverse those epigenetic changes associated with UV radiation.",
              "In addition to the clinical chemopreventive agents which exist for blocking the aberrant methylation or histone deacetylation caused in many tumorigenesis processes, there are also other natural compounds found in a variety of different foods which have a photoprotector effect.",

              "The methyl donor suppliers can affect the epigenome in a global manner and also in a locus-specific way [87, 191], and lack of folic acid nutritional supplement contributes to the induction of cancer in animal models of disease [192].",
              "The best example is the influence of maternal diet on the murine Agouti gene (Avy).",
              "This gene is responsible for determining if mouse coat color is banded (Agouti) or solid (non-Agouti) and is regulated by the DNA methylation status of the intracisternal A-particle (IAP) retrotransposon located in the promoter region of the Agouti gene [193, 194].",
              "When it is methylated, a mouse's coat has a normal appearance (solid color), but when the retrotransposon is unmethylated, the coat is banded or yellow and the mouse will have an increased risk of cancer and diabetes.",

              "Another representative example showing the effects of nutrition comes from a study in Gambia showing differences in the epigenomes of children conceived during the nutrient-poor rainy season compared to those conceived in periods where the nutritional intake of the mother is better [196].",
              "Although dietary folate deficiencies are most obvious when they take place during embryonic development, during adult life the amount of folate intake in the diet has been found to be related to epigenetic status in mammals [198, 199], including humans [200], and has also been related to methylation changes in colon cancer [201] and hyperhomocysteinemia [202].",
              "Other dietary methyl donors are methionine, which is involved in the metabolic pathway of SAM and has been related to epigenetic-dependent hepatic disorders [203], and selenium, which is a dietary supplement capable of modifying the epigenetic status of prostate cancer cells and reducing both DNA and histone methylation levels and which has been suggested to improve cancer prevention through the activation of silenced genes [204].",
              "In addition it has been described that deficiency in vitamin B12, another methyl donor, plays an important role in the adipocyte metabolism, and its deficiency leads to increased total cholesterol by limiting S-adenosylmethionine [205].",
              "In relation to adults, caloric restriction (CR) is a dietary regimen based on a reduction in caloric intake which many studies have related to lifespan extension in various eukaryote organisms [206\u2013212].",

              "Apart from DNA methylation and miRNA changes, ethanol induces gene activation through an increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation and H3k4me3 [253\u2013256], which may lead to immune system dysfunction [257].",
              "Interestingly, epigenetic changes due to ethanol seem to be different depending on whether there is chronic or binge ethanol intake [253].",

              "Also, stress is able to produce changes in histone modifications, such as increased levels of H3K4me3 and reduction of H3K9me3 levels in the dentate gyrus [263].",
              "In this regard, there is an interesting study showing how prenatal maternal stress, generated by a natural disaster, was related to changes in DNA methylation patterns of blood cells, which could have an effect on the immune function of the offspring [264].",

              "The Genetic Theory of Aging, Concepts, and Evidence - Verywell Health",
              "How Genes Affect Aging and How You May \"Alter\" Your Genes Your DNA may predict more about you than the way you look.",
              "According to the genetic theory of aging, your genes (as well as mutations in those genes) are responsible for how long you'll live.",
              "Here's what you should know about genes and longevity, and where genetics fits in among the various theories of aging.",
              "The genetic theory of aging states that lifespan is largely determined by the genes we inherit.",
              "According to the theory, our longevity is primarily determined at the moment of conception and is largely reliant on our parents and their genes.",
              "\ufeff\ufeff The basis behind this theory is that segments of DNA that occur at the end of chromosomes, called telomeres, determine the maximum lifespan of a cell.",
              "Telomeres are pieces of \"junk\" DNA at the end of chromosomes which become shorter every time a cell divides.",
              "These telomeres become shorter and shorter and eventually, the cells cannot divide without losing important pieces of DNA.",
              "\ufeff\ufeff Before delving into the tenets of how genetics affects aging, and the arguments for and against this theory, it's helpful to briefly discuss the primary categories of aging theories and some of the specific theories in these categories.",
              "At the current time, there is not one theory or even one category of theories that can explain everything we observe in the aging process.",
              "There are two primary categories of aging theories which differ fundamentally in what can be referred to as the \"purpose\" of aging.",
              "In the first category, aging is essentially an accident;",
              "an accumulation of damage and wear and tear to the body which eventually leads to death.",
              "In contrast, programmed aging theories view aging as an intentional process, controlled in a way that can be likened to other phases of life such as puberty.",
              "Error theories include several separate theories including: Programmed theories of aging are also broken down into different categories based on the method by which our bodies are programmed to age and die.",
              "There is significant overlap between these theories and even categories of aging theories.",
              "Before discussing the key concepts related to aging and genetics, let's review what our DNA is and some of the basic ways in which genes affect our lifespan.",
              "Our genes are contained in our DNA which is present in the nucleus (inner area) of each cell in our bodies.",
              "(There is also mitochondrial DNA present in the organelles called mitochondria which are present in the cytoplasm of the cell.)",
              "We each have 46 chromosomes making up our DNA, 23 of which come from our mothers and 23 which come from our fathers.",
              "Of these, 44 are autosomes, and two are the sex chromosomes, which determine if we are to be male or female.",
              "(Mitochondrial DNA, in contrast, carries much less genetic information and is received from only our mothers.)",
              "Within these chromosomes lie our genes, our genetic blueprint responsible for carrying the information for every process which will take place in our cells.",
              "Our genes can be envisioned as a series of letters that make up words and sentences of instructions.",
              "These words and sentences code for the manufacturing of proteins that control every cellular process.",
              "If any of these genes are damaged, for example, by a mutation that alters the series of \"letters and words\" in the instructions, an abnormal protein may be manufactured, which in turn, performs a defective function.",
              "If a mutation occurs in proteins that regulate the growth of a cell, cancer may result.",
              "If these genes are mutated from birth, various hereditary syndromes may occur.",
              "For example, cystic fibrosis is a condition in which a child inherits two mutated genes controlling a protein that regulates channels responsible for the movement of chloride across cells in the sweat glands, digestive glands, and more.",
              "The result of this single mutation results in a thickening of mucus produced by these glands, and the resultant problems which are associated with this condition.",
              "It doesn't take an elaborate study to determine that our genes play at least some role in longevity.",
              "People whose parents and ancestors have lived longer, tend to live longer and vice versa.",
              "At the same time, we know that genetics alone are not the sole cause of aging.",
              "Studies looking at identical twins reveal that there is clearly something else going on;",
              "identical twins who have identical genes do not always live an identical number of years.",
              "Some genes are beneficial and enhance longevity.",
              "For example, the gene that helps a person metabolize cholesterol would reduce a person's risk of heart disease.",
              "Some gene mutations are inherited and may shorten lifespan.",
              "However, mutations also can happen after birth, since exposure to toxins, free radicals and radiation can cause gene changes.",
              "(Gene mutations acquired after birth are referred to as acquired or somatic gene mutations.)",
              "Most mutations are not bad for you, and some can even be beneficial.",
              "That's because genetic mutations create genetic diversity, which keeps populations healthy.",
              "Other mutations, called silent mutations, have no effect on the body at all.",
              "Some genes, when mutated are harmful, like those that increase the risk of cancer.",
              "Many people are familiar with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations which predispose to breast cancer.",
              "These genes are referred to as tumor suppressor genes which code for proteins that control the repair of damaged DNA (or the elimination of the cell with damaged DNA if repair is not possible.)",
              "Various diseases and conditions related to heritable gene mutations can directly impact lifespan.",
              "These include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, and Huntington's disease, to name a few.",
              "The key concepts in genetics and aging include several important concepts and ideas ranging from telomere shortening to theories about the role of stem cells in aging.",
              "At the end of each of our chromosomes lies a piece of \"junk\" DNA called telomeres.",
              "Telomeres do not code for any proteins but appear to have a protective function, keeping the ends of DNA from attaching to other pieces of DNA or forming a circle.",
              "Each time a cell divides a little more of a telomere is snipped off.",
              "Eventually.",
              "there is none of this junk DNA left, and further snipping can damage the chromosomes and genes so that the cell dies.",
              "In general, the average cell is able to divide 50 times before the telomere is used up (the Hayflick limit).",
              "Cancer cells have figured out a way to not remove, and sometimes even add to, a section of the telomere.",
              "In addition, some cells such as white blood cells do not undergo this process of telomere shortening.",
              "It appears that while genes in all of our cells have the code word for the enzyme telomerase which inhibits telomere shortening and possibly even results in lengthening, the gene is only \"turned on\" or \"expressed\" as geneticists say, in cells such as white blood cells and cancer cells.",
              "Scientists have theorized that if this telomerase could somehow be turned on in other cells (but not so much that their growth would go haywire as in cancer cells) our age limit could be expanded.",
              "Studies have found that some chronic conditions such as high blood pressure are associated with less telomerase activity whereas a healthy diet and exercise are linked with longer telomeres.",
              "Being overweight is also associated with shorter telomeres.",
              "Longevity genes are specific genes that are associated with living longer.",
              "Two genes that are directly associated with longevity are SIRT1 (sirtuin 1) and SIRT2.",
              "\ufeff\ufeff Scientists looking at a group of over 800 people age 100 or older, found three significant differences in genes associated with aging.",
              "Cell senescence refers to the process by which cells decay over time.",
              "This can be related to the shortening of the telomeres or the process of apoptosis (or cell suicide) in which old or damaged cells are removed.",
              "\ufeff\ufeff Pluripotent stem cells are immature cells that have the potential to become any type of cell in the body.",
              "It is theorized that aging may be related to either the depletion of stem cells or the loss of the ability of stem cells to differentiate or mature into different kinds of cells.",
              "It's important to note that this theory refers to adult stem cells, not embryonic stem cells.",
              "Unlike embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells cannot mature into any type of cell but rather only a certain number of cell types.",
              "Most cells in our bodies are differentiated, or fully mature, and stem cells are only a small number of the cells present in the body.",
              "An example of a tissue type in which regeneration is possible by this method is the liver.",
              "This is in contrast to brain tissue which usually lacks this regenerative potential.",
              "There is now evidence that stem cells themselves may be affected in the aging process, but these theories are similar to the chicken-and-the-egg issue.",
              "It's not certain of aging occurs due to changes in stem cells, or if instead, changes in stem cells are due to the process of aging.",
              "Epigenetics refers to the expression of genes.",
              "In other words, a gene may be present but can either be turned on or turned off.",
              "We know that there are some genes in the body that are turned on for only a certain period of time.",
              "The field of epigenetics is also helping scientists understand how environmental factors may work within the constraints of genetics to either protect or predispose to disease.",
              "\ufeff\ufeff As noted above, there is a significant amount of evidence that looks at the importance of genes in expected survival.",
              "When looking at genetic theories, these are broken down into three primary schools of thought.",
              "There are several avenues of evidence that support a genetic theory of aging, at least in part.",
              "Perhaps the strongest evidence in support of the genetic theory is the considerable species-specific differences in maximal survival, with some species (such as butterflies) having very short lifespans, and others, such as elephants and whales, being similar to ours.",
              "Within a single species, survival is similar, but survival can be very different between two species that are otherwise similar in size.",
              "Twins studies also support a genetic component, as identical twins (monozygotic twins) are much more similar in terms of life expectancy than are non-identical or dizygotic twins.",
              "Evaluating identical twins who have been raised together and contrasting this with identical twins who are raised apart can help to separate out behavior factors such as diet and other lifestyle habits as a cause of family trends in longevity.",
              "Further evidence on a broad scale has been found by looking at the effect of genetic mutations in other animals.",
              "In some worms as well as some mice, a single gene mutation may lengthen survival by over 50 percent.",
              "In addition, we are finding evidence for some of the specific mechanisms involved in the genetic theory.",
              "Direct measurements of telomere length have shown that telomeres are vulnerable to genetic factors that can speed up the rate of aging.",
              "One of the stronger arguments against a genetic theory of aging or a \"programmed lifespan\" comes from an evolutionary perspective.",
              "Why would there be a specified lifespan beyond reproduction?",
              "In other words, what \"purpose\" is there for life after a person has reproduced and been alive long enough to raise their progeny to adulthood?",
              "It's also clear from what we know about lifestyle and disease that there are many other factors in aging.",
              "Identical twins may have very different lifespans depending on their exposures, their lifestyle factors (such as smoking) and physical activity patterns.",
              "It's been estimated that genes can explain a maximum of 35 percent of lifespan, but there is still more we do not understand about aging than which we do understand.",
              "\ufeff\ufeff Overall, it's likely that aging is a multifactorial process, meaning that it is probably a combination of several of the theories.",
              "It's also important to note that the theories discussed here are not mutually exclusive.",
              "The concept of epigenetics, or whether or not a gene that is present is \"expressed\" can further muddy our understanding.",
              "In addition to genetics, there are other determinants of aging such as our behaviors, exposures, and just plain luck.",
              "You are not doomed if your family members tend to die young, and you can't ignore your health even if your family members tend to live long.",
              "We are taught to eat a healthy diet and be active and these lifestyle factors are likely just as important no matter how much our genetics are involved in aging.",
              "The same practices which seem to keep the organs and tissues of our bodies healthy may also keep our genes and chromosomes healthy.",

              "Finally, when considering lifestyle factors, it would be helpful to consider their relative contributions to daily activity.",
              "For example, the addition of any activity means there is less time for other activities.",
              "As such, reading, for example, may be detrimental for sleep because it replaces an activity that is beneficial like outdoor exercise.",
