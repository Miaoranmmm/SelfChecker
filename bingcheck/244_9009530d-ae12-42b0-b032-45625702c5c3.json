    "query": "Can you explain the role and impact of dark energy on the expansion of the universe, and what current research is being conducted to better understand this elusive and mysterious force?",
    "response": "Dark energy is a mysterious form of energy that affects the universe on the largest scales. It is the dominant component of the universe, making up about **68%** of its total energy[^2^]. It is responsible for the **accelerated expansion** of the universe, which was first observed by measuring distant supernovas[^1^]. Scientists do not know what dark energy is, but they have proposed several possible explanations, such as a cosmological constant, a scalar field, or a modification of Einstein's theory of gravity[^1^] [^2^].\n\nThe role and impact of dark energy on the expansion of the universe is one of the most important and challenging questions in cosmology. Dark energy affects the fate and shape of the universe, as well as the formation and evolution of galaxies and other structures. It also has implications for fundamental physics, such as the nature of gravity and quantum theory[^1^] [^2^].\n\nCurrent research on dark energy is being conducted by various experiments and observations, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Dark Energy Survey, the Euclid mission, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. These projects aim to measure the properties and effects of dark energy more precisely and accurately, and to test different models and theories of dark energy[^2^] [^3^] [^4^].",

              "In the early 1990s, one thing was fairly certain about the expansion of the universe.",
              "It might have enough energy density to stop its expansion and recollapse, it might have so little energy density that it would never stop expanding, but gravity was certain to slow the expansion as time went on.",
              "Granted, the slowing had not been observed, but, theoretically, the universe had to slow.",
              "The universe is full of matter and the attractive force of gravity pulls all matter together.",
              "Then came 1998 and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of very distant supernovae that showed that, a long time ago, the universe was actually expanding more slowly than it is today.",
              "So the expansion of the universe has not been slowing due to gravity, as everyone thought, it has been accelerating.",
              "No one expected this, no one knew how to explain it.",
              "But something was causing it.",
              "Eventually theorists came up with three sorts of explanations.",
              "Maybe it was a result of a long-discarded version of Einstein's theory of gravity, one that contained what was called a \"cosmological constant.\"",
              "Maybe there was some strange kind of energy-fluid that filled space.",
              "Maybe there is something wrong with Einstein's theory of gravity and a new theory could include some kind of field that creates this cosmic acceleration.",
              "Theorists still don't know what the correct explanation is, but they have given the solution a name.",
              "It is called dark energy.",
              "More is unknown than is known.",
              "We know how much dark energy there is because we know how it affects the universe's expansion.",
              "Other than that, it is a complete mystery.",
              "But it is an important mystery.",
              "It turns out that roughly 68% of the universe is dark energy.",
              "Dark matter makes up about 27%.",
              "The rest - everything on Earth, everything ever observed with all of our instruments, all normal matter - adds up to less than 5% of the universe.",
              "Come to think of it, maybe it shouldn't be called \"normal\" matter at all, since it is such a small fraction of the universe.",
              "Universe Dark Energy-1 Expanding Universe This diagram reveals changes in the rate of expansion since the universe's birth 15 billion years ago.",
              "The more shallow the curve, the faster the rate of expansion.",
              "The curve changes noticeably about 7.",
              "5 billion years ago, when objects in the universe began flying apart as a faster rate.",
              "Astronomers theorize that the faster expansion rate is due to a mysterious, dark force that is pulling galaxies apart.",
              "Credit: NASA/STSci/Ann Feild One explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space.",
              "Albert Einstein was the first person to realize that empty space is not nothing.",
              "Space has amazing properties, many of which are just beginning to be understood.",
              "The first property that Einstein discovered is that it is possible for more space to come into existence.",
              "Then one version of Einstein's gravity theory, the version that contains a cosmological constant, makes a second prediction: \"empty space\" can possess its own energy.",
              "Because this energy is a property of space itself, it would not be diluted as space expands.",
              "As more space comes into existence, more of this energy-of-space would appear.",
              "As a result, this form of energy would cause the universe to expand faster and faster.",
              "Unfortunately, no one understands why the cosmological constant should even be there, much less why it would have exactly the right value to cause the observed acceleration of the universe.",
              "Dark Matter Core Defies Explanation This image shows the distribution of dark matter, galaxies, and hot gas in the core of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 520.",
              "The result could present a challenge to basic theories of dark matter.",
              "Another explanation for how space acquires energy comes from the quantum theory of matter.",
              "In this theory, \"empty space\" is actually full of temporary (\"virtual\") particles that continually form and then disappear.",
              "But when physicists tried to calculate how much energy this would give empty space, the answer came out wrong - wrong by a lot.",
              "The number came out 10120 times too big.",
              "That's a 1 with 120 zeros after it.",
              "It's hard to get an answer that bad.",
              "So the mystery continues.",
              "Another explanation for dark energy is that it is a new kind of dynamical energy fluid or field, something that fills all of space but something whose effect on the expansion of the universe is the opposite of that of matter and normal energy.",
              "Some theorists have named this \"quintessence,\" after the fifth element of the Greek philosophers.",

              "[2][3][4][5] Dark energy's density is very low: 6\u00d710\u221210 J/m3 (\u22487\u00d710\u221230 g/cm3), much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies.",
              "However, it dominates the universe's mass\u2013energy content because it is uniform across space.",
              "[6][7][8] The first observational evidence for dark energy's existence came from measurements of supernovae.",

              "[9][10] Prior to this observation, scientists thought that the gravitational attraction of matter and energy in the universe would cause the universe's expansion to slow over time.",
              "Since the discovery of accelerating expansion, several independent lines of evidence have been discovered that support the existence of dark energy.",
              "The exact nature of dark energy remains a mystery, and explanations abound.",
              "The main candidates are a cosmological constant[11][12] (representing a constant energy density filling space homogeneously) and scalar fields (dynamic quantities having energy densities that vary in time and space) such as quintessence or moduli.",
              "A cosmological constant would remain constant across time and space, while scalar fields can vary.",
              "Yet other possibilities are interacting dark energy, an observational effect, and cosmological coupling (see the Theories of Dark Energy section).",

              "If considered as a \"source term\" in the field equation, it can be viewed as equivalent to the mass of empty space (which conceptually could be either positive or negative), or \"vacuum energy\".",
              "The cosmological constant was first proposed by Einstein as a mechanism to obtain a solution to the gravitational field equation that would lead to a static universe, effectively using dark energy to balance gravity.",
              "[13] Einstein gave the cosmological constant the symbol \u039b (capital lambda).",
              "Einstein stated that the cosmological constant required that 'empty space takes the role of gravitating negative masses which are distributed all over the interstellar space'.",
              "[14][15] The mechanism was an example of fine-tuning, and it was later realized that Einstein's static universe would not be stable: local inhomogeneities would ultimately lead to either the runaway expansion or contraction of the universe.",
              "The equilibrium is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet more expansion.",
              "Likewise, a universe which contracts slightly will continue contracting.",
              "According to Einstein, \"empty space\" can possess its own energy.",

              "Further, observations made by Edwin Hubble in 1929 showed that the universe appears to be expanding and is not static.",
              "Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to predict the idea of a dynamic universe, in contrast to a static universe, as his greatest blunder.",
              "[17] Alan Guth and Alexei Starobinsky proposed in 1980 that a negative pressure field, similar in concept to dark energy, could drive cosmic inflation in the very early universe.",
              "Inflation postulates that some repulsive force, qualitatively similar to dark energy, resulted in an enormous and exponential expansion of the universe slightly after the Big Bang.",
              "Such expansion is an essential feature of most current models of the Big Bang.",
              "However, inflation must have occurred at a much higher (negative) energy density than the dark energy we observe today, and inflation is thought to have completely ended when the universe was just a fraction of a second old.",
              "It is unclear what relation, if any, exists between dark energy and inflation.",
              "Even after inflationary models became accepted, the cosmological constant was thought to be irrelevant to the current universe.",
              "Nearly all inflation models predict that the total (matter+energy) density of the universe should be very close to the critical density.",
              "During the 1980s, most cosmological research focused on models with critical density in matter only, usually 95% cold dark matter (CDM) and 5% ordinary matter (baryons).",
              "These models were found to be successful at forming realistic galaxies and clusters, but some problems appeared in the late 1980s: in particular, the model required a value for the Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and the model under-predicted observations of large-scale galaxy clustering.",
              "These difficulties became stronger after the discovery of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background by the COBE spacecraft in 1992, and several modified CDM models came under active study through the mid-1990s: these included the Lambda-CDM model and a mixed cold/hot dark matter model.",
              "The first direct evidence for dark energy came from supernova observations in 1998 of accelerated expansion in Riess et al.",
              "[18] and in Perlmutter et al.",
              ",[19] and the Lambda-CDM model then became the leading model.",
              "Soon after, dark energy was supported by independent observations: in 2000, the BOOMERanG and Maxima cosmic microwave background experiments observed the first acoustic peak in the cosmic microwave background, showing that the total (matter+energy) density is close to 100% of critical density.",
              "Then in 2001, the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey gave strong evidence that the matter density is around 30% of critical.",
              "The large difference between these two supports a smooth component of dark energy making up the difference.",
              "Much more precise measurements from WMAP in 2003\u20132010 have continued to support the standard model and give more accurate measurements of the key parameters.",
              "The term \"dark energy\", echoing Fritz Zwicky's \"dark matter\" from the 1930s, was coined by Michael Turner in 1998.",

              "In general relativity, the evolution of the expansion rate is estimated from the curvature of the universe and the cosmological equation of state (the relationship between temperature, pressure, and combined matter, energy, and vacuum energy density for any region of space).",
              "Measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today.",
              "Adding the cosmological constant to cosmology's standard FLRW metric leads to the Lambda-CDM model, which has been referred to as the \"standard model of cosmology\" because of its precise agreement with observations.",

              "Since it is rarefied and un-massive\u2014roughly 10\u221227 kg/m3\u2014it is unlikely to be detectable in laboratory experiments.",
              "The reason dark energy can have such a profound effect on the universe, making up 68% of universal density in spite of being so dilute, is that it is believed to uniformly fill otherwise empty space.",
              "The vacuum energy, that is, the particle-antiparticle pairs generated and mutually annihilated within a time frame in accord with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in the energy-time formulation, has been often invoked as the main contribution to dark energy.",
              "[23] The mass\u2013energy equivalence postulated by general relativity implies that the vacuum energy should exert a gravitational force.",
              "Hence, the vacuum energy is expected to contribute to the cosmological constant, which in turn impinges on the accelerated expansion of the universe.",
              "However, the cosmological constant problem asserts that there is a huge disagreement between the observed values of vacuum energy density and the theoretical large value of zero-point energy obtained by quantum field theory;",
              "the problem remains unresolved.",
              "Independently of its actual nature, dark energy would need to have a strong negative pressure to explain the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe.",
              "According to general relativity, the pressure within a substance contributes to its gravitational attraction for other objects just as its mass density does.",
              "This happens because the physical quantity that causes matter to generate gravitational effects is the stress\u2013energy tensor, which contains both the energy (or matter) density of a substance and its pressure.",

              "e., tension) in all the universe causes an acceleration in the expansion if the universe is already expanding, or a deceleration in contraction if the universe is already contracting.",
              "This accelerating expansion effect is sometimes labeled \"gravitational repulsion\".",
              "In standard cosmology, there are three components of the universe: matter, radiation, and dark energy.",
              "Matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the scale factor, i.",
              "e., \u03c1 \u221d a\u22123, while radiation is anything which scales to the inverse fourth power of the scale factor (\u03c1 \u221d a\u22124).",
              "This can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a cube-shaped box, doubling the length of an edge of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (23).",
              "For radiation, the decrease in energy density is greater, because an increase in spatial distance also causes a redshift.",
              "[24] The final component is dark energy: it is an intrinsic property of space and has a constant energy density, regardless of the dimensions of the volume under consideration (\u03c1 \u221d a0).",
              "Thus, unlike ordinary matter, it is not diluted by the expansion of space.",
              "The evidence for dark energy is indirect but comes from three independent sources: In 1998, the High-Z Supernova Search Team[18] published observations of Type Ia (\"one-A\") supernovae.",

              "Since the discovery of accelerating expansion, several independent lines of evidence have been discovered that support the existence of dark energy.",
              "The exact nature of dark energy remains a mystery, and explanations abound.",
              "The main candidates are a cosmological constant[11][12] (representing a constant energy density filling space homogeneously) and scalar fields (dynamic quantities having energy densities that vary in time and space) such as quintessence or moduli.",

              "If considered as a \"source term\" in the field equation, it can be viewed as equivalent to the mass of empty space (which conceptually could be either positive or negative), or \"vacuum energy\".",

              "The equilibrium is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet more expansion.",
              "Likewise, a universe which contracts slightly will continue contracting.",
              "According to Einstein, \"empty space\" can possess its own energy.",

              "Such expansion is an essential feature of most current models of the Big Bang.",
              "However, inflation must have occurred at a much higher (negative) energy density than the dark energy we observe today, and inflation is thought to have completely ended when the universe was just a fraction of a second old.",
              "It is unclear what relation, if any, exists between dark energy and inflation.",
              "Even after inflationary models became accepted, the cosmological constant was thought to be irrelevant to the current universe.",
              "Nearly all inflation models predict that the total (matter+energy) density of the universe should be very close to the critical density.",
              "During the 1980s, most cosmological research focused on models with critical density in matter only, usually 95% cold dark matter (CDM) and 5% ordinary matter (baryons).",
              "These models were found to be successful at forming realistic galaxies and clusters, but some problems appeared in the late 1980s: in particular, the model required a value for the Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and the model under-predicted observations of large-scale galaxy clustering.",
              "These difficulties became stronger after the discovery of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background by the COBE spacecraft in 1992, and several modified CDM models came under active study through the mid-1990s: these included the Lambda-CDM model and a mixed cold/hot dark matter model.",

              "In general relativity, the evolution of the expansion rate is estimated from the curvature of the universe and the cosmological equation of state (the relationship between temperature, pressure, and combined matter, energy, and vacuum energy density for any region of space).",
              "Measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today.",
              "Adding the cosmological constant to cosmology's standard FLRW metric leads to the Lambda-CDM model, which has been referred to as the \"standard model of cosmology\" because of its precise agreement with observations.",

              "Since it is rarefied and un-massive\u2014roughly 10\u221227 kg/m3\u2014it is unlikely to be detectable in laboratory experiments.",
              "The reason dark energy can have such a profound effect on the universe, making up 68% of universal density in spite of being so dilute, is that it is believed to uniformly fill otherwise empty space.",
              "The vacuum energy, that is, the particle-antiparticle pairs generated and mutually annihilated within a time frame in accord with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in the energy-time formulation, has been often invoked as the main contribution to dark energy.",

              "the problem remains unresolved.",
              "Independently of its actual nature, dark energy would need to have a strong negative pressure to explain the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe.",
              "According to general relativity, the pressure within a substance contributes to its gravitational attraction for other objects just as its mass density does.",
              "This happens because the physical quantity that causes matter to generate gravitational effects is the stress\u2013energy tensor, which contains both the energy (or matter) density of a substance and its pressure.",

              "This accelerating expansion effect is sometimes labeled \"gravitational repulsion\".",
              "In standard cosmology, there are three components of the universe: matter, radiation, and dark energy.",

              "This can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a cube-shaped box, doubling the length of an edge of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (23).",
              "For radiation, the decrease in energy density is greater, because an increase in spatial distance also causes a redshift.",
              "[24] The final component is dark energy: it is an intrinsic property of space and has a constant energy density, regardless of the dimensions of the volume under consideration (\u03c1 \u221d a0).",
              "Thus, unlike ordinary matter, it is not diluted by the expansion of space.",

              "A new theoretical study suggests gravity might also be fueling the mysterious \u201cdark energy\u201d speeding up cosmic expansion.",
              "NASA, ESA, Hubble and HST Frontier Fields For decades cosmologists have wondered about the nature of dark energy, the proposed antigravitational force behind the accelerating expansion of the universe.",
              "Since the 1990s astronomers have observed that the universe is not only expanding, but also increasing its expansion rate.",
              "This is very strange, because the collective gravitational pull of all the \u201cstuff\u201d in the universe would be expected to eventually reverse cosmic expansion, or at least slow it down.",
              "Instead, just like a ball gently tossed overhead suddenly soaring off into the heavens, some mysterious force\u2014the aforementioned \u201cdark energy\u201d\u2014is pushing far-distant, galaxy-filled regions of space away from us at ever-greater speeds.",
              "No known physics has fully explained this phenomenon;",
              "it remains a cosmic enigma, and its true, as-yet-unknown nature will profoundly shape the ultimate fate of our universe.",
              "Now, however, a new theoretical study, submitted for publication at the Journal for Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, suggests dark energy\u2019s apparent antigravitational properties may be the natural, inevitable consequence of how gravity works in the first place, at the universe\u2019s most fundamental quantum scales.",
              "If eventually verified by further cosmological evidence, the idea would represent a major breakthrough in the long quest to mend the schism between physicists\u2019 two most cherished theories: quantum mechanics, which describes the microscopic world of particles and fields, and general relativity, which describes the macroscopic cosmos of planets, stars and galaxies.",
              "General relativity posits that gravity is an emergent property of curves and warps in spacetime\u2014the fabric of reality itself\u2014but the theory loses its predictive power at quantum scales;",
              "conversely, quantum mechanics accurately incorporates all other known fundamental forces save for gravity, which fails to fit into the theory.",
              "Thus, many physicists suspect a quantum theory of gravity is the only way to unify these two opposing approaches.",

              "According to Daniele Oriti, a co-author of the new paper, the core idea behind any theory of quantum gravity is that gravitation arises from a myriad of tiny, discrete, quantum objects that form a sort of hidden underworld, a deeper substructure beneath the familiar dimensions of space and time.",
              "\u201cThese quantum objects, which are very difficult to imagine,\u201d Oriti says, \u201care essentially the building blocks of space itself.",

              "If they exist at all, they are absolutely tiny in their size, and are at a microscopic scale which even the most powerful microscopes cannot see.",
              "\u201d In the study Oriti and his co-author Xiankai Pang, both at the University of Munich in Germany, focused first on developing a new quantum gravity model by trying to better understand the force\u2019s properties at the microscopic level.",
              "\u201cOnce having constructed our new model,\u201d Oriti says, \u201cwe decided to track it through time from the beginning of our modeled universe, to see what would happen during the evolution of its expansion.",
              "We were definitely surprised when we saw something closely resembling dark energy.",
              "The model produced an acceleration of the expansion of the universe at the stage corresponding to the time we are at today, which matches very closely with current observational evidence.",
              "\u201d \u201cThis is quite an elegant result,\u201d says Abhay Ashtekar, an eminent theorist at Penn State who works on modern theories of quantum gravity and who was not involved in the new study.",
              "\u201cBecause the new approach begins with a general framework for quantum gravity at the subspace level, and then applies it to the cosmological scale, while in other methods one restricts oneself to the cosmological context right from start, the new idea is beginning from a more fundamental perspective than we have done before, and that is an advantage.",
              "\u201d Oriti explains that the model's acceleration of the expansion of the universe, during the stage corresponding to today, is caused by interactions between the subspace quantum objects that make up gravity in the theory.",
              "After the expanding universe reaches a critical volume, these quantum objects begin to interact with each other in new ways.",
              "It is a bit like baking a cake.",
              "Imagine a cake where the yeast\u2014in this case the subspace quantum objects\u2014is not so important until a critical temperature\u2014in this case the volume of the universe\u2014is reached, whereafter conditions are just right to kick it into action, causing a rapid expansion.",
              "In the quantum gravity model, this is what causes the emergence of the dark energy\u2013like phenomenon, which is characterized by an acceleration of the growth in volume of space.",
              "\u201cIn the model, during the early universe, when the volume is small, the quantum objects out of which space emerges, interact in a manner which makes them subdominant compared to their large-scale long-term evolution,\u201d says Oriti.",
              "\u201cBut then, because the universe keeps expanding through time, at some point these interactions become relevant and they start affecting the evolution of the universe\u2014the dynamics of the universe\u2014in a considerable manner, causing an acceleration of the expansion.",
              "So, at that stage, the interactions between the quantum objects which make up space produce an acceleration which is similar in description and magnitude to the dark energy cosmologists observe.",
              "\u201d \u201cHaving a dark energy phenomenological effect like this from a quantum gravity model is very interesting,\u201d says Ana Alonso Serrano, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Germany, who was also not involved in the study.",
              "\u201cI think it is important that we explore our quantum gravity models in this kind of way, so to see if they can make predictions about cosmology and compare them to observations.",
              "\u201d \u201cThe next step will be to build on their theory, and their model, so to make further predictions which can be compared against real cosmological observations,\u201d she says.",

              "Second, understanding its role and impact for couplings to the genuine quantum matter will be a first and decisive step in probing the interface between Quantum Theory and GR in a way guided by experiments, with possible far-reaching implications as regards possible reconciliations of the incompatible foundations of these theories.",
              "The first formulation of EP, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP), states the universality of free fall (UFF), which is meant to say that the center-of-mass motion of a sufficiently unstructured test body only depends on the initial conditions and not on the details of body\u2019s further constitution.",

              "Moreover, this statement of EP assumes that one may neglect gravitational self-interactions of the size of the systems used to probe the external gravitational field.",
              "In order to account for modifications or extensions of Einstein gravity, there is the need to introduce an even more general concept, which includes both the previous principles in a suitable limit.",
              "Such a requirement results in the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP) which can be formulated as follows: WEP is valid for self-gravitating bodies with appreciable fractions of gravitational binding energies contributing to their overall energy, as well as for test bodies;",

              "These considerations, however, work for WEP, not only in the context of GR, but also for its generalizations and modifications, most importantly, scalar-tensor- and higher-order-theories of gravity.",

              "Astrophysical and cosmological observations have established9 that DM and DE are the dominant contributions to the average energy density of the universe.",
              "However, the precise nature of DM and DE remains elusive despite considerable efforts in observational astrophysics and experimental high-energy physics over several decades.",
              "Precision measurements based on atom interferometry and atomic clocks in space can make an important contribution to this quest.",
              "Extensive searches10 for massive dark-matter candidates known as WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) have come empty-handed, spurring growing experimental interest in exploring a wider range of dark-matter hypotheses.",
              "In this respect, the possibility that DM could be attributed to coherent oscillations within subgalactic regions of ultralight scalar (or pseudoscalar) fields has recently been gaining increasing attention11.",
              "These oscillations can lead to small periodic variations in space and time of the parameters of the Standard Model, which could be detected in highly sensitive gravimetry measurements as a small modulation in the time of the acceleration experienced by freely falling atoms12.",
              "They can also produce small oscillations of the transition energies between electronic states that could be identified by comparing different atomic clocks at the same location13 or pairs of identical atom interferometers separated by long distances but interrogated by common laser beams14.",
              "On the other hand, certain classes of dark-energy theories, known as chameleon-field15 and symmetron-field16 models, involve a light scalar field that can mediate a long-range interaction and give rise to a \"fifth force\u201d.",
              "However, through its interaction with matter, the chameleon and the symmetron fields acquire a much larger effective mass in any region where the matter density is not too low.",
              "This fact leads to a screening of the interaction, which can in this way evade tests of the EP with macroscopic masses.",
              "In contrast, microscopic test masses, such as the atoms in a vacuum chamber, are hardly affected by the screening mechanism, as opposed to the source mass.",
              "QM is grounded in the superposition principle, which has been verified in a variety of experiments with microscopic and mesoscopic systems. However, its applicability (therefore, the validity of quantum theory) to macroscopic objects poses a problem, as first exemplified by Schro\u0308dinger with the cat paradox17: simply, we do not experience quantum superpositions in our daily life, in spite of the fact that - mathematically speaking - they easily carry over from the microscopic world to the macroscopic one.",
              "One way out is to assume that the quantum superposition principle has a limited range of validity: it is not a fundamental principle of nature and progressively breaks down when atoms glue together to form larger and more complex systems18,19,20,21,22,23.",
              "Models of spontaneous wavefunction collapse24,25 translate this idea into mathematical models: the Schro\u0308dinger equation is modified by adding nonlinear and stochastic terms, which induce the collapse of the wavefunction in space.",
              "As such, these models predict that systems progressively lose quantum coherence and behave classically;",
              "the larger the system, the faster the transition from a quantum to a classical state.",
              "Such a potential loss of coherence can be tested by suitable interferometric techniques.",
              "The basic idea is to create a quantum superposition of a system, which is as massive as possible, make it last as long as possible, and then check whether the two branches interfere.",
              "If they do, then the quantum theory is right, otherwise, there is a conflict with the theory.",
              "The difficulty is to make the superposition, which requires free evolution, last long enough.",
              "Here space helps by ensuring much longer free-evolution times than on the ground (see \u201cMatter-wave interferometry tests of GR and QM\u201d).",
              "Recently, alternative and stronger tests have been developed, which are non-interferometric, because they do not require creating a superposition state.",
              "They are based on the fact that, according to collapse models, the collapse of the quantum wavefunction is triggered by a noise, which also makes particles diffuse.",
              "Then, one can test this diffusion process, which takes place also when systems are not in a spatial superposition26.",
              "Monitoring the diffusion of the center of mass of a system, or the expansion of a gas of particles, has already placed strong bounds on the collapse parameters27,28,29,30,31.",

              "Nicholas Suntzeff, an associate astronomer at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, and Brian Schmidt, who had recently completed his doctoral thesis at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, were specialists in supernovae\u2014exploding stars.",
              "Suntzeff and Schmidt decided that the time had finally come to use their expertise to tackle one of the fundamental questions in cosmology: What is the fate of the universe?",
              "Specifically, in a universe full of matter that is gravitationally attracting all other matter, logic dictates that the expansion of space\u2014which began at the big bang and has continued ever since\u2014would be slowing.",
              "But by how much?",
              "Just enough that the expansion will eventually come to an eternal standstill?",
              "Or so much that the expansion will eventually reverse itself in a kind of about-face big bang?",
              "They grabbed the nearest blue-and-gray sheet of IBM printout paper, flipped it over and began scribbling a plan: the telescopes to secure, the peers to recruit, the responsibilities to delegate.",
              "Meanwhile some 9,600 kilometers up the Pacific Coast, a collaboration at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, operating under the leadership of physicist Saul Perlmutter, was already pursuing the same goal, using the same supernova approach and relying on the same underlying logic.",
              "Suntzeff and Schmidt knew about Perlmutter's Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP).",
              "But they also knew that the SCP team consisted primarily of physicists who, like Perlmutter himself, were learning astronomy on the fly.",
              "Surely, Schmidt and Suntzeff reassured each other, a team of actual astronomers could catch up.",
              "And their team did, just in time.",
              "In 1998 the rival collaborations independently reached the same conclusion as to how much the expansion of the universe is slowing down: it's not.",
              "It's speeding up.",
              "This year marks the 25th anniversary of the discovery of evidence for \u201cdark energy\u201d\u2014a moniker for whatever is driving the acceleration that even then meant next to nothing yet encompassed nearly everything.",
              "The coinage was almost a joke, and the joke was on us.",
              "If dark energy were real, it would constitute two thirds of all the mass and energy in the universe\u2014that is, two thirds of what people had always assumed, from the dawn of civilization onward, to be the universe in its entirety.",
              "Yet what that two thirds of the universe was remained a mystery.",
              "A quarter of a century later that summary still applies.",
              "Which is not to suggest, however, that science has made no progress.",
              "Over the decades observers have gathered ever more convincing evidence of dark energy's existence, and this effort continues to drive a significant part of observational cosmology while inspiring ever more ingenious methods to, if not detect, at least define it.",
              "But right from the start\u2014in the first months of 1998\u2014theorists recognized that dark energy presents an existential problem of more immediate urgency than the fate of the universe: the future of physics.",
              "The mystery of why a universe full of matter gravitationally attracting all other matter hasn't yet collapsed on itself has haunted astronomy at least since Isaac Newton's introduction of a universal law of gravitation.",
              "In 1693, only six years after the publication of his Principia, Newton acknowledged to an inquiring cleric that positing a universe in perpetual equilibrium is akin to making \u201cnot one Needle only, but an infinite number of them (so many as there are particles in an infinite Space) stand accurately poised upon their Points.",
              "Yet I grant it possible,\u201d he immediately added, \u201cat least by a divine Power.",
              "\u201d \u201cIt was a great missed opportunity for theoretical physics,\u201d the late Stephen Hawking wrote in a 1999 introduction to a new translation of Principia.",
              "\u201cNewton could have predicted the expansion of the universe.",
              "\u201d So, too, Einstein.",
              "When, in 1917, he applied his equations for general relativity to cosmology, he confronted the same problem as Newton.",
              "Unlike Newton, though, Einstein added to the equation not a divine power but the Greek symbol lambda (\u039b), an arbitrary mathematical shorthand for whatever was keeping the universe in perfect balance.",
              "The following decade astronomer Edwin Hubble seemingly rendered lambda superfluous through his twin discoveries that other \u201cisland universes,\u201d or galaxies, exist beyond our own Milky Way and that on the whole those galaxies appear to be receding from us in a fairly straightforward manner: the farther, the faster\u2014as if, perhaps, the universe had emerged from a single explosive event.",
              "The 1964 discovery of evidence supporting the big bang theory immediately elevated cosmology from metaphysics to hard science.",
              "Only six years later, in an essay in Physics Today that set the agenda for a generation, astronomer (and onetime Hubble prote\u0301ge\u0301) Allan Sandage defined the science of big bang cosmology as \u201cthe search for two numbers.",
              "\u201d One number was \u201cthe rate of expansion\u201d now.",
              "The second was the \u201cdeceleration in the expansion\u201d over time.",
              "Decades would pass before the first real investigations into the second number got underway, but it was no coincidence that two collaborations more or less simultaneously started work on it at that point.",
              "Only then had advances in technology and theory made the search for the deceleration parameter feasible.",

              "Physics - Entering a New Era of Dark Energy Cosmology",
              "In 1998, Saul Perlmutter was leading one of the two teams that discovered that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating.",
              "The finding stunned the scientific world, as most expectations were that the gravitational attraction of matter to other matter would slow down the expansion.",
              "Instead, a repulsive and enigmatic force\u2014later called dark energy\u2014appeared to be pushing the Universe apart.",
              "Perlmutter, an astrophysicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and the University of California, Berkeley, eventually shared the physics Nobel Prize for the discovery.",
              "In response to the results, he turned to theorists in search of explanations.",
              "\u201cVery quickly, we realized that to distinguish between competing theories, we would need to measure the expansion history of the Universe with at least 20 times the precision achievable at that time,\u201d said Perlmutter at the Cosmic Controversies conference in Chicago in October.",
              "Despite intense research efforts over the past two decades, cosmologists haven\u2019t made much progress on understanding the nature of dark energy.",
              "The lack of progress may seem frustrating, \u201cbut it\u2019s the absolute wrong time to feel depressed,\u201d said Perlmutter, because the kinds of observations that he and others wanted 20 years ago are finally becoming possible.",
              "\u201cThe first experiments achieving the new level of precision are just about to turn on,\u201d he said.",
              "The first of the new generation of experiments to kick off will be the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI), installed at the Mayall telescope on top of Kitt Peak in Arizona.",
              "DESI is currently being tested and is expected to start collecting scientific data next month.",
              "Other experiments, some ground-based and some on satellites, will begin in the next few years.",
              "The new observations will use several different, complementary techniques that cosmologists hope will provide new clues about the nature of dark energy.",
              "There are several ways to probe the Universe\u2019s expansion.",
              "The most established method is the one famously used by Perlmutter and others in the 1990s.",
              "It relies on type Ia supernovae, thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs that are visible even in galaxies ten billion light years away.",
              "Since the intrinsic brightness of this type of supernova is known, these events serve as \u201cstandard candles\u201d: the brightness observed on Earth can be used to calculate their distances.",
              "Astronomers can also determine the speed with which a supernova is moving away from us by measuring its redshift, the change in wavelength of spectral features caused by the Doppler effect.",
              "The redshift provides the cosmic time at which we are seeing the explosion, since objects that are receding faster are farther away in both space and time than ones receding more slowly.",
              "By measuring the distances of many supernovae as a function of their redshift, researchers can put together the expansion history of the Universe.",
              "DESI will use a different method, based on measuring the large-scale distribution of galaxies.",
              "This distribution retains the signatures of a phenomenon known as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs).",
              "BAOs were produced by acoustic waves in the hot, primordial plasma making up the early Universe.",
              "These waves froze into place about 380,000 years after the big bang, when the plasma\u2019s electrons and protons became bound into neutral atoms. This freezing ultimately resulted in subtle, periodic oscillations in the density of galaxies\u2014pick a galaxy, and you are slightly more likely to find other galaxies at a specific distance away from it, a distance called the acoustic scale.",
              "Since the acoustic scale at the freeze-out time can be calculated from first principles, \u201cIt\u2019s like having a reference yardstick imprinted in the Universe,\u201d says DESI director Michael Levi.",
              "The acoustic scale increased as the Universe expanded, so that it is now almost half a billion light years.",
              "Researchers can follow how this yardstick changed with time by studying galaxies at a range of redshifts.",
              "Levi says that using BAOs to determine the Universe\u2019s expansion history is less prone to systematic errors than interpreting supernova measurements, which requires detailed modeling of stellar explosions.",
              "Measuring the acoustic scale, however, is anything but straightforward.",
              "To measure it precisely, one must observe large numbers of galaxies across billions of light years.",
              "Previous BAO surveys mapped about 2.",
              "5 million galaxies.",
              "DESI will surpass the precision of those surveys by mapping over 35 million galaxies and 2.",
              "4 million quasars\u2014extremely bright and distant galactic nuclei.",
              "From such maps, DESI will reconstruct the last 11 billion years of the Universe\u2019s expansion.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s like taking a 3D MRI scan of the Universe,\u201d says Levi.",
              "DESI will be able to measure such a large number of objects thanks to robotic technology.",
              "On the focal plane of the telescope, 5000 optical fibers will each gather light from one galaxy and send the light to a spectrometer, which will provide the galaxy\u2019s redshift.",
              "Every 20 minutes, the 5000 robotic positioners will realign the fiber ends, pointing them at a new set of galaxies and cycling through over 100,000 galaxies every night.",
              "To prepare the ground for DESI, three previous surveys have observed one third of the sky, collecting images of over one billion galaxies, from which the most promising targets for DESI were selected.",
              "These data are collected in a publicly available online Sky Viewer.",
              "DESI opened its eyes to the night sky in October 2019, and its scientists and engineers have been testing and calibrating the instrument.",
              "\u201cWe are still wrapping our heads around the complexity of this machine,\u201d says Levi.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s like using robots to control the most complex Alvin Ailey choreography tens of times every night.",
              "\u201d Beyond supernovae and BAOs, there are two other important techniques for studying dark energy.",
              "One is counting galaxy clusters\u2014the clusters\u2019 abundance varies with time depending on the cosmic mix of matter and dark energy.",
              "The other is weak lensing measurements, which map out the distribution of dark matter based on its subtle warping of spacetime and the resulting distortions of observed galaxies\u2019 shapes and positions.",
              "Cluster counts and weak lensing\u2014both measured as a function of redshift\u2014will reveal how the accelerated expansion has changed the growth of structures of dark and visible matter.",
              "\u201cPeople used to fight over which of the four techniques is the best one,\u201d says cosmologist Andreas Albrecht of the University of California, Davis.",
              "\u201cToday we believe that the combination of different techniques is much more powerful than each individual technique.",
              "\u201d Mark Kamionkowski, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, agrees and refers to a famous South Asian parable.",
              "\u201cIf we focused on one observable only, we\u2019d be like one of those six blind men trying to understand what an elephant is by touching just one of its parts.",
              "\u201d Following this philosophy, upcoming facilities include a variety of experiments that will exploit the full spectrum of dark energy observables.",
              "The European Space Agency will launch Euclid in 2022, and NASA plans to launch WFIRST in 2025.",
              "Between these two satellites, all four techniques will be carried out with high resolution from space.",
              "On the ground, the next big thing is the Large-aperture Synoptic Survey Telescope, a 6.",
              "5-m optical telescope expected to be operational in 2022.",
              "Although it won\u2019t have DESI\u2019s spectroscopic abilities, it will be able to see many more faint objects than any existing surveys, peering deeper into the Universe\u2019s past.",
              "Perlmutter\u2019s optimism is not only motivated by the new measurement technology but also by dramatic improvements in the way researchers handle data.",
              "He cited key progress in several areas: Researchers have gotten better at understanding how random and systematic errors affect experiments;",
              "machine-learning tools have been increasingly applied to the analysis of big data;",
              "and advances in so-called blinding techniques have allowed researchers to better prevent bias from affecting their data processing.",
              "There have also been important \u201csociological changes\u201d\u2014collaborations are increasingly adopting open-science philosophies, sharing all of their data publicly in real time.",
              "Astrophysicist Wendy Freedman of the University of Chicago said that many young researchers are now entering the dark energy arena, coming from other areas, like particle physics, and bringing new techniques.",
              "\u201cThese are times when we get a fertile cross-pollination of ideas from different fields,\u201d she said.",
              "Albrecht marveled at the changes over the last few decades.",
              "\u201cWhen I entered the field, there were many big questions and no way to answer them.",
              "The transformation of cosmology into a precision science has been truly exhilarating,\u201d he said.",
              "While Perlmutter admitted that there is no guarantee that the new level of precision will be sufficient to see something new, \u201ca breakthrough feels like a natural thing to occur soon,\u201d he said.",
