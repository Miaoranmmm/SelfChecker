    "query": "What is the most promising and effective approach to developing a universal cure for cancer, and what breakthroughs in research have been made in recent years towards achieving this goal?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. Unfortunately, there is no simple answer to it, as cancer is not a single disease but a collection of different diseases that affect different parts of the body in different ways. However, some recent research has shown promising results in developing new ways to treat cancer using the immune system[^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^].\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was made by scientists at Cardiff University, who found a new type of T-cell that can recognize and kill a wide range of cancer cells, including prostate, breast, lung, colon, ovarian and cervical cancers[^2^]. T-cells are immune cells that can scan the body for threats and eliminate them. This particular T-cell can interact with a molecule called MR1, which is present on the surface of every cell in the human body and may signal the abnormal metabolism of cancer cells[^2^]. This means that this T-cell could potentially target any cancer cell without harming normal cells[^2^].\n\nThis discovery has been described as a possible \"universal\" cancer therapy or a \"one-size-fits-all\" cancer treatment[^2^] [^4^] [^5^]. However, it is still very early in the research process and more studies are needed to confirm the safety and effectiveness of this approach in humans. So far, the researchers have only tested it in lab experiments and in mice[^2^]. They hope to start clinical trials in patients by 2023[^3^].\n\nAnother promising area of research is immunotherapy, which is a type of treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer. There are different types of immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, cancer vaccines and CAR-T therapy[^6^]. Some of these treatments have shown remarkable results in some patients with certain types of cancer, such as melanoma, lung cancer, leukemia and lymphoma[^6^]. However, immunotherapy is not effective for everyone and can also cause serious side effects[^6^]. Therefore, more research is needed to improve the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy and to find ways to make it work for more types of cancer.\n\nIn summary, there is no universal cure for cancer yet, but there are many ongoing research efforts to find new and better ways to treat it using the immune system. These efforts have made significant progress in recent years and have raised hope for many patients and doctors. However, there are still many challenges and uncertainties ahead and more work is needed to translate these findings into clinical practice.",

              "Proto-oncogenes are involved in normal cell growth and division.",
              "However, when these genes are altered in certain ways or are more active than normal, they may become cancer-causing genes (or oncogenes), allowing cells to grow and survive when they should not.",

              "Before cancer cells form in tissues of the body, the cells go through abnormal changes called hyperplasia and dysplasia.",
              "In hyperplasia, there is an increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue that appear normal under a microscope.",

              "The chemical natures of the antigen or antigens within tumor cells bound to the MR1 of tumor cells and the TCR of MR1T cells remain elusive, but it is possible that they are unstable intermediates resulting from the reaction of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) intermediates with glyoxal or methylglyoxal (see below).",
              "It is important to mention that neither riboflavin (vitamin B2) nor folic acid (vitamin B9) is produced by mammalian cells [25,27,56].",

              "Whether the resulting MR1-metabolite complex is able to activate MAIT cells in vivo is not clear because 5-OP-RU and 5-OE-RU, but not 6-FP, can activate MAIT cells in vitro [7,14].",

              "In support of the innate-like nature of MAIT cells\u2019 TCRs is the fact that they recognize the monomorphic MR1 in complex with a limited number of metabolite antigens [7,14].",
              "In contrast, the classical MHC-I proteins are highly polymorphic and the peptides they bind are diverse, depending on the flexibility of the TCR V region, which is often sufficient to allow the TCR to interact with numerous MHC-I/peptide complexes [58].",

              "These results indicate that the as yet unknown ligand or ligands restricted by MR1, and thereby recognized by MR1T cells, have a similar structure to acetyl-6-FP and other MAIT TCR ligands.",
              "In addition to being byproducts of glycolysis, glyoxal and methylglyoxal come from food sources, yet it is tantalizing to speculate that MR1-expressing cancer cells undergo increased glycolysis to produce glyoxal and methylglyoxal, which react with vitamin B metabolites to form the antigen or antigens that bind MR1 and are recognized by the TCRs of MR1T cells.",
              "As the unknown metabolite antigen or antigens presented by MR1 are specific to or associated with cancer, they may represent a novel class of neoantigens, beyond the neo-peptides arising from altered tumor proteins and presented by classical MHC-I or MHC-II.",

              "MR1-restricted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were detected by staining in the liver, stomach, lung, and duodenum of healthy subjects and were enriched in a celiac duodenum and a Merkel cell carcinoma [59].",
              "The group solved the crystal structure of a \u03b3\u03b4 TCR\u2013MR1\u20135-OP-RU complex and found that the \u03b3\u03b4 TCR binds underneath the MR1 antigen-binding cleft, rather than binding to the presented antigen within the cleft [59].",
              "Thus, MR1-restricted \u03b3\u03b4 TCRs in T cells can adopt diverse binding modes with MR1, representing noteworthy progress for both \u03b3\u03b4 T cell and MR1 biology.",

              "The authors observed relatively low levels of editing efficiency (median = 5.",
              "81%) in infused cells, which may be related to the use of older-generation plasmid-based gene delivery system instead of the newer more efficient ribonucleoprotein method at the time of the study.",

              "The authors did not observe objective response in the treated patients, which may be due to a combination of low editing efficiency, poor T cell expansion, and/or lack of antigen specificity by the edited T cells.",
              "Of note, one patient with the highest PD-1 editing efficiency showed long-term persistence of edited T cells in vivo and stable disease for 76 weeks, suggesting higher editing efficiency may be associated with improved clinical outcomes.",
              "Together, this study showed that using ex vivo CRISPR-edited, PD-1-ablated, patient-derived T cells for cancer treatment is clinically feasible and generally safe.",
              "This finding echoes the conclusions of two other recent clinical studies that also examined the safety and feasibility of CRISPR-based cell therapy.",
              "In the first study, Xu et al.",
              "transplanted CRISPR-engineered, CCR5-ablated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells into a patient with HIV infection and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",
              "The authors found the edited donor cells to persist more than 19 months after transplantation without causing gene-editing-related AEs.",
              "4 In the second study, Stadtmauer et al.",
              "used CRISPR-based multiplex gene editing to ablate the expression of endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) and PD-1 genes in T cells engineered to express a cancer-specific TCR gene in four patients.",
              "The authors reported efficient editing of all target genomic loci and stable engraftment of edited T cells in vivo for up to 9 months.",
              "While chromosome translocations were detected in the edited cells as would be expected from multiplex editing, no cellular transformation was observed and patients experienced no gene-editing-related severe AEs.",
              "5 In both studies, the rates of off-target editing were low.",
              "These three studies marked an important milestone in the development of CRISPR-based gene therapy.",
              "Not only that they provided the eagerly awaited first pieces of evidence supporting the safety and feasibility of CRISPR-based cell therapy in human patients, but also that they established detailed protocols for CRISPR-editing and off-target events tracking in clinical settings which are valuable for designing future trials.",
              "Nevertheless, these studies also revealed several limitations of existing gene-editing technology.",
              "First, the gene-editing efficiency varies significantly across target genes and patients.",
              "1,5 This may be due to the different cell production protocols used in separate studies, but it emphasizes the importance of optimizing and validating each individual CRISPR assay for clinical use.",
              "Second, while the reported off-target rates were low in all three studies, they were highly dependent on gRNA selection, and multiplex gene editing significantly increased the risk of chromosome translocation.",
              "5 Given that adverse effects of off-target editing may take several years to manifest,3 it is important for future studies to evaluate the long-term safety of CRISPR, particularly when the edited cells are long-lived in vivo.",
              "Finally, the current protocols for producing patient-derived CRISPR-edited cells are still somewhat inefficient.",
              "Notably, in two studies, the authors failed to expand enough edited T cells from a significant fraction of patients (23%1 and 33%,5 respectively).",
              "While this may be because these patients were heavily treated prior to T cell isolation, it does reveal potential limitation of current approach in clinical applications.",
              "Some of these limitations may be addressed by newer generation of CRISPR-based gene-editing technologies such as \u201cbase editing\u201d and \u201cprime editing\u201d.",
              "2 Unlike the standard CRISPR-Cas9 approach used in the current study that relies on generating random indels to disrupt target gene function, these newer methods are designed to generate uniform and predictable gene-editing results, thus improving editing precision.",
              "2 More importantly, they do not create double-strand DNA breaks, thus having the potential to significantly improve the safety of therapeutic gene-editing by avoiding generating one of the most toxic form of DNA damage in mammalian cells.",
              "2 Currently, these methods remain at early stage of pre-clinical development as their efficiency and specificity are still being assessed.",
              "Nevertheless, the valuable insights gained from the current batches of CRISPR-based trials by Lu et al.",

              "Because of an overshooting and highly activated immune system, a large amount of cytokines are produced and released, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), etc.",
              "Clinical manifestations of CRS include fever, tachycardia, hypotension and hypoxia.",
              "In a number of CD19 CAR-T cell studies, CRS was observed due to large-scale T-cell activation upon the recognition of CD19+ malignant cells [31].",
              "IL-6 plays a pivotal role in CRS and tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist mAb, has been approved for the treatment of CRS [32].",

              "Successful use of these models may avoid or lower the risk of CRS.",
              "Another major obstacle for the development of effective adoptive T cell therapies is on-target, off-tumor toxicity.",
              "Such toxicity results from target-antigen recognition on normal tissues because of their expression, albeit low, of the targeted tumor-associated antigen (TAA) [34].",
              "One example is immunoglobulin deficiency occurring in patients treated with the CD19 CAR-T cells due to CD19 expression on the B cells, although it can be effectively managed by regular intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion [35].",
              "Another example is the toxic effect on the melanocyte-rich tissues caused by T cells expressing a TCR specific for the melanocyte differentiation antigen MART-1 [36].",

              "The lethality was thought to be associated with the recognition of the low-level HER2 expressed on lung epithelium by HER2-specific CAR-T cell [37].",
              "While it is clear that the same levels of expression of target-antigen in the essential tissues may have dreadful consequences, the adverse events may be manageable with the same level of expression of the target-antigen in nonessential tissues.",
              "Thus, it is crucial to perform a comprehensive analysis of target antigen expression on normal tissues when developing a CAR/TCR against a previously unrecognized TAA.",
              "At the same time, it is important to verify the effective susceptibility of normal cells killed by genetically targeted T cells.",
              "While target-antigen recognition on normal tissues may cause on-target/off-tumor toxicity, off-target/off-tumor toxicity may result from the unexpected recognition on normal tissues.",
              "It may be induced by cross-reactive peptides on normal tissues or by the formation of mispairing TCRs generating unknown specificities.",
              "In one clinical study, two patients died of cardiogenic shock after the infusion of T cells with a TCR recognizing MAGE-A3 tumor antigen.",
              "Further investigation demonstrated that the MAGE-A3 TCR recognized a peptide from a normal myocardial protein called Tintin [38].",

              "T-cells equipped with the new TCR were shown, in the lab, to kill lung, skin, blood, colon, breast, bone, prostate, ovarian, kidney and cervical cancer cells, while ignoring healthy cells.",

              "Professor Andrew Sewell, lead author on the study and an expert in T-cells from Cardiff University\u2019s School of Medicine, said it was \u201chighly unusual\u201d to find a TCR with such broad cancer specificity and this raised the prospect of \u201cuniversal\u201d cancer therapy.",

              "Cellular infiltrates of lymphoma consist of malignant cells and various host immune system cells that significantly affect the onset and progression of malignant disease as well as the immune response against lymphoma[14,15].",
              "For example, in cHL, only 1% of tumor infiltrates are malignant Reed-Sternberg cells[16].",
              "The T-cell response is triggered by two consecutive signals.",
              "The first signal is T-cell activation via the T-cell receptor (TCR).",
              "This process occurs by the TCR binding to lymphoma cells and to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) receptor, which is most commonly expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs).",
              "Another important signal is the binding of B7-1 and B7-2 receptors to APCs and the CD28 receptor on T cells.",
              "When those two steps are accomplished, effector T cells are activated, differentiated, and expanded[13,17].",
              "However, there are several mechanisms by which lymphoma cells avoid effector T-cell recognition and destruction.",
              "One way to avoid the response is to lose the expression of MHC class I and II molecules.",
              "Loss of class I MHC molecules occurs in approximately 75% of patients with aggressive lymphomas, while loss of class II MHC molecules is noted in approximately 30%[18].",
              "Decreased class I MHC expression is associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with cHL[19].",
              "Additionally, loss of class II MHC expression in immune-privileged sites in primary mediastinal lymphoma (PMLCL) and DLBCL leads to a lower objective response rate (ORR) and lower PFS[20,21].",
              "Another barrier to the immune response is the expression of immunosuppressive proteins, which are so-called checkpoints, on both tumor cells and other immune cells within the tumor infiltrate.",
              "The physiological role of these receptors is to inhibit the autoimmune effects of T cells.",
              "The roles of programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) and its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 and 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2)[13] have been most extensively studied.",
              "Effector T cells in the lymphoma infiltrate frequently express PD-1.",
              "The binding of PD-1 to PD-L1/2 receptors on both tumor cells and other cells of the immune system leads to T-cell exhaustion and apoptosis[13,22].",
              "In addition to receptors of the PD-1 family, other less investigated checkpoints, such as TIGIT (T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains), LAG-3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3), and TIM-3 (T-cell immunoglobulin-3)[23], can modify the immune response and increase the complexity of the inhibition signaling network.",
              "The third way the T-cell response is inhibited in lymphoma is the secretion of inhibitory cytokines by both malignant and immune cells[24-26].",
              "Interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are often elevated in patients with lymphoma and can potentially result in the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) that negatively affect the immune response[24].",
              "IL-12, which initially stimulates the T-cell response but remains present, inhibits the T-cell response and reduces T-cell function[25].",
              "Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) activates a dysfunctional population of effector T cells, which also depletes the immune response[26].",
              "Finally, the fourth mode of inhibition, which is closely related to cytokine stimulation and the immune signaling network, is the increased presence of suppressive and regulatory cells in the tumor infiltrate.",
              "MDSCs significantly inhibit T-cell proliferation and activation.",
              "Thus, the presence of a large number of these cells results in a reduced immune response against malignant cells[27].",
              "In addition, macrophages and monocytes often express PD-L1 and PD-L2, and thus suppress the immune response by binding to the PD-1 receptor of T cells[28].",
              "In addition to effector T cells, Fox3+ and CD25+ regulatory T cells are often found in the tumor infiltrate.",
              "Regulatory T cells play a role in controlling the immune response and are often responsible for the inadequate or suppressed immune response against malignant cells[29].",
              "Lymphoma B-cells alone can induce Fox3 expression in CD4+ lymphocytes, and can thus promote the differentiation of suppressive T-cell clones[30].",
              "There are several strategies for overcoming the mechanisms of immune response inhibition.",
              "The best known and most commonly used method, first used to treat various solid tumors and then in lymphomas, is the inhibition of PD-1 and PD-L1 binding with immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs.",
              "Blocking this checkpoint reduces the exhaustion of effector T cells and restores the ability of T cells to recognize and exterminate malignant cells[13].",
              "Another strategy is the destruction of a malignant clone with an approach that is independent of APC presentation and does not rely on the MHC complex.",
              "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are produced by the in vitro engineering of a patient's T cells to render them capable of recognizing a specific antigen, such as malignant CD19-positive clones.",
              "CAR T cells act independently of MHC complexes and thus overcome resistance dependent on T-cell signaling pathways[31].",
              "The third method is the direct engagement of CD3/CD16 effector immune cells with bispecific antibodies.",
              "One end of these antibodies binds to the CD19 receptor on B-lymphoma cells, and the other end binds to the CD3 receptor on T cells or the CD16 receptor on natural killer cells, thus causing a direct stimulation of the immune system and destruction of the malignant clone[32,33].",
              "Direct inhibition of MDSCs is being investigated for the treatment of solid tumors and might also be a way to enhance the immune response in lymphomas[34].",
              "The anti-CD20 antibody rituximab was the first therapeutic antibody approved in oncology in the late 20th century.",
              "This drug changed the landscape and prognosis of almost all B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases and became the gold standard of treatment[35-38].",
              "Attempts to improve the efficacy of CD20 antibodies have been intensively investigated with two new genetically engineered drugs, atumumab and obinutuzumab (Table \u200b(Table1).",

              "Ofatumumab is a humanized type I monoclonal antibody tested in a variety of B-cell lymphomas but to date has only been approved for the treatment of R/R chronic lymphocytic leukemia[39].",
              "The type II antibody obinutuzumab has had greater success.",
              "The key difference between rituximab and obinutuzumab is the higher affinity of obinutuzumab for Fc\u03b3RIII receptors on effector immune cells and the decreased Fc\u03b3RIIb-mediated internalization of the CD20 receptor into lipid rafts, thus increasing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)[40,41].",
