    "response": "That's a great question. There are so many fascinating discoveries and inventions in science that it's hard to choose just one. But here are some examples that I find very interesting:\n\n- The discovery of **gravity** by Isaac Newton, who was inspired by an apple falling from a tree. Gravity is the force that attracts objects with mass to each other, and it explains why we don't float off the Earth and why the planets orbit the sun[^2^].\n- The invention of the **printing press** by Johannes Gutenberg, who used movable metal type to mass-produce books and spread knowledge across Europe. The printing press revolutionized communication, education, culture and religion[^2^].\n- The discovery of **DNA** by James Watson and Francis Crick, who figured out the structure of the molecule that carries genetic information in all living things. DNA is like a blueprint for life, and it enables inheritance, evolution and biotechnology[^2^].\n- The invention of the **wheel** by ancient humans, who used it to transport goods, people and animals more easily and efficiently. The wheel is one of the oldest and most influential inventions in history, and it is still used in many modern devices[^2^].\n- The discovery of **X-rays** by Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, who accidentally found a new type of radiation that could penetrate solid objects and reveal their internal structures. X-rays are used for medical imaging, security scanning, art analysis and more[^2^].\n\nThese are just some of the many amazing scientific discoveries and inventions that have changed our world.

              "At the very end of his life, Newton told a story which has become one of the most enduring legends in the history of science.",
              "Dining with fellow Royal Society member William Stukeley, Newton remembered that he had been sitting beneath an apple tree at his family home of Woolsthorpe, and a falling apple had prompted him to think about gravity.",
              "The story was also told by other people who knew Newton, including his niece Catherine who cared for him in his later years.",
              "However, the myth that Newton was hit on the head by the apple was a later invention.",

              "There are many situations in astronomy, however, in which we do need to include the two mass terms\u2014for example, when two stars or two galaxies orbit each other.",
              "Including the mass term allows us to use this formula in a new way.",
              "If we can measure the motions (distances and orbital periods) of objects acting under their mutual gravity, then the formula will permit us to deduce their masses.",
              "For example, we can calculate the mass of the Sun by using the distances and orbital periods of the planets, or the mass of Jupiter by noting the motions of its moons.",
              "Indeed, Newton\u2019s reformulation of Kepler\u2019s third law is one of the most powerful concepts in astronomy.",
              "Our ability to deduce the masses of objects from their motions is key to understanding the nature and evolution of many astronomical bodies.",
              "We will use this law repeatedly throughout this text in calculations that range from the orbits of comets to the interactions of galaxies.",
              "A planet like Earth is found orbiting its star at a distance of 1 AU in 0.",
              "71 Earth-year.",
              "Can you use Newton\u2019s version of Kepler\u2019s third law to find the mass of the star?",
              "(Remember that compared to the mass of a star, the mass of an earthlike planet can be considered negligible.)",
              "Solution In the formula \\(a^3 = (M_1 + M_2) \\times P_2\\), the factor \\(M_1 + M_2\\) would now be approximately equal to \\(M_1\\) (the mass of the star), since the planet\u2019s mass is so small by comparison.",
              "Then the formula becomes \\(a_3 = M_1 \\times P_2\\), and we can solve for \\(M_1\\): \\[M_1= \\frac{a^3}{P^2} \\nonumber\\] Since \\(a = 1\\), \\(a^3 = 1\\), so \\[M_1= \\frac{1}{P_2}= \\frac{1}{0.",
              "71^2}=\\frac{1}{0.",
              "5}=2 \\nonumber\\] So the mass of the star is twice the mass of our Sun.",
              "(Remember that this way of expressing the law has units in terms of Earth and the Sun, so masses are expressed in units of the mass of our Sun.)",
              "Suppose a star with twice the mass of our Sun had an earthlike planet that took 4 years to orbit the star.",
              "At what distance (semimajor axis) would this planet orbit its star?",
              "Again, we can neglect the mass of the planet.",
              "So \\(M_1 = 2\\) and \\(P = 4\\) years.",
              "The formula is \\(a^3 = M_1 \\times P_2\\), so \\(a^3 = 2 \\times 4^2 = 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\\).",
              "So a is the cube root of 32.",

              "You might like to try a simulation that lets you move the Sun, Earth, Moon, and space station to see the effects of changing their distances on their gravitational forces and orbital paths.",
              "You can even turn off gravity and see what happens.",
              "Gravity, the attractive force between all masses, is what keeps the planets in orbit.",
              "Newton\u2019s universal law of gravitation relates the gravitational force to mass and distance: \\[F_{gravity}=G \\dfrac{M_1M_2}{R^2} \\nonumber\\] The force of gravity is what gives us our sense of weight.",

              "Johannes Gutenberg is known for having designed and built the first known mechanized printing press in Europe.",
              "In 1455 he used it to print the Gutenberg Bible, which is one of the earliest books in the world to be printed from movable type.",
              "The type of mechanized printing press that Johannes Gutenberg created in the 15th century made it possible for the first time in Europe to manufacture large numbers of books for relatively little cost.",
              "Books and other printed matter consequently became available to a wide general audience, greatly contributing to the spread of literacy and education in Europe.",
              "Gutenberg did not, however, invent printing with movable type, which occurred in Korea in the 14th century.",
              "Available records indicate that Johannes Gutenberg spent most, if not all, of his working life in the cities of Strassburg (now Strasbourg, France) and Mainz (now in Germany).",
              "Johannes Gutenberg, (born 14th century, Mainz [Germany]\u2014died probably February 3, 1468, Mainz), German craftsman and inventor who originated a method of printing from movable type.",
              "Elements of his invention are thought to have included a metal alloy that could melt readily and cool quickly to form durable reusable type, an oil-based ink that could be made sufficiently thick to adhere well to metal type and transfer well to vellum or paper, and a new press, likely adapted from those used in producing wine, oil, or paper, for applying firm even pressure to printing surfaces.",
              "None of these features existed in the European technique used up to that time for stamping letters on various surfaces or in woodblock printing.",
              "Gutenberg\u2019s printing press was considered a history-changing invention, making books widely accessible and ushering in an \u201cinformation revolution.",
              "\u201d Gutenberg was long thought to have also invented the punch-matrix system of casting metal type (in which a character engraved on one end of a hard metal rod, the punch, was used to strike an impression into a softer metal plate, the matrix, into which molten metal was poured to form any number of virtually identical pieces of type).",
              "However, in the early 2000s a computer-aided analysis of Gutenberg\u2019s printed work showed that there was too much variation in characters of a given sort (e.",
              "g., the letter i) for his type to have been cast that way.",
              "Some scholars now think that the punch-matrix system emerged several years after Gutenberg\u2019s death.",
              "Gutenberg was the son of a patrician of Mainz.",
              "What little information exists about him, other than that he had acquired skill in metalwork, comes from documents of financial transactions.",
              "Exiled from Mainz in the course of a bitter struggle between the guilds of that city and the patricians, Gutenberg moved to Strassburg (now Strasbourg, France) probably between 1428 and 1430.",
              "Records put his presence there from 1434 to 1444.",
              "He engaged in such crafts as gem cutting, and he also taught a number of pupils.",
              "Some of his partners, who became aware that Gutenberg was engaged in work that he kept secret from them, insisted that, since they had advanced him considerable sums, they should become partners in these activities as well.",
              "Thus, in 1438 a five-year contract was drawn up between him and three other men: Hans Riffe, Andreas Dritzehn, and Andreas Heilmann.",
              "It contained a clause whereby in case of the death of one of the partners, his heirs were not to enter the company but were to be compensated financially.",
              "When Andreas Dritzehn died at Christmas 1438, his heirs, trying to circumvent the terms of the contract, began a lawsuit against Gutenberg in which they demanded to be made partners.",
              "They lost the suit, but the trial revealed that Gutenberg was working on a new invention.",
              "Witnesses testified that a carpenter named Conrad Saspach had advanced sums to Andreas Dritzehn for the building of a wooden press, and Hans Du\u0308nne, a goldsmith, declared that he had sold to Gutenberg, as early as 1436, 100 guilders\u2019 worth of printing materials.",
              "Gutenberg, apparently well along the way to completing his invention, was anxious to keep secret the nature of the enterprise.",
              "After March 12, 1444, Gutenberg\u2019s activities are undocumented for a number of years, but it is doubtful that he returned immediately to Mainz, for the quarrel between patricians and guilds had been renewed in that city.",
              "In October 1448, however, Gutenberg was back in Mainz to borrow more money, which he received from a relative.",
              "By 1450 his printing experiments had apparently reached a considerable degree of refinement, for he was able to persuade Johann Fust, a wealthy financier, to lend him 800 guilders\u2014a very substantial capital investment, for which the tools and equipment for printing were to act as securities.",
              "Two years later Fust made an investment of an additional 800 guilders for a partnership in the enterprise.",
              "Fust and Gutenberg eventually became estranged, Fust, apparently, wanting a safe and quick return on his investment, while Gutenberg aimed at perfection rather than promptness.",
              "Fust won a suit against him, the record of which is preserved, in part, in what is called the Helmaspergersches Notariatsinstrument (the Helmasperger notarial instrument), dated November 6, 1455, now in the library of the University of Go\u0308ttingen.",
              "Gutenberg was ordered to pay Fust the total sum of the two loans and compound interest (probably totaling 2,020 guilders).",
              "Traditional historiography suggested that this settlement ruined Gutenberg, but more recent scholarship suggests that it favoured him, allowing him to operate a printing shop through the 1450s and maybe into the 1460s."

              "Though movable type was already in use in East Asia, Gutenberg invented the printing press,[2] which later spread across the world.",
              "[3] His work led to an information revolution and the unprecedented mass-spread of literature throughout Europe.",
              "It also had a direct impact on the development of the Renaissance, Reformation, and humanist movements, as all of them have been described as \"unthinkable\" without Gutenberg's invention.",
              "[4] His many contributions to printing include the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type;",
              "the use of oil-based ink for printing books;",
              "[5] adjustable molds;",
              "[6] mechanical movable type;",
              "and the invention of a wooden printing press similar to the agricultural screw presses of the period.",
              "[7] Gutenberg's method for making type is traditionally considered to have included a type metal alloy and a hand mould for casting type.",
              "The alloy was a mixture of lead, tin, and antimony that melted at a relatively low temperature for faster and more economical casting, cast well, and created a durable type.",
              "[8] His major work, the Gutenberg Bible, was the first printed version of the Bible and has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.",
              "Described as the \"man of the millennium\", Gutenberg is often cited as among the most influential figures in human history.",
              "He has been commemorated around the world and is a frequent namesake.",

              "[11][b] The year 1400 is commonly assigned to Gutenberg, \"for the sake of convenience\".",
              "[13] Tradition also holds his birthdate to be on the feast day of Saint John the Baptist, 24 June, since children of the time were often named after their birthday's patron saint.",
              "[15] There is no verification for this assumption, since the name \"Johannes\"\u2014and variants such as \"Johann\", \"Henne\", \"Hengin\" and \"Henchen\"\u2014was widely popular at the time.",

              "[21] according to the historian Ferdinand Geldner [de] this disconnect may have disillusioned him from high society and encouraged his unusual career as an inventor.",
              "[22][f] The patrician (Patrizier) class of Mainz\u2014the Gutenbergs included\u2014held a privileged socioeconomic status, and their efforts to preserve this put them into frequent conflict with the younger generations of guild (Zu\u0308nfte) craftsmen.",

              "[28] No documents survive concerning Gutenberg's childhood or youth.",
              "[20] The biographer Albert Kapr [de] remarked that \"most books on Gutenberg pass over this period with the remark that not a single fact is known\".",

              "[33] Nothing is now known of Gutenberg's life for the next fifteen years, but in March 1434, a letter by him indicates that he was living in Strasbourg, where he had some relatives on his mother's side.",
              "He also appears to have been a goldsmith member enrolled in the Strasbourg militia.",
              "In 1437, there is evidence that he was instructing a wealthy tradesman on polishing gems, but where he had acquired this knowledge is unknown.",
              "In 1436/37 his name also comes up in court in connection with a broken promise of marriage to a woman from Strasbourg, Ennelin.",

              "Arbogast parish.",
              "It was in Strasbourg in 1440 that he is said to have perfected and unveiled the secret of printing based on his research, mysteriously entitled Aventur und Kunst (enterprise and art).",
              "It is not clear what work he was engaged in, or whether some early trials with printing from movable type were conducted there.",
              "After this, there is a gap of four years in the record.",
              "In 1448, he was back in Mainz, where he took out a loan from his brother-in-law Arnold Gelthus, possibly for a printing press or related paraphernalia.",
              "By this date, Gutenberg may have been familiar with intaglio printing;",
              "it is claimed that he had worked on copper engravings with an artist known as the Master of Playing Cards.",
              "[36] By 1450, the press was in operation, and a German poem had been printed, possibly the first item to be printed there.",
              "[37] Gutenberg was able to convince the wealthy moneylender Johann Fust for a loan of 800 guilders.",
              "Peter Scho\u0308ffer, who became Fust's son-in-law, also joined the enterprise.",
              "Scho\u0308ffer had worked as a scribe in Paris and is believed to have designed some of the first typefaces.",
              "Gutenberg's workshop was set up at Humbrechthof, a property belonging to a distant relative.",
              "It is not clear when Gutenberg conceived the Bible project, but for this, he borrowed another 800 guilders from Fust, and work commenced in 1452.",
              "At the same time, the press was also printing other, more lucrative texts (possibly Latin grammars).",
              "There is also some speculation that there were two presses: one for the pedestrian texts and one for the Bible.",
              "One of the profit-making enterprises of the new press was the printing of thousands of indulgences for the church, documented from 1454 to 1455.",
              "[38] In 1455, Gutenberg completed his 42-line Bible, known as the Gutenberg Bible.",
              "About 180 copies were printed, three quarters on paper, and the rest on vellum.",
              "[39][40] Some time in 1456, there was a dispute between Gutenberg and Fust, in which Fust demanded his money back, and accused Gutenberg of misusing the funds.",
              "Gutenberg's two rounds of financing from Fust, totaling 1,600 guilders at 6% interest, now amounted to 2,026 guilders.",
              "[41] Fust sued at the archbishop's court.",
              "A legal document, from November 1455, records that there was a partnership for a \"project of the books,\" the funds for which Gutenberg had used for other purposes, according to Fust.",
              "The court decided in favor of Fust, giving him control over the Bible printing workshop and half of all printed Bibles.",
              "Thus, Gutenberg was effectively bankrupt, but it appears he retained (or restarted) a small printing shop and participated in the printing of a Bible in the town of Bamberg around 1459, for which he seems at least to have supplied the type.",
              "But since his printed books never carry his name or a date, it is difficult to be certain, and there is consequently a considerable scholarly debate on this subject.",
              "It is also possible that the large Catholicon dictionary, 300 copies of 754 pages, printed in Mainz in 1460, was executed in his workshop.",
              "Meanwhile, the Fust\u2013Scho\u0308ffer shop was the first in Europe to bring out a book with the printer's name and date, the Mainz Psalter of August 1457, and while proudly proclaiming the mechanical process by which it had been produced, it made no mention of Gutenberg.",
              "In 1462, during the devastating Mainz Diocesan Feud, Mainz was sacked by Archbishop Adolph von Nassau.",
              "On 18 January 1465, Gutenberg's achievements were recognized by Archbishop von Nassau.",
              "[42] He was given the title Hofmann (gentleman of the court).",

              "[43] Gutenberg died in 1468 and was buried likely as a tertiary in the Franciscan church at Mainz.",
              "[44] This church and the cemetery were later destroyed, and Gutenberg's grave is now lost.",
              "[43] In 1504, he was mentioned as the inventor of typography in a book by Professor Ivo Wittig.",
              "It was not until 1567 that the first portrait of Gutenberg, almost certainly an imaginary reconstruction, appeared in Heinrich Pantaleon's biography of famous Germans.",
              "[43] Gutenberg's early printing process, and what texts he printed with movable type, are not known in great detail.",
              "His later Bibles were printed in such a way as to have required large quantities of type, some estimates suggesting as many as 100,000 individual sorts.",

              ", it is thought that the Gutenberg\u2013Fust shop might have employed as many as 25 craftsmen.",
              "[citation needed] Gutenberg's technique of making movable type remains unclear.",
              "In the following decades, punches and copper matrices became standardized in the rapidly disseminating printing presses across Europe.",
              "Whether Gutenberg used this sophisticated technique or a somewhat primitive version has been the subject of considerable debate.",
              "In the standard process of making type, a hard metal punch (made by punchcutting, with the letter carved back to front) is hammered into a softer copper bar, creating a matrix.",
              "This is then placed into a hand-held mould and a piece of type, or \"sort\", is cast by filling the mould with molten type-metal;",
              "this cools almost at once, and the resulting piece of type can be removed from the mould.",
              "The matrix can be reused to create hundreds, or thousands, of identical sorts so that the same character appearing anywhere within the book will appear very uniform, giving rise, over time, to the development of distinct styles of typefaces or fonts.",
              "After casting, the sorts are arranged into type cases, and used to make up pages which are inked and printed, a procedure which can be repeated hundreds, or thousands, of times.",
              "The sorts can be reused in any combination, earning the process the name of \"movable type\".",
              "The invention of the making of types with punch, matrix and mold has been widely attributed to Gutenberg.",
              "However, recent evidence suggests that Gutenberg's process was somewhat different.",
              "If he used the punch and matrix approach, all his letters should have been nearly identical, with some variation due to miscasting and inking.",
              "However, the type used in Gutenberg's earliest work shows other variations.",
              "[47] In 2001, the physicist Blaise Agu\u0308era y Arcas and Princeton librarian Paul Needham, used digital scans of a Papal bull in the Scheide Library, Princeton, to carefully compare the same letters (types) appearing in different parts of the printed text.",
              "[47][48] The irregularities in Gutenberg's type, particularly in simple characters such as the hyphen, suggested that the variations could not have come either from ink smear or from wear and damage on the pieces of metal on the types themselves.",
              "Although some identical types are clearly used on other pages, other variations, subjected to detailed image analysis, suggested that they could not have been produced from the same matrix.",
              "Transmitted light pictures of the page also appeared to reveal substructures in the type that could not arise from traditional punchcutting techniques.",
              "They hypothesized that the method involved impressing simple shapes to create alphabets in \"cuneiform\" style in a matrix made of some soft material, perhaps sand.",
              "Casting the type would destroy the mould, and the matrix would need to be recreated to make each additional sort.",
              "This could explain the variations in the type, as well as the substructures observed in the printed images.",
              "Thus, they speculated that \"the decisive factor for the birth of typography\", the use of reusable moulds for casting type, was a more progressive process than was previously thought.",
              "[49] They suggested that the additional step of using the punch to create a mould that could be reused many times was not taken until twenty years later, in the 1470s.",
              "Others have not accepted some or all of their suggestions, and have interpreted the evidence in other ways, and the truth of the matter remains uncertain.",
              "[50] A 1568 book Batavia by Hadrianus Junius from Holland claims that the idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster in the 1430s and may have brought some of his equipment from Haarlem to Mainz.",
              "While Coster appears to have experimented with moulds and castable metal type, there is no evidence that he had actually printed anything with this technology.",
              "He was an inventor and a goldsmith.",
              "However, there is one indirect supporter of the claim that Coster might be the inventor.",
              "The author of the Cologne Chronicle of 1499 quotes Ulrich Zell, the first printer of Cologne, that printing was performed in Mainz in 1450, but that some type of printing of lower quality had previously occurred in the Netherlands.",

              "The first securely dated book by Dutch printers is from 1471,[52] and the Coster connection is today regarded as a mere legend.",
              "[53] The 19th-century printer and typefounder Fournier Le Jeune suggested that Gutenberg was not using type cast with a reusable matrix, but wooden types that were carved individually.",
              "A similar suggestion was made by Nash in 2004.",
              "[50] This remains possible, albeit entirely unproven.",
              "Between 1450 and 1455, Gutenberg printed several texts, some of which remain unidentified;",

              "7 Ways the Printing Press Changed the World | HISTORY",
              "By: Dave Roos Updated: March 27, 2023 | Original: August 28, 2019 Knowledge is power, as the saying goes, and the invention of the mechanical movable type printing press helped disseminate knowledge wider and faster than ever before.",
              "German goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg is credited with inventing the printing press around 1436, although he was far from the first to automate the book-printing process.",
              "Woodblock printing in China dates back to the 9th century and Korean bookmakers were printing with moveable metal type a century before Gutenberg.",
              "But most historians believe Gutenberg\u2019s adaptation, which employed a screw-type wine press to squeeze down evenly on the inked metal type, was the key to unlocking the modern age.",
              "With the newfound ability to inexpensively mass-produce books on every imaginable topic, revolutionary ideas and priceless ancient knowledge were placed in the hands of every literate European, whose numbers doubled every century.",
              "Here are just some of the ways the printing press helped pull Europe out of the Middle Ages and accelerate human progress.",
              "Gutenberg didn\u2019t live to see the immense impact of his invention.",
              "His greatest accomplishment was the first print run of the Bible in Latin, which took three years to print around 200 copies, a miraculously speedy achievement in the day of hand-copied manuscripts.",
              "But as historian Ada Palmer explains, Gutenberg\u2019s invention wasn\u2019t profitable until there was a distribution network for books.",
              "Palmer, a professor of early modern European history at the University of Chicago, compares early printed books like the Gutenberg Bible to how e-books struggled to find a market before Amazon introduced the Kindle.",
              "\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019ve printed 200 copies of the Bible;",
              "there are about three people in your town who can read the Bible in Latin,\u201d says Palmer.",
              "\u201cWhat are you going to do with the other 197 copies?",
              "\u201d Gutenberg died penniless, his presses impounded by his creditors.",
              "Other German printers fled for greener pastures, eventually arriving in Venice, which was the central shipping hub of the Mediterranean in the late 15th century.",
              "\u201cIf you printed 200 copies of a book in Venice, you could sell five to the captain of each ship leaving port,\u201d says Palmer, which created the first mass-distribution mechanism for printed books.",
              "The ships left Venice carrying religious texts and literature, but also breaking news from across the known world.",
              "Printers in Venice sold four-page news pamphlets to sailors, and when their ships arrived in distant ports, local printers would copy the pamphlets and hand them off to riders who would race them off to dozens of towns.",
              "Since literacy rates were still very low in the 1490s, locals would gather at the pub to hear a paid reader recite the latest news, which was everything from bawdy scandals to war reports.",
              "\u201cThis radically changed the consumption of news,\u201d says Palmer.",
              "\u201cIt made it normal to go check the news every day.",
              "\u201d The Italian Renaissance began nearly a century before Gutenberg invented his printing press when 14th-century political leaders in Italian city-states like Rome and Florence set out to revive the Ancient Roman educational system that had produced giants like Caesar, Cicero and Seneca.",
              "One of the chief projects of the early Renaissance was to find long-lost works by figures like Plato and Aristotle and republish them.",
              "Wealthy patrons funded expensive expeditions across the Alps in search of isolated monasteries.",
              "Italian emissaries spent years in the Ottoman Empire learning enough Ancient Greek and Arabic to translate and copy rare texts into Latin.",
              "The operation to retrieve classic texts was in action long before the printing press, but publishing the texts had been arduously slow and prohibitively expensive for anyone other than the richest of the rich.",
              "Palmer says that one hand-copied book in the 14th century cost as much as a house and libraries cost a small fortune.",
              "The largest European library in 1300 was the university library of Paris, which had 300 total manuscripts.",
              "By the 1490s, when Venice was the book-printing capital of Europe, a printed copy of a great work by Cicero only cost a month\u2019s salary for a school teacher.",
              "The printing press didn\u2019t launch the Renaissance, but it vastly accelerated the rediscovery and sharing of knowledge.",
              "\u201cSuddenly, what had been a project to educate only the few wealthiest elite in this society could now become a project to put a library in every medium-sized town, and a library in the house of every reasonably wealthy merchant family,\u201d says Palmer.",
              "There\u2019s a famous quote attributed to German religious reformer Martin Luther that sums up the role of the printing press in the Protestant Reformation: \u201cPrinting is the ultimate gift of God and the greatest one.",
              "\u201d Luther wasn\u2019t the first theologian to question the Church, but he was the first to widely publish his message.",
              "Other \u201cheretics\u201d saw their movements quickly quashed by Church authorities and the few copies of their writings easily destroyed.",
              "But the timing of Luther\u2019s crusade against the selling of indulgences coincided with an explosion of printing presses across Europe.",
              "As the legend goes, Luther nailed his \u201c95 Theses\u201d to the church door in Wittenberg on October 31, 1517.",
              "Palmer says that broadsheet copies of Luther\u2019s document were being printed in London as quickly as 17 days later.",
              "Thanks to the printing press and the timely power of his message, Luther became the world\u2019s first best-selling author.",
              "Luther\u2019s translation of the New Testament into German sold 5,000 copies in just two weeks.",
              "From 1518 to 1525, Luther\u2019s writings accounted for a third of all books sold in Germany and his German Bible went through more than 430 editions.",
              "The English philosopher Francis Bacon, who\u2019s credited with developing the scientific method, wrote in 1620 that the three inventions that forever changed the world were gunpowder, the nautical compass and the printing press.",
              "For millennia, science was a largely solitary pursuit.",
              "Great mathematicians and natural philosophers were separated by geography, language and the sloth-like pace of hand-written publishing.",
              "Not only were handwritten copies of scientific data expensive and hard to come by, they were also prone to human error.",
              "With the newfound ability to publish and share scientific findings and experimental data with a wide audience, science took great leaps forward in the 16th and 17th centuries.",
              "When developing his sun-centric model of the galaxy in the early 1500s, for example, Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus relied not only on his own heavenly observations, but on printed astronomical tables of planetary movements.",
              "When historian Elizabeth Eisenstein wrote her 1980 book about the impact of the printing press, she said that its biggest gift to science wasn\u2019t necessarily the speed at which ideas could spread with printed books, but the accuracy with which the original data were copied.",
              "With printed formulas and mathematical tables in hand, scientists could trust the fidelity of existing data and devote more energy to breaking new ground.",
              "\u201cWhenever a new information technology comes along, and this includes the printing press, among the very first groups to be \u2018loud\u2019 in it are the people who were silenced in the earlier system, which means radical voices,\u201d says Palmer.",
              "It takes effort to adopt a new information technology, whether it\u2019s the ham radio, an internet bulletin board, or Instagram.",
              "The people most willing to take risks and make the effort to be early adopters are those who had no voice before that technology existed.",
              "\u201cIn the print revolution, that meant radical heresies, radical Christian splinter groups, radical egalitarian groups, critics of the government,\u201d says Palmer.",
              "\u201cThe Protestant Reformation is only one of many symptoms of print enabling these voices to be heard.",
              "\u201d As critical and alternative opinions entered the public discourse, those in power tried to censor it.",
              "Before the printing press, censorship was easy.",
              "All it required was killing the \u201cheretic\u201d and burning his or her handful of notebooks.",
              "But after the printing press, Palmer says it became nearly impossible to destroy all copies of a dangerous idea.",
              "And the more dangerous a book was claimed to be, the more the people wanted to read it.",
              "Every time the Church published a list of banned books, the booksellers knew exactly what they should print next.",
              "During the Enlightenment era, philosophers like John Locke, Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were widely read among an increasingly literate populace.",
              "Their elevation of critical reasoning above custom and tradition encouraged people to question religious authority and prize personal liberty.",
              "Increasing democratization of knowledge in the Enlightenment era led to the development of public opinion and its power to topple the ruling elite.",
              "Writing in pre-Revolution France, Louis-Seba\u0301stien Mercier declared: \u201cA great and momentous revolution in our ideas has taken place within the last thirty years.",
              "Public opinion has now become a preponderant power in Europe, one that cannot be resisted.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "one may hope that enlightened ideas will bring about the greatest good on Earth and that tyrants of all kinds will tremble before the universal cry that echoes everywhere, awakening Europe from its slumbers.",
              "\u201d \u201c[Printing] is the most beautiful gift from heaven,\u201d continues Mercier.",
              "\u201cIt soon will change the countenance of the universe.",
              ".",
              ".",

              ".",
              "Tremble, therefore, tyrants of the world!",
              "Tremble before the virtuous writer!",
              "\u201d Even the illiterate couldn\u2019t resist the attraction of revolutionary Enlightenment authors, Palmer says.",
              "When Thomas Paine published \u201cCommon Sense\u201d in 1776, the literacy rate in the American colonies was around 15 percent, yet there were more copies printed and sold of the revolutionary tract than the entire population of the colonies.",
              "The Industrial Revolution didn\u2019t get into full swing in Europe until the mid-18th century, but you can make the argument that the printing press introduced the world to the idea of machines \u201cstealing jobs\u201d from workers.",
              "Before Gutenberg\u2019s paradigm-shifting invention, scribes were in high demand.",
              "Bookmakers would employ dozens of trained artisans to painstakingly hand-copy and illuminate manuscripts.",
              "But by the late 15th century, the printing press had rendered their unique skillset all but obsolete.",
              "On the flip side, the huge demand for printed material spawned the creation of an entirely new industry of printers, brick-and-mortar booksellers and enterprising street peddlers.",
              "Among those who got his start as a printer's apprentice was future Founding Father, Benjamin Franklin.",
              "Take a closer look at the inventions that have transformed our lives far beyond our homes (the steam engine), our planet (the telescope) and our wildest dreams (the internet).",

              "The discovery in 1953 of the double helix, the twisted-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), by James Watson and Francis Crick marked a milestone in the history of science and gave rise to modern molecular biology, which is largely concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells.",
              "In short order, their discovery yielded ground-breaking insights into the genetic code and protein synthesis.",
              "During the 1970s and 1980s, it helped to produce new and powerful scientific techniques, specifically recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies, techniques on which today's multi-billion dollar biotechnology industry is founded.",
              "Major current advances in science, namely genetic fingerprinting and modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and the promise, yet unfulfilled, of gene therapy, all have their origins in Watson and Crick's inspired work.",
              "The double helix has not only reshaped biology, it has become a cultural icon, represented in sculpture, visual art, jewelry, and toys.",
              "Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information, but they did not know what a gene actually looked like structurally and chemically, or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation.",
              "In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria.",
              "Nevertheless, many scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins, much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform a multitude of biological functions in the cell.",
              "Crick and Watson recognized, at an early stage in their careers, that gaining a detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional configuration of the gene was the central problem in molecular biology.",
              "Without such knowledge, heredity and reproduction could not be understood.",
              "They seized on this problem during their very first encounter, in the summer of 1951, and pursued it with single-minded focus over the course of the next eighteen months.",
              "This meant taking on the arduous intellectual task of immersing themselves in all the fields of science involved: genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography.",
              "Drawing on the experimental results of others (they conducted no DNA experiments of their own), taking advantage of their complementary scientific backgrounds in physics and X-ray crystallography (Crick) and viral and bacterial genetics (Watson), and relying on their brilliant intuition, persistence, and luck, the two showed that DNA had a structure sufficiently complex and yet elegantly simple enough to be the master molecule of life.",
              "Other researchers had made important but seemingly unconnected findings about the composition of DNA;",
              "it fell to Watson and Crick to unify these disparate findings into a coherent theory of genetic transfer.",
              "The organic chemist Alexander Todd had determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups.",
              "The biochemist Erwin Chargaff had found that while the amount of DNA and of its four types of bases--the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine(T)--varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C.",
              "Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape.",
              "Linus Pauling, then the world's leading physical chemist, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms. Moreover, he had pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to uncover the structure of DNA.",
              "Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his own model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.",
              "The time, then, was ripe for their discovery.",
              "After several failed attempts at model building, including their own ill-fated three-stranded version and one in which the bases were paired like with like (adenine with adenine, etc.)",
              ", they achieved their break-through.",
              "Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect.",
              "On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models by moving a hydrogen atom from a position where it bonded with oxygen to a neighboring position where it bonded with nitrogen.",
              "While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds.",
              "If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder.",
              "The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis, all of which were structural features demanded by the X-ray evidence.",
              "Similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the fact, also established by the X-ray diffraction pattern, that the backbones ran in opposite direction to each other, one up, the other down.",
              "Watson and Crick published their findings in a one-page paper, with the understated title \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\" in the British scientific weekly Nature on April 25, 1953, illustrated with a schematic drawing of the double helix by Crick's wife, Odile.",
              "A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors.",
              "Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G.",
              "The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain.",
              "Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in a second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.",
              "The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions.",
              "During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis, revolutionary then but widely-accepted since, that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted.",
              "Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first.",
              "Its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened, only towards the end of the 1950s, when the structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Arthur Kornberg, and others.",
              "Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery.",
              "As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\"",
              "Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement, but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\"",
              "He revealed that \"years later she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\"",
              "As he recounted her words, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally I thought nothing of it.\"",
              "Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy.",
              "Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into his privacy, and a distortion of his motives.",
              "He waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication.",
              "He eventually became reconciled to Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.",
              "A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, which was shown to them, without her knowledge, by her estranged colleague, Maurice Wilkins, and by Max Perutz.",
              "Her evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel.",
              "Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery.",
              "Yet, they gave her scant acknowledgment.",
              "Even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them.",
              "She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two.",
              "She soon left DNA research to study tobacco mosaic virus.",
              "She became friends with both Watson and Crick, and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house (Franklin died in 1958).",
              "Crick believed that he and Watson used her evidence appropriately, while admitting that their patronizing attitude towards her, so apparent in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.",

              "Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect.",
              "On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models by moving a hydrogen atom from a position where it bonded with oxygen to a neighboring position where it bonded with nitrogen.",
              "While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds.",
              "If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder.",
              "The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis, all of which were structural features demanded by the X-ray evidence.",
              "Similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the fact, also established by the X-ray diffraction pattern, that the backbones ran in opposite direction to each other, one up, the other down.",
              "Watson and Crick published their findings in a one-page paper, with the understated title \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\" in the British scientific weekly Nature on April 25, 1953, illustrated with a schematic drawing of the double helix by Crick's wife, Odile.",
              "A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors.",
              "Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G.",
              "The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain.",
              "Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in a second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.",
              "The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions.",
              "During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis, revolutionary then but widely-accepted since, that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted.",
              "Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first.",
              "Its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened, only towards the end of the 1950s, when the structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Arthur Kornberg, and others.",
              "Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery.",
              "As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\"",
              "Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement, but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\"",
              "He revealed that \"years later she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\"",
              "As he recounted her words, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally I thought nothing of it.\"",
              "Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy.",
              "Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into his privacy, and a distortion of his motives.",
              "He waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication.",
              "He eventually became reconciled to Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.",
              "A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, which was shown to them, without her knowledge, by her estranged colleague, Maurice Wilkins, and by Max Perutz.",
              "Her evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel.",
              "Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery.",
              "Yet, they gave her scant acknowledgment.",
              "Even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them.",
              "She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two.",
              "She soon left DNA research to study tobacco mosaic virus.",
              "She became friends with both Watson and Crick, and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house (Franklin died in 1958).",
              "Crick believed that he and Watson used her evidence appropriately, while admitting that their patronizing attitude towards her, so apparent in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.",

              "As a way to efficiently carry goods for long distances, wheeled vehicles allowed for the broadening of trade networks.",
              "With access to a wider market, craftspeople could more easily specialize, and communities could expand if there was no need to live close to food production areas.",
              "In a very real sense, wheeled vehicles facilitated periodic farmers markets.",
              "Not all changes brought by wheeled vehicles were good ones, however: With the wheel, imperialist elites were able to expand their range of control, and wars could be waged farther afield.",
              "It wasn't simply the invention of wheels alone that created these changes.",
              "Wheels are most useful in combination with suitable draft animals such as horses and oxen, as well as prepared roadways.",
              "The earliest planked roadway we know of, Plumstead in the United Kingdom, dates to about the same time as the wheel, 5,700 years ago.",
              "Cattle were domesticated about 10,000 years ago and horses probably about 5,500 years ago.",
              "Wheeled vehicles were in use across Europe by the third millennium BCE, as evidenced by the discovery of clay models of high sided four-wheeled carts throughout the Danube and Hungarian plains, such as that from the site of Szigetszentmarton in Hungary.",
              "More than 20 wooden wheels dated to the late and final Neolithic have been discovered in different wetland contexts across central Europe, between about 3300\u20132800 BCE.",
              "Wheels were invented in the Americas, too, but because draft animals were not available, wheeled vehicles were not an American innovation.",
              "Trade flourished in the Americas, as did craft specialization, imperialism and wars, road construction, and the expansion of settlements, all without wheeled vehicles: but there's no doubt that having the wheel did drive (pardon the pun) many social and economic changes in Europe and Asia.",
              "The earliest evidence for wheeled vehicles appears simultaneously in Southwest Asia and Northern Europe, about 3500 BCE.",
              "In Mesopotamia, that evidence is from images, pictographs representing four-wheeled wagons found inscribed on clay tablets dated to the late Uruk period of Mesopotamia.",

              "The first carts with wheels and axles involved a fixed wheel and axle design, where the wheel and the axle turned together.",
              "Essentially, pegs were used to hold the wheel and axle in place, and all of the movement was done by this combined axle-wheel.",
              "It wasn't until later in wheel history that carts were designed which used holes, rather than pegs, to hold the axles in place.",
              "This is harder because, in order to make a fixed axle with revolving wheels, the ends of the axle and the holes in the center of the wheels needed to be almost perfectly smooth and round.",
              "Otherwise, friction would prevent the wheels from turning.",
              "The axles also had to fit snugly inside the holes in the wheels, but remain loose enough that they were free to rotate.",

              "The X-ray emerged from the laboratory and into widespread use in a startlingly brief leap: within a year of Roentgen's announcement of his discovery, the application of X-rays to diagnosis and therapy was an established part of the medical profession.",
              "Roentgen's scientific career was one beset with difficulties.",
              "As a student in Holland, he was expelled from the Utrecht Technical School for a prank committed by another student.",
              "His lack of a diploma initially prevented him from obtaining a position at the University of Wu\u0308rzburg even after he received his doctorate, although he eventually was accepted.",
              "His experiments at Wu\u0308rzburg focused on light phenomena and other emissions generated by discharging electrical current in so-called \"Crookes tubes,\" glass bulbs with positive and negative electrodes, evacuated of air, which display a fluorescent glow when a high voltage current is passed through it.",
              "He was particularly interested in cathode rays and in assessing their range outside of charged tubes.",
              "On November 8, 1895, Roentgen noticed that when he shielded the tube with heavy black cardboard, the green fluorescent light caused a platinobarium screen nine feet at away to glow - too far away to be reacting to the cathode rays as he understood them.",
              "He determined the fluorescence was caused by invisible rays originating from the Crookes tube he was using to study cathode rays (later recognized as electrons), which penetrated the opaque black paper wrapped around the tube.",
              "Further experiments revealed that this new type of ray was capable of passing through most substances, including the soft tissues of the body, but left bones and metals visible.",
              "One of his earliest photographic plates from his experiments was a film of his wife Bertha's hand, with her wedding ring clearly visible.",
              "To test his observations and enhance his scientific data, Roentgen plunged into seven weeks of meticulous planned and executed experiments.",
              "On December 28, he submitted his first \"provisional\" communication, \"On a New Kind of Rays,\" in the Proceedings of the Wu\u0308rzburg Physico-Medical Society.",
              "In January 1896 he made his first public presentation before the same society, following his lecture with a demonstration: he made a plate of the hand of an attending anatomist, who proposed the new discovery be named \"Roentgen's Rays.\"",
              "The news spread rapidly throughout the world.",
              "Thomas Edison was among those eager to perfect Roentgen's discovery, developing a handheld fluoroscope, although he failed to make a commercial \"X-ray lamp\" for domestic use.",
              "The apparatus for producing X-rays was soon widely available, and studios opened to take \"bone portraits,\" further fueling public interest and imagination.",
              "Poems about X-rays appeared in popular journals, and the metaphorical use of the rays popped up in political cartoons, short stories, and advertising.",
              "Detectives touted the use of Roentgen devices in following unfaithful spouses, and lead underwear was manufactured to foil attempts at peeking with \"X-ray glasses.\"",
              "As frivolous as such reactions may seem, the medical community quickly recognized the importance of Roentgen's discovery.",
              "By February 1896, X-rays were finding their first clinical use in the US in Dartmouth, MA, when Edwin Brant Frost produced a plate of a patient's Colles fracture for his brother, a local doctor.",
              "Soon attempts were made to insert metal rods or inject radio-opaque substances to give clear pictures of organs and vessels, with mixed results.",
              "The first angiography, moving-picture X-rays, and military radiology, were performed in early 1896.",
              "In addition to the diagnostic powers of X-rays, some experimentalists began applying the rays to treating disease.",
              "Since the early 19th century, electrotherapy had proved popular for the temporary relief of real and imagined pains.",
              "The same apparatus could generate X-rays.",
              "In January 1896, only a few days after the announcement of Roentgen's work, a Chicago electrotherapist named Emil Grubbe irradiated a woman with a recurrent cancer of the breast, and by the end of the year, several researchers had noted the palliative effects of the rays on cancers.",
              "Others found remarkable results in the treatment of surface lesions and skin problems while others investigated the possible bacterial action of the rays.",
              "X-rays even found cosmetic uses in depilatory clinics set up in the US and France.",
              "Roentgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize in physics in 1901 for his discovery.",
              "When asked what his thoughts were at the moment of discovery, he replied, true to form, \"I didn't think, I investigated.\"",
              "Today, Roentgen is widely recognized as a brilliant experimentalist who never sought honors or financial profits for his research.",
