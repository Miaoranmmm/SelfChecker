He observed that people who had been infected with cowpox, a milder disease, were immune to smallpox. He inoculated a boy named James Phipps with cowpox matter and then exposed him to smallpox, proving that he was protected[^3^].\n\nThis breakthrough inspired other scientists to develop vaccines for various diseases, such as cholera, rabies, tetanus, typhoid fever, plague, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, yellow fever, typhus, influenza, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumonia, meningitis, hepatitis B and A, chicken pox, Haemophilus influenzae type b (HiB), Q fever, Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, Lyme disease, rotavirus, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), nasal influenza vaccine (FluMist), Argentine hemorrhagic fever, human papillomavirus (HPV), and herpes zoster[^2^].\n\nVaccines have had a tremendous impact on public health over time.

              "Smallpox vaccination is based on a thousand-year old technique called inoculation, in which a small sample of infected matter is deliberately introduced into the body in order to prevent the full disease from developing.",
              "A vaccine stops you from getting an infectious disease by stimulating your body's immune system to produce chemicals called antibodies that will combat a future infection.",

              "Thanks to vaccination, smallpox was completely eradicated in 1979.",

              "That might prevent them getting the full-blown disease if they encountered it in the future.",
              "This is the basis of vaccination, which itself is based on the thousand-year-old practice of inoculation.",
              "Vaccination has saved millions, mostly children, from many potentially fatal diseases.",
              "Vaccination is a medical technique that uses the body\u2019s own immune system to protect it from infectious diseases.",

              "Once someone has been vaccinated they are immune, which means that if they encounter the actual disease their body can fight off the infection before the disease takes hold.",
              "The first attempts to produce immunity artificially were recorded in China approximately a thousand years ago.",
              "Healthy people would inhale a powder made from the crusts of smallpox scabs in order to protect themselves from the disease.",

              "The practice was called inoculation.",
              "Another version of inoculation involved inserting powdered scab or pus from a smallpox pustule into a scratch on the skin made by a sharp instrument.",
              "Inoculation was practiced in Asia and parts of Africa.",
              "It reached Europe and America via traveller's tales and experiences in the 1700s, where it was also called variolation, after the Latin name for smallpox\u2014variola.",
              "Cotton Mather, an American churchman, was told about inoculation by his enslaved worker, Onesimus who had been inoculated as a child in Africa.",
              "In 1721, Mather campaigned for inoculation during an outbreak of smallpox in Boston and met with some success\u2014but also much hostility.",

              "She introduced the practice to London Society and even King George II had his children inoculated.",
              "Inoculation was an uncertain procedure and people sometimes developed the full-blown disease or inadvertently spread it to others while they were still infectious.",
              "Smallpox was a highly infectious disease that was endemic around the world.",
              "The disease began with a fever and a red rash that spread all over the body.",

              "Milkmaids, who were renowned for their clear complexions, were often immune to smallpox and its scarring pock marks.",
              "Their work brought them into contact with cowpox, a mild disease of cattle that only left a single pustule on the hands of people who milked the cows.",
              "Locals who were aware of this phenomenon began to inoculate themselves with the cowpox pustule as a way to ward off the more deadly smallpox.",
              "Jenner decided to test the effectiveness of this practice.",
              "In 1796 he took some matter from a cowpox pustule on the hand of milkmaid Sarah Nelmes and injected it into the arm of a young boy called James Phipps.",
              "James developed a scab and experienced some soreness and mild fever for a day.",
              "Six weeks later, Jenner inoculated young James with smallpox matter and the boy showed no signs of the disease.",

              "Despite some opposition, vaccination soon replaced the riskier variolation and in 1853, 30 years after Jenner\u2019s death, smallpox vaccination was a standard practice for preventing smallpox.",
              "Today people can get vaccines against a whole host of infectious diseases, but smallpox is not one of them.",
              "Thanks to a global eradication programme of mass vaccination, the entire world population was officially free of this life-threatening disease by 1979.",
              "Six lancets, steel and tortoiseshell in a shagreen and silver case, as used by Edward Jenner.",
              "Clinical practice proved Jenner\u2019s vaccine successful, but neither he nor anyone else knew why it worked.",
              "An explanation had to wait for the science of bacteriology to develop at the end of the 1800s.",
              "The French scientist Louis Pasteur (1822\u20131895) believed that germs (microorganisms) were responsible for infectious diseases such as smallpox.",
              "He tested his 'germ theory of disease' on anthrax, an infectious disease of people and animals.",
              "Through his microscope, he identified a microorganism in infected blood, which he believed was responsible for the disease.",
              "Pasteur developed a solution containing a weakened form of the bacteria, which he could use as an inoculating agent.",
              "He was able to measure the success of his experiment by the absence of bacteria in the inoculated host.",
              "Pasteur called the process vaccination in honour of Jenner\u2019s work on smallpox, and vaccination became the generic term for the technique.",
              "Both vaccines and antitoxins are derived from toxoids, modified bacterial toxins that stimulate protective antibodies in the blood.",
              "Antitoxins are used as a treatment or cure when the infection is already present in the person.",
              "Vaccines, on the other hand, are examples of prophylactics - they prevent a disease from developing by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies in the blood.",
              "If a person has a disease, their immune system is already overwhelmed by the infection so a vaccine wouldn't help.",
              "Antitoxins work by harnessing the immunity of another person or animal to boost the immune system of the infected person.",
              "Antitoxins were developed by two researchers, Shibasaburo Kitasato (1852-1931) and Emil von Behring (1854-1917), who inoculated guinea pigs against diphtheria so they were immune to the disease.",
              "They then isolated a serum from the blood of the immunised animals and used it to treat guinea pigs that already had diphtheria.",
              "They found that the serum cured the sick animals of the disease.",
              "Antitoxins are made by collecting and purifying serum from animals (usually horses) inoculated with a non-lethal dose of disease toxin.",
              "Like vaccines, there are specific antitoxins for specific diseases, and the same technique is used for manufacturing treatments for other toxins such as snake venom.",
              "Because antitoxins are not manufactured in the patient\u2019s own blood, their effect only lasts a few weeks.",
              "This is enough to treat the disease if you already have it, but it doesn\u2019t prevent you from getting it again.",
              "Vaccines don\u2019t treat a disease, but prevent it from happening by stimulating the host to produce their own immunity, which can last for years.",
              "In the 1800s, some people objected to compulsory vaccination because they felt it violated their personal liberty.",
              "The Vaccination Act of 1853 introduced mandatory smallpox vaccination in England and Wales for infants up to three months old.",
              "The Act was met with opposition from people who demanded the right to control their bodies and those of their children.",
              "The Anti Vaccination League and the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League formed in response to the mandatory laws, and numerous anti-vaccination journals sprang up.",
              "After a visit to New York, in 1879, by prominent British anti-vaccinationist William Tebb, The Anti-Vaccination Society of America was founded.",
              "Despite the opposition to vaccination by some, smallpox was completely eradicated from the world 100 years after the Anti-Vaccination League was set up.",
              "When a high percentage of the population is protected through vaccination, it becomes difficult for a disease to spread because there are so few susceptible people left to infect.",
              "This is called herd immunity.",
              "Herd immunity is crucial for protecting people who cannot be vaccinated, such as babies and people with compromised or ineffective immune systems. In several countries, reductions in the use of some vaccines have been followed by increases in the number of cases of potentially lethal diseases, as herd immunity begins to break down.",
              "People can lose confidence in a vaccine for a number of reasons.",
              "In the mid-1970s, a report from the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London alleged that 36 children suffered neurological conditions after having the DTP (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertusis) vaccine.",
              "Television documentaries and newspaper reports drew public attention to the controversy.",
              "As a result, uptake of the DTP vaccine in the UK fell from 81% to 31%, and whooping cough (pertusis) epidemics followed, leading to the deaths of several children.",
              "Public confidence was only restored after a national study identified every child between 2 and 36 months hospitalized in the UK for neurological illness, and determined that the risk was very low.",
              "DTP vaccine uptake eventually increased to levels above 90%, and disease incidence declined dramatically.",
              "The MMR vaccine used to protect against measles, mumps and rubella.",
              "Vaccination gives public health authorities something of a conundrum.",
              "When they succeed in vaccinating almost all of their communities, herd immunity kicks in and the incidence of a disease decreases.",
              "But if the next generation then has no memory of the trauma and danger of that disease, then public attention can shift from the significant risks in having the disease to the much lower risks from being vaccinated.",
              "Read more stories about how epidemics have affected people and places around the world.",
              "While many infectious diseases began to decline by the end of the 19th century, incidents of polio increased to epidemic proportions.",

              "[1] Jenner knew of a local belief that dairy workers who had contracted a relatively mild infection called cowpox were immune to smallpox, and successfully tested his theory on the 8-years-old James Phipps on 17 May 1796.",
              "[2] Phipps was born in Berkeley parish in Gloucestershire to a poor landless labourer working as Jenner's gardener.",
              "He was baptised in St Mary's parish church, Berkeley, when he was 4.",
              "[3] On 14 May 1796 he was selected by Jenner, who took \"a healthy boy, about eight years old for the purpose of inoculation for the Cow Pox\".",
              "[4] Jenner took some fluid from the cowpox vesicles on the hand of a milkmaid named Sarah Nelmes (in an unpublished manuscript Jenner refers to her as Lucy Nelmes[5]), and inoculated Phipps by two small cuts in the skin of the boy's arm.",
              "Jenner wrote: On the seventh day he complained of uneasiness in the axilla and on the ninth he became a little chilly, lost his appetite, and had a slight headache.",
              "During the whole of this day he was perceptibly indisposed, and spent the night with some degree of restlessness, but on the day following he was perfectly well.",
              "[6] About six weeks later Jenner inoculated the boy with smallpox which had no effect, and concluded that he now had complete protection against smallpox.",
              "[7][8] Phipps was subsequently inoculated with smallpox more than twenty times without succumbing to the disease.",
              "[9] Phipps is often cited incorrectly as the first person to be vaccinated against smallpox by inoculation with cowpox: other people had undergone the procedure before him.",
              "In 1791, Peter Plett from Kiel in the Duchy of Holstein (now Germany) inoculated three children,[10] and Benjamin Jesty of Yetminster in Dorset performed the procedure on three family members in 1774.",
              "[11] However, Jenner included his description of the vaccination of Phipps and an illustration of the hand of Sarah Nelmes from which the material was taken in his Inquiry published in 1798.",
              "Together with a series of vaccinations which showed that the vaccine could be maintained by arm-to-arm transfer, and information about selection of suitable material, Jenner's Inquiry was the first published account of vaccination.",
              "[12] Later in Phipps's life, Jenner gave him, his wife, and his two children a free lease on a cottage in Berkeley, which went on to house the Edward Jenner Museum between 1968 and 1982.",
              "[7] Phipps attended Jenner's funeral on 3 February 1823.",
              "[13] In 1853 Phipps was buried in St Mary's church in Berkeley, where he had been baptised.",

              "The practice, which originated in China and India, was based on two distinct concepts: first, that one attack of smallpox effectively protected against any subsequent attack and, second, that a person deliberately infected with a mild case of the disease would safely acquire such protection.",

              "Better methods of preserving vaccines at ambient temperature are being developed [38] and alternative delivery systems including needle-less devices are being explored [39], both of which could facilitate uptake of vaccines in hard to reach areas.",
              "Table 3 indicates some of the organisms that are currently the target of vaccine research;",
              "recent and continuing technical advances should make it technically possible to develop effective vaccines against most of these pathogens.",
              "However, whether all these vaccines will prove cost effective or be used widely enough to provide a sufficient financial return to the manufacturer is uncertain, as illustrated by the recent case of a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine developed using an innovative technical approach but whose deployment in the UK is being queried on the grounds of cost effectiveness [40].",
              "Some of the infectious diseases currently the target of research to develop new or improved vaccines.",
              "HIV, human immunodeficiency virus;",

              "NTS, non-typhoidal salmonella bacteria.",
              "It has, until recently, been the usual practice to have a standard national vaccination policy implemented country-wide.",
              "However, as vaccination programmes include an increasing number of vaccines and more complex schedules, targeted vaccination programmes based on a sound local knowledge may become an important way of improving efficiency and reducing costs.",
              "For example, in Nigeria, with its large population, the new serogroup A meningococcal conjugate is being deployed only in the states that are known to be at risk of epidemics.",
              "Developing a new vaccine to the high standards required is expensive and new vaccines are bound to be costly until these recovery costs have been paid off.",
              "However, once research and development costs have been recouped through the sale of the vaccine at an appropriate price in industrialized countries and sale volume has been increased through adoption of the vaccine in developing countries with their large populations, experience has shown that the costs of a vaccine fall, a fall sometimes aided by vaccine manufacture in a developing country.",
              "It is probable that effective vaccines will be developed against the major infections such as HIV, TB and malaria, although it is difficult to predict how long this will take, and that eventually these infections will cease to be a major public health priority even if they cannot be eradicated completely.",
              "Ensuring the maximum benefit that vaccination can provide against infectious diseases will be achieved only if there is global, high-level surveillance to detect the emergence of new potentially dangerous infections and also to detect the emergence of strains resistant to the vaccines in routine use as quickly as possible so that countermeasures can be put into place.",
              "As the incidence of infectious diseases declines and living standards improve across the developing world, many developing countries are entering a transition phase in which they have a residual challenge from infectious diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis, while at the same time experiencing major challenges from emerging non-infectious diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.",
              "Could vaccination have a role to play in ameliorating this increasing global burden of non-infectious diseases?",
              "Prevention of a substantial proportion of liver and cervical cancers should be achievable by ensuring universal hepatitis B and HPV vaccination, and prevention of some stomach and nasopharyngeal cancers might be possible in communities where there is a high risk of these cancers by vaccination against Helicobacter pylori and Epstein Barr virus infections, respectively.",
              "Vaccination to prolong survival from other cancers, as recently demonstrated for prostate cancer, may become practicable, but highly personalized cancer immunotherapy is likely to be too expensive for universal use in even middle-income countries [41].",
              "Management of chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension is difficult in communities with limited access to healthcare and it is possible that vaccination against these conditions could help by reducing the need for frequent contacts with the health system, although there is much work to be done before this approach could become a practical reality.",
              "Some progress is being made in developing vaccines which modulate the course of diabetes and hypertension [42].",
              "Vaccination against addiction, including smoking, is also feasible, although very high antibody concentrations are required to achieve an effect [43], and there are early results suggesting that vaccination against Alzheimer's disease might slow the progress of this condition [44].",
              "In the coming decades, vaccination is likely to expand its scope beyond prevention of the common infections of childhood which has been its main success so far.",
              "Vaccination has achieved much since the original work of Jenner 200 years ago, and many new vaccines are likely to be developed within the next decade, including some directed at non-infectious diseases.",
              "Which of these new vaccines are cost effective and affordable is likely to generate much debate.",
              "New vaccines will be more expensive than the vaccines whose developmental costs have been met, and this is likely to pose a major challenge to developing countries where many of these vaccines could be of most use.",
              "Currently, it is envisaged that the enhanced costs of an expanded national programme of immunization will be met through international aid, primarily through GAVI, but a number of developing countries, including some in sub-Saharan Africa, are making substantial economic progress so that they are, or shortly will be, no longer eligible for GAVI support.",
              "Although methods are being developed to facilitate this transition, existing and new lower middle-income countries are likely to be required to make a greater contribution to the costs of their national vaccination programme than is currently the case.",

              "This was primarily done in calves, but donkeys and horses were also used.",
              "Although this practice allowed manufacturing capacity to be distributed even to remote areas, it was complicated by the risk of contamination from bacteria, fungi, and other viruses and raised the theoretical risk of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.",

              "The ancient practice of variolation (named for smallpox, also known as variola or \u2018la variole\u2019) was widely used in Asia and some parts of Africa.",
              "This consisted of transferring to healthy people small amounts of material from smallpox sores, resulting in milder forms of illness and much lower mortality than natural infection.",
              "Some sources suggest practices of variolation were taking place as early as 200 BCE.",
              "Written accounts from the mid-1500s describe a form of variolation used in China known as insufflation, where smallpox scabs were dried, ground and blown into the nostril using a pipe.",
              "In India, similar practices were carried out through inoculation, using a lancet or needle to transfer material from smallpox pustules to the skin of healthy children.",
              "Accounts from the 18th century suggest this technique dates back hundreds of years.",
              "Variolation (in the form of inoculation) was introduced in Europe by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu 300 years ago in 1721, after she had observed the practice in the Ottoman Empire, where her husband was stationed as ambassador to Turkey.",
              "Around the same time, it came to public attention in the American colonies.",
              "Enslaved West Africans had long practised the technique, and after his slave Onesimus told him about how it worked in 1716, Cotton Mather publicized it and argued for its use in response to a 1721 outbreak of smallpox in Massachusetts.",
              "It wasn\u2019t until May 1796 that the world\u2019s first vaccine was demonstrated, using the same principle as variolation but with a less dangerous viral source, cowpox.",

              "But by 1801, through extensive testing, it was shown to effectively protect against smallpox.",
              "The vaccine was soon in use on other continents, where vaccine continued to be inoculated from arm to arm until vaccination programmes were established.",
              "Mandatory smallpox vaccination came into effect in Britain and parts of the United States of America in the 1840s and 1850s, as well as in other parts of the world, leading to the establishment of the smallpox vaccination certificates required for travel.",
              "While some European regions eliminated the disease by 1900, smallpox was still ravaging continents and areas under colonial rule, with over 2 million people dying every year.",
              "It took another 50 years to achieve global solidarity in the fight against the disease.",
              "Vaccine research and studies in vaccine delivery were carried out around the world in the search for more resilient and effective vaccines.",

              "With this strategy they were able to eliminate highly contagious smallpox from the district within weeks.",
              "In higher-risk countries, laboratories began to produce higher-quality freeze-dried vaccines, and mass production of the innovative and easy-to-use bifurcated needle to administer doses contributed to vaccination efforts.",
              "Thanks to the combined efforts of national health agencies, WHO and scientists around the world, smallpox was eliminated from South America in 1971, Asia in 1975 and Africa in 1977.",

              "The under-utilisation of vaccines in industrialised countries could be seen as vaccination being a victim of its own success, leading people to underestimate the seriousness of vaccine-preventable diseases and the benefits of vaccination, and, instead, to have concerns regarding the side effects of vaccines.",
              "As for any biological or medicinal product, adverse reactions due to vaccines, although extremely rare, exist.",
              "For example, the risk a child will have a severe reaction after receiving the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) or DTaP vaccine is less than 1 in 1,000,000 (28).",
              "Additionally, even if vaccination is one of the most cited examples of positive externalities, through herd immunity and reduced transmission of the disease, it may also have potentially negative epidemiological effects such as serotype replacement or shift of disease to older populations.",
              "These potential effects should be closely monitored and weighed against the benefits of protecting from severe vaccine-preventable diseases to conclude on the benefit/risk profile of a particular vaccination programme.",
              "In parallel, the ability to reduce the global disease burden with vaccines continues to grow, as new vaccines are developed to prevent other diseases and policy-makers must decide where and how scarce resources are best allocated.",
              "Product- and programme-specific attributes such as safety, efficacy, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness play an important role in the basic health system objectives of efficiency, equity, and sustainability.",
              "The earlier vaccines set a high standard because they were not only cost-effective, but often even cost-saving, turning decision-making into a relatively straightforward task (requiring only strictly rational behaviour).",

              "Thus, the variable quality of the included studies represents an important limitation of our study.",
              "Finally, the heterogeneity of study designs necessitated using different methods for calculating coverage changes, which may limit the validity and generalizability of our comparisons.",
              "Specifically, for some studies, we calculated overall coverage change as an average across multiple vaccine changes.",
              "For studies that lacked a comparator group, we calculated coverage change based on differences in pre- and post-intervention coverage that may overstate the changes in coverage.",
              "For studies for which we calculated coverage change as a difference between the intervention and comparator coverage, the estimates may not consider the impact of the baseline level of coverage.",
              "Furthermore, for studies that did not report the number of doses, we estimated the number of doses using the number of doses based on the implied definition for full vaccination in the paper and the number of people attaining full vaccination in the intervention.",
