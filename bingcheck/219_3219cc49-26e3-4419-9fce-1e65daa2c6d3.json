    "query": "Can you explain the process and technology behind the development of self-driving cars, and what potential implications and impacts will they have on the transportation industry, society, and the environment?",
    "response": "Self-driving cars are a system of advanced sensors and software that allow a car to drive with little or no human input[^1^]. They use cameras, radar, ultrasound, and radio antennas to provide a 360-degree view of the environment and detect road signs, markings, lanes, vehicles, pedestrians, and other objects[^2^]. The software uses powerful computers and advanced algorithms to process the sensor data and generate an environment understanding for the car to navigate safely[^1^].\n\nSelf-driving cars have the potential to impact various aspects of our society, such as safety, mobility, environment, economy, and lifestyle. Some of the possible implications and impacts are:\n\n- Safety: Self-driving cars could reduce traffic fatalities by eliminating human error, which is responsible for 94% of traffic collisions in the US[^2^]. A study estimated that making 90% of cars on US roads self-driving would save 25,000 lives per year[^2^].\n- Mobility: Self-driving cars could increase mobility for people who cannot drive or do not own a car, such as elderly, blind, disabled, or low-income people[^3^]. They could also improve accessibility and convenience for travelers by providing door-to-door service and reducing parking hassles[^4^].\n- Environment: Self-driving cars could have mixed effects on the environment. On one hand, they could reduce emissions and fuel consumption by optimizing routes, speeds, and traffic flow[^3^]. On the other hand, they could increase energy use and pollution by encouraging more car use and sprawl[^4^].\n- Economy: Self-driving cars could have significant impacts on various industries and sectors. They could create new markets and opportunities for technology, transportation, and service providers[^3^]. They could also disrupt existing jobs and businesses in fields such as healthcare, insurance, travel, and logistics[^4^]. For example, self-driving cars could lower auto insurance costs and reduce the demand for donor organs[^4^].\n- Lifestyle: Self-driving cars could change our lifestyle and culture in various ways. They could free up time and space for people to engage in other activities while traveling[^3^]. They could also affect our social interactions, privacy, security, and sense of responsibility[^4^].\n\nSelf-driving cars are still facing many challenges and uncertainties before they can become fully autonomous and widely adopted. Some of these challenges include technical limitations, ethical dilemmas, legal regulations, public perception, infrastructure development, and liability issues[^2^] [^4^].",

              "To qualify as fully autonomous, a vehicle must be able to navigate without human intervention to a predetermined destination over roads that have not been adapted for its use.",
              "Companies developing and/or testing autonomous cars include Audi, BMW, Ford, Google, General Motors, Tesla, Volkswagen and Volvo.",
              "Google's test involved a fleet of self-driving cars -- including Toyota Prii and an Audi TT -- navigating over 140,000 miles of California streets and highways.",
              "AI technologies power self-driving car systems. Developers of self-driving cars use vast amounts of data from image recognition systems, along with machine learning and neural networks, to build systems that can drive autonomously.",
              "The neural networks identify patterns in the data, which are fed to the machine learning algorithms. That data includes images from cameras on self-driving cars from which the neural network learns to identify traffic lights, trees, curbs, pedestrians, street signs and other parts of any given driving environment.",
              "For example, Google's self-driving car project, called Waymo, uses a mix of sensors, lidar (light detection and ranging -- a technology similar to RADAR) and cameras and combines all of the data those systems generate to identify everything around the vehicle and predict what those objects might do next.",
              "This happens in fractions of a second.",
              "Maturity is important for these systems. The more the system drives, the more data it can incorporate into its deep learning algorithms, enabling it to make more nuanced driving choices.",
              "The following outlines how Google Waymo vehicles work: Google's Waymo project is an example of a self-driving car that is almost entirely autonomous.",

              "Planning and deciding errors, such as speeding and illegal maneuvers, were contributing factors in about 40 percent of crashes in the study sample.",
              "The fact that deliberate decisions made by drivers can lead to crashes indicates that rider preferences might sometimes conflict with the safety priorities of autonomous vehicles.",
              "For self-driving vehicles to live up to their promise of eliminating most crashes, they will have to be designed to focus on safety rather than rider preference when those two are at odds.",

              "[32] This may, in turn, encourage urban sprawl and ultimately total private vehicle use.",
              "Others argue that it will be easier to share cars and that this will thus discourage outright ownership and decrease total usage, and make cars more efficient forms of transportation in relation to the present situation.",

              "[20][47][failed verification] The automobile insurance industry might suffer as the technology makes certain aspects of these occupations obsolete.",
              "[25] As fewer collisions implicate less money spent on repair costs, the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well.",
              "It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but fewer payouts may imply a demand drop for insurances in general.",
              "In order to accommodate such changes, the Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 was introduced.",
              "While Part 2 deals with Electric Vehicles, Part 1 covers insurance provisions for automated vehicles.",
              "A direct impact of widespread adoption of automated vehicles is the loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry.",
              "[6][20][21][48] There could be resistance from professional drivers and unions who are threatened by job losses.",
              "[49] In addition, there could be job losses in public transit services and crash repair shops.",
              "A frequently cited paper by Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey found that automated cars would make many jobs redundant.",
              "[50] The industry has, however created thousands of jobs in low-income countries for workers who train autonomous systems.[51] With the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the personal ownership of autonomous vehicles, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue as it rises in popularity.",
              "Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry, and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise.",
              "[52] A review found that private autonomous vehicles may increase total travel, whereas autonomous buses may lead to reduced car use.",
              "[53] Vehicle automation can improve fuel economy of the car by optimizing the drive cycle, as well as increasing congested traffic speeds by an estimated 8%\u201313%.",
              "[54][55] Reduced traffic congestion and the improvements in traffic flow due to widespread use of automated cars will translate into higher fuel efficiency, ranging from a 23%\u201339% increase, with the potential to further increase.",
              "[54][56] Additionally, self-driving cars will be able to accelerate and brake more efficiently, meaning higher fuel economy from reducing wasted energy typically associated with inefficient changes to speed.",
              "However, the improvement in vehicle energy efficiency does not necessarily translate to net reduction in energy consumption and positive environmental outcomes.",
              "Alongside the induced demand, there may also be a reduction in the use of more sustainable modes, such as public or active transport.",
              "It is expected that convenience of the automated vehicles encourages the consumers to travel more, and this induced demand may partially or fully offset the fuel efficiency improvement brought by automation.",

              "[57] Overall, the consequences of vehicle automation on global energy demand and emissions are highly uncertain, and heavily depends on the combined effect of changes in consumer behavior, policy intervention, technological progress and vehicle technology.",
              "[55] By reducing the labor and other costs of mobility as a service, automated cars could reduce the number of cars that are individually owned, replaced by taxi/pooling and other car-sharing services.",
              "[58][59] This would also dramatically reduce the size of the automotive production industry, with corresponding environmental and economic effects.",
              "The lack of stressful driving, more productive time during the trip, and the potential savings in travel time and cost could become an incentive to live far away from cities, where housing is cheaper, and work in the city's core, thus increasing travel distances and inducing more urban sprawl, raising energy consumption and enlarging the carbon footprint of urban travel.",
              "[55][60][61] There is also the risk that traffic congestion might increase, rather than decrease.",
              "[55][25] Appropriate public policies and regulations, such as zoning, pricing, and urban design are required to avoid the negative impacts of increased suburbanization and longer distance travel.",
              "[25][61] Since many autonomous vehicles are going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases.",
              "Similarly, radar, sensors, lidar, and high-speed internet connectivity require higher auxiliary power from vehicles, which manifests as greater power draw from batteries.",
              "[55] The larger battery requirement causes a necessary increase in the supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry.",
              "On the other hand, with the expected increase of battery-powered (autonomous) vehicles, the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand.",

              "A study conducted by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that drivers did not trust self-parking technology, even though the systems outperformed drivers with a backup camera.",
              "The study tested self-parking systems in a variety of vehicles (Lincoln MKC, Mercedes-Benz ML400 4Matic, Cadillac CTS-V Sport, BMW i3 and Jeep Cherokee Limited) and found that self-parking cars hit the curb 81% fewer times, used 47% fewer manoeuvres and parked 10% faster than drivers.",
              "Yet, only 25% of those surveyed said they would trust this technology.",
              "[63] Manually driven vehicles are reported to be used only 4\u20135% of the time, and being parked and unused for the remaining 95\u201396% of the time.",
              "[64][65] Autonomous taxis could, on the other hand, be used continuously after they have reached their destination.",
              "This could dramatically reduce the need for parking space.",
              "For example, in Los Angeles a 2015 study found 14% of the land is used for parking alone, equivalent to some 1,702 hectares (4,210 acres).",
              "[66][67] This combined with the potential reduced need for road space due to improved traffic flow, could free up large amounts of land in urban areas, which could then be used for parks, recreational areas, buildings, among other uses;",
              "making cities more livable.",
              "Besides this, privately owned self-driving cars, also capable of self-parking would provide another advantage: the ability to drop off and pick up passengers even in places where parking is prohibited.",
              "This would benefit park and ride facilities.",
              "[68] The vehicles' increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behaviour, while possibly enabling other crimes, such as deliberately crashing into another vehicle or a pedestrian.",
              "[69] However, this may also lead to much-expanded mass surveillance if there is wide access granted to third parties to the large data sets generated.",
              "Privacy could be an issue when having the vehicle's location and position integrated into an interface that other people have access to.",

              "That's almost 300,000 lives saved each decade in the US, and a saving of US$190 billion each year in healthcare costs associated with accidents.",
              "\"By midcentury, the penetration of AVs (autonomous vehicles) and other ADAs (advanced driver-assistance system) could ultimately cause vehicle crashes in the US to fall from second to ninth place in terms of their lethality ranking among accident types,\" the report, from US consulting firm, McKinsey & Company, concludes.",
              "Back in May, we reported that four of the 48 driverless cars the road in California had been in accidents over the past six months.",
              "One in 12 might seem like a lot, but the technology itself wasn't at fault - it was the humans around it who were messing up.",
              "Of the three Google-operated driverless cars that were involved in accidents during that period, human error was at fault in 100 percent of them.",
              "\"Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident,\" director of Google's self-driving car project, Chris Urmson, wrote in a blog post at the time.",
              "The fourth was a Delphi Automotive driverless car, and was reportedly not in self-driving mode at the time of the accident.",
              "As Adrienne LaFrance reports for The Atlantic, practical moves to increase road safety in the past have made an incredible impact, with seatbelt laws and airbags reducing the annual death toll from 60,000 in 1970 to a record low of 32,719 in 2013.",
              "With the recent report predicting that driverless car technology could reduce fatalities by 90 percent by the mid-century, that means 29,447 lives could be saved every year, based on the 2013 statistic, she reports.",
              "\"In the United States alone, that's nearly 300,000 fatalities prevented over the course of a decade, and 1.",

              "McKinsey & Company Saving lives isn't the only thing driverless cars could do once they hit the mainstream.",
              "The report estimates that they'll free up as much as 50 minutes per day for users, which adds up to a global figure of 1 billion free hours every single day.",
              "(The researchers rather strangely equate this to the time it took to build the Great Pyramid of Giza, but let's be real here, the only thing we're likely to do with those 1 billion hours is play more video games.)",
              "The issue of parking will also become a non-issue, with the report estimating that driverless cars will reduce the need for parking space in the US by more than 5.",
              "7 billion square metres.",
              "\"For example, self-parking AVs do not require open-door space for dropping off passengers when parked, allowing them to occupy parking spaces that are 15 percent tighter,\" it says.",
              "The biggest obstacle in the way of letting driverless cars save us from ourselves?",
              "Us.",
              "As Peter Dockrill reported for us back in June, a survey of 505 drivers by the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute in the US found that most of them weren't particularly happy about the idea of automated vehicles, \"with the largest segment of respondents indicating they'd prefer to retain full control over their vehicles, thank you very much\".",
              "The most frequent preference for vehicle automation in the survey responses was for no self-driving capability at all (43.",
              "8 percent), with partially self-driving vehicles as the second preference (40.",
              "6 percent).",
              "Just 15.",
              "6 percent of the respondents said they liked the idea of a self-driving car being fully in control.",
              "As Andrew Moore, computer science dean at Carnegie Mellon told LaFrance at The Atlantic, \"No one is going to want to realise autonomous driving into the world until there's proof that it's much safer, like a factor of 100 safer, than having a human drive.\"",
              "Google and the rest of the self-driving car peddlers have got one hell of a marketing campaign on their hands."

              "The researchers, from the University of Cambridge, programmed a small fleet of miniature robotic cars to drive on a multi-lane track and observed how the traffic flow changed when one of the cars stopped.",
              "When the cars were not driving cooperatively, any cars behind the stopped car had to stop or slow down and wait for a gap in the traffic, as would typically happen on a real road.",
              "A queue quickly formed behind the stopped car and overall traffic flow was slowed.",
              "However, when the cars were communicating with each other and driving cooperatively, as soon as one car stopped in the inner lane, it sent a signal to all the other cars.",
              "Cars in the outer lane that were in immediate proximity of the stopped car slowed down slightly so that cars in the inner lane were able to quickly pass the stopped car without having to stop or slow down significantly.",
              "Additionally, when a human-controlled driver was put on the 'road' with the autonomous cars and moved around the track in an aggressive manner, the other cars were able to give way to avoid the aggressive driver, improving safety.",
              "The results, to be presented today at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Montre\u0301al, will be useful for studying how autonomous cars can communicate with each other, and with cars controlled by human drivers, on real roads in the future.",

              "Starting with inexpensive scale models of commercially-available vehicles with realistic steering systems, the Cambridge researchers adapted the cars with motion capture sensors and a Raspberry Pi, so that the cars could communicate via wifi.",
              "They then adapted a lane-changing algorithm for autonomous cars to work with a fleet of cars.",
              "The original algorithm decides when a car should change lanes, based on whether it is safe to do so and whether changing lanes would help the car move through traffic more quickly.",
              "The adapted algorithm allows for cars to be packed more closely when changing lanes and adds a safety constraint to prevent crashes when speeds are low.",
              "A second algorithm allowed the cars to detect a projected car in front of it and make space.",
              "They then tested the fleet in 'egocentric' and 'cooperative' driving modes, using both normal and aggressive driving behaviours, and observed how the fleet reacted to a stopped car.",
              "In the normal mode, cooperative driving improved traffic flow by 35% over egocentric driving, while for aggressive driving, the improvement was 45%.",

              "One new space we can expect to see driverless technology deployed in is high-risk environments, from nuclear plants to military settings, to limit the dangers to human life, says Fowler.",
              "A Rio Tinto mine in Western Australia, for example, is currently operating the largest autonomous fleet in the world.",
              "The trucks are controlled by a centralised system miles away in Perth.",

              "In the next five years most driverless technology will remain behind the scenes.",
              "TRL is investigating the potential for driverless HGVs on motorways, including the idea of platooning vehicles.",
              "Platoons are a group of semi-autonomous vehicles that drive a close distance between each other, stopping other vehicles from separating them.",
              "By driving closer together, vehicles in a platoon can be more fuel efficient by taking advantage of the slipstream of the truck in front while also helping to reduce congestion as the lorries take up less overall space on the road.",
              "Also in this space is Plus, the first self-driving truck manufacturer, whose European pilots commenced this year after a successful trial on Wufengshan highway in China's Yangtze Delta economic centre.",
              "You might also like: Away from these industries, Ozay further predicts that \"we will possibly see lighter robotic vehicles that can potentially use sidewalks and bike paths with limited speeds \u2013 for delivering things such as food and groceries.\"",
              "When it comes to public transport, Oxbotica is also working with German-based vehicle systems specialist ZF over the next five years to make the driverless shuttle a true mainstay for European cities, operating on roads, as well as at airports, much in the same way buses do now.",
              "\"The shuttles in airports we see today on rails won't need those rails in five years from now.",
              "This means driverless shuttles have the potential to transport you from the car park to the airport, then straight through to your gate and the plane,\" Jinks explains.",
              "For users, this could mean more reliable and cost-efficient transport systems. \"Interlinking autonomous transport systems to bring a public transport system that is as efficient as you jumping in your own car and driving it yourself has got to be the answer to congestion in the future,\" adds Jinks.",
              "Seven years from now All experts agree that the next seven years will depend on the successes and failures of initial deployments, and how safety and public trust evolves accordingly.",
              "However, most hope that city redesigns will enable more adoption of the technology and help move us into modern, and more efficient ways of living.",
              "\"If you live in a dense, urban area, the hope is that you'd be able to rely on mobility as a service.",
              "You could dial up the car, it would arrive in two minutes, and you make your journey.",
              "You wouldn't need to have those vast rows of parked cars in your street, which makes the street more navigable for the automated vehicle,\" says Hynd.",
              "Without parked cars lining the street, roads could be narrower, making way for more green spaces.",
              "But while proponents of self-driving vehicles insist they will make our roads safer, there are some who feel pedestrians and autonomous vehicles simply can't mix.",
              "It could mean that our cities and the way we use them may need to be reimagined.",
              "Some of this thinking is already taking place.",
              "In 2018, IKEA developed a concept autonomous vehicle that can double up as meeting rooms, hotels, and stores.",
              "The impact this type of innovation would have is reduced requirement for travel in the first place, offering instead interchangeable, on-demand environments as and when we need them.",
              "Our needs could be met right where we are.",
              "Ozay expects many more self-driving options to be available for customers during this time, including in the passenger vehicle space.",
              "\"My hope is that cars will be smart enough to say 'yes' or 'no' when asked if they can reliably and safely get a non-driver from point A to point B on a given day, by analysing the weather and traffic conditions beforehand,\" she explains.",
              "10 years from now Despite all the developments and innovations the next decade is likely to hold, some experts still feel we might be a way off from full deployment of driverless vehicles.",
              "By 2031, \"full-self driving \u2013 human-level or above, in all possible conditions, where you can put kids by themselves in the car to send them to arbitrary locations without worrying \u2013 is not something I expect to see,\" says Ozay.",
              "Hynd agrees that full automation is unlikely on this timescale.",
              "\"With anything transport infrastructure, anything that society uses, so many other things need to come into play.",
              "And I don't just mean regulation,\" he says.",
              "Safety will be a major hurdle, especially for countries slower to adopt the change because of the huge costs involved.",
              "Infrastructure will also dictate how fast and effectively this technology can roll out, and public perception and willingness to use autonomous vehicles will need to increase according to Hynd.",
              "But not everyone agrees.",
              "Jinks is confident that we'll see autonomous vehicles on the roads at the same time as human-driven vehicles in 10 years from now.",
              "In this vein, you may very well be stepping onto a driverless shuttle at the airport, then into a self-driving taxi to take you to your final destination.",
              "Owning a driverless car in the next 10 years is less likely \u2013 it'll still be too expensive for most people, according to Hynd.",
              "But the promise of driverless technology is about unchaining us from our reliance on cars, and how that can transform the use of our time and our environment.",
              "\"This is one of the biggest engineering problems that we're trying to solve in a century,\" Jinks says.",

              "Given the current rate of technological development, the advent of self-driving cars is inevitable.",
              "Is this a blessing or a curse?",
              "While there are safety and policy concerns that need to be addressed in the development phase, the benefits to road safety and quality of life will prevail in the long run.",
              "The players in the self-driving car market are diverse: traditional car manufacturers like Nissan, Audi and Mercedes, and new companies such a Tesla, Google\u2019s Waymo and Uber, are all competing to develop the first fully autonomous self-driving car.",
              "The approach they are taking is similar across the board.",
              "Essentially, a self-driving car needs to perform three actions to be able to replace a human driver: to perceive, to think and to act (Figure 1).",
              "These tasks are made possible by a network of high-tech devices such as cameras, computers and controllers.",
              "A self-driving car\u2019s \u201csight\u201d or perception is achieved via several mechanisms. Cameras are installed on the roof and in other places around the car for 360o vision (Figure 2).",
              "While cameras are good for identifying shapes and colors in the environment, they are not helpful in finding the distance to an object.",
              "Fortunately, self-driving cars also have high-tech sensors, called LIDARs, that are much better at determining the location of people and objects around the car.",
              "LIDAR (or \u201cLight Detection and Ranging\u201d) is a device with a constantly rotating laser beam.",
              "It sends invisible light pulses all around it.",
              "By measuring the travel time and location of the reflected laser light, it can discriminate the shape and location of surrounding objects.",
              "In addition to cameras and LIDARs, self-driving cars often have conventional radars.",
              "Although radars can only see very fuzzily, they are great at detecting moving objects and are much cheaper than the other devices.",
              "Once a self-driving car \u201csees\u201d its surroundings, the cameras, LIDARs and radars all send the information they perceive to the \u201cbrain\u201d of the car.",
              "The \u201cbrain\u201d of a self-driving car is a powerful computer that often sits in the trunk and controls the car\u2019s thoughts and actions.",
              "By use of GPS, it initially has a rough idea of the route it must follow to get to a destination.",
              "This is not enough, however, to navigate along a busy street, to change lanes or to stop at a traffic light when necessary.",
              "Therefore, the computer takes in camera, LIDAR, radar and GPS data and determines the precise location of the car as well as the objects around it.",
              "Programmers have developed very smart algorithms that can be \u201ctrained\u201d to identify objects\u2019 in the car\u2019s surroundings.",
              "For example, these algorithms classify a bulky, fast-moving object with two wheels as a motorcycle, rather than a bicycle.",
              "Other objects would be identified as cars, pedestrians, traffic lights or obstacles, accordingly.",
              "Once the computer has determined which objects surround the car and how far away they are, it must decide how to act and then execute its decision.",
              "For example, if the lane is closed ahead due to construction, the computer will identify the options: it could either change lanes immediately or slow down to let the vehicles in the next lane pass first.",
              "But how does the computer know which option is better?",
              "Programmers have developed algorithms that behave like the neurons in a brain.",
              "These algorithms can \u201clearn\u201d from the actions taken in previous situations and infer what to do in a new, similar situation.",
              "This type of machine learning is like speech recognition on your smartphone or facial recognition for photos on social media.",
              "Once the car\u2019s computer decides what action to take, it sends electronic commands to controllers that turn the steering wheel and control the throttle and brakes.",
              "It is important to note that this cycle of gathering information and deciding and executing an action is repeated several times per second.",
              "All this is by enabled high-speed computers and very smart algorithms, which allows the computer to constantly assess the situation and make quick decisions.",
              "Once they are fully developed, self-driving cars will potentially have a huge positive impact on our safety and lifestyle.",
              "The high-tech vision system has the potential to outperform humans in detecting dangerous situations.",
              "Unlike distracted or drunk drivers, self-driving cars always operate at their maximum ability.",
              "Therefore, they are likely to reduce accidents and lower the huge death toll on our roads.",
              "Additionally, the smart algorithms will find faster routes to our destinations, drive more efficiently and consume less fuel.",
              "We will have the added benefit of spending our time on other tasks while our car is driving for us.",
              "Given these advantages and the fact that the technology required to build self-driving cars is basically available, why haven\u2019t they entered the market yet?",
              "It turns out that present tests of self-driving cars have been limited either to specific roads or to specific tasks.",
              "In order to navigate down a road, the self-driving car requires very precise maps of the street and surroundings.",
              "These need to be much more detailed than those found on common online map services and will require more time to be created for every road in the country or the world.",
              "Moreover, more work needs to be done on the computer algorithms that constitute the car\u2019s \u201cbrain.",
              "\u201d Software engineers do not yet trust their programs to correctly assess all the possible situations that can occur in traffic.",
              "In addition, more data needs to be collected to reliably train the machine learning algorithms. Therefore, testing of self-driving prototypes is still closely supervised.",
              "A safety driver is present at all times, ready to intervene if the car makes a mistake.",
              "An example from Tesla illustrates that the technology is not yet ready for fully autonomous driving: a Tesla driver died when his car with partial self-driving features crashed into a turning truck that it did not recognize as an obstacle.",
              "It is important to note that the self-driving feature involved in the Tesla crash was explicitly not meant for fully autonomous driving.",
              "The driver had been warned several times to put his hands back on the wheel.",
              "However, the accident illustrates that more programming and engineering is required to make cars fully autonomous.",
