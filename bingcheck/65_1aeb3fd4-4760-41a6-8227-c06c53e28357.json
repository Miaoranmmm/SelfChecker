    "query": "What was the inspiration behind the design of the Eiffel Tower and how was it initially received by the public when it was unveiled at the 1889 World's Fair in Paris?",
    "response": "The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel's company, but the original idea came from two of his engineers, **\u00c9mile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin**, who drew a sketch of a 300-meter tall metal pylon with four legs and latticework girders[^2^] [^4^]. They were inspired by the **Latting Observatory**, a wooden tower built in New York City in 1853[^1^]. The design was later improved by the company's architect, **Stephen Sauvestre**, who added decorative elements, such as arches, balconies, and a glass pavilion at the top[^3^].\n\nThe Eiffel Tower was built as the centerpiece of the **1889 World's Fair** in Paris, which celebrated the centennial of the French Revolution and France's industrial power[^2^]. However, it was not well received by some of the public and critics, who considered it an ugly and useless monument that did not fit with the city's architecture and culture. Some of them even formed a committee to protest against its construction and demanded its removal after the fair[^2^]. Despite the controversy, the tower attracted millions of visitors and became a symbol of Paris and France over time. It is now one of the most visited monuments in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site[^2^].",

              "This enthusiast and true genius was able to go beyond his own limits to bequeath to us monuments such as the dome on the Nice Observatory, the metallic structure of the Statue of Liberty, not to mention the Bordeaux railway bridge.",
              "Sommaire Gustave Eiffel An engineer by training, Eiffel founded and developed a company specializing in metal structural work, whose crowning achievement was the Eiffel Tower.",
              "He devoted the last thirty years of his life to his experimental research.",
              "Born in Dijon in 1832, he graduated from the Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in 1855, the same year that Paris hosted the first World's Fair.",
              "He spent several years in the South West of France, where he supervised work on the great railway bridge in Bordeaux, and afterwards he set up in his own right in 1864 as a \"constructor\", that is, as a business specializing in metal structural work.",
              "His outstanding career as a constructor was marked by work on the Porto viaduct over the river Douro in 1876, the Garabit viaduct in 1884, Pest railway station in Hungary, the dome of the Nice observatory, and the ingenious structure of the Statue of Liberty.",
              "It culminated in 1889 with the Eiffel Tower.",
              "This date marks the end of his career as an entrepreneur.",
              "Eiffel built hundreds of metal structures of all kinds all around the world.",
              "Eiffel built hundreds of metal structures of all kinds, all around the world.",
              "Bridges, and in particular railway bridges, were his favourite field of work, but he also won renown for his metal structural work and industrial installations.",
              "His career was marked by a large number of fine buildings, among which two of the most outstanding are the twin edifices of the Porto viaduct and the Garabit viaduct in the Cantal region of France.",
              "Equally outstanding are certain other structures in which the pure inventiveness of Eiffel's company was allowed free rein, such as the \"portable\" bridges sold around the world in \"kits\", the ingenious structure of the Statue of Liberty in New York, and of course the Eiffel Tower itself.",
              "In 1887 Eiffel agreed to build the locks of the Panama canal, an immense undertaking badly managed by Ferdinand De Lesseps, which ended in the biggest financial scandal of the century.",
              "This was the biggest contract in his entire career in business, and also the one with the greatest risk.",
              "Given the risk he faced, he was granted major financial advantages and solid guarantees, which allowed him to collect his profit as soon as the work was begun.",
              "Despite the care which Eiffel took in the project, the liquidation of the canal construction company, Compagnie du Canal, on February 4 1889, led to his own indictment for fraud alongside De Lesseps and his son, and to a sentence of two years in prison and a fine of 2000 francs, even though nothing could really be blamed on him personally.",
              "With his honour and dignity severely compromised, he withdrew from business.",
              "The ruling was later to be annulled by the highest appeal court, the Cour de Cassation, liberating him of all obligations concerning the accusations, which put an end to any further court action against him.",
              "In retirement following the Panama scandal, Eiffel devoted the final thirty years of his life to a fruitful career as a scientist.",
              "First of all he set himself to finding a practical application for the Tower, which had only been built to stand for twenty years.",
              "He employed it in wind resistance experiments, as a meteorological observation post, and above all as a giant aerial mast for the new science of radio broadcasting.",
              "He collected meteorological data at posts installed in his various properties, and at the same time pursued his research into aerodynamics, building a wind tunnel right at the foot of the Tower, and then a second and much larger one on Rue Boileau in Paris, in 1909.",
              "This latter wind tunnel is still in service.",
              "He died on December 27, 1923 at the age of 91.",
              "An object of discord, desire and fascination, the Eiffel Tower never fails to impress.",
              "Enriched by a history full of new developments, here you can discover all of its key information.",
              "It was for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, the date that marked the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution, that a great competition was launched in 1886.",

              "Four legs, each made up of four sturdy beams connected to each other by latticework girders, rise obliquely to meet at the top.",

              "It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889.",
              "Locally nicknamed \"La dame de fer\" (French for \"Iron Lady\"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair.",
              "Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.",
              "[3] The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022.",
              "[4] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:[5] 6.",
              "91 million people ascended it in 2015.",
              "It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site (\"Paris, Banks of the Seine\") in 1991.",
              "[6] The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[7] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris.",
              "Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side.",
              "During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930.",
              "It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height.",
              "Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.",

              "[8] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".",
              "[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design.",
              "Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.",
              "The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name.",
              "On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socie\u0301te\u0301 des Inge\u0301nieurs Civils;",
              "after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise [n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.",
              "[10] Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Gre\u0301vy was re-elected as president of France and E\u0301douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade.",
              "A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.",
              "[10] (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.)",
              "On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.",
              "After some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887.",
              "Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.",
              "5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.",
              "5 million francs.",
              "Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years.",
              "He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.",
              "[11] A French bank, the Cre\u0301dit Industriel et Commercial (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower.",
              "During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower.",
              "These loans were connected to an indemnity controversy which saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, \"effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income\".",
              "According to The New York Times, \"[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.\"",
              "[12] The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds.",
              "Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[13] and many people believed it was impossible.",
              "These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering.",
              "It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet.",
              "A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887: We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection .",

              "we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.",
              "[14] Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man.",
              "Will it not also be grandiose in its way?",
              "And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"",
              "[15] These criticisms were also dealt with by E\u0301douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying,[16] \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.",
              "Indeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection.",
              "Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\"",
              "[17] Some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built;",
              "others remained unconvinced.",
              "[18] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.",
              "[19] By 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.",
              "[20] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.",
              "Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.",
              "[21] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.",
              "6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg.",
              "The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[22] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick.",
              "Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.",
              "Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.",
              "5 m (25 ft) long.",
              "The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began.",
              "The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.",
              "[23] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm (0.",
              "04 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc.",
              "[24] The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed.",
              "No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration.",
              "In all, 18,038 pieces were joined using 2.",
              "5 million rivets.",
              "[21] At first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold.",

              "hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold.",
              "Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[21] due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens, only one person died.",

              "Emile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin, the two chief engineers in Eiffel's company, had the idea for a very tall tower in June 1884.",
              "It was to be designed like a large pylon with four columns of lattice work girders, separated at the base and coming together at the top, and joined to each other by more metal girders at regular intervals.",
              "The tower project was a bold extension of this principle up to a height of 300 metres - equivalent to the symbolic figure of 1000 feet.",
              "On September 18 1884 Eiffel registered a patent \"for a new configuration allowing the construction of metal supports and pylons capable of exceeding a height of 300 metres\".",
              "In order to make the project more acceptable to public opinion, Nouguier and Koechlin commissioned the architect Stephen Sauvestre to work on the project's appearance.",
              "Sauvestre proposed stonework pedestals to dress the legs, monumental arches to link the columns and the first level, large glass-walled halls on each level, a bulb-shaped design for the top and various other ornamental features to decorate the whole of the structure.",
              "In the end the project was simplified, but certain elements such as the large arches at the base were retained, which in part give it its very characteristic appearance.",
              "The curvature of the uprights is mathematically determined to offer the most efficient wind resistance possible.",
              "As Eiffel himself explains: \"All the cutting force of the wind passes into the interior of the leading edge uprights.",
              "Lines drawn tangential to each upright with the point of each tangent at the same height, will always intersect at a second point, which is exactly the point through which passes the flow resultant from the action of the wind on that part of the tower support situated above the two points in question.",
              "Before coming together at the high pinnacle, the uprights appear to burst out of the ground, and in a way to be shaped by the action of the wind\".",

              "On the Seine side of the construction, the builders used watertight metal caissons and injected compressed air, so that they were able to work below the level of the water.",
              "The tower was assembled using wooden scaffolding and small steam cranes mounted onto the tower itself.",
              "The assembly of the first level was achieved by the use of twelve temporary wooden scaffolds, 30 metres high, and four larger scaffolds of 40 metres each.",
              "\"Sand boxes\" and hydraulic jacks - replaced after use by permanent wedges - allowed the metal girders to be positioned to an accuracy of one millimetre.",
              "On December 7, 1887, the joining of the major girders up to the first level was completed.",
              "The pieces were hauled up by steam cranes, which themselves climbed up the Tower as they went along using the runners to be used for the Tower's lifts.",
              "5 months to build the foundations It only took five months to build the foundations and twenty-one to finish assembling the metal pieces of the Tower.",
              "Considering the rudimentary means available at that period, this could be considered record speed.",
              "The assembly of the Tower was a marvel of precision, as all chroniclers of the period agree.",

              "One could have taken them for blacksmiths contentedly beating out a rhythm on an anvil in some village forge, except that these smiths were not striking up and down vertically, but horizontally, and as with each blow came a shower of sparks, these black figures, appearing larger than life against the background of the open sky, looked as if they were reaping lightning bolts in the clouds.\"",

              "The exposition was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille, which marked the beginning of French Revolution, and was also seen as a way to stimulate the economy and pull France out of an economic recession.",

              "This section featured a large assortment of outdoor restaurants and cafes with foods from Indochina, North Africa, and other cuisines from around the world.",
              "The colonial pavilions conveyed the multiculturalism of France's colonies, the largest of them being the Palais Central des Colonies, designed by Stephen Sauvestre, who notably contributed to the design of the Eiffel Tower.",

              "[6] The colonized people had their daily lives displayed for the exposition visitors, which made some of them uncomfortable.",
              "[6] Samba Lawbe\u0301 Thiam, a jeweler from Senegal who was part of the 1889 Exposition, said the following: \"We are very humiliated to be exhibited this way, in huts like savages;",

              "[6] The incorporation of indigenous colonized individuals in the exposition was intended to be an educational element, but has also historically been framed as an exploitative and patronizing display of colonized people without their consent.",
              "[7] This colonial section of the exposition was linked to the Champs de Mars site by a corridor of pavilions along the left Bank.",
              "This corridor, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, also featured a display called \"The History of Human Habitation\", with model houses depicting the history of domestic architecture, designed with much imagination by Charles Garnier, architect of the Paris Opera.",

              "A competition to build what was simply called \"A tower of three hundred meters\" with a base one hundred meters wide, was announced in 1886.",
              "It was won by the construction firm of Gustave Eiffel, which had recently built the iron frame of the Statue of Liberty.",
              "The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884, had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions.",
              "The structural design was created by two Eiffel engineers, Maurice Koechlin and E\u0301mile Nouguier, who along with Eiffel himself, received the patent for the plan.",
              "An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance.",
              "Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms. A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the exposition was completed.",
              "[9] The construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in Levallois-Perret, a Paris suburb.",
              "Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son-in-law of Eiffel, declared, \"no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history.\"",
              "During the exposition, no one other than construction personnel were allowed higher than the second viewing platform.",

              "[10] By the time the exposition finished, after 173 days, 1,968,287 persons had ascended the tower.",
              "[9] When the exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station.",
              "In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer Edouard Branly, be placed on the third level.",
              "In 1909, when Eiffel's concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently.",

              "It was a huge iron and glass structure which contained the industrial displays.",
              "It occupied the entire width of the exposition site, the land between the avenue de la Bourdonnais and the present avenue de Suffren, and covered 77,000 square meters, with 34,700 square meters of glass windows.",

              "[11] It was later used again at the 1900 Universal Exposition and then destroyed in 1910.",
              "The Gallery of Machines used a system of hinged arches (like a series of bridge spans placed not end-to-end but parallel) made of steel or iron.",

              "Another new technology that was promoted at the exposition was the safety elevator, developed by a new American company, Otis Elevator.",
              "Otis built the elevators carrying passengers up the legs of the Eiffel Tower to the first level.",
              "When journalists expressed concern about the safety of the elevators, Otis technicians filled one elevator with three thousand kilograms of lead, simulating passengers, and then, with journalists from around the world watching, cut the cable with an axe.",

              "When the Eiffel Tower was a subject of controversy",
              "Thursday 24 August 2023 Modified the 24/08/23 Nowadays, the silhouette of the Iron Lady has become very much a part of the Parisian landscape.",
              "But Gustave Eiffel had to fight tirelessly to impose and complete his plan to build a 1000-foot metal tower, which would come to be known as the Eiffel Tower!",
              "As we are paying tribute to Gustave Eiffel in 2023, to mark the centenary of his death, let\u2019s look back at the fights he waged for his tower, which was the focus of much debate and controversy before even being built.",
              "\u201cEiffel, Higher and Higher\u201d: to learn more, come and discover the incredible race to construct the highest building in the late 19th century, in which Gustave Eiffel was one of the main competitors, by visiting the free exhibition on the Eiffel Tower esplanade (accessible to all, no ticket required), created by Savin Yeatman-Eiffel, Gustave Eiffel\u2019s descendant.",
              "From June to December 2023.",
              "It was no walk in the park for Gustave Eiffel to have his metal tower project chosen.",
              "A number of years before the 1889 World Exhibition, the idea of building an enormous tower was born.",
              "It would be the major attraction of the fair, which had important aims for France: to celebrate the centenary of the French Revolution, unite the population and show the entire world France\u2019s strength in engineering and industrial expertise.",
              "And Eiffel had a serious rival: Jules Bourdais.",
              "This highly respected architect was at the height of his glory: he had won the competition in collaboration with Gabriel Davioud to build the Palais du Trocade\u0301ro (now destroyed and replaced by the Palais de Chaillot), which was the highlight of the 1878 World Exhibition.",
              "Jules Bourdais proposed a competing project for a monumental, 1200-foot tower, made out of granite and porphyry and topped with a powerful beacon, named the Sun Tower.",
              "The two projects were total opposites: stone versus iron, an architect versus an engineer, classic versus modern.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "The battle took place in the press, with Eiffel and Bourdais mobilizing their respective supporters.",
              "Early on, Gustave Eiffel placed the emphasis on his ability to build his tower within a realistic timeframe and at a controlled cost.",
              "He also used a patriotic and utilitarian argument that the Tower \u201cwill provide essential services to science and national defense\u201d.",
              "Jules Bourdais also used the press to create publicity around his project.",
              "But he lacked credibility: would it really be possible and financially reasonable to build such a tall stone tower?",
              "It didn\u2019t seem likely.",
              "However, in 1886, victory seemed within grasp for Jules Bourdais, with support from new Prime Minister Charles de Freycinet.",
              "But Gustave Eiffel wasn\u2019t giving up.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "He turned to the new Minister for Commerce, Edouard Lockroy, who was responsible for coordinating the 1889 World Exhibition.",
              "Lockroy was unconvinced by Jules Bourdais\u2019 project and won over by the arguments of Gustave Eiffel, who also stated that he would finance the entire project in return for receiving a contract for the tower\u2019s operation.",
              "On May 1, 1886, the Minister launched a competition for the contract to build attractions for the Exhibition.",
              "Among other things, candidates were invited to \u201cstudy the possibility of building a 1000-foot iron tower with a square base with sides of 410 feet\u201d.",
              "It would seem that this proposal was custom-made for Gustave Eiffel\u2019s tower.",
              "Caught unprepared, Jules Bourdais participated, replacing stone with iron for his Sun Tower.",
              "But in the end, the project by Gustave Eiffel and his architect Stephen Sauvestre was selected for the 1000-foot tower competition.",
              "However, Gustave Eiffel\u2019s problems were just beginning.",
              "And after winning the competition, his project was subject to multiple attacks.",
              "Firstly, from architects, who were outraged to see an engineer chosen for such a project.",
              "Then, the Parisian artistic scene got up in arms when construction began.",
              "On February 14, 1887, the famous \u201cProtest against the Tower of Monsieur Eiffel\u201d was published in Le Temps newspaper, calling on the person responsible for works for the Exhibition to put a stop to it.",
              "The letter was signed by major names in the artistic and literary world: composer Charles Gounod, writers Guy de Maupassant and Alexandre Dumas (son), and poet Franc\u0327ois Coppe\u0301e, as well as classical architects like Charles Garnier, who designed the Ope\u0301ra Garnier.",
              "\u201cWe come, we writers, painters, sculptors, architects, lovers of the beauty of Paris which was until now intact, to protest with all our strength and all our indignation, in the name of the underestimated taste of the French, in the name of French art and history under threat, against the erection in the very heart of our capital, of the useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower which popular ill-feeling, so often an arbiter of good sense and justice, has already christened the Tower of Babel.",
              "\u201d Gustave Eiffel responded to this diatribe immediately: \u201cI believe, for my part, that the Tower will have its own beauty [.",

              "The construction of a giant iron tower in the middle of Paris sparked contrasting opinions from Parisians, who at first were rather doubtful about the aesthetics of the Tower under construction.",
              "The influence of artists, who were not shy to criticize, also fed into the reluctance of residents of the French capital: \u201cthis belfry skeleton\u201d (Paul Verlaine);",
              "\u201cthis truly tragic street lamp\u201d (Le\u0301on Bloy);",

              "After the Iron Lady was built, he was seemingly still repulsed by it - he said that he often went to have lunch on the first floor of the Eiffel Tower, as it was \u201cthe only place in the city where I won\u2019t see it\u201d.",
              "However, the supposed hatred of Parisians for the Tower had little foundation, apart from the concerns of Champ de Mars residents for their homes.",
              "A Paris City Council member living in the area launched a lawsuit against Gustave Eiffel, who, to avoid stopping construction, declared himself prepared to personally assume all risks and compensate locals in the event of an accident.",
              "Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t necessary!",
              "The Tower opened to the public on May 15, 1889 and was immediately a grand success, triumphantly welcomed by crowds of people, French and international, sweeping away all previous controversy.",
              "Some of the disparaging artists even made public apologies.",
              "And the Tower was definitively adopted into the hearts of Parisians, proud of this symbol of modernity.",
              "It became the icon of Paris.",
              "Even if the entire world covets our Eiffel Tower, some detractors weren\u2019t ready to let go of their grudge, such as architect Charles Garnier.",
              "In 1894, a new call for projects -partially drafted by Garnier- was launched for the 1900 World Exhibition that would be held once again in Paris.",
              "Applicants were granted full freedom to modify or even destroy the Eiffel Tower!",
              "No project - and some were particularly farfetched - would be selected and the Tower would remain intact, at the center of the new, spectacular installations in 1900.",
              "However, the Tower was only meant to stay up for 20 years, under the operation contract held by Gustave Eiffel (until December 31, 1909).",
              "Danger was creeping closer, and furthermore, visitor numbers to the monument were down.",
              "In 1903, demolition was seriously considered, as the Paris City Council wished to redevelop the Champ de Mars.",
              "In the end, it was decided not to destroy the monument.",
              "However, Gustave Eiffel pushed, financed and promoted all the scientific experiments that took place at the Tower: meteorological observations, wireless telegraphy, falling bodies, aerodynamics and more.",

              "The scientific uses of the world\u2019s highest tower undoubtedly saved it from destruction.",

              "The range for wireless telegraphy grew from year to year, and the strategic importance of the Eiffel Tower station became evident, capable of emitting and receiving long-distance signals.",

              "It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889.",
              "Locally nicknamed \"La dame de fer\" (French for \"Iron Lady\"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, and to crown the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution.",
              "Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.",
              "[4] The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022.",
              "[5] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:[6] 6.",
              "91 million people ascended it in 2015.",
              "It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site (\"Paris, Banks of the Seine\") in 1991.",
              "[7] The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[8] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris.",
              "Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side.",
              "During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930.",
              "It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height.",
              "Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.",
              "2 metres (17 ft).",
              "Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.",

              "He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as Thomas Edison.",
              "The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and E\u0301mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des E\u0301tablissements Eiffel.",
              "It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution.",
              "In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".",
              "[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design.",
              "Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.",
              "The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name.",
              "On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socie\u0301te\u0301 des Inge\u0301nieurs Civils;",
              "after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise [n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.",
              "[10] Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Gre\u0301vy was re-elected as president of France and E\u0301douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade.",
              "A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.",
              "[10] (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.)",
              "On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.",
              "After some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887.",
              "Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.",
              "5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.",
              "5 million francs.",
              "Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years.",
              "He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.",
              "[11] A French bank, the Cre\u0301dit Industriel et Commercial (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower.",
              "During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower.",
              "These loans were connected to an indemnity controversy which saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, \"effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income\".",
              "According to The New York Times, \"[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.\"",
              "[12] The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds.",
              "Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[13] and many people believed it was impossible.",
              "These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering.",
              "It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet.",
              "A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887: We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection .",

              "And for twenty years .",

              "we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.",
              "[14] Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man.",
              "Will it not also be grandiose in its way?",
              "And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"",
              "[15] These criticisms were also dealt with by E\u0301douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying,[16] \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.",
              "Indeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection.",
              "Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\"",
              "[17] Some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built;",
              "others remained unconvinced.",
              "[18] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.",
              "[19] By 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.",
              "[20] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.",
              "Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.",
              "[21] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.",
              "6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg.",
              "The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[22] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick.",
              "Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.",
              "Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.",
              "5 m (25 ft) long.",
              "The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began.",
              "The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.",
              "[23] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm (0.",
              "04 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc.",
              "[24] The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed.",
              "No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration.",
              "In all, 18,038 pieces were joined using 2.",
              "5 million rivets.",
              "[21] At first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold.",
              "This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\"",
              "and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press.",
              "[25] Multiple famous artists of that time, Charles Garnier and Alexander Dumas, thought poorly of the newly made tower.",
              "Charles Garnier thought it was a \u201c truly tragic street lamp.",

              "[26] At this stage, a small \"creeper\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg.",
              "They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs.",
              "The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.",
              "[21] Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments to precisely align the legs;",
              "hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold.",
              "Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[21] due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens, only one person died.",

              "[18] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features.",
              "Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, E\u0301mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustre\u0301, completed the ascent.",
              "At 2:35 pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.",
              "[28] There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May;",
              "even then, the lifts had not been completed.",
              "The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.",
              "[29] Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[30] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.",
              "[4] After dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light.",

              "[citation needed] At the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit.",
              "Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower.",
              "Gustave Eiffel described the collection of responses as \"truly curious\".",
              "[31] Famous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison.",
              "[29] Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.",
