              "November 18, 2019 7 min read Forming lasting memories appears to depend on an interaction between glial cells and brain waves that are produced during sleep By R.",
              "Douglas Fields Glial cells (red) intersperse among neurons (blue).",
              "Daniel Schroen Getty Images Neuroscientists have always presumed that learning and memory depend on strengthening or weakening the connection points between neurons (synapses), increasing or decreasing the likelihood that the cell is going to pass along a message to its neighbor.",
              "But recently some researchers have started pursuing a completely different theory that does not involve changing the strength of synaptic transmission;",
              "in fact, it does not even involve neurons.",
              "Instead other types of brain cells, called glia, are responsible.",
              "A new study from the University of Toronto, published on-line this week in the journal Neuron furnishes support for this theory.",
              "It provides evidence that the basic act of learning whether one\u2019s environs are safe or not, a behavior common to all animals, depends on glial cells that form the fatty sheath called myelin\u2014electrical insulation that covers nerve fibers.",
              "The new theory postulates that establishing indelible memories that can be recalled long after sensory input or training on a task involves an interaction between glia and peculiar brain waves produced during sleep.",
              "\u201cThe role of myelin in cognitive functions has been largely neglected, an omission elegantly rectified by this paper,\u201d says myelin researcher Bernard Zalc, at the Sorbonne Universite\u0301 in Paris, commenting on this new study.",
              "Traditionally researchers who study the myelin insulation on nerve fibers, called axons, have focused on diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, in which the fatty sheath is damaged.",
              "In multiple sclerosis, neural transmission fails, causing wide-ranging disabilities.",
              "Much like the plastic coating on a copper wire, myelin was understood to be vital for neural transmission but inert and irrelevant to information processing and memory storage.",
              "The new research challenges that view because of the discovery that the glial cells that form myelin, called oligodendrocytes, can detect neural impulses flowing thorough the axons they contact.",
              "Intriguingly, immature oligodendrocytes, called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), populate nearly the entire brain with little regard for the complex anatomical boundaries within brain tissue.",
              "Salted throughout the brain\u2014even in adulthood when there would seem to be little need for immature brain cells\u2014OPCs are by far the most abundant cells undergoing cell division in our brain.",
              "Why that is, is unclear, and these peculiar cells have long mystified researchers.",
              "Research in several laboratories has found recently that OPCs can respond to neural impulse activity by dividing and maturing into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, and increasing the number of myelinated axons.",
              "This process could have a profound effect on information transfer through neural networks because myelin boosts the speed of neural impulse transmission by about 50 times.",
              "In the Neuron study, first author Patrick Steadman and colleagues in the laboratory of Paul Frankland at the Hospital for Sick Children and University of Toronto, tested the hypothesis that new myelin must form during learning.",
              "They did so by genetically altering mice so that a gene called myelin regulatory factor (MRF) is deleted when treated with the drug tamoxifen.",
              "The gene is essential for OPCs to mature into oligodendrocytes.",
              "Knocking out MRF increased the number of OPCs, whereas the number of newly formed oligodendrocytes diminished.",
              "Now the researchers could test the hypothesis that formation of myelin is necessary for learning by training these mice while preventing them from forming new myelin.",
              "They could block myelin formation at any point during training or afterward simply by administering tamoxifen to the mice.",
              "They then probed whether myelin is needed for learning by giving a well-established memory test called the Morris water maze, in which a mouse is placed in a large tub of water in which a hidden platform is submerged just below the surface.",
              "The mice quickly learned where that platform was, and they swam directly to it after several days of training.",
              "The experiments showed that the mice that were unable to form new myelin were able to learn where the platform was just as quickly as control mice, but when their recall was tested long after training ended, the ones that could not form new myelin did not remember the location as well and had to swim for a longer time to find the platform again.",
              "Examining the brain tissue with an electron microscope, the researchers found that more axons were myelinated in regions of the brains of normal mice known to be required for learning the Morris water maze.",
              "The researchers now had evidence that myelin is involved in making the long-term memories involved in learning.",
              "But they still needed to pin down myelin\u2019s role in recall.",
              "Different types of information must be brought together at the same time to recall, for example, where your home is located\u2014or, for a mouse, the platform in the water maze.",
              "Recall requires the integration of memories of sights, sounds, smells, emotions related to your home, and sensations the memory of your home evokes.",
              "These diverse types of information are processed and stored in very different parts of the brain and connected by broad-ranging networks that must be activated together to interlace diverse aspects of these memories, ultimately resulting, at the subcellular level, in the strengthening of synapses.",
              "This network-centric view of neural functioning has been overlooked by memory researchers narrowly focused on synaptic transmission.",
              "But the question still remains of how the arrival time of neural impulses at each synaptic relay point in complex neural networks is established.",
              "The brain rhythms of sleep may provide a clue.",
              "The researchers wondered if new myelin might be necessary after the training was over to convert a short-term memory that quickly fades away into a long-lasting memory, a process neuroscientists call memory consolidation.",
              "To test that idea, they trained the mice, as before, three times a day for six days and then administered tamoxifen after the training had ended to inhibit myelin formation.",
              "When tested 28 days later, the mice that could not form new myelin after the training session performed poorly in recalling where the hidden platform was.",
              "If they waited too long after training to inhibit the formation of new myelin\u201425 days in their tests\u2014recall was not impaired, indicating that a window of time persists after training when new experiences become consolidated into memory.",
              "The results suggest that new myelin is part of the process of engraving lasting memories.",
              "But the researchers drilled down still further to ask how specifically does myelin promote memory consolidation?",
              "To answer that, the researchers turned their investigation to a different learning situation that induced fearful memories in the animals.",
              "A soldier riding in a jeep in Afghanistan will feel an intense sensation of danger from the risk of a roadside bomb, but will relax riding in a jeep through the streets of his hometown.",
              "The hippocampus is the brain\u2019s \u201cGPS\u201d system that determines the location of the body in the environment, but higher-level cognitive functions processed in the prefrontal cortex are necessary to provide the context of whether a location is associated with a friend or a foe.",
              "When communication between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex becomes impaired after a traumatic experience, the body\u2019s fear response can be activated inappropriately, causing a person with PTSD to suffer the same intense sense of danger while riding in a jeep at home.",
              "Because this type of memory requires long-distance communication between brain regions, it could provide insight into how myelin consolidates memory.",
              "Scientists study this type of fearful learning by placing an experimental animal in a cage where a harmless but alarming electric shock is applied through the metal floor after a warning sound.",
              "The animal will freeze in fear later when the same alarm sound is presented in the same cage, even without the foot shock.",
              "However, the animal will not freeze in response to the same sound in a different environment, because it is not associated with the induced fear.",
              "The communication between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex provides the essential context that sparks the varying reactions.",
              "Research by Gyo\u0308rgy Buzsa\u0301ki at New York University discovered that brief, high-frequency oscillations in the hippocampus\u2014brain waves called sharp wave/ripple complexes\u2014convey information by coupling in synchrony with cortical neurons firing rhythmically in what are called spindle oscillations.",
              "Promoting this rhythmic coupling can improve memory consolidation.",
              "These unusual waves of rhythmic neural activity are especially active during non-REM (dreamless) sleep, and learning a new task increases this activity.",
              "It is believed that this transfer of information between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex during sleep links the memory of place with its context.",
              "In my own research, we have found that myelin is important for transmission of brain waves, raising the possibility that the need for new myelin in memory consolidation could promote this shuttling of information between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex by these unusual neural oscillations.",
              "Brain waves oscillate at many different frequencies.",
              "Two regions of the brain oscillating together in synchrony may promote the coupling of distant populations of neurons into functional assemblies.",
              "Much like the synchronization of the string section and French horns in an orchestra, synchronous brain rhythms could potentially couple neurons in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus together for the mouse to learn to fear a particular location.",
              "Myelin could play a key role in regulating the speed of transmission of brain waves.",
              "If waves of neural activity are not transmitted at the proper rate, destructive interference of one wave with another will disrupt the transmission of rhythmic information in the brain\u2014just as musicians playing out of time will mangle a symphonic work.",
              "Interestingly, changes in myelin have been found during sleep and sleep deprivation.",
              "Steadman and colleagues tested whether the formation of myelin during sleep may promote learning by increasing the coupling of brain wave activity by recording neural oscillations in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice.",
              "They found that when the formation of new myelin was impaired by deleting the MRF gene, the synchrony of brain wave coupling was indeed reduced and the animals performed poorly in invoking the memory of fear learned in the environment where they had been shocked.",
              ".",
              "Together these studies indicate that formation of new myelin is necessary for learning because it consolidates memories by facilitating the coordinated brain wave activity between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.",
              "New myelin also appears to be needed for other types of learning\u2014in improving motor coordination, for example.",
              "\u201cWhen we think about how memories are consolidated, traditionally we have always thought about synaptic plasticity.",

              "The hippocampus is considered a part of the limbic system, a group of structures involved in processing and regulating emotions and memories.",
              "The hippocampus, which is most strongly associated with the formation of memories, is an early storage place for new long-term memories and is involved in the transition of these long-term memories to more permanent memories.",
              "The hippocampus is one of the most studied areas of the brain and is also one of the few places where neurogenesis occurs, the process by which new neurons are produced.",

              "This is an area strongly and reciprocally connected with many other parts of the cerebral cortex and serves as an interface between the hippocampus and other parts of the brain.",
              "The hippocampus receives input from regions such as the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and premammillary region of the brain, meaning it can respond to changes in these areas and send output.",

              "The amygdala can work with the hippocampus to associate emotions with new memories to strengthen them.",
              "Essentially, if memory has an element of fear attached to it, this makes it more likely to be remembered.",

              "this is so we can encode the environment around us and remember where everything is.",
              "Within our spatial memories, we have a cognitive map, a mental representation containing information on relative locations in specific environments.",
              "Through using cognitive maps, we can code, store, recall, and decode information about our environment, which can be used when navigating environments we are familiar with.",

              "Although the hippocampus is involved in memory, long-term memories are not thought to be stored within this structure.",
              "Instead, the hippocampus is believed to be a transfer center for long-term memories.",
              "this means it can take in memory information, register it, then temporarily store it before it is then transferred to long-term memory stores.",
              "Sleep is thought to play a critical role in the process of this.",
              "Information in the hippocampus circulates in this area whilst neurons start to encode this information through a process called long-term potentiation.",
              "Long-term potentiation is a form of neural plasticity and is a vital mechanism in the storage of memory.",
              "When this occurs in the hippocampus, the strongest of the circulating information then returns to the brain area where it originated from in order to turn the short-term memories into long-term memories.",
              "If someone is experiencing dysfunction with their hippocampus, they may be experiencing one or more of the following symptoms: It has been found that the classic symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, including memory loss and disorientation, have been associated with a decline in hippocampal activity.",
              "Other symptoms of early-onset of Alzheimer\u2019s are a loss of short-term memory and difficulty following directions.",
              "As this condition develops, the volume of the hippocampus tends to reduce, and it becomes harder to function in daily life.",

              "Long-term stress can harm the hippocampus, and there is evidence that individuals who have experienced severe traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus.",
              "Damage to the hippocampus could also be the result of trauma to this area, oxygen starvation, stroke, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy.",

              "Experimentalists have made great strides in providing evidence for this viewpoint1,2, and theorists have added further support3,4.",
              "In particular, theorists have shown that models using long-term synaptic plasticity as a storage mechanism can retain enormous numbers of memories for long periods of time.",
              "The models used to establish this result involve many simplifying assumptions and not-so-realistic features, but it has generally been believed that their impressive memory performance is not an artifact of these simplifications and would generalize to more realistic models.",
              "Unfortunately, this is not true.",
              "The remarkable memory capacity of the classic neural network models depends critically on one of their least realistic features, the fact that their synapses are unbounded.",
              "Modifying this single feature by placing reasonable bounds on synaptic efficacies reduces memory capacity in these models so drastically that it shakes the entire theoretical underpinnings supporting the link between memory (and learning) and long-lasting modifications of synaptic strength5,6,7.",
              "The dominant factor that causes memory traces to decay over time in models5,6,7, experiments involving in vitro8,9,10,11,12 and in vivo12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 synaptic modification, and psychophysical studies20,21,22 is overwriting of the synaptic modifications representing the memory by ongoing plasticity.",
              "This can occur due to synaptic modifications arising from spontaneous activity, or synapses retaining a trace of one memory can be overwritten when other memories are stored that share some of the same synapses as the first memory.",
              "We use the term 'ongoing plasticity' to refer to both of these effects.",
              "In the models we consider, the rate of ongoing plasticity events, which we denote by r, is a critical parameter that sets the scale for memory lifetimes.",
              "It is difficult to know what value r takes, but it can be estimated.",
              "For example, spike pairings suitable for inducing synaptic potentiation or depression through spike timing\u2013dependent plasticity (see, for example, ref.",
              "23) caused by pre- and postsynaptic neurons firing at 1 Hz occur about once a minute.",
              "We keep r as an unknown factor that sets the scale for the memory lifetimes we compute, but we estimate that 1/r lies somewhere between 10 and 100 s.",
              "To study how quickly memories are forgotten, we focus on one particular memory and track its mnemonic trace in the presence of ongoing plasticity.",
              "We isolate the synapses that are modified during storage of the specific tracked memory, and we determine the rate at which these synapses return to an equilibrium distribution and the memory trace is lost.",
              "To simplify this calculation, we assume that ongoing plasticity that is due to spontaneous activity and to the storage of new memories is uncorrelated with the plasticity that stored the particular memory we are tracking.",
              "Previous work has shown that ongoing plasticity causes an exponential degradation of memory traces if synaptic efficacies are restricted to lie within realistic ranges5,6,7,24.",
              "We refer to the time constant governing this exponential decay as the memory lifetime and denote it by \u03c4.",
              "Memories can only be recovered from a population of n synapses for a time of order \u03c4 ln(n) after they have been stored5,6,7 (see also Methods).",
              "Because the lifetime \u03c4 is proportional to 1/r, which we estimate to be around 1 min, and the logarithm is such a slowly increasing function, memory capacity is extremely small even if n includes every synapse in the brain.",
              "Two methods come to mind for evading this catastrophe.",
              "One is to require synapses to traverse many different states before they reach their bounds.",
              "It has been suggested previously that this might improve memory performance significantly6.",
              "Here we show that this improvement is not robust.",
              "The other, which we also explore, is to modify how the bounds that limit the range of synaptic efficacy are implemented.",
              "It should be stressed that neither of these changes affects the logarithmic dependence of memory capacity on the number of synapses used to store the memories.",
              "Changing this requires a more dramatic shift in the way synapses store memories25.",
              "Instead, we explore here whether the coefficient \u03c4 multiplying the logarithmic dependence can be increased enough to compensate for the severe limits on memory capacity in models without such metaplasticity.",
              "Studying memory storage, maintenance and retrieval by neural circuits raises numerous questions and problems for both theoretical and experimental investigation.",
              "We attempted to reduce the number of issues and uncertainties by taking an 'ideal observer' approach25.",
              "Rather than constructing a hypothetical neural network that stores and recovers memories through synaptic modification, we directly track the states of the synapses that such a network would use.",
              "In other words, we model how synapses are modified during both memory storage and ongoing activity and ask whether a memory trace can be detected within this population of synapses by examining the synapses directly, rather than by examining the output of network neurons.",
              "Of course, we are not proposing that neural circuits directly measure synaptic strengths as we do.",
              "Rather, our approach extracts an upper bound on memory performance that optimal circuits may approach but that no circuit can exceed.",
              "The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to determine the strength and lifetime of memory traces without having to speculate about how neural circuits actually recover and reveal those traces.",
              "We characterize the strength of each synapse by a weight parameter, w, that falls between 0 and 1.",
              "Thus, we measure synaptic strength in units of the maximum possible synaptic efficacy.",
              "When synaptic plasticity occurs, the synapse is modified according to for potentiation and depression, respectively.",
              "The expressions q+(w) and q\u2212(w) represent weight-dependent factors that determine the size of the potentiation and depression modifications.",
              "In addition to the rate of ongoing plasticity, r, we needed to know the relative amounts of potentiation and depression making up the ongoing plasticity.",
              "We denote the probability of plasticity being potentiating as f+ and the corresponding probability for depression as f\u2212, with f+ + f\u2212 = 1.",
              "The rates of events that cause potentiation and depression are thus rf+ and rf\u2212, respectively.",
              "With these parameters defined and set to particular values, we can proceed to examine the memory storage properties of populations of n synapses.",
              "We subject these synapses to continuous modifications at the rates given above until an equilibrium configuration is achieved.",
              "This equilibrium is characterized by constant distributions of synaptic efficacy, although modification of individual synapses is still proceeding.",
              "We denote the average value of synaptic efficacy at equilibrium by w\u0304.",
              "We then introduce a particular memory that we will track over time to study features of memory storage.",
              "It should be stressed that this particular memory is no different from any of the other memories whose storage is represented by the ongoing synaptic modifications, nor is it the only memory being stored by the system.",
              "It is just a particular memory that we happen to choose to monitor.",
              "The tracked memory is initially stored by imposing a pattern of synaptic potentiations and depressions on the population of synapses.",
              "At any later time, we define the memory trace or 'signal' as the average distance separating the potentiated and depressed synapses from their equilibrium values.",
              "In other words, the memory signal for n synapses is where the sums are over all the synapses potentiated (first sum) and depressed (second sum) by the memory event being tracked.",
              "Note that the average value of the synaptic strengths does not have to be altered by memory storage.",
              "The tracked memory is detectable only because we have divided the population of synapses into two groups on the basis of whether they were potentiated or depressed during the storage of this particular memory.",
              "The signal given by equation (2) must be detected despite the fact that synapses are continually changing their values as a result of ongoing plasticity, which causes the memory signal to fluctuate and degrade.",
              "The fluctuations introduce a 'noise' N, defined as the s.",
              "d.",
              "of the signal (see Methods).",
              "The detectability of the memory trace is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio, S/N.",
              "Specifically, we use two quantities to characterize the quality of memory storage25: the initial signal-to-noise ratio right after the tracked memory is stored, labeled S0/N0, and the memory lifetime \u03c4, which is the time constant describing the exponential decay of the memory signal-to-noise ratio over time6,7.",
              "S0/N0 gives the strength of the initial memory trace and \u03c4 controls how long it is detectable, as discussed in the introduction.",

              "One possibility is that long-lasting memories are protected from overwriting by some mechanism39,40, or that synapses are modified in a clever way by exploiting the feedback of an internal or external supervisor that knows which synapses have to be modified to store a new memory without compromising the old ones (for example, the mechanism of learning of the perceptron41,42,43).",
              "A second possibility is that the amount of information acquired with each stored memory is small, to the point that previous memories are essentially left untouched.",
              "This can be achieved either by reducing the amount of information contained in each memory (for example, in the case of sparse patterns of neural activity6,44) or by reducing the rate at which synapses are modified (for example, by randomly selecting only a small fraction of synapses whose modifications are consolidated5,6,45).",

              "This is yet another expression of the tradeoff between memory lifetime and signal-to-noise ratio discussed earlier: slowing down learning can extend memory lifetimes, but this happens at the price of reducing the amount of information stored after every synaptic modification.",

              "The experimental implication of our results is that connecting synaptic plasticity to memory requires more than simply accumulating evidence about long-lasting modifications of synaptic efficacy.",

              "Source: Stanford.",
              "Somewhere right now in Pyeongchang, South Korea, an Olympic skier is thinking through the twists and spins she\u2019ll make in the aerial competition, a speed skater is visualizing how he\u2019ll sneak past a competitor on the inside line, and a curler is imagining the perfect sweep.",
              "It\u2019s called mental rehearsal, and psychologists and athletes alike know that it works: picturing ourselves going through routines, whether it\u2019s figure skating or something more mundane, improves our chances of success.",
              "Now, neuroscientists report Feb.",
              "15 in Neuron, they\u2019ve learned how the brain learns physical tasks, even in the absence of real-world movement, and found that it could hinge on getting the mind to the right starting place, ready to perfectly execute everything that follows.",
              "\u201cMental rehearsal is tantalizing, but difficult to study,\u201d said Saurabh Vyas, a graduate student in bioengineering and the paper\u2019s lead author.",
              "That\u2019s because there\u2019s no easy way to peer into a person\u2019s brain as he imagines himself racing to a win or practicing a performance.",
              "\u201cThis is where we thought brain-machine interfaces could be that lens, because they give you the ability to see what the brain is doing even when they\u2019re not actually moving,\u201d he said.",
              "Although there are some important caveats, the results could point the way toward a deeper understanding of what mental rehearsal is and, the researchers believe, to a future where brain-machine interfaces, usually thought of as prosthetics for people with paralysis, are also tools for understanding the brain, said Krishna Shenoy, the Hong Seh and Vivian W.",

              "What are you thinking?",
              "The idea for the study came while thinking about how people learn to use brain-machine interfaces to perform a task, Vyas said.",
              "In a typical setup, a person \u2013 or, very often, a monkey \u2013 has to learn to move a cursor around a computer screen using only patterns of activity in the brain, not hand or other movements.",
              "That got Vyas wondering whether what people (or monkeys) learned using brain-machine interfaces might somehow transfer, in a way similar to mental rehearsal, to physical movements.",
              "\u201cHe\u2019s just sitting there thinking, and as he\u2019s thinking he\u2019s getting better and better\u201d at moving the cursor, Vyas said, referring to one of the monkeys he studied.",
              "\u201cThe natural question becomes: What happens if you switch to another context, where now he actually has to generate muscle activity?",
              "Do you see the effects of that learning in that new context?",
              "\u201d The short answer is yes, mental learning does transfer to physical performance.",
              "Vyas initially taught two monkeys outfitted with brain-machine interfaces to move a cursor from one place to another on a computer screen using only their minds, then introduced a complication, called a visuomotor rotation: what mental signals they previously used to move a cursor up would now move it at an angle, say 45 degrees clockwise.",
              "The monkeys easily adapted, and that adaptation carried over when they repeated the same task using their hands, rather than the brain-machine interface, to control the cursor directly.",
              "Now, if the monkeys wanted to move the cursor up, they moved their hands 45 degrees clockwise.",
              "This suggested that the monkeys were doing something like mental rehearsal, Vyas said \u2013 what they had learned to do in their minds, they could then do with their hands.",
              "Some additional experiments and an analysis of recorded neural activity suggest the reason why: rehearsing the task with a brain-machine interface got patterns of activity in the monkeys\u2019 brains into just the right spot, so they could carry out the same rotation task with their hands, even though they had never done so before.",
              "A new way to probe the mind \u201cThere are key differences between our paradigm and true mental rehearsal,\u201d Vyas said, and there are reasons to be cautious about interpreting the results too broadly.",
              "For one thing, one can\u2019t just ask a monkey to imagine skiing down a mountain slope, as one could with a person.",
              "For another, mentally rehearsing a task is not the same as using a brain-machine interface to do it.",
              "In the latter case, people get feedback on how they\u2019re doing, something they can only imagine in mental rehearsal.",
              "\u201cWe can\u2019t prove the connection beyond a shadow of a doubt,\u201d Shenoy said, but \u201cthis is a major step in understanding what mental rehearsal may well be in all of us.",
              "\u201d The next steps, he and Vyas said, are to figure out how mental rehearsal relates to practice with a brain-machine interface \u2013 and how mental preparation, the key ingredient in transferring that practice to physical movements, relates to movement.",
              "Meanwhile, Shenoy said, the results demonstrate the potential of an entirely new tool for studying the mind.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s like building a new tool and using it for something,\u201d Shenoy said.",
              "\u201cWe used a brain-machine interface to probe and advance basic science, and that\u2019s just super exciting.",

              "By actively training your brain, you can use neuroplasticity to your benefit by increasing the number of synaptic connections and thus maintaining cognitive ability as we age, and by reducing the speed of cognitive decline.",

              "Memory improvement also occurs if a set of information is learned by having it distributed across multiple events [25].",
              "For example, if people learn lists of words either within the same location, or spread across multiple location, such as rooms in a lab or windows on a computer screen, they remembered more when the set was divided between multiple events, rather than being part of a single event, complementing prior work on context and retroactive interference [71].",

              "After picking up an object and walking a fixed distance, memory was poorer if that walk included a doorway.",
              "This effect occurs both when the probes are pictures as well as labels, when people need to remember word pairs [76], with small computer screens, and real world movement [77].",
              "As shown in Figure 3, this is not simply a context effect: If people leave a room and then return to it, memory is not improved.",
              "It is also not solely a consequence of event segmentation: moving from one room into a second room and then into a third room leads to worse memory than returning to the original room.",
              "In both cases, there are two event boundaries but in the former case there are three retrieval contexts, whereas in the latter case there are two.",
              "Thus, at least part of the memory decrement reflects retrieval interference.",
              "The location updating effect is also not a matter of sensory-perceptual processing: it occurs for imagined doorways [78], for doorways separated by a transparent \u201cglass\u201d wall [79], and occurs when there is time to allow participants to process the sensory and perceptual transients [80].",
              "Finally, it should be noted that recent work [81] has shown that this pattern of performance was similar in younger and older adults suggesting that they manage their event models in long-term memory similarly.",

              "The more event models there are, the greater the interference, and the slower the retrieval time.",
              "This increase in retrieval time with an increase in the number of associations is called a fan effect.",
              "Recent work [82] has shown that the differential fan effect persists over long periods of time, largely unchanged.",

              "This beneficial effect of music on verbal episodic memory appears to be even stronger when the music is more rewarding, possibly due to interactions between reward-related brain networks and brain regions that support episodic memory83.",

              "One possible limitation of the present study is that neither continuous nor discrete (i.",
              "e., change-point) changes in emotional arousal were related to immediate tests of temporal memory.",
              "We observed comparable variability in both valence and arousal ratings across music listening and found that items that span valence and arousal change points coincide with prominent changes in valence and arousal, respectively.",
              "Participants also made emotion ratings consistent with the basic emotion categories of the songs designed by the composers.",
              "For these reasons, it is unlikely that a lack of arousal effects was driven by participants being unable to simultaneously track changes in both valence and arousal during music listening.",
              "However, because we collapsed emotional ratings across participants to account for variability in online cursor tracking and to retain otherwise well-performing participants for analysis, there is a possibility that the song-level arousal ratings were not sensitive enough to account for variance in temporal order and temporal distance memory.",
              "It could be the case that individuals primarily rely on valence information as an effective encoding strategy for committing sequential items to memory.",
              "However, high-valence, high-arousal states were related to enhanced delayed recognition and temporal source memory for otherwise neutral items. The temporal source of items encountered at arousal-related change points was also better remembered than the temporal source of items encountered at perceptual boundaries or non-boundaries, suggesting that large shifts in emotional arousal were still important for enhancing individual item representations and their surrounding temporal details in long-term memory.",
              "A final possibility is that while changes in valence may promote segmentation effects in the immediate retrieval of temporal memory, the effects of emotional arousal may require a longer period of consolidation to emerge.",

              "For instance, while our music stimuli may possess less intrinsic conceptual overlap with the item memoranda than do emotional images or scenes from films or video clips, people can still generate complex semantic content, such as narratives and mental imagery, while listening to unfamiliar instrumental music92,93,94.",
              "Because participants were instructed to form mental narratives using the items during encoding, there might have been unaccounted features of the music or images that promoted successful narrative encoding and thereby influenced temporal memory.",
              "To address this possibility, future studies should test how linguistic content generated while listening to music or other dynamically evocative media relates to various aspects of memory.",
              "Critically, we used music to manipulate the temporal stability of emotional contexts, enabling us to test how emotions alter the processing and encoding of an otherwise neutral series of events.",
              "In this way, the music/neutral-image pairing is somewhat similar to episodic associative learning paradigms, whereby neutral images are paired with appetitive or aversive unconditioned stimuli95.",
              "One key advantage of this approach is that it prevents an explicit induction of emotion during memory retrieval, which could trigger encoding specificity effects.",
              "Using neutral memoranda also largely avoids confounding the effects of emotion on encoding and retrieval processes, which is challenging to disentangle in memory paradigms that use IAPS images or still frames from films as memoranda.",

              "The hippocampus is thought to connect different parts of a memory that make up a specific episode.",
              "So right after encoding, a memory is usually episodically detailed, containing details about time and place22.",
              "Over time, encoded memories are proposed to become consolidated during sleep4,23 (and presumably also during rest24,25,26,27).",
              "The specifics of this process are still up to debate, but it is generally argued that consolidation acts to semanticize memories so that episodic details fade away and a semantic network of separately acquired, associated memories remains28,29.",
              "According to the systems consolidation model30, this leads a memory to become hippocampally independent after some time, meaning that the hippocampus is not necessary anymore to access the memory.",
              "An alternative theory, multiple trace or transformation theory31,32,33 poses that this process transforms memories such that the memory will contain episodic details only when the hippocampus can still access the memory.",
              "Otherwise, a memory can still be expressed, but will contain few or no episodic details.",
              "Generally, when memories are retrieved34 after consolidation, they have a different neural architecture than when they were first encoded4.",
              "Moreover, they do not always contain the same details, showing that memories are altered over time beyond our conscious awareness and are not retrieved as a solid entity, but rather reconstructed depending on present cues35,36.",

              "Piaget\u2019s concepts regarding accommodation (the adaptation of an existing schema) and assimilation (integration of new information into a schema) are still prevalent throughout educational theory, most importantly in constructivism41.",

              "Since then, a multitude of research has been published, both in animals and humans, that focuses on the question how the brain constructs, uses, and adapts schemas and what this means for how our memories are stored3.",

              "For example, you can ask yourself questions about what you already know about a topic or how it links to other topics.",
              "Moreover, the well-established method of loci extends new memories by linking them to spatial locations and combining different sensory systems to make the memory as vivid as possible75.",
              "This method can be easily trained and is shown to change neural processes underlying memory formation76,77.",
              "Similarly, reactivation of previous memories while learning new information is suggested to help to integrate them with an existing schema78, presumably making a new memory better connected and less likely to fade away17.",
              "All of this should happen at a desirable difficulty79, at an optimal \u201cdistance\u201d from the schema.",
              "This is rooted in the assumption that when new information is too alike you will not learn a lot, but very distinct information cannot be linked well either.",
              "Distinctiveness itself is also a characteristic that makes a memory more easily retrievable.",
              "It has long been known that events that stand out from their context are more easily remembered80.",
              "This has been viewed as an effect of novelty enhancing encoding, but it probably reflects easier recall of distinctive memories81,82.",
              "Making one item stand out from its context, e.",
              "g., by printing a word in a text in a different font, does not increase the strength with which it is encoded.",
              "However, it makes the word distinctive, which makes it easier to retrieve from memory (due to lessened interference).",
              "This was shown, for example, by a study in which items became distinctive only after they had been studied, i.",
              "e., by manipulating subsequent items, distinctiveness still led to better retrieval, even though it could not have affected the encoding of the items81.",
              "Novelty does affect encoding, though, but not on an item by item basis.",
              "Several studies have found that exploring a novel environment83,84 or seeing a set of novel pictures85 enhances encoding of subsequently learned material, up to thirty minutes later.",

However, empirical studies show that information consistent with prior knowledge can sometimes be integrated very quickly.",
              "We use artificial neural networks with properties like those we attribute to the neocortex to develop an understanding of the role of consistency with prior knowledge in putatively neocortex-like learning systems, providing new insights into when integration will be fast or slow and how integration might be made more efficient when the items to be learned are hierarchically structured.",

              "When a new item only overlaps with items within one branch of a hierarchy, interleaving can focus on the previously known items within this branch, resulting in faster integration with less interleaving overall.",

              "the other, based primarily in neocortex, supports the acquisition of structured knowledge that generally builds up over relatively long time scales.",
              "The primary evidence for this view comes from the effect of extensive bilateral lesions of the hippocampus and related structures in patient HM and subsequently in other neuropsychological patients and animals.",
              "In humans, these lesions profoundly impair the acquisition of arbitrary new memories, while leaving intact previously acquired knowledge and skills, as well as the ability to gradually acquire new skills and often-repeated factual information.",
              "The investigation of computational models based on multi-layer artificial neural networks provided one possible answer to the question, why do we have complementary learning systems in the brain?",
              "Early after their introduction, research with these models showed that they could gradually acquire structured knowledge through an interleaved learning process, such that experience with each item occurred repeatedly, interleaved with experience with other items. Several models of this kind were presented in the late 1980s and early 1990s, demonstrating how the mastery of structured bodies of knowledge of several different types could occur in this way, including knowledge of the mapping from spelling to sound [1,2], knowledge of the syntactic structure of sentences [3], knowledge of the mapping from sentences to meaning [4], and knowledge of concrete object semantics [5].",
              "Yet these models had a significant deficiency: McCloskey & Cohen [6] showed that an attempt to teach such models new information quickly led to catastrophic interference with the knowledge previously acquired by the network.",
              "In McClelland et al.",
              "[7], we drew on earlier ideas of Marr [8] to propose that complementary learning systems exist in the brain to solve this problem: according to our complementary learning systems theory (CLST), multi-layer neural networks, thought to be similar to the neocortex of the brain, need to be paired with a fast-learning, complementary system inspired by the human hippocampus.",
              "Features of the hippocampus, according to the theory, provide a specialized type of neural learning system that could learn new things rapidly, allowing new learning to occur without interfering with the knowledge previously acquired in the cortex-like multi-layered neural network.",
              "Simulations in McClelland et al.",
              "[7] showed that if these newly learned items were reactivated from the hippocampus-like system and used as learning experiences for the cortex-like network, interleaved with ongoing exposure to other information already known to the system, the new information would be gradually integrated into the neocortex-like network, without interference.",
              "The recent explosion of research in artificial intelligence using deep neural networks strongly reinforces and supports the ideas laid out above.",
              "These networks have achieved tremendous success in building up systems of structured knowledge, providing breakthroughs in machine vision, language processing, and mastery of the most challenging human-invented strategy games, including go and chess.",
              "These networks achieve this success through massively interleaved learning, gradually acquiring their abilities over hundreds of millions of experiences in some cases.",
              "Catastrophic interference is an important problem for such networks, and developing methods to allow them to acquire new knowledge quickly without interfering with existing knowledge is an open and important research question for artificial intelligence as well as for understanding biological neural systems [9].",
              "Furthermore, many of the solutions that are being explored (e.",
              "g. [10]) rely on complementary learning system-like solutions.",
              "Here, we build on recent developments in the neurobiology of learning and in the mathematical analysis of learning in multi-layer neural networks to advance our understanding of the acquisition of new knowledge and of resulting interference with what is already known.",
              "We begin by reviewing recent research demonstrating that new knowledge can sometimes be integrated very rapidly into cortex-like systems, with very little interference with prior knowledge, both in biological and artificial learners.",
              "We then present new work drawing on a recently developed mathematical theory of learning in deep neural networks to provide a mathematically explicit characterization of some of the observations from previous work, and to address two additional questions about what happens when we learn something new after building up prior knowledge.",
              "Specifically, we will address these questions: The answers to these questions should contribute to our understanding of how biological and artificial learning systems work.",
              "In addition, as we shall see, the answers to these questions have practical implications, suggesting experience presentation regimes that could make new learning more efficient in both natural and artificial learners.",
              "Specifically, we will explore when new learning can proceed rapidly, building efficiently on what has already been learned;",
              "and when it must proceed slowly to avoid interference.",
              "We will see that some but not all aspects of items to be learned might be integrated without interference, and we will identify ways in which interleaved learning might be optimized using similarity-weighted interleaved learning to speed the integration of harder-to-integrate aspects of new information into cortex-like networks, while avoiding catastrophic interference.",

              "For both the cardinal and the trout, the error is eliminated very rapidly, indicating that the network very rapidly acquired the ability to learn each of these two items.

It will be seen that this learning occurs with only the slightest of interference with the existing items. This result is consistent with the finding in Tse et al.",
              "that learning the two new flavour-place associations did not interfere with previously acquired flavour-place associations in the same environment.",
              "The very rapid learning of the new schema-consistent items by the network might correspond to learning that occurs in the animals through a combination of direct, within-experience learning and replay-based learning both within the in-arena learning episode and during subsequent off-line waking and resting periods, and the likelihood of this replay may depend on the prior existence of a schema for the environment.",
              "Based on the results from the somewhat analogous spatial learning studies of Pfeiffer [24], we know that animals engage in extensive preplay of neural representations of planned trajectories through space as they search for food at previously learned locations, and that animals also engage in off-line replay during rest and sleep during subsequent off-line periods after spatial learning [25].",
              "Of course, from available evidence, the extent of this replay-based learning cannot be known.",
              "We can suggest, however, that the failure of animals lacking a hippocampus to acquire new schema-consistent associations within the familiar environment might be a consequence of the unavailability of a representation in the hippocampus that would support replay of the correct route back to the target location.",
              "We conjecture that these replay events are crucial for allowing the animal to return to the correct location once found, allowing the animal to learn efficiently within the learning episode and allowing for amplification of neocortical learning opportunities through replay both during and after the episode.",
              "Before leaving our consideration of the learning of new schema-consistent items, we can consider how it is that these items can be learned so rapidly, and why it is that this learning produces so little interference.",
              "There are basically two points that are essential for understanding these findings.",
              "First, the back-propagated error signals arising from the two experiences with each of these items provide strong, coherent, convergent learning signals, driving the input-to-representation weights in figure 2 coherently toward values that treat the item either as a bird-like animal (in the case of the cardinal) or as a fish-like animal (in the case of the trout).",
              "Since (as we will discuss in the theory section of this article below) the learning signals depend on the knowledge already built up in these weights during schema acquisition, they are far stronger after schema acquisition than they would be earlier in learning.",
              "This allows the network to exhibit a readiness to learn that depends crucially on the prior acquisition of the relevant schema.",
              "Second, because the changes build up so quickly, the error at the output layer is very quickly eliminated, so that there is very little need or opportunity to adjust the connections that are shared among the different concepts in the weights forward of the representation layer in the network.",
              "We now turn attention to the experiment with the penguin.",
              "The penguin was the example used in the simulation of interference with previous learning to motivate the CLST in McClelland et al.",
              "[7].",
              "There, when the network was trained only with the ISA and CAN experiences involving the penguin, this resulted in substantial interference with previously learned items \u2013 particularly, the birds and fish.",
              "Indeed, we replicate this finding here, as shown in figure 3.",
              "Looking first on the left of the figure, we see that learning proceeds substantially more slowly for the penguin than it does for the trout and the cardinal, and correspondingly, on the right, the penguin produces far more interference with the previously learned birds and fish.",
              "The reasons for these effects can be understood in terms of the ideas we already considered to explain the faster learning and lack of interference for the schema-consistent trout and cardinal items. First, the back-propagated error information now partially cancels out, driving the connection weights in one case towards weights that would work for a bird and in the other toward weights that would work for a fish.",
              "The result is slower acquisition of connection weights from the input to the hidden layer that assign the penguin a representation intermediate between a fish and a bird.",
              "Second, the connection weights forward from the representation layer to the output for this compromise representation will partially activate bird and fish in the ISA context and swim and fly in the CAN context.",
              "Adjusting these weights to correctly activate bird for the ISA context and swim for the CAN context will result in a tendency to call all the animals birds (interfering with the known fish) and to say they all can swim and not fly (interfering with the known birds).",
              "It is useful to note that the results we observe with the penguin are not as extreme as the results we might observe if we trained the network with a pair of examples that are completely inconsistent with the learned schema based on the original eight items. Consider the case in which the input X-ISA is paired with three units randomly selected across all the output units of the network, and similarly for the input X-CAN.",
              "This would radically disrupt the schema acquired by the network, in which all ISA outputs come from one subset and all CAN outputs come from another, while also cross-pairing features that may never have occurred together in any items. Learning of such items would be very slow, and, as in the simulations reported in early work in McCloskey & Cohen [6], this learning would drastically interfere with the networks knowledge of all items previously acquired (for details, see [18]).",
              "The work reviewed above reflects the complexity of the issues that arise when we consider new learning in deep neural networks\u2014issues that may have analogues in new learning in biological learning systems such as humans and non-human animals.",
              "It would be an oversimplification to characterize new learning in a cortex-like neural network as inherently fast or slow\u2014instead, as discussed before [18], such learning has to be seen as prior knowledge dependent.",
              "Furthermore, it would be wrong to state that rapid learning in a cortex-like network always produces interference, or that the interference is necessarily completely catastrophic.",
              "Such effects are matters of degree, and depend on the consistency of the new information to be acquired with pre-existing knowledge.",
              "The analysis we have provided thus far is largely qualitative and intuitive.",
              "It has been helpful in clarifying when learning can be fast and slow and when learning can result in interference.",
              "However, many questions remain, and the qualitative principles we have described may not provide a sufficient guide to allow predictions about when we will observe rapid learning and/or interference with previously acquired knowledge.",

              "[26] to provide a mathematically explicit characterization of some of the ideas we have been discussing, and to address the two additional questions raised in the introduction: \u2018Are all aspects of new learning integrated into cortex-like networks at the same rate?",

              "Although the statistical structure in the matrix can be characterized in completely abstract terms, we support intuition by considering the items to be two birds, two fish, two trees and two flowers, and consider the properties to be attributes like those we have been considering for such items above.",
              "The dataset is simpler than the one we have used up to now: we now treat attributes of different types like can fly and has wings homogeneously, so that each item maps onto a single vector of features.",

              "First, the time required to learn about a particular hierarchical split in the data (as characterized, say, by the time required to reach 1/2 of the corresponding dimension\u2019s final value), depends primarily on the strength of the dimension, or the amount of variance in the data the dimension accounts for.",
              "Second, the sigmoidal character of the learning of each dimension can have the consequence of producing a highly stage-like process, so that the network can have mastered some dimensions fully (in our case, for example, the distinctions between plants and animals, captured in the strongest two dimensions in the SVD) before it exhibits any appreciable sensitivity to details of the differences among particular items (captured in the weakest dimensions).",
              "Taking these two points together, we see that detailed information about particular items captured by weaker dimensions in the training data is learned much more slowly than general information that is shared across many items. This pattern is also exhibited in human development and, as previously mentioned, in the dynamics of the deep nonlinear networks we first explored in McClelland et al.",
              "[7].",
              "These networks progressively differentiate hierarchies like the hierarchy of plants and animals, starting with the highest level categorical splits (for results comparable to those in figure 6a, see fig.",
              "4c of [19] or fig.",
              "3.",
              "4 of [20]).",
              "Our analysis of deep linear networks thus seems relevant to understanding the dynamics of learning in more complex real and artificial neural networks.",
              "The final point is that the time course of learning about each dimension depends on what is already known about this dimension at the time we begin to observe the process of learning, as reflected in the quantity ai(0).",
              "That is, the time required to learn about each dimension depends on what we already know about it at the time we start to measure learning.",
              "This observation is particularly relevant to our purpose in the next section, which is to characterize the time course of new learning from any given point we might choose to define as the reference time t = 0, as we shall see after a brief consideration of extensions of the domain of the theory.",
              "A feature of the simulations we have considered thus far is that they rely on a \u2018one-hot\u2019 input representation of each item such that each item is represented by a single neuron.",
              "If this were a real limitation of these networks it would be deeply disappointing, since it seems unlikely that biological systems would actually rely on single, grandmother-cell neurons.",
              "Happily, it turns out that this is not a real limitation.",
              "Here, we briefly consider three alternative cases.",
              "The first is the case in which the input vectors are not one-hot vectors, but instead are multi-dimensional orthogonal vectors, each of equal magnitude (where the magnitude is the square root of the sum of the squares of the values in the vector).",
              "The theory is completely unchanged in this case, although the actual input-classifying vectors will not be as transparently identifiable with the conceptual identity of each of the items. Indeed the one-hot version of the theory can simply be seen as a convenient transformation of the input patterns into a basis that allows the item classification vectors to be rendered more interpretable than they would be if they remained in the actual input coding space.",
              "Thus, for example, if the neural representations of the odour stimuli used in the Tse et al.",
              "experiments were approximately orthogonal high-dimensional vectors, then this input representation would be a useful way of modelling how they function as input to a deep neural network that maps them onto a structured system of internal representations of corresponding places in an arena.",
              "The second case we consider is one in which the patterns correspond to vectors that may have some degree of correlation, or similarity, to each other.",
              "Such correlations will induce a tendency for what is learned about one input to transfer to similar items, and this is likely to be helpful if, as is often the case, items that appear similar share other characteristics, or if the very same item appears slightly differently to the senses on different occasions.",
              "The situation can be more problematic if similar items must be mapped to completely different outputs, as could be the case if, for example, two very similar flavours in the Tse et al.",
              "experiment had to be mapped to two distinct places in the environment.",
              "The theory can address the effects of such correlations (and can capture differences in strength of input activations, capturing aspects of differences among features in their perceptual salience) as long as the set of patterns to be mapped to distinct outputs are linearly separable.",
              "(In cases where the inputs themselves are not linearly separable, the brain may employ conjunctive encoding schemes to help ensure that the patterns that are input to cortical learning systems are linearly separable;",
              "however, the theory does not address the process of learning to form such a linearly separable code.)",
              "Third, we consider the case in which the neural network is a deep linear auto-associator, i.",
              "e. a linear neural network that simply associates each pattern with itself, via a layer of hidden units (rather than relying on direct unit-to-unit connections).",
              "The auto-associative case is interesting because this form of learning is entirely driven by the distribution of experiences, without requiring separate input and target patterns to be provided by the environment, and indeed without requiring the experiences to be labelled as falling into distinct categories in any way.",
              "Instead of having one-hot input units for each item, the patterns corresponding to the items in the training set serve both as inputs to and targets for learning in the network, and the task of the network is to learn an input connection weight matrix W1 that maps from the input to the hidden layer and an output connection weight matrix W2 that maps from the hidden layer to reproduce the input on the output.",
              "Nonlinear networks of this type have been used extensively in deep learning research, where the hidden layer representations are thought of as providing a compressed, invertible representation of the input [28].",
              "The auto-associator is also interesting because it can perform pattern completion, a general form of memory in which any fragment or approximation of an input pattern can be thought of as serving as a potential cue for the reconstruction of all aspects of the pattern.",
              "Our linear auto-associator is also interesting in that it can be considered to capture one step of a recurrent computation in which the output of the auto-associator is repeatedly fed back into itself, allowing the learned states in the network to function as attractors.",
              "When we train such a network with our dataset, the time course of the development of the IO matrix (as before, the matrix of outputs produced by each of the eight input items) is characterized by the curves shown in the bottom panel of figure 6.",
              "Learning is still completely characterized by the singular value decomposition, but now with a much stronger dependence on the strength of the singular values: the rate of acquisition of each dimension is now proportional to the square of the singular value as reflected in the exponential terms in the revised learning dynamics equation below Thus, for example, a dimension 5 times stronger than another would be learned in 1/25 of the time required to learn the weaker dimension.",
              "This is reflected in the fact that the learning curves for the stronger dimensions are much steeper in the auto-associative case than in the case with one-hot inputs, as can be seen by comparing the top and bottom panels of figure 6.",
              "In summary, while details of the dynamics of learning depend on details of the neural network architecture, the training patterns, and the formulation of the learning task, the general characteristics of the time course of learning we observed with the analytically tractable deep linear network are conserved under a wide range of variations, supporting the view that the patterns of learning we have observed in our deep linear network are relevant to understanding learning in a wider range of cases.",
              "We therefore now return to the simple and analytically tractable deep linear case to explore its implications for learning new things in a network that has already learned the structure of a hierarchical dataset.",

              "This correspondence is indicated by the coincidence of the observed learning time for the new dimension, indicated by the solid curve rising from 0 starting part-way through the third normalized time interval in the singular value plot for the control condition, and the learning time that would be expected due simply to the reduced exposure to the three birds, indicated by the dashed curve.",

              "The sparrowhawk example we have considered here exemplifies properties of many of the new things that we learn about.",
              "New things often share properties with things we already know, but like the sparrowhawk, they are not fully predictable from those prior experiences in two ways.",
              "New items can have their own idiosyncratic content, represented by unique features not shared with other items, and they may recombine aspects of known items in novel ways.",
              "New types of things (like a new species of bird) or new individual persons, places or things, generally have many properties that are typical of their super-ordinate category, while also having unique properties or combinations of properties.",
              "Though our observations with the sparrowhawk were implicit in earlier work, the present work has brought out more clearly that it may be possible to learn some aspects of new things very quickly and without interference.",
              "It is not everything about something new that is hard to learn in a deep neural network, it is the aspects of it that differ from other things that can be hard to learn.",
              "Another important observation is that the interference with existing knowledge that arises from learning something new is also not completely general.",
              "As we have seen, new learning about the sparrowhawk interferes only with knowledge of similar things, and even then, the interference is restricted to those aspects of the similar items that are in conflict.",
              "There is no interference with knowledge of completely unrelated things at all, and no interference with knowledge of aspects of similar items that the new item shares with others it is similar to.",
              "These observations are captured in our simulations with a simple hierarchically structured dataset learned by a simple version of a deep neural network.",
              "Our analysis, building on previous work [26], reveals that learning in these networks must be understood in terms of learning the structure in the ensemble of items from which the network learns, rather than simply in terms of such matters as the frequency of exposure to the individual items themselves.",
              "The dimensional structure of the ensemble of items\u2014as captured by the SVD\u2014dictates the learning time needed to acquire knowledge, both when that information is being learned from scratch, and when it is being added to a body of knowledge already known.",
              "We can rapidly integrate the projection of the sparrowhawk onto existing knowledge structures.",
              "However, the novel features and novel combinations of features require a new dimension to be integrated into the structured representation in the weights of the network and thus require interleaved learning if they are to be learned without interference with other similar items. It is important to acknowledge that the networks we have focused on here are far less complex than the real neural networks in the brain.",
              "We have analysed networks that are completely linear and contain only two layers of modifiable connection weights, and the neural networks in the brain surely contain more layers and exploit nonlinear computations.",
              "While our simple networks capture many properties of learning in the deeper, nonlinear network we used in previous work, greater depth and nonlinearities add computational capabilities that our networks do not have.",
              "Thus it is important to be cautious in extrapolating what we have learned to deeper and more nonlinear networks or real biological systems, and further work is needed to explore the limits of any such extrapolation.",
              "Nevertheless, it seems worthwhile to consider the implications of our findings for understanding the roles of replay and interleaved learning in our understanding of the neural basis of learning and memory.",
              "To our knowledge, the idea of memory replay originated in the theoretical speculations of Marr [8], who proposed that the hippocampus stores in the order of 10 000 experiences every day, and replays them overnight to allow the cortex to sort them into categories and to adjust these category representations.",
              "Inspired by this, Wilson & McNaughton [25], building on Pavlides & Winson [31], were able to demonstrate that correlated patterns of neural activity occurring during waking behaviour were subsequently recapitulated during subsequent sleep episodes.",
              "Our extension of Marr\u2019s ideas, as elaborated first in McClelland et al.",
              "[7], offers a different take on the role of replay, however.",
              "In our theory, it is not just new information that needs to be re-experienced for integration into neocortical structures.",
              "Instead, the integration of newly encountered items or experiences with unique properties or novel combinations of properties requires interleaving with existing knowledge if this integration is to occur without interference.",
              "One view worth keeping under consideration is that much of the interleaving that is required for integration of new knowledge may come from ongoing experience.",
              "For example, if we acquired a new pet, we would experience it every day, and as we continue to go about our daily routine, we would continue to be exposed to many other things.",
              "The hippocampus could play an important role in initial formation of a memory for the new pet.",
              "Some aspects consistent with existing knowledge would be easy for the cortex to learn, while others, such as remembering the name of a new pet or its particular proclivities would remain hippocampus-dependent for a longer period of time.",
              "Gradually, the cortex would learn through repeated exposure, so that the hippocampus would no longer be necessary.",
              "Meanwhile, we would have ongoing exposure to other things including other people\u2019s pets and other animals, avoiding the problem of catastrophic interference.",
              "A question arises here: what, in this view, would be the role of replay of new information during off-line periods shortly after initial exposure to new information?",
              "While this replay is often thought to begin the process of integration into the neocortex, another important possible role would be to help stabilize the plastic changes within the fast-learning hippocampal system, ensuring that the new learning remains available for use and replay over an extended time period.",
              "If such replay events were selective for repeated and/or highly salient aspects of our recent experience, they would help conserve limited synaptic resources in both hippocampal and neocortical circuits, reserving them for material likely to be of use in the future.",
              "We have also explored a factor that could potentially speed the integration of arbitrary new information into neocortex, namely hippocampus-dependent replay of recent experience interleaved with selective replay of similar already known information.",
              "We observed that learning arbitrary new aspects of things without interference with existing knowledge does not require ongoing exposure to all existing knowledge;",
              "instead it can be enough to focus only on related items, relying on an experience protocol we have called SWIL.",
              "Similarity-based reactivation of pre-existing knowledge could occur, in part, during direct experience with new things.",
              "Returning to the example of a new pet, when we have an experience with it, that experience may trigger memories of other pets\u2014our own or those of our friends and acquaintances.",
              "Thus, it is possible that similarity-weighted exposure to related things we already know about may be a natural concomitant of experience with new things.",
              "While ongoing experience may play a role in promoting interleaved learning, some studies support the idea that replay without ongoing exposure can also lead to neocortical consolidation.",
              "In one study showing this pattern, Kim & Fanselow [32] exposed rats to highly aversive tone-shock pairings in a single session in a novel environment.",
              "They found that removal of the hippocampus one day after the experience resulted in little or no expression of fear when the animals were returned to the environment, but leaving the hippocampus intact for a period of one to four weeks after this experience resulted in gradually increasing expression of fear after a subsequent hippocampal lesion.",
              "The increase in fear memory occurred while the animals were retained in their home cages, with no re-exposure to the fear-inducing environment.",
              "While there are many studies that have failed to show increasing retention after a longer period prior to a hippocampal lesion [33], there are other sources of evidence of gradual integration into the neocortex.",
              "For example, Takehara-Nishiuchi & McNaughton [34] demonstrated the emergence of neural activity in deep layers of the medial prefrontal cortex over a period of several weeks without ongoing task exposure, also supporting the idea of gradual integration of initially hippocampus-dependent learning into non-HC-dependent structures through off-line replay.",
              "In the context of the evidence for gradual integration of new knowledge into the cortex without ongoing exposure from the environment, it is intriguing to consider the possibility that SWIL might occur during off-line periods based on information already stored in the brain.",
              "In ongoing work, we are exploring the possibility that a hippocampus-dependent replay of a recent new memory would activate the corresponding representation in the neocortex, providing a learning trial for the cortex based on the new memory.",
              "The initial cortical activation during the novel experience might also leave a residual trace within the cortex that may bias the cortex, so that spontaneous neural activity would tend to reactivate memories stored in the neocortical connection weights with neural activity patterns that overlap with the one that represents the new experience.",
              "In future work, we hope to explore this possibility through computer simulations relying on more biologically grounded simulated neural networks than the ones we have employed in the work presented here.",
              "While the work reported here demonstrates that similarity-weighted interleaving can allow new information to be fully integrated with less ongoing exposure to existing knowledge than might otherwise have been thought, we have not found a similar advantage for similarity weighting with some other datasets and neural network architectures.",
              "In ongoing work, we are exploring this issue.",
              "It should be clear from our simulations that degree of overlap with other patterns is a relevant factor that influences the efficacy of similarity weighting, and future work should explore whether sparse coding schemes that reduce overall pattern similarity might enhance the advantage of similarity weighting.",
              "Perhaps, if each pattern to be learned only overlaps with a small fraction of the other patterns, then interleaving might only be required for the items in this small set.",
              "On the other hand, excessive sparsity can reduce a network\u2019s ability to capture relevant similarity structure and thereby to generalize in useful ways, and cortical networks may, therefore, exploit an intermediate level of sparsity that balances the need to capture generalizations while minimizing interference [35].",
              "In summary, the extent of the advantage of similarity weighting is likely to depend on the details of the similarity relationships among the patterns to be learned, and future work is needed to explore more fully the advantages that similarity weighting might provide in a wider range of situations and to explore how the representations of items to be learned might be tailored to promote the effectiveness of similarity weighting.",
              "More broadly, it should be noted that our work does not fully address the broader literature on learning structured bodies of knowledge and the roles of schema consistency and inconsistency in new learning.",
              "In particular, much of the work in humans highlights an important role for novelty as well as schema consistency in driving memory replay, and a role for the medial pre-frontal cortex in this process [14], and other evidence suggests that less consistent information may be prioritized for replay [17,36].",
              "A complete theory of new learning will require a fuller understanding of these important aspects of the memory formation and replay process [37].",
              "Before closing, a comment may be in order about the relationship between computer simulations and experimental investigations of real neural systems. The role of models is not to capture reality in all of its complexity, but to simplify it so that some of its key properties may be understood [38,39].",
              "The simple simulations we present here do not fully capture what really happens in the brain during learning.",
              "We strongly believe that further progress will still require simplification, but that any consideration of what is observed in the behaviour of simulation models must also be viewed as providing a limited perspective that needs to be complemented by consideration of the properties of the real neural system.",
              "It is only though such interplay that real progress will be made.",
              "In spite of many years of progress in the psychology, neurobiology, and computational analysis of learning and memory, there remains a great deal we still have to learn.",
              "Real brains are far more complex than the simple networks we have considered here, and so is real experience.",
              "The discovery of the medial temporal lobe amnesic syndrome, the invention of methods that allow us to study neural activity during experience and during later offline periods, and the exploration of artificial neural networks that allow aspects of learning and memory to be captured in simulations have provided a starting place, and the findings from the research that has ensued in the wake of these developments constitutes real progress.",
              "Yet, they still leave us with only a partial understanding of how experiences and their replay contribute to learning and memory.",
              "We hope that the ideas and findings we have presented here will contribute to the ongoing exploration of these issues, and we expect that a full understanding will require ongoing research of all of the types we have mentioned for many years to come.",
              "1The quantities computed by PCA can be derived from the SVD and vice versa, if the column means are first subtracted from the item property matrix before calculating the SVD.",
              "In that case, the singular values in the SVD are proportional to the square roots of the eigenvalues in PCA.",
              "See [27] for more details.",
              "The quantities captured in the SVD without subtracting the column means are directly related to the dynamics of learning in our model, and so are more useful for present purposes.",
              "2We follow the mathematical convention in which a bold lowercase letter such as x corresponds to a column vector and a bold uppercase letter such as X corresponds to a matrix.",

              "To better support intuition, we transpose the data matrix employed in [26];",
              "this swaps the roles of the ui and viT.",
              "3The adequacy of the approximation depends on having enough hidden units to make it likely that there is a dimension embedded in the initial weights such that each to-be-learned dimension projects reasonably strongly onto it.",
              "A perfect match to the equation can be obtained by initializing the network with weights that exactly capture the to-be-learned dimensions scaled down to align with the chosen value of ai(0).",

              "The combined \u201cpush\u2013pull\u201d action of replay on the one hand (\u201cpush\u201d equals potentiating \u201cimportant\u201d traces) and downscaling on the other (\u201cpull\u201d equals weakening irrelevant traces) may together aid the construction and updating of memory networks in the cortex (Diekelmann and Born 2010;",

              "Sleep replay seems to be a widespread phenomenon requiring participation and cooperation among many different brain areas, whereas downscaling is thought to be a more local process, which is locally initiated and regulated.",
              "What mechanisms are responsible for memory traces becoming consolidated during sleep?",
              "To initiate replay in the hippocampus, a slow oscillation starts in the prefrontal cortex, consisting of an alternation between states of generalized cortical excitation and depolarized membrane potentials (UP states) and generalized states of relative neuronal silence (DOWN states).",
              "This oscillation, as seen in intracranial recordings of patients being evaluated for epileptic surgery, travels across the brain to the medial temporal lobe (Nir et al.",
              "2011), where it is followed by sharp wave ripples in the hippocampus.",
              "During sharp wave ripples, 30% of hippocampal neurons increase their firing rate, and the replay of sequential firing of neurons that encode, for example, previous spatial experiences occurs in a temporally compressed form (Wilson and McNaughton 1994).",
              "Hippocampal replay was first observed in the rat when place cells were seen to fire during sleep in the same sequence as they fired on a linear track when the rat was actually running (Wilson and McNaughton 1994).",
              "Since then, many other interesting attributes of sharp wave ripples and replay have been reported.",
              "Replay occurs 7\u201310 times faster than the original experience (Euston et al.",
              "2007) and seems to be homeostatically regulated.",
              "The increased appearance of sharp wave ripples after their disruption is seen only after a significant learning period (Girardeau et al.",
              "2014).",
              "Further, the type of neural network being activated during replay, that is, the specific memory, can be recognized by the typical morphology of the ripple (Reichinnek et al.",
              "2010), and longer memories seem to be replayed across multiple sharp wave ripples (Davidson et al.",
              "2009).",
              "By recording neuronal firing patterns in the prefrontal cortex at choice points in a maze and during sleep, it has been shown that hippocampal replay during sleep (but not during the awake state) is directly communicated to the prefrontal cortex.",
              "As a result, there is simultaneous expression in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of learning-associated neural firing patterns (Peyrache et al.",
              "2009).",
              "Evidence for replay has also been found in other brain areas, including the striatum, motor cortex, and visual cortex (Euston et al.",

              "Additionally, if sharp-wave ripples are followed by neocortical spindles, secondary larger waves of increased firing rates can be observed in the cortex (Wierzynski et al.",
              "2009).",
              "At the same time, by comparing unit firing in the cortex and hippocampus during spindles, it was observed in one study that the cortex became functionally deafferented from hippocampal inputs during sleep spindles (Peyrache et al.",
              "2011).",
              "Spindles may also play an additional but separate role in local cortical processing during sleep, which is independent of the hippocampal replay mechanism (Andrillon et al.",
              "2011).",
              "As discussed earlier, recent studies in humans have tried to increase the probability of replay during sleep by cueing recently learned memories via smell or sound associations (Rasch et al.",

              "Rudoy et al.",
              "2009).",
              "In a related study in rats, two running tracks were associated with distinct sounds.",
              "In this case, cueing replay during sleep did not increase the absolute amount of replay.",
              "Instead, cueing biased replay toward the cued content at the cost of the noncued content (Bendor and Wilson 2012).",
              "Interestingly, replay is observed not only during sleep, but can occur during waking as well.",
              "Intervention studies have addressed whether there are different functions of replay in sleep versus awake states by interrupting sharp wave ripples with electrical stimulation whenever they occur (Fig.",
              "2D).",
              "This work has hinted at the possibility that replay during sleep is important for consolidation processes, whereas awake replay is more associated with spatial working memory and navigational planning (Girardeau et al.",
              "2009;",

              "2012;",
              "Pfeiffer and Foster 2013).",
              "However, both awake and sleep replay do seem to contribute to later memory performance (Dupret et al.",
              "2010), with awake replay, perhaps, serving to initially stabilize memory but with sleep replay operating in association with systems consolidation.",
              "To summarize, there are time-dependent changes in physiological function that relate to or mediate aspects of systems memory consolidation, as now shown with 2-DG, immediate early gene mapping, and electrophysiological recordings.",
              "New technologies, notably optical recording, offer the opportunity to study these changes dynamically in large numbers of neurons.",
              "This approach might require a head-fixed, virtual-reality paradigm that could be used over the time periods after learning when consolidation occurs.",
              "New approaches are starting to use elegant inducible and reversible genetic interventions to examine systems consolidation.",
              "The focus here is not on the specific molecular mechanisms of consolidation (discussed elsewhere in this collection), but on the use of molecular engineering approaches to illuminate the dynamics of systems consolidation.",
              "Two studies illustrate the approach.",
              "In one study, optogenetic inhibition of the hippocampus was deployed to examine the interplay of the hippocampus and neocortex, emphasizing the opportunity that this technique offers for precise temporal intervention (Goshen et al.",
              "2011).",
              "Halorhodopsin-induced inhibition of area CA1 of the hippocampus reduced the frequency of cell firing and blocked the acquisition and retrieval of contextual fear conditioning.",
              "Brief optogenetic inhibition (for 5 min) of hippocampus consistently interfered with retrieval (after 28 days, 9 weeks, and 12 weeks).",
              "In contrast, more extended pharmacological and optogenetic inhibition spared remote memory, but impaired recent memory, revealing a temporal gradient (Fig.",
              "2E).",
              "Brief inhibition of CA1 resulted in a decreased c-fos expression at recall in both CA1 and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), whereas extended inhibition decreased expression in CA1, but increased expression in ACC.",
              "These results could mean that prolonged inhibition allows for compensatory activity to develop and that this compensatory activity supports remote memory performance.",
              "An alternative is that prolonged inhibition allows nonspecific effects of the inhibition to wear off and remote memory to be successfully expressed.",
              "The concept of rapid cortical tagging (Lesburgueres et al.",
              "2011;",
              "Tse et al.",
              "2011) suggests that, even if the hippocampus is normally engaged for a short period for \u201cbinding\u201d disparate cortical networks during memory encoding and the early stages of consolidation, a memory trace of some kind is rapidly formed in the cortex.",
              "The cortical trace in this case corresponds to the episodic memory-like trace that was formed during the initial experience and not to a gist-memory trace.",
              "This trace may ordinarily require co-occurrent activity in the hippocampus for behavioral expression during the consolidation period, but this involvement of the hippocampus might be mimicked optogenetically.",
              "That is, if the role of the hippocampus during the consolidation period is to engage cortical neurons selectively during the stabilization process, this function of the hippocampus might be achieved optogenetically by selectively activating those cortical neurons that are involved in the memory.",
              "A relevant step forward has used context fear conditioning and tet-TAG mice in which c-fos is used to drive the insertion of a channelrhodopsin-like protein into learning-activated cells (Cowensage et al.",
              "2014).",
              "A subset of neurons in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) was tagged in this way during context fear conditioning.",
              "Subsequently, it was possible to activate just this subset of RSC cells optogenetically (despite diffuse light activation of all cells) because only those neurons were activated that had been firing at the time of cortical memory encoding and had, therefore, expressed c-fos.",
              "The mice showed elevated freezing in response to the light, an observation made even more secure through the use of a context discrimination procedure (reminiscent of Wiltgen\u2019s work cited earlier).",
              "Increased freezing was also observed in response to light activation of the RSC network when the hippocampus was simultaneously inactivated with lidocaine (Fig.",
              "2F).",
              "Thus, although the hippocampus may ordinarily serve to guide the process of neocortical stabilization, its role can be bypassed if another (exogeneous) method is used to activate the appropriate subset of neocortical neurons.",
              "Whereas the method of bypassing the hippocampus is artificial, this is an important proof-of-principle study establishing that memory traces in the cortex are sufficient for memory expression.",
              "Evidence for memory consolidation has accumulated in the laboratory and the clinic for more than 100 years.",
              "Yet, quantitative studies of retrograde amnesia began only in the 1970s, and the idea that consolidation involves a dialogue between the hippocampus and neocortex is even more recent.",
              "Information is stored initially in both the hippocampus and neocortex, and the hippocampus then guides a gradual process of reorganization and stabilization whereby information in the neocortex eventually becomes independent of the hippocampus.",
              "This is the so-called standard model of memory consolidation depicted in Figure 3A.",
              "It is now known that the rate of this process depends on the extent to which new information can be related to preexisting knowledge, such as networks of connected neurons called \u201cschemas\u201d (Fig.",
