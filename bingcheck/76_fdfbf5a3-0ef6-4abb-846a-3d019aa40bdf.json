              "The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE), named after the two scientists who predicted it, describes what happens to the photons of the CMB when they pass through the ICM and scatter off the free electrons present in the hot gas that fills galaxy clusters.",
              "These electron-photon collisions redistribute the frequencies of photons in a characteristic way such that, when looking at the CMB in the direction of a galaxy cluster, one observes a deficit, with respect to the average CMB signal, of low-energy photons, and a subsequent surplus of more energetic ones.",

              "As a result, the SZE is a unique tool for detecting galaxy clusters, even at high redshift.",
              "The signature of the SZE does not depend on the redshift of the galaxy cluster that produces it in a similar way as the light coming from a lantern and passing through an intervening lane of fog is dimmed by the same amount, regardless whether the lane is closer to the lantern or to the observer.",

              "Credit: Nick Higgins Just like trees, people and stars, galaxies have life cycles.",
              "A galaxy is born when enough gas and stars coalesce to form a coherent structure\u2014perhaps it starts as one cloud of gas and slowly gathers mass, or maybe it builds up from the collision of two or more clouds.",
              "Either way, once formed, a galaxy spends its lifetime making stars, using its reservoirs of gas to create tiny furnaces where nuclear fusion burns elements to release light and energy.",
              "A galaxy deemed \u201calive\u201d shines strongly in ultraviolet light, a signal of young, bright and hot stars.",
              "As those stars age, their light changes from hot and blue to cool and yellow or red.",
              "When a galaxy contains mostly yellow and red stars and emits little to no ultraviolet light, we consider it retired, or \u201cred-and-dead.",
              "\u201d Eventually, if massive enough, it becomes a spheroidal blob, known as an elliptical galaxy, that will likely never birth a new star again.",
              "All around us in nearby space\u2014within, say, 300 million to 600 million light-years\u2014astronomers see dead or dying elliptical galaxies gathered in great ensembles called galaxy clusters.",
              "These clusters hold the fossilized remains of the most massive galaxies ever formed\u2014hundreds to thousands of them slowly dancing around one another, gravitationally bound forever in their permanent graves.",
              "But galaxy clusters present a problem for astronomers.",
              "Most clusters seem to have been established by the time the universe was only half of its current age.",
              "That means the galaxies within those clusters must have birthed most of the stars they contain early in cosmic history.",
              "It appears that these galaxies grew to the size of the Milky Way or larger but up to 10 billion years more quickly.",
              "The young galaxy clusters, called protoclusters, where these galaxies formed must have been incredibly violent and active places, full of galaxies producing stars at a furious pace.",
              "Our current understanding of physics cannot quite explain how they could have grown so big so quickly.",
              "Only recently have astronomers had the telescopic tools necessary to find protoclusters, which are very distant (their light often travels 10 billion years or more to reach us) and frequently hide their most massive galaxy members behind dust.",
              "In the past few years scientists have discovered two protoclusters that are providing an unprecedented window into cluster growth.",
              "Follow-up observations have revealed that they are, in fact, active and huge\u2014so huge that they challenge our understanding of galaxy formation.",
              "If we can solve the riddle posed by galaxy clusters, we may redefine our understanding of the evolution of the universe.",
              "The most common type of star-forming galaxy produces roughly one to tens of suns' worth of stars a year.",
              "These are often called normal star-forming galaxies.",
              "The Milky Way is in this class.",
              "Normal star-forming galaxies are metaphorical tortoises, forming stars slowly and steadily over the course of 10 billion years or so, remaining blue and disklike and depleting their reservoirs of fresh gas (fuel for new stars) at a leisurely pace.",
              "Galaxies that produce hundreds to thousands of stars every year are known as starburst galaxies.",
              "These are the hares in galaxy evolution.",
              "In perhaps 300 million years at most, these galaxies burst into existence, form as many stars as possible as quickly as possible and, in a cosmic blink of an eye, run out of fuel.",
              "Starbursts live fast and die young.",
              "Astronomers think that they are the best candidate ancestors for the massive, dead elliptical galaxies we see in clusters today.",
              "It stands to reason that if we looked deep enough into space, we would find protoclusters filled with starburst galaxies\u2014tomorrow's clusters of dead galaxies.",
              "Yet finding starburst galaxies in protoclusters has proved challenging.",
              "Until recently, most of our methods for spotting clusters were developed to preferentially select dying elliptical galaxies or the hot gas that pervades the space between them.",
              "Elliptical galaxies and hot intracluster gas appear at the later stages of galaxy cluster evolution, so we need new methods to find their bluer, more star-forming infant counterparts.",
              "To make things more difficult, protoclusters are often spread far apart on the sky because the galaxies have yet to fully coalesce into the dense structures we see today.",
              "When our most famous and precise telescopes have cameras that span only the width of a pencil (the Hubble Space Telescope, for instance), it is not surprising that we cannot piece together protocluster puzzle pieces that are spread across the sky at distances more than 100 times greater than our telescope's field of view.",
              "Other methods of searching, such as systematically surveying large swaths of the sky, tend to miss starburst galaxies because they are often obscured by dust.",
              "The exceptional stellar growth in starbursts generates an overabundance of heavy metals that are produced in the explosive deaths of stars.",
              "Once dispersed into space, heavy elements such as iron, carbon and gold collide to form complex dust molecules that absorb and obscure ultraviolet and optical light.",
              "Think of the reddening sun during wildfire season: dust dims hotter, more energetic blue light while letting redder light sneak through.",
              "The result is that starburst galaxies are nearly invisible when viewed with optical and ultraviolet telescopes, but they shine like beacons when viewed in the cooler infrared spectrum.",
              "All of this means that until recently, the tools to find and study protoclusters usually missed a key population of galaxies.",
              "From the late 1990s through the early 2010s the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometer Array, the Herschel Space Observatory, the South Pole Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope revolutionized our understanding of the dust-obscured universe by unveiling millions of galaxies that were previously invisible.",
              "Starting about 15 years ago, astronomers began studying the clustering properties of dusty starbursts, and they found that these powerhouses live preferentially near other large and actively star-forming galaxies.",
              "But the state of technology was still behind our ambitions;",
              "the resolution of infrared and millimeter telescopes was still so low that multiple galaxies would get blended into one large object, even if those galaxies were far apart but lay along the same line of sight.",
              "The age of the infrared universe was here, but we needed sharper and more sensitive instruments to fully comprehend what we were seeing.",
              "Finally, in 2013, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) arrived.",
              "High in the Chilean desert, this collection of nearly 70 radio dishes works together as a single telescope, reaching resolutions up to 600 times sharper than that of the Herschel telescope.",
              "ALMA has transformed many corners of astronomy, including galaxy evolution.",
              "(I know several people with tattoos dedicated to this telescope.)",
              "The observatory is excellent at detecting dusty, gaseous stellar nurseries throughout star-forming galaxies.",
              "With it, astronomers have discovered systems that are both shocking and exciting.",
              "In 2018 two separate teams of astronomers used ALMA to study the brightest infrared objects they could find in the distant universe.",
              "Each team discovered a different conglomeration of dusty, starbursting galaxies that were previously blended together, hiding as one in surveys taken by the first generation of infrared telescopes.",
              "SPT2349-56, a group of 14 galaxies, and the Distant Red Core (DRC), a group of 10 galaxies, were both found growing and thriving in different corners of the universe, when the cosmos was only 10 percent of its current age.",
              "We see both these budding protoclusters undergoing extreme bursts of star formation\u2014each group birthing nearly 10,000 times as much stellar mass a year as the Milky Way does\u2014across volumes only half the size of our Local Group (which includes our own galaxy plus Andromeda and several smaller galaxies).",
              "Estimates of the protoclusters' individual gas reservoirs tell us that if these galaxies continued to form stars at such excessive rates, they would exhaust their fuel supply in just a few hundred million years and become the massive red-and-dead elliptical galaxies that are ubiquitous in fully grown clusters.",
              "Moreover, they would complete this cycle well before the present era.",
              "The discovery of these two dust-obscured protocluster cores presented a promising new lens for studying cluster growth, but we were still missing an important part of the picture.",
              "The best way to \u201cweigh\u201d a galaxy is to measure the light from its adult star population, which requires data from across the electromagnetic spectrum.",
              "But until recently, all observations of protoclusters living in the first two billion years of the universe had been conducted within a narrow energy spectrum (in either the optical or the infrared).",
              "Then, in September 2018, my colleagues and I were able to observe, for the first time, ultraviolet and optical emission from a dusty, starbursting protocluster as seen 12 billion years ago: the Distant Red Core.",
              "Using the Hubble Space Telescope, the Gemini Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope, we captured the multiwavelength perspective necessary to more deeply understand this structure's past and future.",
              "Waiting for Hubble Space Telescope data can be anticlimactic.",
              "You know the day that your patch of the sky is scheduled for observation, but you have no idea when you will actually receive your data: you just have to wait for an e-mail notification to tell you to check the archive.",
              "The day our protocluster observations were scheduled, I checked my e-mail what felt like every two minutes.",
              "I was disappointed when it was time to go to bed and nothing had arrived in my in-box.",
              "The following morning, against my partner's protests, I rolled out of bed immediately and went straight to my computer to see if the data had at last come in.",
              "Fortunately, it had been delivered a few hours past midnight.",
              "I commenced the download, dancing impatiently like a child waiting for her turn to unwrap presents.",
              "Finally, I opened the image.",
              "No words can describe how it feels to be the first person to glimpse a part of the universe that no one else has seen.",
              "I felt compelled to take a moment to inspect each star and galaxy in the field, to acknowledge their existence.",
              "Eventually I snapped back to myself and zoomed in on the part of the sky I was interested in.",
              "I saw something remarkable.",
              "This little region of space is violent.",
              "At least half of the galaxies there were so messily shaped they must have recently crashed into other nearby galaxies or were still in the process of doing so.",
              "When we measured the population of adult stars in these galaxies, we found something incredible\u2014so incredible that it may pose a problem for our current understanding of the universe.",
              "Already at this early era, some of the Distant Red Core galaxies had formed three times more stars than our own Milky Way has\u2014but in just a fraction of the time.",
              "Yet simulations of the universe based on known physics struggle to produce galaxies this massive so early on.",
              "This incongruity between simulation and observation exacerbates a problem that we have known about since the discovery of dusty, star-forming galaxies.",
              "Modeling the extreme pace and density of star formation seen in starbursts is difficult because physics predicts the simulated galaxies should either shred themselves apart or heat up so much that they blow out all of the fresh gas needed to grow large enough to match what we see today.",
              "The protocluster as a whole presents another problem: it is shockingly massive.",
              "When I first measured it, I could not believe my numbers.",
              "I knocked on doors in my department to make sure I was doing the calculations right.",
              "Two weeks later I brought the results to a conference to show my collaborators.",
              "One said, \u201cThere must be a bug in your code.",
              "\u201d Another asked, \u201cAre you sure you're not double counting somewhere?",
              "\u201d (Turns out there was a small bug in my code, but it was not enough to explain the huge measurement.)",
              "Eventually, after double-checking my calculations and trying out different methods, the measurements became undeniable.",
              "The Distant Red Core seems to be too big for our universe.",
              "We do not know how it could have gotten so large in such a short time.",
              "To better understand its bulk and how much mass was in the form of stars, we zeroed in on the size of the dark matter halo around this protocluster.",
              "Dark matter is the most abundant form of matter in any given galaxy and in the universe as a whole.",
              "All galaxies and clusters are thought to be surrounded by blobs, or halos, of this mysterious stuff.",
              "And although it is invisible and poorly understood, dark matter leaves a clear gravitational signal.",
              "There are a variety of ways to infer the amount of dark matter in a given astronomical object, and to cover those methods would require an additional article (or five).",
              "Suffice it to say, we weighed the dark matter component of the Distant Red Core, and according to our simulations, it contains nearly the largest allowable halo mass at that period in the history of the universe.",
              "This apparent overabundance of dark matter means that the DRC may be so large that it violates the laws of our universe as we understand them.",
              "When we fast-forward our simulations to estimate what the DRC may look like after evolving 12 billion years to the present day, we find that it may grow to be larger than the largest known galaxy cluster, El Gordo.",
              "Although we have a healthy margin of error on our dark matter calculation (meaning it could be overestimated), the discrepancy looks even worse when we consider the fact that our observations are capturing only a small percentage of the likely galaxy cluster members;",
              "there are probably more galaxies in the DRC that were simply out of the narrow field of view of our telescopes and thus not included in our calculations.",
              "This mismatch most likely will grow as we continue surveying and studying this protocluster.",
              "Our investigation of the Distant Red Core, along with the discoveries of other potentially similar protoclusters, forces us to reconsider our understanding of galaxy cluster formation.",
              "Because the galaxies in clusters are likely to be some of the first galaxies ever, we must determine how such massive objects can form so quickly.",
              "Doing so is not just an issue of constraining the physical mechanics and chemistry of star formation inside the first galaxies.",
              "It is also a matter of investigating the timing of the conditions that lead dark matter to gravitationally collapse into halos, seeding galaxies.",
              "Is it possible that galaxies and structure began forming earlier in the universe than we thought?",
              "What does that mean for our understanding of the formation of the first elements?",
              "Could these galaxies have forged the right ingredients to build stars with habitable planets around them\u2014and perhaps hosted some of the first forms of life in the universe?",
              "Some of these questions probably will not be answered during my lifetime, but I and other astrophysicists are working hard and fast to address the others.",
              "Already we are carrying out more observations of these known protoclusters across the electromagnetic spectrum.",
              "We are also developing new methods for identifying large samples of dusty protocluster candidates.",
              "With more examples, we may be able to determine whether protoclusters such as the Distant Red Core are examples of a common, yet previously invisible, phase of galaxy evolution that all clusters go through or just rarities.",
              "Observers and theorists are forming new collaborations to learn how early in the history of the universe conditions were right for protoclusters akin to those we have discovered\u2014pockets of space overdense with tremendous rates of star formation and outsize masses.",
              "The best way to test our physical models is to look at extremes.",

              "When interacting with the fast-moving electrons in the hot gas, this light gains some energy and changes its colour, or wavelength, slightly.",

              "Combining data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory with radio observations and computer simulations, an international team of scientists has discovered a vast wave of hot gas in the nearby Perseus galaxy cluster.",
              "Spanning some 200,000 light-years, the wave is about twice the size of our own Milky Way galaxy.",
              "The researchers say the wave formed billions of years ago, after a small galaxy cluster grazed Perseus and caused its vast supply of gas to slosh around an enormous volume of space.",
              "\"Perseus is one of the most massive nearby clusters and the brightest one in X-rays, so Chandra data provide us with unparalleled detail,\" said lead scientist Stephen Walker at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.",
              "\"The wave we've identified is associated with the flyby of a smaller cluster, which shows that the merger activity that produced these giant structures is still ongoing.\"",
              "A paper describing the findings appears in the June 2017 issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and is available online.",
              "Galaxy clusters are the largest structures bound by gravity in the universe today.",
              "Some 11 million light-years across and located about 240 million light-years away, the Perseus galaxy cluster is named for its host constellation.",
              "Like all galaxy clusters, most of its observable matter takes the form of a pervasive gas averaging tens of millions of degrees, so hot it only glows in X-rays.",
              "Chandra observations have revealed a variety of structures in this gas, from vast bubbles blown by the supermassive black hole in the cluster's central galaxy, NGC 1275, to an enigmatic concave feature known as the \"bay.\"",
              "The bay's concave shape couldn't have formed through bubbles launched by the black hole.",
              "Radio observations using the Karl G.",
              "Jansky Very Large Array in central New Mexico show that the bay structure produces no emission, the opposite of what scientists would expect for features associated with black hole activity.",
              "In addition, standard models of sloshing gas typically produced structures that arc in the wrong direction.",
              "Walker and his colleagues turned to existing Chandra observations of the Perseus cluster to further investigate the bay.",

              "For comparison, visible light has energies between about two and three electron volts.",
              "The scientists then filtered the Chandra data to highlight the edges of structures and reveal subtle details.",
              "Next, they compared the edge-enhanced Perseus image to computer simulations of merging galaxy clusters developed by John ZuHone, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
              "The simulations were run on the Pleiades supercomputer operated by the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division at Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, California.",

              "\"Hydrodynamic simulations of merging clusters allow us to produce features in the hot gas and tune physical parameters, such as the magnetic field.",
              "Then we can attempt to match the detailed characteristics of the structures we observe in X-rays.\"",
              "One simulation seemed to explain the formation of the bay.",
              "In it, gas in a large cluster similar to Perseus has settled into two components, a \"cold\" central region with temperatures around 54 million degrees Fahrenheit (30 million Celsius) and a surrounding zone where the gas is three times hotter.",
              "Then a small galaxy cluster containing about a thousand times the mass of the Milky Way skirts the larger cluster, missing its center by around 650,000 light-years.",
              "The flyby creates a gravitational disturbance that churns up the gas like cream stirred into coffee, creating an expanding spiral of cold gas.",
              "After about 2.",
              "5 billion years, when the gas has risen nearly 500,000 light-years from the center, vast waves form and roll at its periphery for hundreds of millions of years before dissipating.",
              "These waves are giant versions of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, which show up wherever there's a velocity difference across the interface of two fluids, such as wind blowing over water.",
              "They can be found in the ocean, in cloud formations on Earth and other planets, in plasma near Earth, and even on the sun.",
              "\"We think the bay feature we see in Perseus is part of a Kelvin-Helmholtz wave, perhaps the largest one yet identified, that formed in much the same way as the simulation shows,\" Walker said.",
              "\"We have also identified similar features in two other galaxy clusters, Centaurus and Abell 1795.\"",
              "The researchers also found that the size of the waves corresponds to the strength of the cluster's magnetic field.",

              "UCF is Part of Team That Finds Water on Ultra-hot Exoplanet with James ...",
              "The temperature is so hot that it would tear most water molecules apart, and the researchers say detecting the remaining water that survived speaks to the extraordinary sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope.",
              "By Robert Wells | May 31, 2023 A University of Central Florida researcher and multiple alumni are part of a team that has used NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to identify water vapor in the atmosphere of an ultra-hot gas giant exoplanet and make a thermal map of its atmosphere.",
              "Using JWST\u2019s Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph, the team found multiple small, but precisely measured, water features present in the atmospheric spectrum of exoplanet WASP-18b, despite its extreme temperatures of almost 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.",
              "The results were published today in the journal Nature.",
              "The temperature is so hot that it would tear most water molecules apart, and the researchers say detecting the remaining water that survived speaks to the extraordinary sensitivity of JWST.",
              "Learning more about the atmospheric properties of WASP-18b, including detecting water, advances the understanding of physics in extreme environments and provides valuable data about water\u2019s abundance and distribution in different planetary atmospheres.",
              "The findings also advance observational techniques and instrumentation, which can have broader applications across the field of astronomy.",
              "Alien Weather In addition to detecting water, the researchers also created a temperature map of the planet.",
              "This was an exciting development more than 10 years in the making, says study co-author Joseph Harrington, a Pegasus Professor in UCF\u2019s Department of Physics and Florida Space Institute.",
              "\u201cWhen my team at UCF made the first measurements of WASP-18b\u2019s dayside by observing its secondary eclipses with NASA\u2019s infrared Spitzer Space Telescope, we had the barest of signals to work with,\u201d Harrington says.",
              "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t make a map, but our analysis said that the planet was very hot and that it radiated most of the heat it received from its star right back out into the universe, without the winds blowing that heat to the night side.",
              "\u201d Secondary eclipses occur when a planet slips behind its star and reappears on the other side.",
              "Harrington says their finding meant there had to be at least one hot spot on the dayside that was much warmer than the rest of the planet.",
              "\u201cThat\u2019s really different from all the planets in our solar system, which have winds blowing the Sun\u2019s heat all around the planet,\u201d he says.",
              "Those findings were published in a 2011 study led by UCF alumna Sarah Nymeyer \u201910 that included current study co-authors Harrington and his students at the time, Kevin Stevenson \u201912PhD, Jasmina Blecic \u201915PhD, and Patricio Cubillos \u201915PhD.",
              "The new temperature map was made by study co-author Ryan Challener \u201920PhD, another one of Harrington\u2019s students.",
              "\u201cRyan\u2019s map shows a single, very hot central region facing the star, with a much-cooler surrounding region, confirming what we found in much cruder data,\u201d Harrington says.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s like figuring out that there could possibly be such a thing as ice cream, and then, 12 years later and after a lot of work, actually tasting it for the first time.",
              "\u201d This achievement was made possible with the power of JWST, which is Spitzer\u2019s successor, as it has almost 50 times Spitzer\u2019s ability to collect light and much better instruments.",
              "\u201cIt has solidly confirmed our finding and moved science to the next level, where we can actually use the data to guide computer models that study this alien weather pattern,\u201d Harrington says.",
              "Strange Planet WASP-18b is an ultra-hot gas giant 10 times more massive than Jupiter and located 400 light years away.",
              "It was discovered in 2009, and scientists have continued studying it ever since, due to its unique characteristics, including its size and its close proximity to its host star, named WASP-18.",
              "Its orbit is so close to WASP-18 that its atmosphere reaches incredibly high temperatures and makes WASP-18b one of the hottest known exoplanets.",
              "The researchers found from their observations that WASP-18b\u2019s composition is very similar to that of its star, meaning it most likely formed from the leftover gas that was present just after the star was born, says the study\u2019s lead author, Louis-Philippe Coulombe, a graduate student at the University of Montreal.",
              "\u2018\u2018Those results are very valuable to get a clear picture of how strange planets like WASP-18b, which have no counterpart in our solar system, come to exist,\u2019\u2019 Coulombe says.",
              "How the Research Was Performed The scientists made their observations for about six hours that included the planet\u2019s secondary eclipse.",
              "They measured the combined light from star and planet before and after the eclipse, then subtracted the measurements from just the star as the planet went into eclipse behind it to get a spectrum of the planet alone.",
              "This planetary spectrum showed an atmosphere with temperatures varying by hundreds of degrees between its layers and increasing with elevation.",
              "The temperature, or brightness, map they created shows a huge change in temperature \u2014 up to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 from the hottest point facing the star to the terminator, where day and night sides of the tidally locked planet meet in permanent twilight.",
              "This is the first time that a planet has been mapped with JWST.",
              "The team mapped temperature gradients across the dayside of the planet, and given how much cooler the planet is at the terminator, there is likely something hindering winds from efficiently redistributing heat to the night side, the researchers say.",
              "But they say what is hindering the winds is still a mystery.",
              "\u2018\u2018The brightness map of WASP-18b shows a lack of east-west winds that is best matched by models with atmospheric drag,\u201d says Challener, now with the University of Michigan.",
              "\u201cOne possible explanation is that this planet has a strong magnetic field, which would be an exciting discovery.",
              "\u2019\u2019 The researchers say that possibly magnetic effects force the winds to blow from the planet\u2019s equator up over the North Pole and down over the South Pole, instead of east-west, as they would otherwise expect.",
              "About the Team More than 100 scientists around the globe are working on early science from JWST through the Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program led by Natalie Batalha, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who helped coordinate the new research.",
              "Much of this groundbreaking work is being done by early-career scientists.",

              "12 October 2006 New Hubble images have provided a dramatic glimpse of a large massive galaxy under assembly as smaller galaxies merge.",
              "This has commonly been thought to be the way galaxies grew in the young Universe, but now Hubble observations of the radio galaxy MRC 1138-262, nicknamed the \"Spiderweb Galaxy\", have shown dozens of star-forming satellite galaxies in the actual process of merging.",
              "In nature spiders earn our respect by constructing fascinating, well-organised webs in all shapes and sizes.",
              "But the beauty masks a cruel, fatal trap.",
              "Analogously, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has found a large galaxy 10.",
              "6 billion light-years away from Earth (at a redshift of 2.",
              "2) that is stuffing itself with smaller galaxies caught like flies in a web of gravity.",
              "The galaxy is so far away that astronomers are seeing it as it looked in the early formative years of the Universe, only 2 billion years after the Big Bang.",
              "The Hubble image shows the Spiderweb Galaxy sitting at the centre of an emergent galaxy cluster, surrounded by hundreds of other galaxies from the cluster.",
              "Team leader George Miley from Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands explains: \"The new Hubble image is the best demonstration so far that large massive galaxies are built up by merging smaller ones.\"",
              "The image reaches much deeper than previous ones and shows the merging process in unprecedented detail.",
              "Galaxies can be seen as they are sucked into the Spiderweb at speeds of several hundred kilometres per second, from distances of more than a hundred thousand light-years around it.",
              "Radio telescopes have shown that jets of fast particles are being spewed out from the centre of the Spiderweb Galaxy with enormous energies.",
              "These jets are believed to be produced by a massive black hole buried deep in the nucleus of the system.",
              "The infalling galaxy \"flies\" are a source of food for this black hole \"spider\", allowing it to continue disgorging the jets.",
              "The new Hubble image provides a unique real-world example for testing theoretical models of massive galaxy formation.",
              "The complexity and clumpiness of the Spiderweb agrees qualitatively with the predictions of such models, but a surprising feature of the Spiderweb Galaxy is the presence of several faint small linear galaxies within the merging structure.",
              "The Spiderweb Galaxy is located in the southern constellation of Hydra (the water snake) and is one of the most massive galaxies known.",
              "This result was published 10th October 2006 in Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
              "The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between ESA and NASA.",
