After the Yardbirds disbanded in 1968, Page recruited singer Robert Plant, bassist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham to form a new group[^3^]. The name \"Led Zeppelin\" came from a joke by Keith Moon, the drummer for The Who, who said that the new band would go down like a \"lead balloon\" or a \"lead zeppelin\"[^3^] [^2^] [^5^].

              "[3] Several popular singles with Beck followed, including a second American album, Having a Rave Up with the Yardbirds (1965), that, as with their previous album, was a split release featuring songs with both Clapton and Beck.",
              "[4] In 1966, the Yardbirds recorded their first studio album of all original material.",
              "[5] Released in the UK as Yardbirds and in the US as Over Under Sideways Down, the album acquired the nickname \"Roger the Engineer\" after a caption on the English cover drawn by rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja.",
              "[6] Shortly after its release, bassist Paul Samwell-Smith left the group and was replaced by Page.",
              "[5] Page soon switched to second lead guitar, with Dreja taking over on bass.",
              "[5] This lineup only produced two songs \u2013 the psychedelic \"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\" (1966), which was the group's last song to reach the charts in the UK, and \"Stroll On\", the proto-heavy metal remake of \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\" they performed for the film Blowup (1966).",
