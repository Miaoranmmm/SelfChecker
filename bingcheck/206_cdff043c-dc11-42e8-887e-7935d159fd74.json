    "query": "What is the most effective and efficient method for desalinating seawater, and how has this technology developed over time to become a viable solution for addressing freshwater scarcity in coastal regions around the world?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. According to the information I found on the web, the most effective and efficient method for desalinating seawater is **reverse osmosis**, which uses a semi-permeable membrane to separate water from dissolved salt[^1^] [^2^]. Reverse osmosis requires less energy than thermal processes that involve heating and evaporating water[^1^]. However, reverse osmosis still faces some challenges such as membrane fouling, brine disposal, and high capital and operational costs[^2^].\n\nDesalination technology has a long history that dates back to ancient times, when people used evaporation and distillation methods to obtain fresh water from seawater[^7^] [^8^]. The first patent for a desalination process was granted in England in 1869, and the first large-scale desalination plant was built in Aruba in 1930[^6^]. The development of desalination technology was accelerated by the need for fresh water during World War II and the subsequent support from the U.S. government[^5^]. The first seawater desalination demonstration plant in the United States was built in Freeport, Texas in 1961[^5^]. Since then, desalination technology has undergone many improvements and innovations, such as the introduction of membranes, nanomaterials, renewable energy sources, and hybrid systems[^9^].\n\nDesalination technology has become a viable solution for addressing freshwater scarcity in coastal regions around the world, especially in arid and semi-arid areas where conventional sources of water are limited or unreliable. Desalination can provide high-quality water for drinking, irrigation, industrial applications, and environmental restoration. However, desalination also poses some environmental and social challenges, such as the impact of brine discharge on marine ecosystems, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with fossil fuel consumption, the potential conflicts over water rights and access, and the affordability and equity of water supply[^9^]. Therefore, desalination technology needs to be carefully evaluated and implemented in a sustainable and integrated manner that considers the local context and the alternative options available.",

              "It involves a broad range of technologies that yield access to marginal sources of water such as seawater, brackish ground- and surface water, and wastewater.",
              "Given the reduction in access to fresh water in recent decades and the uncertainty in availability effected by climate change, desalination is critical for ensuring the future of humanity.",
              "This paper describes advances toward more sustainable desalination and exciting directions that could make this technology more accessible, energy efficient, and versatile.",
              "It reviews the emergence of membranes as the preferred technology for desalination, recent advances, challenges to its sustainable implementation, and needs for further research.",
              "Introduction Desalination represents a promise of near unlimited water supply and is an attractive potential solution to the age-old conundrum of seawater abundance and practical inaccessibility for potable use.",
              "It now encompasses the removal of both salts and dissolved contaminants from various sources such as seawater, brackish surface and groundwater, and industrial and municipal wastewaters.",
              "The primary descriptor of importance for desalination processes is the amount of dissolved solids (primarily inorganic salts) represented by the total dissolved solids (TDS;",
              "the solids left over after water is evaporated from particle-free water).",
              "Table 1 lists the typical range of TDS levels in waters subjected to desalination-based water treatment processes (Australian NWC 2008).",
              "Table 1 In addition to being a measure of usability (such as for consumption), TDS levels determine the bounds for the minimum energy needed to remove these solutes from water (or to move water away from these solutes).",
              "Just as energy is released when a solute is dissolved in a compatible solvent, energy is needed to separate the solute from the solvent and is dependent on the concentration of the solute.",
              "Table 1 shows that higher-salinity water (such as seawater) requires larger amounts of energy for desalination, whereas water from low-salinity streams (such as those from wastewater reuse) could be much lower.",
              "The growing pressure on limited freshwater sources has focused the world\u2019s attention on seawater and the recovery of water from marginal sources such as brackish ground- and surface water as well as recycled wastewater.",
              "It has also raised awareness and catalyzed the implementation of wastewater reuse, where wastewater is treated to a high quality and in some cases used for direct or indirect potable reuse.",
              "Desalination is thus a critical technology for humanity to allow for sustainable development.",
              "Background and History Desalination has a long history in both mythology and practice.",
              "An early and illustrative reference appears in the Bible (Exodus 15:22\u201326) and is widely considered to be about desalination.",
              "When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter;",
              "therefore it was named Marah.",
              "And the people grumbled against Moses, saying, \u201cWhat shall we drink?",
              "\u201d And he cried to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a log, and he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet.",
              "Distillation-Based Technologies Early scientific descriptions of desalination centered around the application of distillation.",
              "In his Meteorologica, Aristotle wrote that \u201cSalt water when it turns into vapour becomes sweet and the vapour does not form salt water again when it condenses\u201d (Forbes 1948, p.",
              "383).",
              "This is the definition of distillation, a process used to create fresh water from seawater at larger scales starting in the 1930s (NRC 2008).",
              "Distillation-based technologies remained a major approach to water desalination until the development of membranes.",
              "The most common distillation-based desalination methods are thermally driven technologies, including multistage flash distillation, multiple-effect distillation, and mechanical vapor compression processes.",
              "In these processes water is evaporated by the addition of heat and in many cases assisted by the use of vacuum.",
              "The evaporated water is then condensed to recover desalinated water.",
              "Several large plants, primarily in the Middle East, have used thermal distillation since the 1930s (NRC 2008).",
              "Figure 1 But thermal desalination has very high energy consumption and is increasingly being replaced by the use of membranes, specifically reverse osmosis (RO) membranes.",
              "Figure 1 shows the energy consumption per unit volume of water for several commonly used water desalination techniques (Al-Karaghouli and Kazmerski 2013).",
              "As is evident from this figure, RO is a substantially more energy efficient technology for water desalination.",
              "Emergence of Membrane Technology Membrane technologies arose as a result of a breakthrough in the use of polymer films for separating salt from water in the late 1950s/early 1960s.",
              "A brief history of the development of RO membranes is shown in figure 2, based on Baker (2004).",
              "Figure 2 Reid and Breton (1959) first demonstrated the possibility of desalination using polymeric cellulose films and thus the first polymeric RO membranes were created.",
              "Loeb and Sourirajan (1963) then showed that an asymmetric cellulose acetate membrane can be used for desalination.",
              "The permeabilities of these early membranes were low and RO membranes were considered a novelty separation technique rather than a solution to desalination.",
              "An innovation in the packaging of large membrane areas into small volumes was the development of the spiral wound module (figure 3) by General Atomics in 1963.",
              "The spiral wound configuration is now common in RO applications (Cadotte 1981;",
              "Westmoreland 1968).",
              "In this module, \u201cleaves\u201d of membranes, with feed and permeate spacers, are connected to a perforated permeate tube and rolled up in a \u201cjelly roll\u201d configuration.",
              "Hollow-fiber modules containing thin fibers were developed a few years later by DuPont, but this configuration is less commonly used for RO.",
              "Figure 3 A major advance in membrane chemistry that has made possible the application of RO membranes is the development of the thin film composite (TFC) architecture.",
              "Previously, membranes were either several-micron-thick polymer layers with a uniform architecture or similar-size polymer layers with an \u201casymmetric\u201d structure with a nonporous salt-rejecting top surface opening up to a more porous support.",
              "Cadotte (1981) patented the design for the three-layer TFC membrane that is now the industry standard.",
              "It provides high permeability while maintaining selectivity for water (vs. salt or other solutes).",

              "[28] Many studies focus on ways to optimize desalination systems.[29][30] The first commercial reverse osmosis desalination plant, Coalinga desalination plant, was inaugurated in California in 1965 for brackish water.",
              "A few years later, in 1975, the first sea water reverse osmosis desalination plant came into operation.",

              "More generally, desalination refers to the removal of salts and minerals from a target substance,[1] as in soil desalination, which is an issue for agriculture.",
              "Saltwater (especially sea water) is desalinated to produce water suitable for human consumption or irrigation.",
              "The by-product of the desalination process is brine.",
              "[2] Desalination is used on many seagoing ships and submarines.",
              "Most of the modern interest in desalination is focused on cost-effective provision of fresh water for human use.",
              "Along with recycled wastewater, it is one of the few rainfall-independent water resources.",
              "[3] Due to its energy consumption, desalinating sea water is generally more costly than fresh water from surface water or groundwater, water recycling and water conservation.",
              "However, these alternatives are not always available and depletion of reserves is a critical problem worldwide.",
              "[4][5] Desalination processes are using either thermal methods (in the case of distillation) or membrane-based methods (e.",

              "[6][7]: 24 An estimate in 2018 found that \"18,426 desalination plants are in operation in over 150 countries.",
              "They produce 87 million cubic meters of clean water each day and supply over 300 million people.\"",
              "[7]: 24 The energy intensity has improved: It is now about 3 kWh/m3 (in 2018), down by a factor of 10 from 20-30 kWh/m3 in 1970.",
              "[7]: 24 Nevertheless, desalination represented about 25% of the energy consumed by the water sector in 2016.",
              "[7]: 24 Desalination has been known to history for millennia as both a concept, and later practice, though in a limited form.",
              "The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle observed in his work Meteorology that \"salt water, when it turns into vapour, becomes sweet and the vapour does not form salt water again when it condenses,\" and also noticed that a fine wax vessel would hold potable water after being submerged long enough in seawater, having acted as a membrane to filter the salt.",
              "[8] There are numerous other examples of experimentation in desalination throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages,[9] but desalination was never feasible on a large scale until the modern era.",
              "[10] A good example of this experimentation are the observations by Leonardo da Vinci (Florence, 1452), who realized that distilled water could be made cheaply in large quantities by adapting a still to a cookstove.",
              "[11] During the Middle Ages elsewhere in Central Europe, work continued on refinements in distillation, although not necessarily directed towards desalination.",
              "[12] However, it is possible that the first major land-based desalination plant may have been installed under emergency conditions on an island off the coast of Tunisia in 1560.",
              "[12][13] It is believed that a garrison of 700 Spanish soldiers was besieged by a large number of Turks and that, during the siege, the captain in charge fabricated a still capable of producing 40 barrels of fresh water per day, though details of the device have not been reported.",
              "[13] Before the Industrial Revolution, desalination was primarily of concern to oceangoing ships, which otherwise needed to keep on board supplies of fresh water.",
              "Sir Richard Hawkins (1562-1622), who made extensive travels in the South Seas, reported in his return that he had been able to supply his men with fresh water by means of shipboard distillation.",
              "[14] Additionally, during the early 1600s, several prominent figures of the era such as Francis Bacon or Walter Raleigh published reports on water desalination.",
              "[13][15] These reports and others,[16] set the climate for the first patent dispute concerning desalination apparatus.",

              "[20][21] Beginning about 1800, things started changing very rapidly as consequence of the appearance of the steam engine and the so-called age of steam.",
              "[12] The development of a knowledge of the thermodynamics of steam processes [22] and the need for a pure water source for its use in boilers,[23] generated a positive effect regarding distilling systems. Additionally, the spread of European colonialism induced a need for freshwater in remote parts of the world, thus creating the appropriate climate for water desalination.",
              "[12] In parallel with the development and improvement of systems using steam (multiple-effect evaporators), this type of devices quickly demonstrated their potential in the field of desalination.",
              "[12] In 1852, Alphonse Rene\u0301 le Mire de Normandy, was issued a British patent for a vertical tube seawater distilling unit which thanks to its simplicity of design and ease of construction, very quickly gained popularity for shipboard use.",
              "[12][24] Land-based desalting units did not significantly appear until the later half of the nineteenth century.",
              "[24] In the 1860s, the US Army purchased three Normandy evaporators, each rated at 7000 gallons/day and installed them on the islands of Key West and Dry Tortugas.",
              "[12][24][25] Another important land-based desalter plant was installed at Suakin during the 1880s which was able to provide freshwater to the British troops placed there.",

              "[31] Desalination is currently expensive compared to most alternative sources of water, and only a very small fraction of total human use is satisfied by desalination.",
              "[32] It is usually only economically practical for high-valued uses (such as household and industrial uses) in arid areas.",
              "However, there is growth in desalination for agricultural use and highly populated areas such as Singapore[33] or California.",
              "[34][35] The most extensive use is in the Persian Gulf.",
              "[36] While noting costs are falling, and generally positive about the technology for affluent areas in proximity to oceans, a 2005 study argued, \"Desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions, but not for places that are poor, deep in the interior of a continent, or at high elevation.",

              "Debbie Cook wrote in 2011 that desalination plants can be energy intensive and costly.",
              "Therefore, water-stressed regions might do better to focus on conservation or other water supply solutions than invest in desalination plants.",

              "Solar distillation mimics the natural water cycle, in which the sun heats sea water enough for evaporation to occur.",
              "[44] After evaporation, the water vapor is condensed onto a cool surface.",
              "[44] There are two types of solar desalination.",
              "The first type uses photovoltaic cells to convert solar energy to electrical energy to power desalination.",

              "Liquids boil when the vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure and vapor pressure increases with temperature.",
              "Effectively, liquids boil at a lower temperature, when the ambient atmospheric pressure is less than usual atmospheric pressure.",
              "Thus, because of the reduced pressure, low-temperature \"waste\" heat from electrical power generation or industrial processes can be employed.",
              "Water is evaporated and separated from sea water through multi-stage flash distillation, which is a series of flash evaporations.",

              "Furthermore, the report notes that desalinated water produced generated around 103 million cubic meters of toxic, high-salinity brine effluent that impacted the Mediterranean seagrass ecosystem in the region of the discharge pipes.",
              "In a reportco-authored by Manzoor Qadir on the state of desalination and brine production globally, it was shown that increased salinity, combined with climate-driven temperature rise, can cause a decrease in the dissolved oxygen content, resulting in conditions called hypoxia.",
              "This hypersaline water can sink to the ocean bed and kill marine microorganisms that are vital to the entire food chain.",

              "Recovery of these resources remains economically uncompetitive, however, Qadir believes.",
              "This needs to change as reuse is an important sustainability solution, he added, especially \"in countries producing large volumes of brine with relatively low efficiencies, such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar.\"",
              "Scientists at the US research body, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), have suggested ways to repurpose brine by using the salt to produce caustic soda, or sodium hydroxide.",

              "The researchers note that such fouling is a typical source of breakdowns and adds to the energy inefficiency and overall cost.",
              "Although such brine reuse is still in the early developmental stage, Qadir notes that newer, more modern plants in the US that utilize the latest reverse osmosis technology already produce less brine.",

              "Some of the most cited factors in no particular order are demographic factors (e.",
              "g., age, gender, education, occupation), level of trust in authorities and decision-makers, and cultural and religious concerns (Etale et al.",
              "2020).",
              "That said, it should be noted that there are no universal recipes when it comes to convincing the public about alternative, unconventional water resources, and this is, more than anything, a case-by-case situation.",
              "Understanding the full scope of this concept within the context of the irrigation and agriculture sector, however, is more complicated.",
              "A good showcase of this would be a survey that was conducted among irrigators in the southeastern part of Spain (Ricart et al.",
              "2020), in which farmers in different communities were asked to rank their perceptions about the quality of desalinated water.",
              "Among the surveyed groups, only two gave this resource unfavorable scores.",
              "Interestingly, these are two neighboring communities, one of which did not even use desalinated water for irrigation when this survey was conducted.",

              "(2020), the water used by the neighboring community had contained some elements (i.",

              "\u201d The communication of this gave the second community a bad and arguably unrealistic impression about the quality of desalinated water.",
              "This incident showcases how perception can influence the acceptability of this practice in real-world situations.",
              "When it comes to understanding the role of perception in the implementation of desalinated water for irrigation, one of the crucial things that induces further complications to an already complex problem is the vast and diverse number of players involved.",
              "The primary stakeholders and funders of desalination projects represent another aspect that can introduce complexity into the equation.",
              "Historically, public sector and governmental agencies have been the primary backers of desalination units (March 2015).",
              "However, in recent times, many projects have been emerging under the purview of private entities or public\u2013private consortiums (Greer et al.",
              "2021).",
              "This shift in sponsorship brings forth distinct perspectives and priorities, potentially adding intricacy to the governance and regulation of such units.",
              "Consequently, it becomes more challenging to ascertain and dissect the perceptions of stakeholders regarding desalination in a broader sense (Campero and Harris 2019).",
              "As for the main stakeholders\u2019 viewpoints, in the case of urban uses, for instance, it could be argued that the public consumers would clearly dominate the role of perceptions.",
              "In agriculture, however, in addition to the direct consumer, the farmers and irrigators, the perception of the public, as the leading consumer of the agricultural products, is expected to play an important role.",
              "In addition to this, governing bodies, health and environmental agencies, regulators, and private investors are also, each to a certain degree, involved in the decision-making process.",
              "While in some of these cases, the objective assessment and scientific findings may eventually be the decisive factors, one cannot underestimate how the public\u2019s perception, as shown in previous cases (e.",
              "g., Ricart et al.",
              "2020), can ultimately be a contributing factor.",
              "With these in mind, we can finally look at the limited number of papers that exclusively addressed this notion within the context of using desalinated water for irrigation (e.",

              "The idea here is that while there may be a general pattern behind the public\u2019s perceptions, based on the findings of similar studies reviewed earlier in this section, it is safe to assume that different regions may react differently to this practice.",
              "In other words, while we expect to see recurring factors when studying the gist of the public\u2019s perceptions toward irrigation with desalinated water, odds are there would be notable variations based on the unique circumstances of each given case.",
              "A comprehensive apprehension of such behaviors would depend on unveiling these very local-dependent contributing factors.",
              "When it comes to farmers\u2019 perceptions of the practice of using desalinated water for irrigation purposes, certain factors seem to be recurring in most case studies.",
              "These fundamental factors, in no particular order, are found to be the economic aspect of the operation and, more specifically, the cost of desalinated water, the quality and quantity of desalinated water, environmental concerns, an insurance mechanism to meet the contracts between the decision-makers and irrigator community to guarantee the availability of desalinated water under the promised circumstances, the quality of the agricultural products and soil, lack of any storage system for storing the excess desalinated water, and finally, contracts that are based on the take-or-pay paradigm (Aznar-Sa\u0301nchez et al.",

              "Of course, how relevant these factors would be for a given region must be determined on a case-by-case basis.",
              "As for the studies that focused on this research topic, three out of four papers mentioned earlier focused on Spain.",
              "The findings of these studies suggest that, overall, the farmers in this region generally have a somewhat negative perspective on the idea of using desalinated water for irrigation purposes (Aznar-Sa\u0301nchez et al.",
              "2017).",
              "This is to the point that in some cases, even if the exact same price applies to different water resources, the farmers tend not to opt for desalinated water in any way, shape, or form (Aznar-Sa\u0301nchez et al.",
              "2017).",
              "However, recent studies in the region have demonstrated that this negative perception is seemingly improving over time (Villar-Navascue\u0301s et al.",
              "2020).",
              "In contrast to results obtained in Spain, farmers are reportedly keener about the application and the future of this practice in Israel.",
              "Based on research conducted in 2017, about half of the surveyed farmers were planning to switch to desalinated water in the next few years (Ghermandi and Minich 2017).",
              "The general conclusion of that study was that farming communities in Israel are open to the idea of using desalinated water as a reliable source for irrigation.",
              "That result, in and of itself, shows that there are crucial factors that need to be studied case-by-case.",
              "And, more than anything, it demonstrates the massive and tangible gap in knowledge that exists when it comes to understanding the irrigators\u2019 perceptions toward desalinated water use in general.",
              "That said, while two ostensibly contradictory opinions are reported above, a more general pattern would unveil itself if these perceptions were to be analyzed using a more holistic perspective that accounts for the water resources situation in these regions.",
              "Seemingly, the more water-stressed a region, such as the case in Israel, when the farmer community has not many alternative water resources at their disposal, the more favorable the views toward desalinated water use.",
              "In contrast, in a place such as Spain, where desalinated water is still viewed as a complimentary resource by farmers for use only when they cannot meet their demand through conventional water resources, these perceptions are not as favorable.",
              "What is important to note here is that such perceptions can potentially adjust to match the current water situation in a given region.",
              "Take the case of Spain\u2019s 2005 drought, where the request for this type of resource, perhaps out of necessity, increased drastically (Marti\u0301nez-Alvarez et al.",
              "2019).",
              "A similar situation occurred during the Australian millennium drought between 2003 and 2012 (Heihsel et al.",
              "2019).",
              "As such, it could be argued that, often, the imminent threat of drought, or water scarcity to be more general, can be enticing enough to convey the use of this unconventional resource from the farmers\u2019 perspective.",
              "Although the earliest application of commercial desalination dates back to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it was not until the 1960s that this practice eventually evolved into a viable solution to combat water shortages in semi-arid and arid regions.",
              "While this practice has experienced exponential growth in recent years in water-scarce regions, there are still some unexplored angles regarding the potential impacts of desalination.",
              "For the most part, this is because it would take years for such effects, including environmental repercussions, to be detected with a scientific degree of certainty.",
              "As the desalination sector is anticipated to continue expanding globally, in accordance with the sustainable development principle, it is necessary to understand and, in turn, minimize these adverse effects.",
              "In fact, it could be argued that these would define the evolution of this industry in the foreseeable future.",
              "On that note, an excellent universal policy would be that desalination projects need to demonstrate sustainability on economic, environmental, and social grounds and demonstrate that the technologies and designs employed maximize sustainability for the particular local context of the project.",
              "Consequently, this review intends to take a more holistic approach to assess the general practice of desalination through the aforementioned lenses.",
              "The results of this review show that from a practical point of view, environmental and socioeconomic concerns are some of the pressing issues concerning desalinated water.",
              "For the most part, the socioeconomic concerns with regard to desalination are centered around the overall cost of desalinated water, which, in turn, is rooted largely in the energy consumption of desalination units.",
              "As an energy-intensive technology, energy markets can profoundly impact how cost-effective this practice can be.",
              "However, the core technology behind desalination has improved immensely from where it started, to the point that state-of-the-art RO units are far more proficient in energy consumption than they used to be.",
              "RO units seem to have established their place as the standard practice in the market.",
              "Current global trends show how they are and most likely continue to dominate the desalination industry for the foreseeable future.",
              "In fact, even the Middle Eastern nations that long relied on previous-generation thermal technologies are gradually moving toward RO-based units.",
              "Switching from conventional fossil fuels to renewable resources could be another groundbreaking strategy to make these technologies more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.",
              "As for the remaining issues concerning the environmental-related impacts, the findings of this review suggest that the expected effects can drastically vary from one case to another.",
              "This, more than anything, highlights the necessity of conducting region-based studies to unveil such impacts on a local level.",
              "That said, the gathered data suggests that all the said issues can be mitigated, often substantially.",
              "In some cases, well-thought planning and management measures provide a tailor-fitted solution to optimizing the efficiency of the desalination units.",
              "In other cases, a more hands-on measure, such as establishing pre- and post-treatments, could minimize the adverse effects of desalination.",
              "On the other, there are some notable advantages to incorporating desalinated water in the grand scheme of water resources planning and management.",
              "First and foremost is the augmentation of a versatile and reliable resource that can, by nature, circumvent hydro-climatic oscillations.",
              "If executed correctly, this would facilitate an effective, sustainable water resources planning and management scheme.",
              "Doing so, however, requires addressing the fundamental question of how desalination, in general, should be utilized in the context of other available water resources.",
              "The point is that desalinated water can be seen as an augmentation source that comes into play mostly during peak demands.",
              "This is to say that along with other water management schemes, most notably demand management, introducing desalinated water in the proper context can help target sustainable development goals.",
              "On the other hand, desalinated water can also be treated as a means to meet the baseline demands, providing a unique socioeconomic opportunity.",
              "However, opting for the latter option requires careful planning and management.",
              "What ensures sustainability, in short, is how this technology can endure its cost-effective performance with minimum to no environmental degradation in the long run.",
              "This is, in turn, reflected in how effectively and quickly decision-makers can address the pressing issues.",
              "This becomes quite crucial, yet more challenging, as more sectors, including and perhaps most notably the agriculture industry, are gradually leaning toward desalinated water.",
              "Finally, one cannot assess the sustainability of desalination without exploring its formidability from the public perspective.",
              "Our systematic review of this subject revealed that this specific topic has received little to no attention.",
              "That said, the limited available studies point out the presence of a potential negative stigma both for urban and irrigation use of desalination water, though the extent and reasons for these vary vastly from one case to another.",
              "That said, these studies also highlight that the public can be persuaded on this matter should the right and tailored mechanism are to be utilized in a timely and proper manner.",
              "What is also important to note here is that one can see that, at least in the context of irrigation demands, perceptions can potentially adjust to match the current water situation in a given region.",

          "The most widespread process for desalination is called reverse osmosis, which works by flowing seawater over a membrane at high pressure to remove the minerals.",
          "Now, Purdue University engineers have developed a variant of the process called \u201cbatch reverse osmosis,\u201d which promises better energy efficiency, longer-lasting equipment and the ability to process water of much higher salinity.",

          "in arid places like the Middle East, more than half of the fresh drinking water supplies come from desalination facilities.",
          "\u201cInstead of fully emptying the piston each time or using some other liquid or gas to pressurize the piston, we\u2019re filling it with the next batch of seawater,\u201d Warsinger said.",
            "\u201cSo rather than one side of the piston being essentially dead space, we are using the seawater itself to get double-duty out of this piston, so there\u2019s almost no downtime.",

        "Reverse osmosis uses a semi-permeable membrane to separate water from dissolved salt.": [
          "Reverse osmosis works by using a high-pressure pump to increase the pressure on the salt side of the RO and force the water across the semipermeable RO membrane, leaving almost all (around 95 to 99 %) dissolved salts in the reject stream behind.",
          "Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water purification process that uses a semi-permeable membrane to separate water molecules from other substances.",

          "Thermal desalination involves heating seawater to its boiling point and condensing the salt-free steam for drinking water.",
          "Though there\u2019s a range of efficiency in both methods, thermal desalination requires roughly 10 times as much energy as reverse osmosis, says Emily Tow, a mechanical engineer at Olin College of Engineering who studies water desalination and reuse.",

        "Reverse osmosis still faces some challenges such as membrane fouling, brine disposal, and high capital and operational costs.": [
          "However, fouling and membrane degradation are some of the major challenges faced by the RO systems, which need to be carefully addressed.",
          "Biofouling increases the operating cost of water treatment by increasing RO system feed pressure (i.e., energy demand) and increasing membrane cleaning frequency, which increases downtime and reduces membrane useful life.",   
          "For waters with known high biofouling potential, plant designs also may require more extensive pretreatment, which increases capital and operating costs as well as the footprint of a desalination plant."

          "During the Middle Ages elsewhere in Central Europe, work continued on refinements in distillation, although not necessarily directed towards desalination.",
          "The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle observed in his work Meteorology that \"salt water, when it turns into vapour, becomes sweet and the vapour does not form salt water again when it condenses,\" and also noticed that a fine wax vessel would hold potable water after being submerged long enough in seawater, having acted as a membrane to filter the salt.",
          "There are numerous other examples of experimentation in desalination throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages,[9] but desalination was never feasible on a large scale until the modern era.",
