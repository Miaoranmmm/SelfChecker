    "query": "Can you explain how the human brain processes and stores memories, and what new research has been done to better understand this complex process?",
    "response": "The human brain is a complex organ that controls thought, memory, emotion and many other processes. Memory is the ongoing process of information retention over time[^4^]. According to cognitive science, memory operates according to a \"dual-process\" theory, where more unconscious, more routine thought processes (known as \"System 1\") interact with more conscious, more problem-based thought processes (known as \"System 2\")[^3^].\n\nThe brain has three types of memory processes: sensory register, short-term memory and long-term memory[^5^]. Sensory register is the process of obtaining information from the environment for a very short time. Short-term memory is the process of holding and manipulating information for a limited time. Long-term memory is the process of storing and retrieving information over a long period of time. Each of these processes involves encoding (getting information in), storage (holding on to it) and retrieval (getting it back out)[^6^].\n\nNew research has been done to better understand how these memory processes work and how they can be improved or impaired. For example, some studies have explored how emotions, attention, sleep, stress and aging affect memory formation and recall. Other studies have investigated how memory consolidation (the process of strengthening and stabilizing memories) occurs in the brain and what factors influence it. Some researchers have also tried to develop interventions or techniques to enhance memory performance or prevent memory loss in various conditions. Memory research is a fascinating and evolving field that can help us learn more about ourselves and our world.",

              "The brain stem begins where the spinal cord enters the skull and forms the medulla, the area of the brain stem that controls heart rate and breathing.",
              "In many cases the medulla alone is sufficient to maintain life\u2014animals that have the remainder of their brains above the medulla severed are still able to eat, breathe, and even move.",
              "The spherical shape above the medulla is the pons, a structure in the brain stem that helps control the movements of the body, playing a particularly important role in balance and walking.",
              "Running through the medulla and the pons is a long, narrow network of neurons known as the reticular formation.",
              "The job of the reticular formation is to filter out some of the stimuli that are coming into the brain from the spinal cord and to relay the remainder of the signals to other areas of the brain.",
              "The reticular formation also plays important roles in walking, eating, sexual activity, and sleeping.",
              "When electrical stimulation is applied to the reticular formation of an animal, it immediately becomes fully awake, and when the reticular formation is severed from the higher brain regions, the animal falls into a deep coma.",
              "Figure 3.",
              "8 The Brain Stem and the Thalamus The brain stem is an extension of the spinal cord, including the medulla, the pons, the thalamus, and the reticular formation.",

              "The thalamus is the egg-shaped structure above the brain stem that applies still more filtering to the sensory information that is coming up from the spinal cord and through the reticular formation, and it relays some of these remaining signals to the higher brain levels (Guillery & Sherman, 2002).",
              "The thalamus also receives some of the higher brain\u2019s replies, forwarding them to the medulla and the cerebellum.",
              "The thalamus is also important in sleep because it shuts off incoming signals from the senses, allowing us to rest.",
              "Figure 3.",
              "9 The Limbic System This diagram shows the major parts of the limbic system, as well as the pituitary gland, which is controlled by it.",
              "The cerebellum (literally, \u201clittle brain\u201d) consists of two wrinkled ovals behind the brain stem.",
              "It functions to coordinate voluntary movement.",
              "People who have damage to the cerebellum have difficulty walking, keeping their balance, and holding their hands steady.",
              "Consuming alcohol influences the cerebellum, which is why people who are drunk have more difficulty walking in a straight line.",
              "Also, the cerebellum contributes to emotional responses, helps us discriminate between different sounds and textures, and is important in learning (Bower & Parsons, 2003).",
              "Whereas the primary function of the brain stem is to regulate the most basic aspects of life, including motor functions, the limbic system is largely responsible for memory and emotions, including our responses to reward and punishment.",
              "The limbic system is a brain area, located between the brain stem and the two cerebral hemispheres, that governs emotion and memory.",
              "It includes the amygdala, the hypothalamus, and the hippocampus.",
              "The amygdala consists of two \u201calmond-shaped\u201d clusters (amygdala comes from the Latin word for \u201calmond\u201d) and is primarily responsible for regulating our perceptions of, and reactions to, aggression and fear.",
              "The amygdala has connections to other bodily systems related to fear, including the sympathetic nervous system (which we will see later is important in fear responses), facial responses (which perceive and express emotions), the processing of smells, and the release of neurotransmitters related to stress and aggression (Best, 2009).",
              "In one early study, Klu\u0308ver and Bucy (1939) damaged the amygdala of an aggressive rhesus monkey.",
              "They found that the once angry animal immediately became passive and no longer responded to fearful situations with aggressive behavior.",
              "Electrical stimulation of the amygdala in other animals also influences aggression.",
              "In addition to helping us experience fear, the amygdala also helps us learn from situations that create fear.",
              "When we experience events that are dangerous, the amygdala stimulates the brain to remember the details of the situation so that we learn to avoid it in the future (Sigurdsson, Doye\u0300re, Cain, & LeDoux, 2007).",
              "Located just under the thalamus (hence its name) the hypothalamus is a brain structure that contains a number of small areas that perform a variety of functions, including the important role of linking the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.",
              "Through its many interactions with other parts of the brain, the hypothalamus helps regulate body temperature, hunger, thirst, and sex, and responds to the satisfaction of these needs by creating feelings of pleasure.",
              "Olds and Milner (1954) discovered these reward centers accidentally after they had momentarily stimulated the hypothalamus of a rat.",
              "The researchers noticed that after being stimulated, the rat continued to move to the exact spot in its cage where the stimulation had occurred, as if it were trying to re-create the circumstances surrounding its original experience.",
              "Upon further research into these reward centers, Olds (1958) discovered that animals would do almost anything to re-create enjoyable stimulation, including crossing a painful electrified grid to receive it.",
              "In one experiment a rat was given the opportunity to electrically stimulate its own hypothalamus by pressing a pedal.",
              "The rat enjoyed the experience so much that it pressed the pedal more than 7,000 times per hour until it collapsed from sheer exhaustion.",
              "The hippocampus consists of two \u201chorns\u201d that curve back from the amygdala.",
              "The hippocampus is important in storing information in long-term memory.",
              "If the hippocampus is damaged, a person cannot build new memories, living instead in a strange world where everything he or she experiences just fades away, even while older memories from the time before the damage are untouched.",
              "All animals have adapted to their environments by developing abilities that help them survive.",
              "Some animals have hard shells, others run extremely fast, and some have acute hearing.",
              "Human beings do not have any of these particular characteristics, but we do have one big advantage over other animals\u2014we are very, very smart.",
              "You might think that we should be able to determine the intelligence of an animal by looking at the ratio of the animal\u2019s brain weight to the weight of its entire body.",
              "But this does not really work.",
              "The elephant\u2019s brain is one thousandth of its weight, but the whale\u2019s brain is only one ten-thousandth of its body weight.",
              "On the other hand, although the human brain is one 60th of its body weight, the mouse\u2019s brain represents one fortieth of its body weight.",
              "Despite these comparisons, elephants do not seem 10 times smarter than whales, and humans definitely seem smarter than mice.",
              "The key to the advanced intelligence of humans is not found in the size of our brains.",
              "What sets humans apart from other animals is our larger cerebral cortex\u2014the outer bark-like layer of our brain that allows us to so successfully use language, acquire complex skills, create tools, and live in social groups (Gibson, 2002).",
              "In humans, the cerebral cortex is wrinkled and folded, rather than smooth as it is in most other animals.",
              "This creates a much greater surface area and size, and allows increased capacities for learning, remembering, and thinking.",
              "The folding of the cerebral cortex is referred to as corticalization.",
              "Although the cortex is only about one tenth of an inch thick, it makes up more than 80% of the brain\u2019s weight.",
              "The cortex contains about 20 billion nerve cells and 300 trillion synaptic connections (de Courten-Myers, 1999).",
              "Supporting all these neurons are billions more glial cells (glia), cells that surround and link to the neurons, protecting them, providing them with nutrients, and absorbing unused neurotransmitters.",
              "The glia come in different forms and have different functions.",
              "For instance, the myelin sheath surrounding the axon of many neurons is a type of glial cell.",
              "The glia are essential partners of neurons, without which the neurons could not survive or function (Miller, 2005).",
              "The cerebral cortex is divided into two hemispheres, and each hemisphere is divided into four lobes, each separated by folds known as fissures.",
              "If we look at the cortex starting at the front of the brain and moving over the top (see Figure 3.",
              "10 \u201cThe Two Hemispheres\u201d), we see first the frontal lobe (behind the forehead), which is responsible primarily for thinking, planning, memory, and judgment.",
              "Following the frontal lobe is the parietal lobe, which extends from the middle to the back of the skull and which is responsible primarily for processing information about touch.",
              "Then comes the occipital lobe, at the very back of the skull, which processes visual information.",
              "Finally, in front of the occipital lobe (pretty much between the ears) is the temporal lobe, responsible primarily for hearing and language.",
              "Figure 3.",
              "10 The Two Hemispheres The brain is divided into two hemispheres (left and right), each of which has four lobes (temporal, frontal, occipital, and parietal).",
              "Furthermore, there are specific cortical areas that control different processes.",
              "When the German physicists Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig (1870/2009) applied mild electric stimulation to different parts of a dog\u2019s cortex, they discovered that they could make different parts of the dog\u2019s body move.",
              "Furthermore, they discovered an important and unexpected principle of brain activity.",
              "They found that stimulating the right side of the brain produced movement in the left side of the dog\u2019s body, and vice versa.",
              "This finding follows from a general principle about how the brain is structured, called contralateral control.",
              "The brain is wired such that in most cases the left hemisphere receives sensations from and controls the right side of the body, and vice versa.",
              "Fritsch and Hitzig also found that the movement that followed the brain stimulation only occurred when they stimulated a specific arch-shaped region that runs across the top of the brain from ear to ear, just at the front of the parietal lobe (see Figure 3.",
              "11 \u201cThe Sensory Cortex and the Motor Cortex\u201d).",
              "Fritsch and Hitzig had discovered the motor cortex, the part of the cortex that controls and executes movements of the body by sending signals to the cerebellum and the spinal cord.",
              "More recent research has mapped the motor cortex even more fully, by providing mild electronic stimulation to different areas of the motor cortex in fully conscious patients while observing their bodily responses (because the brain has no sensory receptors, these patients feel no pain).",
              "As you can see in Figure 3.",
              "11 \u201cThe Sensory Cortex and the Motor Cortex\u201d, this research has revealed that the motor cortex is specialized for providing control over the body, in the sense that the parts of the body that require more precise and finer movements, such as the face and the hands, also are allotted the greatest amount of cortical space.",
              "Figure 3.",
              "11 The Sensory Cortex and the Motor Cortex The portion of the sensory and motor cortex devoted to receiving messages that control specific regions of the body is determined by the amount of fine movement that area is capable of performing.",
              "Thus the hand and fingers have as much area in the cerebral cortex as does the entire trunk of the body.",
              "Just as the motor cortex sends out messages to the specific parts of the body, the somatosensory cortex, an area just behind and parallel to the motor cortex at the back of the frontal lobe, receives information from the skin\u2019s sensory receptors and the movements of different body parts.",
              "Again, the more sensitive the body region, the more area is dedicated to it in the sensory cortex.",
              "Our sensitive lips, for example, occupy a large area in the sensory cortex, as do our fingers and genitals.",
              "Other areas of the cortex process other types of sensory information.",
              "The visual cortex is the area located in the occipital lobe (at the very back of the brain) that processes visual information.",
              "If you were stimulated in the visual cortex, you would see flashes of light or color, and perhaps you remember having had the experience of \u201cseeing stars\u201d when you were hit in, or fell on, the back of your head.",
              "The temporal lobe, located on the lower side of each hemisphere, contains the auditory cortex, which is responsible for hearing and language.",
              "The temporal lobe also processes some visual information, providing us with the ability to name the objects around us (Martin, 2007).",
              "As you can see in Figure 3.",
              "11 \u201cThe Sensory Cortex and the Motor Cortex\u201d, the motor and sensory areas of the cortex account for a relatively small part of the total cortex.",
              "The remainder of the cortex is made up of association areas in which sensory and motor information is combined and associated with our stored knowledge.",
              "These association areas are the places in the brain that are responsible for most of the things that make human beings seem human.",
              "The association areas are involved in higher mental functions, such as learning, thinking, planning, judging, moral reflecting, figuring, and spatial reasoning.",
              "The control of some specific bodily functions, such as movement, vision, and hearing, is performed in specified areas of the cortex, and if these areas are damaged, the individual will likely lose the ability to perform the corresponding function.",
              "For instance, if an infant suffers damage to facial recognition areas in the temporal lobe, it is likely that he or she will never be able to recognize faces (Farah, Rabinowitz, Quinn, & Liu, 2000).",
              "On the other hand, the brain is not divided up in an entirely rigid way.",
              "The brain\u2019s neurons have a remarkable capacity to reorganize and extend themselves to carry out particular functions in response to the needs of the organism, and to repair damage.",
              "As a result, the brain constantly creates new neural communication routes and rewires existing ones.",
              "Neuroplasticity refers to the brain\u2019s ability to change its structure and function in response to experience or damage.",
              "Neuroplasticity enables us to learn and remember new things and adjust to new experiences.",
              "Our brains are the most \u201cplastic\u201d when we are young children, as it is during this time that we learn the most about our environment.",
              "On the other hand, neuroplasticity continues to be observed even in adults (Kolb & Fantie, 1989).",

              "Across cultures and ethnic groups, about 90% of people are mainly right-handed, whereas only 10% are primarily left-handed (Peters, Reimers, & Manning, 2006).",
              "This fact is puzzling, in part because the number of left-handers is so low, and in part because other animals, including our closest primate relatives, do not show any type of handedness.",
              "The existence of right-handers and left-handers provides an interesting example of the relationship among evolution, biology, and social factors and how the same phenomenon can be understood at different levels of analysis (Harris, 1990;",
              "McManus, 2002).",
              "At least some handedness is determined by genetics.",
              "Ultrasound scans show that 9 out of 10 fetuses suck the thumb of their right hand, suggesting that the preference is determined before birth (Hepper, Wells, & Lynch, 2005), and the mechanism of transmission has been linked to a gene on the X chromosome (Jones & Martin, 2000).",
              "It has also been observed that left-handed people are likely to have fewer children, and this may be in part because the mothers of left-handers are more prone to miscarriages and other prenatal problems (McKeever, Cerone, Suter, & Wu, 2000).",
              "But culture also plays a role.",
              "In the past, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hands in many countries, and this practice continues, particularly in collectivistic cultures, such as India and Japan, where left-handedness is viewed negatively as compared with individualistic societies, such as the United States.",

              "Automatic teller machines (ATMs), classroom desks, scissors, microscopes, drill presses, and table saws are just some examples of everyday machinery that is designed with the most important controls on the right side.",
              "This may explain in part why left-handers suffer somewhat more accidents than do right-handers (Dutta & Mandal, 2006).",
              "Despite the potential difficulty living and working in a world designed for right-handers, there seem to be some advantages to being left-handed.",
              "Throughout history, a number of prominent artists have been left-handed, including Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Pablo Picasso, and Max Escher.",
              "Because the right hemisphere is superior in imaging and visual abilities, there may be some advantage to using the left hand for drawing or painting (Springer & Deutsch, 1998).",
              "Left-handed people are also better at envisioning three-dimensional objects, which may explain why there is such a high number of left-handed architects, artists, and chess players in proportion to their numbers (Coren, 1992).",
              "However, there are also more left-handers among those with reading disabilities, allergies, and migraine headaches (Geschwind & Behan, 2007), perhaps due to the fact that a small minority of left-handers owe their handedness to a birth trauma, such as being born prematurely (Betancur, Ve\u0301lez, Cabanieu, & le Moal, 1990).",
              "In sports in which handedness may matter, such as tennis, boxing, fencing, or judo, left-handers may have an advantage.",
              "They play many games against right-handers and learn how to best handle their styles.",
              "Right-handers, however, play very few games against left-handers, which may make them more vulnerable.",
              "This explains why a disproportionately high number of left-handers are found in sports where direct one-on-one action predominates.",
              "In other sports, such as golf, there are fewer left-handed players because the handedness of one player has no effect on the competition.",
              "The fact that left-handers excel in some sports suggests the possibility that they may have also had an evolutionary advantage because their ancestors may have been more successful in important skills such as hand-to-hand combat (Bodmer & McKie, 1994).",

              "In this situation, the recognition test would likely produce better performance from participants than the recall test.",

              "Roediger & Karpicke, 2006).",
              "However, retrieving some information can actually cause us to forget other information related to it, a phenomenon called retrieval-induced forgetting (Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork, 1994).",

              "But how do we do this?",
              "Keep in mind the two critical principles we have discussed: to maximize retrieval, we should construct meaningful cues that remind us of the original experience, and those cues should be distinctive and not associated with other memories.",
              "These two conditions are critical in maximizing cue effectiveness (Nairne, 2002).",
              "So, how can these principles be adapted for use in many situations?",
              "Let\u2019s go back to how we started the module, with Simon Reinhard\u2019s ability to memorize huge numbers of digits.",
              "Although it was not obvious, he applied these same general memory principles, but in a more deliberate way.",
              "In fact, all mnemonic devices, or memory aids/tricks, rely on these fundamental principles.",
              "In a typical case, the person learns a set of cues and then applies these cues to learn and remember information.",
              "Consider the set of 20 items below that are easy to learn and remember (Bower & Reitman, 1972).",
              "It would probably take you less than 10 minutes to learn this list and practice recalling it several times (remember to use retrieval practice!)",
              ".",
              "If you were to do so, you would have a set of peg words on which you could \u201chang\u201d memories.",
              "In fact, this mnemonic device is called the peg word technique.",
              "If you then needed to remember some discrete items\u2014say a grocery list, or points you wanted to make in a speech\u2014this method would let you do so in a very precise yet flexible way.",
              "Suppose you had to remember bread, peanut butter, bananas, lettuce, and so on.",
              "The way to use the method is to form a vivid image of what you want to remember and imagine it interacting with your peg words (as many as you need).",
              "For example, for these items, you might imagine a large gun (the first peg word) shooting a loaf of bread, then a jar of peanut butter inside a shoe, then large bunches of bananas hanging from a tree, then a door slamming on a head of lettuce with leaves flying everywhere.",
              "The idea is to provide good, distinctive cues (the weirder the better!)",
              "for the information you need to remember while you are learning it.",
              "If you do this, then retrieving it later is relatively easy.",

              ", so you simply go through your cue word list and \u201clook\u201d in your mind\u2019s eye at the image stored there (bread, in this case).",
              "This peg word method may sound strange at first, but it works quite well, even with little training (Roediger, 1980).",
              "One word of warning, though, is that the items to be remembered need to be presented relatively slowly at first, until you have practice associating each with its cue word.",
              "People get faster with time.",
              "Another interesting aspect of this technique is that it\u2019s just as easy to recall the items in backwards order as forwards.",
              "This is because the peg words provide direct access to the memorized items, regardless of order.",
              "How did Simon Reinhard remember those digits?",
              "Essentially he has a much more complex system based on these same principles.",
              "In his case, he uses \u201cmemory palaces\u201d (elaborate scenes with discrete places) combined with huge sets of images for digits.",
              "For example, imagine mentally walking through the home where you grew up and identifying as many distinct areas and objects as possible.",
              "Simon has hundreds of such memory palaces that he uses.",
              "Next, for remembering digits, he has memorized a set of 10,000 images.",
              "Every four-digit number for him immediately brings forth a mental image.",
              "So, for example, 6187 might recall Michael Jackson.",
              "When Simon hears all the numbers coming at him, he places an image for every four digits into locations in his memory palace.",
              "He can do this at an incredibly rapid rate, faster than 4 digits per 4 seconds when they are flashed visually, as in the demonstration at the beginning of the module.",
              "As noted, his record is 240 digits, recalled in exact order.",
              "Simon also holds the world record in an event called \u201cspeed cards,\u201d which involves memorizing the precise order of a shuffled deck of cards.",
              "Simon was able to do this in 21.",
              "19 seconds!",
              "Again, he uses his memory palaces, and he encodes groups of cards as single images.",
              "Many books exist on how to improve memory using mnemonic devices, but all involve forming distinctive encoding operations and then having an infallible set of memory cues.",
              "We should add that to develop and use these memory systems beyond the basic peg system outlined above takes a great amount of time and concentration.",
              "The World Memory Championships are held every year and the records keep improving.",

              "There are three main ways in which information can be encoded/changed: Visual encoding: Information is represented as a picture Acoustic encoding: Information is represented as sounds Semantic encoding: Information is represented by its meaning to you When you are exposed to information through your senses, you take the information and begin processing it in visual, acoustic, and/or semantic form.",
              "This means that you take in information, either as a picture, a sound, or give the information meaning.",

              "Indeed, if you know the literature, you know that many scholars have proposed different terms for these cognitive processes.",
              "In addition to Kahneman's System 1 and System 2, we have Freud's primary and secondary, Keith Stanovich advocates for Type 1 and Type 2, and many in cognitive science use \"automatic\" versus \"deliberate\" or \"controlled.\"",
              "This diversity of framing is consistent with a central point we have repeatedly made in our work together: there is much confusion and equivocation regarding the meaning of cognitive and the ontology of the mental and we need big picture perspectives to sort out the confusion.",
              "We have each independently developed metatheories for psychology (Henriques) and cognitive science (Vervaeke).",
              "Over the last two years, we have found that they work together in a highly synergistic fashion.",
              "Interestingly, when we combine our metatheoretical viewpoints and look at the System 1 and 2 versus Type 1 and 2 terminologies, a new picture emerges.",
              "Specifically, we contend that it makes sense to divide human mental processes into two different types and two different systems. To see the two types of cognitive processes, we can use Vervaeke\u2019s metatheory of cognition.",
              "As described in this post, Vervaeke has posited a general model of cognition framed as the 3 Rs of recursive relevance realization.",
              "The short summary is that the mind works to scan the inputs for relevant information and then moves to realize both what is the case and what paths of action can be taken.",
              "In addition, there is a secondary recursive process that functions to place a check on the initial grip that the relevance realization process forms on the situation.",
              "This recursive process can then update the initial inference based on how it conforms to anticipated expectations and based on how it aligns with other modeling processes held in the mind.",
              "Applying Vervaeke\u2019s frame to the dual processing model, we can suggest that the initial sizing up of relevance to be realized can be framed as Type 1 processes.",
              "That is, when confronted with a scene or set of stimuli, there are a group of primary cognitive processes that are quickly making inferences about what is relevant and try to \u201crealize\u201d a match between the model it initially makes and the incoming information.",
              "Then there are Type 2 secondary recursive processes that operate to check the match and align it with other mental models.",
              "These Type 2 recursions come online if the first type of processing results in an unexpected surprise or if it conflicts with other models.",
              "As such, they function as a kind of deliberative and corrective process.",
              "It is helpful to note that Keith Stanovich, who emphasized the Type 1 versus Type 2 terminology, proposed that the defining difference between Type 1 and Type 2 processes is that the latter involves working memory2.",
              "Given the work of Hasher and others that working memory is a higher-order relevance filter where we can perform chunking and do counterfactual simulations of things, it makes sense to see working memory as an important hub of recursive relevance realization3.",
              "We also see that there is no clear dividing line between Type 1 and Type 2 processes, but a continuum of increasing demand placed on working memory.",
              "Such a continuum is less consistent with the idea of distinct systems. Thus, when we look at dual processing through the lens of Vervaeke\u2019s model, we can see why a more accurate nomenclature is the Type 1 versus Type 2 processes.",
              "However, there is another angle provided by Henriques' work on the Unified Theory of Knowledge (UTOK)5 that can validate the System 1 versus System 2 distinction.",
              "Early in the cognitive psychology course mentioned above, we covered Seymour Epstein\u2019s American Psychologist article on Cognitive Experiential Self Theory5.",
              "In it, Epstein argued his model could effectively bridge an updated Freudian analysis with modern cognitive psychology.",
              "His model makes a clear distinction between the animal-mammal-primate portion of our cognitive structure and the more verbal, rational, self-conscious, self-reflective, justifying \u201cperson\u201d mind.",
              "Epstein's analysis aligns well with UTOK's formulation of humans as persons and primates6.",
              "Via Justification Systems Theory7, UTOK posits that we should think of the human ego as a mental organ of justification that evolves in response to the evolution of propositional language and the resulting question-answer dynamics of justification that emerge with it.",
              "UTOK\u2019s model of human psychology thus posits that humans have a primary animal-mammal-primate system of nonverbal cognition and a secondary, self-conscious, justifying mind that is a propositional knowing system that allows us to navigate the Culture-Person plane of existence.",
              "As such, the primate-experiential system can be framed as \u201cSystem 1\u201d and the person-propositional system as \u201cSystem 2\u201d.",
              "Of course, the fact that there are these two systems does not mean that there are not important causal and function relations between the primate-experiential system and the person-propositional system.",
              "There are important connections between the respiratory and circulation systems within the body, but we can still understand them as different systems performing different functions.",
              "When Henriques' analysis is placed in relation to the set of analyses framed by Vervaeke\u2019s theory of recursive relevance realization, we can see that both types of cognitive processes would be present in both systems. That is, there are Type 1 (relevance realizing) and Type 2 (recursive checking) processes in both System 1 (primate-experiential) and System 2 (justifying person).",
              "In this analysis, the example of the ball and bat would be processed in System 2 because it is propositional, but the conclusion that the bat is $1 is a function of Type 1 processes in System 2.",
              "We can also see deliberation in the animal world, such as when crows engage in systematic, novel problem-solving.",
              "Such processes would be Type 2 processes taking place in System 1.",
              "In short, when we merge Henriques' UTOK with Vervaeke\u2019s metatheory of cognition, a new picture emerges.",

              "How Memory Works | Derek Bok Center, Harvard University",
              "Memory is the ongoing process of information retention over time.",
              "Because it makes up the very framework through which we make sense of and take action within the present, its importance goes without saying.",
              "But how exactly does it work?",
              "And how can teachers apply a better understanding of its inner workings to their own teaching?",
              "In light of current research in cognitive science, the very, very short answer to these questions is that memory operates according to a \"dual-process,\" where more unconscious, more routine thought processes (known as \"System 1\") interact with more conscious, more problem-based thought processes (known as \"System 2\").",
              "At each of these two levels, in turn, there are the processes through which we \"get information in\" (encoding), how we hold on to it (storage), and and how we \"get it back out\" (retrieval or recall).",
              "With a basic understanding of how these elements of memory work together, teachers can maximize student learning by knowing how much new information to introduce, when to introduce it, and how to sequence assignments that will both reinforce the retention of facts (System 1) and build toward critical, creative thinking (System 2).",
              "Think back to a time when you learned a new skill, such as driving a car, riding a bicycle, or reading.",
              "When you first learned this skill, performing it was an active process in which you analyzed and were acutely aware of every movement you made.",
              "Part of this analytical process also meant that you thought carefully about why you were doing what you were doing, to understand how these individual steps fit together as a comprehensive whole.",
              "However, as your ability improved, performing the skill stopped being a cognitively-demanding process, instead becoming more intuitive.",
              "As you continue to master the skill, you can perform other, at times more intellectually-demanding, tasks simultaneously.",
              "Due to your knowledge of this skill or process being unconscious, you could, for example, solve an unrelated complex problem or make an analytical decision while completing it.",
              "In its simplest form, the scenario above is an example of what psychologists call dual-process theory.",
              "The term \u201cdual-process\u201d refers to the idea that some behaviors and cognitive processes (such as decision-making) are the products of two distinct cognitive processes, often called System 1 and System 2 (Kaufmann, 2011:443-445).",
              "While System 1 is characterized by automatic, unconscious thought, System 2 is characterized by effortful, analytical, intentional thought (Osman, 2004:989).",
              "How do System 1 and System 2 thinking relate to teaching and learning?",
              "In an educational context, System 1 is associated with memorization and recall of information, while System 2 describes more analytical or critical thinking.",
              "Memory and recall, as a part of System 1 cognition, are focused on in the rest of these notes.",
              "As mentioned above, System 1 is characterized by its fast, unconscious recall of previously-memorized information.",
              "Classroom activities that would draw heavily on System 1 include memorized multiplication tables, as well as multiple-choice exam questions that only need exact regurgitation from a source such as a textbook.",
              "These kinds of tasks do not require students to actively analyze what is being asked of them beyond reiterating memorized material.",
              "System 2 thinking becomes necessary when students are presented with activities and assignments that require them to provide a novel solution to a problem, engage in critical thinking, or apply a concept outside of the domain in which it was originally presented.",
              "It may be tempting to think of learning beyond the primary school level as being all about System 2, all the time.",
              "However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that successful System 2 thinking depends on a lot of System 1 thinking to operate.",
              "In other words, critical thinking requires a lot of memorized knowledge and intuitive, automatic judgments to be performed quickly and accurately.",
              "In its simplest form, memory refers to the continued process of information retention over time.",
              "It is an integral part of human cognition, since it allows individuals to recall and draw upon past events to frame their understanding of and behavior within the present.",
              "Memory also gives individuals a framework through which to make sense of the present and future.",
              "As such, memory plays a crucial role in teaching and learning.",
              "There are three main processes that characterize how memory works.",
              "These processes are encoding, storage, and retrieval (or recall).",
              "Retrieval is subject to error, because it can reflect a reconstruction of memory.",
              "This reconstruction becomes necessary when stored information is lost over time due to decayed retention.",
              "In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted an experiment in which he tested how well individuals remembered a list of nonsense syllables over increasingly longer periods of time.",
              "Using the results of his experiment, he created what is now known as the \u201cEbbinghaus Forgetting Curve\u201d (Schaefer, 2015).",
              "Through his research, Ebbinghaus concluded that the rate at which your memory (of recently learned information) decays depends both on the time that has elapsed following your learning experience as well as how strong your memory is.",
              "Some degree of memory decay is inevitable, so, as an educator, how do you reduce the scope of this memory loss?",
              "The following sections answer this question by looking at how to improve recall within a learning environment, through various teaching and learning techniques.",
              "As a teacher, it is important to be aware of techniques that you can use to promote better retention and recall among your students.",
              "Three such techniques are the testing effect, spacing, and interleaving.",
              "As useful as it is to know which techniques you can use, as a teacher, to improve student recall of information, it is also crucial for students to be aware of techniques they can use to improve their own recall.",

              "Why is this?",
              "Because you can recall images (mental pictures) more easily than words alone.",

              "Some years ago, psychologists Fergus Craik and Endel Tulving (1975) conducted a series of experiments to find out.",
              "Participants were given words along with questions about them.",

              "These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin (1968).",
              "Their model of human memory (Figure 8.",
              "4), called Atkinson and Shiffrin's model, is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer processes information.",

              "Baddeley and Hitch (1974) proposed a working memory model in which short-term memory has different forms. In their model, storing memories in short-term memory is like opening different files on a computer and adding information.",
              "The working memory files hold a limited amount of information.",
              "The type of short-term memory (or computer file) depends on the type of information received.",
              "There are memories in visual-spatial form, as well as memories of spoken or written material, and they are stored in three short-term systems: a visuospatial sketchpad, an episodic buffer (Baddeley, 2000), and a phonological loop.",

              "In fact, this mnemonic device is called the peg word technique.",
              "If you then needed to remember some discrete items\u2014say a grocery list, or points you wanted to make in a speech\u2014this method would let you do so in a very precise yet flexible way.",
              "Suppose you had to remember bread, peanut butter, bananas, lettuce, and so on.",
              "The way to use the method is to form a vivid image of what you want to remember and imagine it interacting with your peg words (as many as you need).",
              "For example, for these items, you might imagine a large gun (the first peg word) shooting a loaf of bread, then a jar of peanut butter inside a shoe, then large bunches of bananas hanging from a tree, then a door slamming on a head of lettuce with leaves flying everywhere.",
              "The idea is to provide good, distinctive cues (the weirder the better!)",

              ", so you simply go through your cue word list and \u201clook\u201d in your mind\u2019s eye at the image stored there (bread, in this case).",
              "This peg word method may sound strange at first, but it works quite well, even with little training (Roediger, 1980).",
              "One word of warning, though, is that the items to be remembered need to be presented relatively slowly at first, until you have practice associating each with its cue word.",
              "People get faster with time.",
              "Another interesting aspect of this technique is that it\u2019s just as easy to recall the items in backwards order as forwards.",
              "This is because the peg words provide direct access to the memorized items, regardless of order.",

              "For example, imagine mentally walking through the home where you grew up and identifying as many distinct areas and objects as possible.",
              "Simon has hundreds of such memory palaces that he uses.",
              "Next, for remembering digits, he has memorized a set of 10,000 images.",

              "So, for example, 6187 might recall Michael Jackson.",
              "When Simon hears all the numbers coming at him, he places an image for every four digits into locations in his memory palace.",
              "He can do this at an incredibly rapid rate, faster than 4 digits per 4 seconds when they are flashed visually, as in the demonstration at the beginning of the module.",
              "As noted, his record is 240 digits, recalled in exact order.",
              "Simon also holds the world record in an event called \u201cspeed cards,\u201d which involves memorizing the precise order of a shuffled deck of cards.",

              "19 seconds!",
              "Again, he uses his memory palaces, and he encodes groups of cards as single images.",
              "Many books exist on how to improve memory using mnemonic devices, but all involve forming distinctive encoding operations and then having an infallible set of memory cues.",
              "We should add that to develop and use these memory systems beyond the basic peg system outlined above takes a great amount of time and concentration.",

              "How Memory Works | Derek Bok Center, Harvard University",
              "Memory is the ongoing process of information retention over time.",
              "Because it makes up the very framework through which we make sense of and take action within the present, its importance goes without saying.",
              "But how exactly does it work?",
              "And how can teachers apply a better understanding of its inner workings to their own teaching?",
              "In light of current research in cognitive science, the very, very short answer to these questions is that memory operates according to a \"dual-process,\" where more unconscious, more routine thought processes (known as \"System 1\") interact with more conscious, more problem-based thought processes (known as \"System 2\").",
              "At each of these two levels, in turn, there are the processes through which we \"get information in\" (encoding), how we hold on to it (storage), and and how we \"get it back out\" (retrieval or recall).",
              "With a basic understanding of how these elements of memory work together, teachers can maximize student learning by knowing how much new information to introduce, when to introduce it, and how to sequence assignments that will both reinforce the retention of facts (System 1) and build toward critical, creative thinking (System 2).",
              "Think back to a time when you learned a new skill, such as driving a car, riding a bicycle, or reading.",
              "When you first learned this skill, performing it was an active process in which you analyzed and were acutely aware of every movement you made.",
              "Part of this analytical process also meant that you thought carefully about why you were doing what you were doing, to understand how these individual steps fit together as a comprehensive whole.",
              "However, as your ability improved, performing the skill stopped being a cognitively-demanding process, instead becoming more intuitive.",
              "As you continue to master the skill, you can perform other, at times more intellectually-demanding, tasks simultaneously.",
              "Due to your knowledge of this skill or process being unconscious, you could, for example, solve an unrelated complex problem or make an analytical decision while completing it.",
              "In its simplest form, the scenario above is an example of what psychologists call dual-process theory.",
              "The term \u201cdual-process\u201d refers to the idea that some behaviors and cognitive processes (such as decision-making) are the products of two distinct cognitive processes, often called System 1 and System 2 (Kaufmann, 2011:443-445).",
              "While System 1 is characterized by automatic, unconscious thought, System 2 is characterized by effortful, analytical, intentional thought (Osman, 2004:989).",
              "How do System 1 and System 2 thinking relate to teaching and learning?",
              "In an educational context, System 1 is associated with memorization and recall of information, while System 2 describes more analytical or critical thinking.",
              "Memory and recall, as a part of System 1 cognition, are focused on in the rest of these notes.",
              "As mentioned above, System 1 is characterized by its fast, unconscious recall of previously-memorized information.",
              "Classroom activities that would draw heavily on System 1 include memorized multiplication tables, as well as multiple-choice exam questions that only need exact regurgitation from a source such as a textbook.",
              "These kinds of tasks do not require students to actively analyze what is being asked of them beyond reiterating memorized material.",
              "System 2 thinking becomes necessary when students are presented with activities and assignments that require them to provide a novel solution to a problem, engage in critical thinking, or apply a concept outside of the domain in which it was originally presented.",
              "It may be tempting to think of learning beyond the primary school level as being all about System 2, all the time.",
              "However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that successful System 2 thinking depends on a lot of System 1 thinking to operate.",
              "In other words, critical thinking requires a lot of memorized knowledge and intuitive, automatic judgments to be performed quickly and accurately.",
              "In its simplest form, memory refers to the continued process of information retention over time.",
              "It is an integral part of human cognition, since it allows individuals to recall and draw upon past events to frame their understanding of and behavior within the present.",
              "Memory also gives individuals a framework through which to make sense of the present and future.",
              "As such, memory plays a crucial role in teaching and learning.",
              "There are three main processes that characterize how memory works.",
              "These processes are encoding, storage, and retrieval (or recall).",
              "Retrieval is subject to error, because it can reflect a reconstruction of memory.",
              "This reconstruction becomes necessary when stored information is lost over time due to decayed retention.",
              "In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted an experiment in which he tested how well individuals remembered a list of nonsense syllables over increasingly longer periods of time.",
              "Using the results of his experiment, he created what is now known as the \u201cEbbinghaus Forgetting Curve\u201d (Schaefer, 2015).",
              "Through his research, Ebbinghaus concluded that the rate at which your memory (of recently learned information) decays depends both on the time that has elapsed following your learning experience as well as how strong your memory is.",
              "Some degree of memory decay is inevitable, so, as an educator, how do you reduce the scope of this memory loss?",
              "The following sections answer this question by looking at how to improve recall within a learning environment, through various teaching and learning techniques.",
              "As a teacher, it is important to be aware of techniques that you can use to promote better retention and recall among your students.",
              "Three such techniques are the testing effect, spacing, and interleaving.",
              "As useful as it is to know which techniques you can use, as a teacher, to improve student recall of information, it is also crucial for students to be aware of techniques they can use to improve their own recall.",

              "They target the three main components of memory: encoding, storage, and retrieval, while also bearing on categories such as short/long term, declarative, non-declarative memory, etc.",
              "In neurodegenerative disease, there are therapies that treat the symptoms of memory loss, while others attack the fundamental disease.",
              "Drugs affecting several physiological systems (e.",
              "g., glucocorticoid, endocannabinoid, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin systems) sometimes push different memory functions in opposite directions, for example, enhancing memory formation while impairing retrieval, or vice versa.",
              "It is, therefore, critical to determine which functions should be improved and then to select the appropriate approach.",
              "We here focus mainly on methods addressing long term memory processes.",
              "Long term memory stores information for a long period of time and can be classified into declarative and procedural memory systems1.",
              "While procedural memory facilitates learning skills that can be retrieved without conscious awareness, declarative memory enables one to remember personal events (episodic memory) or general information (semantic memory) and frequently requires a conscious recall process1.",
              "From an anatomical point of view, procedural memory is supported by the striatum and cerebellum2.",
              "In contrast, declarative memory processes like encoding and consolidation take place in the medial temporal lobe, especially in the hippocampus3.",
              "In nature, the different systems of memory cannot be seen as separated from each other but rather interact frequently4.",
              "Nevertheless, we will describe some examples of how memory-enhancing techniques influence different memory types.",
              "Memory loss in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) mostly affects episodic memory5 which represents a part of the declarative long-term memory.",
              "Thus, light stimulation, an innovative approach for restoring memory in AD that has been tested in mice, targets episodic memory by activating special hippocampal engram cells5.",
              "Administration of erythropoietin (EPO) addresses declarative long term memory as well: EPO enhanced long-term potentiation in the hippocampus during picture recall in healthy volunteers6 and improved verbal memory mediated through an increase in hippocampal volume in mood disorders7.",
              "When using mnemonic learning strategies, such as the ancient method of loci (MOL) for remembering items as numbers, faces, and snowflakes, activation of the right hippocampus and other brain regions crucial for spatial memory could be demonstrated8.",
              "Hence, the MOL seems to address long term memory and spatial memory.",
              "In this review, we will summarize current approaches for memory enhancement in both diseased and healthy individuals with focus on methods addressing long term memory processes.",
              "Our aim is not to be comprehensive, but to critically examine specific prevailing techniques and to discuss some promising concepts for the future (Fig.",

              "Our perspective analyzes first the recent progress in memory-enhancing approaches in AD, such as stem cell transplantation and vaccination against AD.",
              "Then, we investigate some rather unconventional neuroenhancement drugs, whose brain function-improving action was just detected in the last few years and might serve both healthy and diseased individuals.",
              "These include histamine, EPO, probiotics, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA).",
              "Next, we explore memory techniques and in particular, the ancient \u201cmethod of loci\u201d (MOL) which mainly stimulates memory capabilities only in the healthy state.",
              "To conclude, we investigate augmented reality (AR) and chip devices as a potential booster of learning capacities.",
              "We compare the approaches regarding memory-enhancing effects, briefly describe their physiological background and critically reexamine the prevailing limitations.",
              "Regarding the future, we discuss the recovery of memories through light stimulation5 and potential memory prostheses9.",
              "AD is the most common form of dementia with prevalence increasing worldwide10.",
              "It is characterized by an accumulation of amyloid-\u00df (A\u00df) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (tau protein).",
              "The key symptoms consist of cognitive dysfunction in the form of learning impairments as well as memory loss that becomes increasingly severe over time, correlating with extensive neuronal and synaptic losses11.",
              "So far, the treatment options for reversing the pathologies and neuronal death in AD and other forms like Lewy body12 and alcohol-abuse-associated dementia13 have been very limited, but in several studies, stem cell therapy showed modestly promising results in rescuing memory.",
              "Stem cells are characterized by their capability to differentiate into different cell types and in the brain were originally thought to replace the damaged neurons in neurodegenerative diseases.",
              "Indeed, mesenchymal stem cells derived from human umbilical cord could be shown to transform into nerve-like cells14.",
              "However, many studies found totally different mechanisms of action including targeting the misfolded proteins or neurogenesis15 by, for example, increasing neurotrophins16.",
              "One study that used neural stem cells from fetal brain tissue transplanted into two different transgenic mouse models of AD, has shown a significant improvement in cognition, specifically in memory consolidation and to a lesser extent in learning a new task11.",
              "Interestingly, the stem cells did not alter A\u03b2 or tau protein aggregations, but improved markers that are associated with synaptic integrity and thus, probably synaptogenesis11.",
              "This effect could have been mediated by BDNF, a neurotrophic factor that is known to enhance synaptic growth11.",
              "Another study applied neural stem cell transplantation in a transgenic mouse model of Lewy body dementia (LBD).",
              "This treatment was found to correlate with significant improvement in multiple cognitive and motor functions12.",
              "Similar to AD, LBD is characterized by the accumulation of a misfolded protein.",
              "However, the pathology of \u03b1-synuclein, forming Lewy bodies, was not improved by stem cell transplantation.",
              "Impaired dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling after depletion of synaptic storages was restored via a BDNF-dependent mechanism12.",
              "Mesenchymal stem cells of bone marrow and human umbilical cord help in neurodegenerative pathologies17 including impairment of learning and memory13,18 such as in stroke.",
              "A meta-analysis of effects of stem cell transplantation on cognitive function in AD in 58 different studies reinforces a potential benefit regarding learning and memory recovery in experimental settings10.",
              "Nevertheless, due to several limitations and the poor quality-standards of most of these studies, the estimated positive effect may be overrated10.",
              "A majority of the better-designed studies found a lower impact on learning and memory10.",
              "Despite the lesser effect in the better-designed studies, transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells did consistently ameliorate A\u03b2-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive decline in vivo and in vitro.",
              "It inhibited apoptotic cell death and oxidative stress in the hippocampus9.",
              "Over the last decade, the idea of treating AD by vaccination has also garnered more attention.",
              "Immunization against the pathological key players in AD would be an ideal treatment, because the disease process itself could be prevented or at least attenuated19.",
              "Main strategies of AD vaccination rely on lowering the levels of the pathological A\u00df peptide20 and tau protein19.",
              "These may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death21 as characteristic features of AD.",
              "Indeed, previous studies have shown that both active and passive immune therapies are able to effectively clear \u03b2-amyloid deposits in the brains of multiple mouse models of AD20,22 and even can improve behavioral deficits22.",
              "However, these findings did not correlate with a positive clinical outcome in phase three trials with Alzheimer\u2019s patients20,21,22,23,24.",
              "Nevertheless, a beneficial effect on cognitive functions could be demonstrated in pre-symptomatic or early AD patients treated with passive and active immunization against A\u00df20,25.",
              "In the first studies using active anti-A\u00df immunization, the patients who responded to the therapy achieved significantly better composite scores of memory function and had a slower cognitive decline20.",
              "In another study using the same vaccine, the A\u00df burden correlated inversely with the patients\u2019 antibody titer, but there was no clinical effect20.",
              "There is a long road to a real clinical improvement through an AD vaccination with \u03b2-amyloid antibodies.",
              "This currently represents the most advanced approach.",
              "However, to be effective, the treatment has to be administered before plaque deposition and before the first symptoms of the disease occur21.",
              "Moreover, the antibody administration must be long-term in order to produce the desired effects21.",
              "A promising new vaccination technique for long-term treatment was successfully tested in two mouse models of AD: Cells that continuously secreted \u03b2-amyloid antibodies for more than 10 months were implanted subcutaneously before an actual plaque accumulation and dramatically reduced amyloid and tau pathologies21,25.",
              "How far a vaccination against AD will be able not only to reverse pathologies, but can actually help to prevent or ameliorate the symptoms of disease clinically, is still not clear26.",
              "Maybe, despite representing the key findings in AD, the amyloid and tau pathologies do not contribute to the memory and cognitive decline to the extent expected26.",
              "For instance, the signaling involved in vascular dysfunction in AD was studied and it was found that antiplatelet therapy may, in fact, be helpful as inhibition of platelet signaling alleviates fibril formation in AD patients27.",
              "Further studies beyond animal models, especially controlled clinical trials, are required.",
              "Regarding the patho-mechanisms in AD on a cellular level, up to now, many studies suggested that the occurring memory deficits are due to an impaired storage of information5.",
              "The Tonegawa group recently discovered that an AD mouse model had not forgotten information\u2014their traces were still stored in specific hippocampal cells, so-called engram cells\u2014but were unable to access the information because of disease-related disrupted neuronal signaling5.",
              "Interestingly, light therapy, mimicking the natural cellular signal, allowed the memories to be retrieved5.",
              "This optogenetic stimulation of long-term potentiation even succeeded in recovering spine density and long-term memory5.",
              "In our opinion, these findings contribute tremendously to a deeper insight into the operating principle of human memory itself, as well as the patho-mechanisms of AD.",
              "In the last decades, major efforts and large financial expenditures have been made in order to find significant effects of neural stem cell transplantation in neurodegenerative disease, particularly in animal models28.",
              "Nevertheless, we see only little progress in this field, as compared to other approaches and doubt that the transplantation of stem cells will soon work in humans and become a widely applicable therapy29.",
              "The handful of therapies currently available provide only transient benefits and the focus should be more on neurotrophins.",
              "In contrast, the relatively new and innovative approach of an Alzheimer\u2019s vaccination has hardly been researched and should be investigated more deeply.",
              "However, the stimulation of memory engram cells via optical long-term potentiation opens a completely new, promising target for future treatments of AD and in our opinion, should be intensely promoted in future research.",
              "Indeed, \u201cclassical\u201d neuroenhancement drugs, such as methylphenidate and modafinil actually improve memory30, and negative side effects such as abuse are comparatively low.",
              "Similarly, a systematic review tackling newer active drugs for cognitive enhancement found a memory ameliorating effect of melatonin and acetyl salicylic acid, but also admits that most of the studied drugs showed negative results31.",
              "We, therefore, would like to report on some novel drugs that are generally not categorized as memory-enhancing.",
              "We first focus on EPO as a powerful treatment option in different mental and neurodegenerative diseases that are accompanied by memory deficits.",
              "Better known as a doping drug in sports, increasing physical performance by boosting the number of red blood cells, the hormone EPO has been shown to additionally offer cognition-enhancing and brain-mass-protecting effects independently of its hematopoietic role7,32,33.",
              "In the last few years, a positive impact on cognition and hippocampal long-term potentiation in healthy human volunteers and rodents was found6,34.",
              "In a study on EPO as a treatment option for memory impairment in neuropsychiatric diseases, recombinant human EPO could consistently improve memory and cognition in patients with multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder7,33,35,36,37.",
              "While most of the studies on depression even demonstrated a beneficial impact on mood and behavioral symptoms38,39, this did not correlate with improvement in memory function38, and other investigations did not confirm an antidepressant-like effect7,40,41.",
              "However, EPO produced a mood-independent enhancement of verbal memory even 6 weeks after treatment completion when red blood cell levels were again normal.",
              "The exact underlying neurobiological mechanisms of EPO are still not completely understood32.",
              "According to current knowledge, EPO seems to be involved in different modes of action including the promotion of adult neurogenesis42 and the release of BDNF43.",
              "After EPO treatment, Ehrenreich and colleagues found adult neurogenesis increased by 20% from preexisting neuronal precursors that can differentiate into mature hippocampal memory neurons in a specific hippocampal region32.",
              "It is important to understand that here EPO acts not as a direct drug for neuroenhancement but rather stimulates differentiation in neuroblasts for adult neurogenesis.",
              "This alternative paradigm was based on the results of animal experiments and in vitro experiments using human cell cultures.",
              "Reactivating neuro-regeneration is indeed promising in all cases in which there is an indication/risk of increased and irreversible neuron loss.",
              "Application in healthy subjects in a clinical study is, however, rare.",
              "A recent report shows in a case-control study for very preterm infants treated with EPO positive effects in the frontal and temporal lobes and better neuronal connectivity44.",
              "Another possible memory-enhancing agent that is better known as a mediator in allergies, is histamine.",
              "In a recent study in Japan, the administration of histamine receptor agonists that raised histamine levels and neuronal activity in specific brain regions, improved long term memory in mice45.",
              "Histamine release enabled the reactivation of neurons that were already firing during memorization45.",
              "Accordingly, application of histamine agonists could boost memory in healthy human volunteers45.",
              "These findings open up a completely new field of histamine treatment that, so far, is mostly used to block histamine release via antihistamines.",
              "However, to determine whether and in which conditions pro-histamine medications could be applied for memory enhancement, further studies are required.",
              "Lately, a group of researchers in Toronto has developed several new molecules, so-called imidazobenzodiazepine (IBZD) amide ligands that are derived from benzodiazepine (BZ)46.",
              "IBZD amide ligands target specific gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in brain regions critical for cognition, such as the hippocampus46.",
              "In a recent study, IBZD amide ligands have been shown for the first time to reverse stress- and age-related working memory impairments in mice46.",
              "The application of IBZD amide ligands for memory enhancement could be broad, provided that clinical trials confirm the safety and efficacy of these novel molecules.",
              "If successfully tested in humans, utilization of IBZD amide ligands for impeding cognitive deficits in AD and mental illnesses such as depression and/or age-related memory loss are conceivable46.",
              "Externally administered drugs have beneficial effects on memory, however, what about internal effectors?",
              "Here the gut microbiome and bacterial secreted components, in general, are important to consider.",
              "In addition, we will consider diet and lifestyle impacts.",
              "The microbiota-gut\u2013brain axis is a recent field of considerable research interest.",
              "Comprising trillions of bacteria stimulating afferent neurons of the enteric nervous system47, the complex role of the gut microbiome and its effects on the brain are just beginning to be illuminated.",
              "There is growing evidence that the composition and diversity of the gut habitat are capable of altering learning, memory, and behavior via different pathways48,49,50,51,52.",
              "Even neuropsychiatric diseases like anxiety disorders and depression, as well as age and dementia-related cognitive decline could already be attenuated in animals and man51,53,54,55.",
              "Currently, multiple mechanisms have been proposed on how bacteria in our gut could be able to influence our central nervous system.",
              "One theory suggests intestinal permeability due to toxins produced by pathogenic bacteria, as a major route56.",
              "According to this understanding/theory, such a \u201cleaky gut\u201d could modulate the brain through the release of inflammatory cytokines, or stimulation of the vagal nerve as well as translocation of different metabolic products56.",
              "Furthermore, Quintana and his colleagues recently uncovered how gut bacteria products might limit inflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system by influencing microglia and astrocytes57.",
              "In a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), they demonstrated how the breakdown products of dietary tryptophan produced by microbes directly reduce brain inflammation via the microglial and astrocytic aryl hydrocarbon receptor57.",
              "In addition, studying human MS brain tissues, the researchers detected similar players and pathways57.",
              "Besides giving hope for new MS therapies, these findings deliver the first molecular insights on how the gut\u2013brain-connection might work on a mechanistic level.",
              "There are also observations of direct manipulation of the central nervous system by food compounds58.",
              "However, these effects on the brain could at least in part again be caused by changes in the gut microbiota provoked by nutrition.",
              "In one mouse study, a meat-rich diet, known to induce shifts in bacterial variety, was associated with a significant increase in the diversity of the gut flora as well as memory improvement and reduction of anxiety levels58.",
              "In other animal studies, high fat and particularly high sugar diets were found to deteriorate memory and learning while promoting anxiety by altering the microbiome50,59,60.",
              "However, a diet rich in polysaturated fatty acids, as opposed to saturated, was not associated with such memory impairments despite a similar caloric intake60.",
              "Furthermore, n-3 PUFA mediates some of these beneficial effects on the brain via the gut61,62.",
              "n-3 PUFA supplementation could be shown to improve performance in different memory tasks in mice, since it provides a variety of neuroprotective effects and induces adult hippocampal neogenesis62.",
              "However, inconsistent outcomes in clinical trials of efficacy in neurodegenerative diseases like AD, show that for decisions on concrete dietary measures such as increasing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids more studies are required63.",
              "Besides direct dietary modifications, directly altering the gut flora by administering probiotics also shows promise: in animal studies, cognitive impairment due to diabetes mellitus was reversed and learning and memory were improved after probiotic administration64,65.",
              "Another factor detrimental for memory retrieval implying bad memory access are mood disorders such as depression or anxiety.",
              "In this respect, symptoms of depression, and anxiety were reduced by probiotic supplementation49,65,66.",
              "The gut microbiome may even be an important factor influencing anxiety, depression and autism and by this lead to memory or mental impairment by ref.",

              "A strong and very effective way to improve memory, mnemonic discrimination, flexibility, and spatial working memory is through sports and physical activity68.",

              "Soft and natural interventions such as diet and behavior, including n-3 PUFA, probiotics, and physical activity are effective in preventing and ameliorating symptoms as well as delaying the onset of memory decline.",
              "Molecular neuro-regeneration such as through EPO administration, however, requires more basic research before being transferrable to clinical settings.",
              "The same applies to translating the influence of the gut microbiome on neuro-inflammation and neuro-regeneration into clinical settings.",
              "There are some behavioral methods that every one of us can easily incorporate into daily life to improve learning and memory that help at the same time in learning impairment by brain injury such as the modified Story Memory Technique69.",

              "On a mechanistic level, applying mnemonic strategies like the MOL, both by experts and nai\u0308ve users, leads to transient activation of visuospatial brain regions8 and in the long-term, even provokes reorganisation of the functional brain network as a whole78.",
              "In superior memorizers using the MOL, none of the brain areas that were activated during memorizing were specifically active during recall79.",

              "In that study, two IEGs, zif-268 and Arc, were measured and found to be up-regulated throughout consolidation-relevant midline regions of the neocortex at the time of memory encoding, broadly similar to the areas identified in earlier work at long time periods after learning (Frankland and Bontempi 2005).",
              "The magnitude of the increase for these IEGs was related to how readily the new information would later be expressed, that is, how easily it would be assimilated into the existing and activated knowledge structure if the full period of consolidation had been allowed to take place.",
              "These findings support the possibility, raised earlier (Lesburgueres et al.",
              "2011), that cortical tagging helps promote the neocortical consolidation process.",

              "What mechanisms are responsible for memory traces becoming consolidated during sleep?",
              "To initiate replay in the hippocampus, a slow oscillation starts in the prefrontal cortex, consisting of an alternation between states of generalized cortical excitation and depolarized membrane potentials (UP states) and generalized states of relative neuronal silence (DOWN states).",
              "This oscillation, as seen in intracranial recordings of patients being evaluated for epileptic surgery, travels across the brain to the medial temporal lobe (Nir et al.",
              "2011), where it is followed by sharp wave ripples in the hippocampus.",
              "During sharp wave ripples, 30% of hippocampal neurons increase their firing rate, and the replay of sequential firing of neurons that encode, for example, previous spatial experiences occurs in a temporally compressed form (Wilson and McNaughton 1994).",
              "Hippocampal replay was first observed in the rat when place cells were seen to fire during sleep in the same sequence as they fired on a linear track when the rat was actually running (Wilson and McNaughton 1994).",
              "Since then, many other interesting attributes of sharp wave ripples and replay have been reported.",
              "Replay occurs 7\u201310 times faster than the original experience (Euston et al.",
              "2007) and seems to be homeostatically regulated.",
              "The increased appearance of sharp wave ripples after their disruption is seen only after a significant learning period (Girardeau et al.",
              "2014).",
              "Further, the type of neural network being activated during replay, that is, the specific memory, can be recognized by the typical morphology of the ripple (Reichinnek et al.",
              "2010), and longer memories seem to be replayed across multiple sharp wave ripples (Davidson et al.",
              "2009).",
              "By recording neuronal firing patterns in the prefrontal cortex at choice points in a maze and during sleep, it has been shown that hippocampal replay during sleep (but not during the awake state) is directly communicated to the prefrontal cortex.",
              "As a result, there is simultaneous expression in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of learning-associated neural firing patterns (Peyrache et al.",
              "2009).",

              "Spindles may also play an additional but separate role in local cortical processing during sleep, which is independent of the hippocampal replay mechanism (Andrillon et al.",
              "2011).",
              "As discussed earlier, recent studies in humans have tried to increase the probability of replay during sleep by cueing recently learned memories via smell or sound associations (Rasch et al.",

              "Two studies illustrate the approach.",
              "In one study, optogenetic inhibition of the hippocampus was deployed to examine the interplay of the hippocampus and neocortex, emphasizing the opportunity that this technique offers for precise temporal intervention (Goshen et al.",
              "2011).",
              "Halorhodopsin-induced inhibition of area CA1 of the hippocampus reduced the frequency of cell firing and blocked the acquisition and retrieval of contextual fear conditioning.",
              "Brief optogenetic inhibition (for 5 min) of hippocampus consistently interfered with retrieval (after 28 days, 9 weeks, and 12 weeks).",
              "In contrast, more extended pharmacological and optogenetic inhibition spared remote memory, but impaired recent memory, revealing a temporal gradient (Fig.",
              "2E).",
              "Brief inhibition of CA1 resulted in a decreased c-fos expression at recall in both CA1 and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), whereas extended inhibition decreased expression in CA1, but increased expression in ACC.",
              "These results could mean that prolonged inhibition allows for compensatory activity to develop and that this compensatory activity supports remote memory performance.",
              "An alternative is that prolonged inhibition allows nonspecific effects of the inhibition to wear off and remote memory to be successfully expressed.",

              "2011;",
              "Tse et al.",
              "2011) suggests that, even if the hippocampus is normally engaged for a short period for \u201cbinding\u201d disparate cortical networks during memory encoding and the early stages of consolidation, a memory trace of some kind is rapidly formed in the cortex.",
              "The cortical trace in this case corresponds to the episodic memory-like trace that was formed during the initial experience and not to a gist-memory trace.",
              "This trace may ordinarily require co-occurrent activity in the hippocampus for behavioral expression during the consolidation period, but this involvement of the hippocampus might be mimicked optogenetically.",
              "That is, if the role of the hippocampus during the consolidation period is to engage cortical neurons selectively during the stabilization process, this function of the hippocampus might be achieved optogenetically by selectively activating those cortical neurons that are involved in the memory.",
              "A relevant step forward has used context fear conditioning and tet-TAG mice in which c-fos is used to drive the insertion of a channelrhodopsin-like protein into learning-activated cells (Cowensage et al.",

              "A subset of neurons in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) was tagged in this way during context fear conditioning.",
              "Subsequently, it was possible to activate just this subset of RSC cells optogenetically (despite diffuse light activation of all cells) because only those neurons were activated that had been firing at the time of cortical memory encoding and had, therefore, expressed c-fos.",
              "The mice showed elevated freezing in response to the light, an observation made even more secure through the use of a context discrimination procedure (reminiscent of Wiltgen\u2019s work cited earlier).",

              "Yet, quantitative studies of retrograde amnesia began only in the 1970s, and the idea that consolidation involves a dialogue between the hippocampus and neocortex is even more recent.",
              "Information is stored initially in both the hippocampus and neocortex, and the hippocampus then guides a gradual process of reorganization and stabilization whereby information in the neocortex eventually becomes independent of the hippocampus.",

              "The identification of mechanisms necessary for memory consolidation and reconsolidation, the processes by which the post-training and post-retrieval fragile memory traces become stronger and insensitive to disruption, has indicated new approaches for investigating and treating psychopathologies.",
              "In this review, we will discuss some key biological mechanisms found to be critical for memory consolidation and strengthening, the role/s and mechanisms of memory reconsolidation, and how the interference with consolidation and/or reconsolidation can modulate the retention and/or storage of memories that are linked to psychopathologies.",
              "Memory, the ability to retain information and recall it at later time, is a biologically fundamental function essential for survival.",
              "Furthermore, memories shape our identity: we are who we are because of our memories, which guide our thoughts and decisions, and influence our emotional reactions.",
              "Memories exist in different forms and rely on distinct neural systems. On the basis of their duration, memories can be classified into short- and long-term.",
              "While short-term memory (STM) is the ability to hold and recall information for a short period of time, usually for a few seconds, long-term memories (LTM) store information for long-lasting periods, sometimes for an entire lifetime.",
              "STMs and LTMs can also be distinguishednct on the basis of their biological mechanisms: while the former rely on existing networks and post-translational modifications, the latter is accompanied by structural and functional changes of neural networks that require de novo gene expression [1-6].",
              "Memories can also be classified according to their behavioral manifestation, which reflect the use of distinct underlying networks, or memory systems. For example, a major distinction is between explicit (e.",
              "g. declarative) and implicit (e.",
              "g. procedural) memories [7, 8].",
              "Declarative memories are memories that can be consciously recalled such as those of facts, people and events, whereas procedural memories are those that store information about skills, for example, driving a car, riding a bike or playing piano.",
              "While declarative memories are known to critically engage the medial temporal lobe, and particularly the hippocampus, procedural memories critically recruit the cerebellum.",
              "Despite this distinctions, memories are often complex and made from experiences that involve multiple memory systems interacting with each other.",
              "In the last two decades, one of the main interests of neuroscientists has been the identification of the biological mechanisms that underlie the formation and storage of memories.",
              "Studies in invertebrate systems like Aplysia californica and Drosophila melanogaster have paved the way to the molecular and cellular discoveries in vertebrate, and particularly in mammalian systems. Most studies have investigated temporal lobe-dependent memories.",
              "From genetic, molecular, electrophysiological and anatomical investigations it has emerged that molecular modifications at all levels, post-translational, translational and transcriptional, play a critical role in long-term memory formation.",
              "These changes include both general mechanisms of long-term plasticity, which occur in many brain regions and with all paradigms involving long-lasting changes, as well as selective mechanisms, which are found in specific brain regions and cell populations [9-12].",
              "One general feature of long-term memory formation across memory systems and species is that a newly encoded memory initially exists in a fragile state and can be disrupted very easily by several types of interferences, from pharmacological, to molecular to behavioral.",
              "With time, the memory becomes stronger and resilient to disruption.",
              "This process of strengthening and stabilization is known as memory consolidation [2, 5, 6, 13, 14].",
              "Once consolidated, hence insensitive to interferences, memory was believed to be \u201cfixated\u201d and stored.",
              "However, studies that have been particularly revived in the last 15 years have shown that a memory that has become insensitive to molecular interferences can again become labile if it is reactivated, for example by retrievals.",
              "This post-retrieval fragility, like the one that occurs after acquisition, is temporally limited and the memory returns to a stable state through a process known as reconsolidation [15-18].",
              "Both consolidation and reconsolidation are phases during which memory is vulnerable to interference and during which a strengthening or weakening of the memory trace can be achieved.",
              "This understanding -and more to come- is extremely important for potential clinical applications: in principle, according to the consolidation and reconsolidation mechanisms, it is possible to strengthen weak memories or memories that are easily lost, or conversely, weaken memories that are too strong and linked to psychopathologies, like those for example associated to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety or substance abuse [17, 19-21].",
              "Memory consolidation initiates with a gene expression-dependent phase that lasts for several hours or days.",
              "This process, known as cellular or molecular consolidation [4, 22] represents the initial, highly fragile phase of memory storage.",
              "However, several types of memories that rely on the hippocampus are not fully processed and stable after this initial phase: although considered consolidated according to molecular interferences, these memories are still undergoing a great deal of processing that culminates with a network rearrangement that is accompanied by a decline in the critical role of the hippocampus.",
              "If the hippocampus is inactivated or lesioned during this phase, the memories are lost.",
              "This process lasts for weeks in animals and up to years in humans and it is known as system consolidation [10, 23].",
              "We have studied the mechanisms of the consolidation phases by using rats trained in the inhibitory avoidance task (IA).",
              "IA is a fear conditioning-based task, in which the animal encounters an aversive experience (foot shock) in a given context, hence learns to avoid it when represented with that context at later times.",
              "The advantage of this task is that it is learned in a single trial, thus allowing the identification of rapid changes occurring in the brain after encoding and the follow up of their progression over time.",
              "Focusing first on the dorsal hippocampus, a region required for the formation of contextual associations, we have found that, in this region, the activation of the pathways mediated by the transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein \u03b2 and \u03b4 (C/EBP\u03b2 and \u03b4) are required for IA memory consolidation [5, 24-26].",
              "Several studies, including ours, have led to the conclusion that the CREB-C/EBP is an evolutionarily conserved molecular pathway of long-term plasticity and memory formation, as it plays a necessary role in these processes in various learning paradigms and species ranging from invertebrates to mammals [5, 27].",
              "The understanding of upstream and downstream mechanisms of the activation of CREB-C/EBP cascade is important because it offers the identification of targets that can be used to develop strategies for strengthening or weakening memories [28, 29].",
              "Starting with the upstream regulation of CREB-C/EBP cascade, as it is well known that stress hormones modulate memory formation and retention, we tested the hypothesis that the learning-dependent activation of the CREB-C/EBP pathway might be regulated by stress.",
              "Emotionally charged or salient events are better remembered than emotionally neutral experiences, which in fact are often quickly forgotten.",
              "The emotion involved can be either positive (excitement and pleasure) or negative (pain, fear, trauma).",
              "Traumatic experiences, chronic stress and painful experiences are linked to the development and progression of psychopathologies like anxiety disorders, depression, PTSD and substance abuse [30-35].",
              "A large number of pharmacological and behavioral studies have shown that the level of stress follows an inverted U relationship with memory retention.",
              "Increasing levels of stress are required to form long-lasting memories that are proportionally stronger and more persistent.",
              "However, when stress becomes too intense or is chronic, memory can be impaired.",
              "Accordingly, it has been found that the levels of the stress hormones noradrenaline and glucocorticoids, which are released in response to stress, mediate and modulate memory retention according to an inverted U-shape curve [36-38].",
              "Notably, the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects have remained elusive, until recently.",
              "Recent studies, including those from our laboratory, have investigated the mechanisms activated downstream of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and implicated in long-term memory formation.",
              "It emerged that after learning GRs regulate several intracellular signaling pathways known to be required for memory consolidation.",
              "These include the pathways activated by CREB, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [39-41].",
              "In addition, GRs control epigenetic modifications that influence long-term memory retention (see Figure 1) [42-44].",
              "Activated GRs rapidly enhance the translation of Arc and may influence trafficking of TrkB to the membrane surface and/or BDNF release.",
              "BDNF binding to its receptor TrkB leads to its phosphorylation, which results in the activation of ERK1/2, Akt and PLC\u03b3.",
              "In parallel, activated GRs, via transcription-dependent mechanisms, also rapidly lead to CaMKII\u03b1 phosphorylation.",
              "The activation of ERK1/2, Akt, PLC\u03b3, and CaMKII\u03b1 pathways independently or in concert can converge in CREB phosphorylation, which leads to the synthesis of BDNF.",
              "The newly synthesized BDNF sustains the activation of the pathways and results in persistent phosphorylation of CREB, CaMKII\u03b1, and a downstream pre-synaptic target of CaMKII\u03b1, phosopho-synapsin-1.",
              "Thus, GR activation recruits pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms to mediate memory consolidation [41].",

              "In our studies with rat IA, we found that, in the dorsal hippocampus, GRs control the rapid learning-dependent increase of CREB phosphorylation and the expression of the immediate early gene activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), as well as the increase in synaptic phospho-CaMKII\u03b1, phospho-synapsin-1, and AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 expression.",
              "We also found that inhibition of GRs in rat hippocampus significantly reduces the phosphorylation of the tropomysosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase B (Akt) and phospholipase C \u03b3 (PLC\u03b3).",
              "Because these pathways are all canonical activation pathways downstream of BDNF, we concluded that the BDNF-dependent pathway is a key downstream effector of GR activation during memory consolidation (see Figure 1) [41].",
              "In agreement with this conclusion, we found that intrahippocampal injections of BDNF, but not of other neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), rescue both the molecular impairments and the amnesia caused by GR inhibition.",
              "The effect is selective for GRs because BDNF does not rescue behavioral deficits caused by the inhibition of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, underscoring the critical and specific role of the BDNF-mediated signaling pathway in the GR-dependent molecular activations required for memory consolidation [41].",
              "Hence, we proposed a model that explains, at least in part, the nature of the biological mechanisms involved in the formation of long-term memories elicited by stressful or arousing experiences: we suggested that evolution has selected mechanisms of growth and pro-survival in response to stress as the fundamental molecular pathways activated by learning and recruited in brain cells to form long-term memories [45].",
              "Although the activation of the GR/BDNF pathway is critical for proper memory consolidation in conditions of stress levels that are within normal ranges (beneficial stress levels), prolonged or extensive stress and abnormal levels of glucocorticoids can negatively regulate the BDNF response and memory processes [46-48].",
              "Various psychiatric disorders that are associated with declarative memory impairments, in particular major depression disorder, have been linked to altered functioning of the hypothalamic-pitutary-adrenal (HPA) axis [49].",
              "A significant number of depressed patients have increased levels of cortisol in the saliva and plasma, as a result of an increased activity of the pituitary and adrenal glands, due to reduced GR-mediated feedback inhibition by endogenous glucocorticoids, which are though to be related to functional and expression changes in the GR [50].",
              "Indeed, reduced levels of GR have been found post mortem in the brain of depressed suicide patients and antidepressant treatment not only ameliorates cognitive functions, but also increases GR and BDNF expression, as well as GR-mediated feedback inhibition in both laboratory animals and humans [51-55].",
              "Thus, our results and working model together with clinical evidence, agree with the idea that the convergence between GR and BDNF pathways may be an important node of dysfunction in stress-related cognitive impairments and affective disorders.",
              "For a long time, memory consolidation was seen as a unitary process that transforms a fragile memory trace into a stable one, once and for all.",
              "However, studies done in the 1960s and then re-exploded in the last 15 years have demonstrated that memories that have become insensitive to disruption by certain types of interferences, become again transiently labile if they are recalled.",
              "Because the recalled memory must again be stabilized, this post-retrieval process has been termed memory reconsolidation [18, 56].",
              "In the last decade, several questions have been asked about memory reconsolidation.",
              "First, is reconsolidation a mere repetition of the consolidation process?",
              "The results of several studies suggest that consolidation is distinct from reconsolidation because it engages distinct brain circuits, hence perhaps mechanisms, although, in the engaged regions, molecular mechanisms of long-term plasticity appear to be common denominators [13, 57].",
              "Second, does reconsolidation occur every time a memory is recalled and/or a trace is reactivated?",
              "The answer to this question is still controversial.",
              "With IA, contextual fear conditioning and drug-induced memories, in rodents as well as other types of fear memories in fish, the passage of time is a key limiting factor for the post-retrieval vulnerability of memory.",
              "In fact, upon reactivation, a young memory is more fragile and easily disrupted than an old one indicating that over time memory becomes increasingly stable and in some cases insensitive to post-reactivation interference [19, 58-61].",
              "In our rat IA paradigm, systemic injection of protein synthesis inhibitors after reactivation produces a decrementally graded amnesia in 2-day- and 1-week-old memories, but when the same treatment is performed on memories two and four weeks old, the amnestic effect is no longer observed [25, 58].",
              "However, auditory fear conditioning, a cue-association seems to remain sensitive to disruption following memory reactivation for at least 45 days [62], suggesting that different types of memory have different sensitivity to post-reactivation interference [15, 63].",
              "A third and important question asked about memory reconsolidation is: what is its function?",
              "Why does memory become labile after retrieval or reactivation?",
              "Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain the functional role of reconsolidation.",
              "The first suggests that reconsolidation strengthens the memories;",
              "in other words, the phase of temporary fragility mediates additional consolidation and therefore produces a stronger and longer lasting memory.",
              "The second hypothesis posits that reconsolidation allows the association of new information into memories of past events, in order to integrate new learning with already established and reactivated memories.",
              "We tested both hypotheses with rat IA and found that reconsolidation strengthens memory but does not mediate memory updating, when updating is creating new associations to a reactivated memory.",
              "Specifically, we found that the reconsolidation of the original memory takes place independently from the formation of the new association, as the two can be doubly dissociated [64].",
              "We concluded that, although the old memory needs to be retrieved in order to make new associations, its reconsolidation process is not engaged in establishing the link between the new information and the reactivated memory, but rather this new association is processed as a new memory [64].",
              "In contrast, several studies argue that reconsolidation is a mechanism of memory updating [65-69].",
              "We only partially agree with this conclusion and propose that reconsolidation updates the memory when the update is adding information to the same trace (e.",
              "g. strengthening).",
              "However, we disagree with the interpretation that the updating due to adding distinct information (novelty) to a trace is mediated by reconsolidation.",
              "The studies arguing in favor of this conclusion do not actually prove that reconsolidation mediates that updating;",
              "they show that interference given after the presentation of novel information disrupts the old memory.",
              "However, because both consolidation of a new trace and reconsolidation of a reactivated one are sensitive to similar interference, both processes can be actually disrupted, making the conclusion about a selective role of reconsolidation debatable.",
              "Based on our studies, we speculate that the reconsolidation of medial temporal lobe-dependent memories strengthens or further consolidates the original memory without changing its content [57].",
              "Why is this understanding important?",
              "Because it provides critical knowledge for formulating hypotheses about memory processing in both physiological and pathological conditions, as well as designing clinical studies based on the fragility of memory traces.",
              "The studies of the last 20 years show that the process of memory formation and storage is very dynamic and that the storage of information continuously changes through processes of consolidation, reconsolidation and updating.",
              "The knowledge of biological mechanisms underlying these processes is important for developing novel specific treatments for mental disorders and cognitive impairments.",
              "For example, for persistent and intrusive memories like those associated to PTSD, it may be possible to target the mechanisms of consolidation and block or reduce the formation or persistence of a very intense memory.",
              "Even more easily targeted would be the mechanisms of reconsolidation, as memory retrieval can be controlled.",
              "Thus, using a combination of behavioral or psychotherapeutical approaches combined with pharmacology it might be possible to weaken traumatic memories.",
              "Furthermore, the mechanisms of the reconsolidation and consolidation may offer an opportunity to re-store the memory with a different emotional valence and intensity.",
              "Based on the current knowledge of consolidation and reconsolidation, we suggest that an ideal therapeutical approach to psychopathology may be one that modulate only certain components of the memory trace, such as stress, fear and emotions in general, but spares the semantic representation.",
              "More studies are needed in models of traumatic memories for understanding whether this is possible.",
              "Using the IA in rats, we have tested whether blocking the mechanisms of stress, and specifically GRs, which mediate and modulate memory consolidation and reconsolidation, reduce fear memory.",
              "We reasoned that when a traumatic experience is recalled, a stress response is initiated, which, as shown by our studies described above, activates the cascade of gene expression mediating memory consolidation and strengthening.",
              "Thus, we tested whether blocking the action of GRs could prevent reconsolidation and memory strengthening.",
              "The GR antagonist mifepristone (RU38486) administered after the recall of IA either directly into the amygdala [63], or systemically [70], significantly weakened the original memory.",
              "With systemic administration, we also found that one or two treatments were sufficient to achieve maximal disruption of the fear memory, and that the effect selectively targeted the recalled memory without interfering with other unrecalled memories [70].",
              "To examine whether the efficacy of treatment changes with the intensity of a traumatic experience, we tested the effects of mifepristone on memories evoked by different foot shocks intensities.",
              "We found that, while less intense fear memories (low foot shock intensities) could be easily weakened, strongly traumatic memories (high foot shock intensities) were less susceptible to disruption by post-reactivation mifepristone treatment.",
              "However, these traumatic memories could be weakened by a double mifepristone treatment administered after memory reactivation evoked a week after training [70].",
              "These data suggest that the effect of a reconsolidation-based treatment on traumatic memories is best achieved by a delayed intervention rather than one given immediately after the trauma [70].",
              "However, the intervention should not be delayed after the system consolidation temporal window, as memory would then be more resistant to disruption because they are more consolidated.",
              "A recent pilot study in male veterans with PTSD is in agreement with our IA model data, and reports that mifepristone may have a beneficial effect in PTSD remission [71].",
              "A wide body of animal and human studies have also examined the effect of glucocorticoids on memory retention, and have indicated that they exert opposite effects in different memory phases and processes, e.",
              "g. typically facilitating memory consolidation and reconsolidation processes, but impairing memory retrieval [31, 38, 72, 73].",
              "Since in PTSD traumatic memories are distressing and continuously retrieved, studies have tried to block memory retrieval in patients with PTSD by daily administration of cortisol over a one-month period [74].",
              "Interestingly, it was reported a significant within subject treatment effect in both the intensity of feeling of reliving the traumatic event, as well as in the intensity of physiological distress [74].",
              "Moreover, acute cortisol treatments were also successful in enhancing extinction-based psychotherapies in patients with phobias [75, 76].",
              "In light of all these results, the stress hormone cortisol and its receptors appear to be a promising target for pharmacologic intervention in trauma-related pathologies, including PTSD and phobias.",
              "In the last decade mounting evidence shows that the endocannabinoid system plays an important role in modulating consolidation and reconsolidation of emotionally aversive memories through a combined action of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) and glucocorticoids [77-79].",
              "Specifically, it has been hypothesized that stress-induced glucocorticoid release results in a rapid the synthesis of endocannabinoids in the amygdala, which in turn suppress GABAergic/inhibitory input of noradrenergic neurons, resulting in an enhancement of noradrenergic activation and thus consolidation of emotionally aversive memories [77, 80].",
              "Notably, injection of rats with the CB1R agonists into the amygdala enhanced the consolidation of conditioned fear, whereas CB1R antagonist impaired fear memory formation.",
              "These effects on fear conditioning are not restricted to the amygdala, but also involve pathways between the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex [81-85].",
              "Moreover, activation of CB1R via systemic or intra-hippocampal administration of either CB1R agonists or endocanabinoid reuptake blockers has been shown to facilitate fear extinction in rodents and fear extinction memory recall in humans [86-91].",
              "These studies indicate that the endocanabinoid system may represent a key modulator of environmental and stress influences on memory processes and should be explored as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric illness involving memory dysfunctions, including mood and anxiety disorders [92-94].",
              "It is clear that a better knowledge of the consolidation and reconsolidation mechanisms of fear memories is critical for better understanding how to approach fear- and trauma-induced pathologies.",
              "However, it is important to keep in mind that it should be understood why only a fraction of people who experience trauma develop PTSD, and why this disorder surfaces over time following trauma.",
              "Are the storage mechanisms for recurrent, intrusive memories that affect PTSD patients different from the storage mechanisms of traumatic memories in people who don't develop the disorder?",
              "If targeting memory reconsolidation will not be sufficiently efficacious in ameliorating the symptoms of PTSD, an alternative approach would be to target reconsolidation to actually prevent the onset of trauma-induced pathologies.",
              "Weakening the intensity of traumatic memories during the first few weeks or months of their consolidation phase may be effective in impeding the development of PTSD or other disorders, including substance abuse, anxiety and depression.",
              "Another interesting approach that targets reconsolidation and is entirely based on behavioral paradigms using a sequential retrieval (reconsolidation) and extinction protocols has been proven effective in both animal models and humans [95, 96].",
              "Interestingly, extinction after fear memory reactivation leads to a permanent loss of the fear expression, if the extinction is conducted within reconsolidation's temporal window [95-98].",
              "This approach has recently been successfully applied to reduce craving in drug addicts [99].",
              "Given the high impact of such a therapy in treating several psychopathologies, it would be important to determine its effects in remote pathological memories.",
              "A severe psychiatric disease with alterations of the hippocampus and temporal lobe is schizophrenia, which also exhibits deficits in long-term memory as revealed by verbal learning and memory tests.",
              "Schizophrenia is a complex heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder, whose core symptoms include, in addition to deficits in declarative long-term memory, distorted perceptions of reality, social avoidance and deficits in executive functions, [100-102].",
              "The memory deficits are believed to be mainly due to altered brain connectivity in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex [102, 103].",
              "Although a dysregulation of the BDNF pathways during brain development has been proposed to mediate these structural alterations, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this dysconnectivity remains largely unknown [104-107].",
              "One important question that recurs in the literature of mood and anxiety disorders is the role of the history of traumatic experiences, particularly those occurring during early development.",
              "Compelling evidence from a variety of studies in humans and animals suggests that traumatic experiences during early development predispose individuals to multiple forms of psychopathologies, including depression, PTSD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), schizophrenia and substance abuse [108-114].",
              "Part of the explanation for the enhanced impact of adversity in early life is thought to lie in the relatively high degree of plasticity during this period, when environmental factor exert pervasive effects on a number of brain health trajectories [109, 115].",
              "Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the persistent changes in gene regulation via epigenetic mechanisms (specifically those involved in neural systems mediating the response to stress [116-118]), relatively little is known about the neural substrates that mediate memory consolidation processes during early development.",
              "Although memories formed during the first few years of life are usually short-lived and become inaccessible after a relatively short time frame [119-122], considerable clinical evidence suggest that young children retain some forms of internal representation of their trauma for month and even years and demonstrate trauma-specific behavioral reenactments, affective responses to traumatic triggers, as well as sensory and somatic symptoms [123-130].",
              "The understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these pathologies is therefore greatly needed.",

              "In the book Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning, authors Henry Roediger and Mark McDaniel, cognitive scientists specializing in the study of learning and memory, together with novelist Peter Brown, tell engaging stories of how people learn in a way that allows them to successfully apply their knowledge and skills.",
              "At the same time, they aptly introduce the scientific evidence for highly-effective learning strategies.",
              "Throughout the book, the authors describe how some commonly-used study strategies are unproductive in the long term and suggest alternative, research-based learning strategies.",
              "For example, the student described above used massed practice to cram for an exam by rereading the text soon after the first reading.",
              "This gives one the impression of mastery of a subject because the text becomes familiar.",
              "In contrast, research indicates that this study method involves short-term memory rather than deep learning.",
              "A more beneficial study strategy that is supported by research is retrieval practice, which involves recalling information from memory.",
              "To implement this strategy, while reading a text, a student should describe main ideas in his own words, frequently ask questions about what was just read, self-quiz, and attempt to connect new ideas with what was learned previously.",
              "Although this recommended approach seems unproductive to the student because it is slower and requires more effort, retrieval practice that is spaced and interleaved (mixed with other topics) involves some forgetting, and the increased cognitive effort required to re-learn leads to higher levels of conceptual learning and application.",
              "Teachers can promote retrieval practice by asking questions during class and by implementing frequent announced quizzes.",
              "Moreover, if the quizzes are cumulative and include corrective feedback, students will be motivated to continually retrieve previous course concepts, helping with memory.",
              "In addition to intertwining personal stories with relevant research on memory and learning, the authors provide a brief \u201ctakeaway\u201d section of key ideas at the conclusion of each chapter as well as notes about the empirical research and references for further reading at the end of the book.",
              "The final chapter includes descriptions of instructors who find improvements in student learning from implementing the evidence-based learning strategies in the book, as well as a useful summary of learning tips for students, life-long learners (all of us), teachers, and trainers.",
              "For example, the authors recommend that teachers explain to students how people learn, teach students how to study, use frequent announced low-stakes quizzes and practice exercises that include both new and previously covered concepts, and include opportunities for reflection.",
              "In addition to clear benefits to the students, these strategies benefit the teacher as students display improved attendance, better class preparation, and improved attention during class.",
              "Furthermore, frequent quizzes provide valuable feedback on student performance for the teacher to adjust instruction.",
              "Make it Stick is an excellent book on learning and memory, and I recommend it for both teachers and students who want to better understand how learning occurs and how to study effectively.",

              "Very little is known about what downstream mechanisms cause this persistent memory enhancement, but due to the receptor requirement and the different temporal dynamics, it seems likely to hypothesize that it uses mechanisms distinct from those of insulin or glucose.",

              "A number of studies have shown increased BDNF mRNA or protein levels following memory enhancement treatments53, 93, 94.",
              "However, there seem to be no current evidence that BDNF itself can enhance memory in a non-diseased animal when given close to the time of training, as is the case with IGF-II.",

              "For example, BDNF injected into the dorsal rat hippocampus 12 hours after an IA training with a low footshock, which produces a memory that would normally be forgotten by 7 days, leads to memory persistence95.",
              "In disease models, BDNF may reverse memory deficits, making it an attractive candidate for selective enhancement of failing memories.",
              "In addition to pharmacological approaches, there are a number of behavioral manipulations that have been found to be effective in promoting memory enhancement.",
              "First, repetition has long been known to enhance memory performance, and it has been consistently shown that repeated training trials and/or learning events are associated with better memory96.",
              "This method is one that is employed during everyday learning, and is also known to have benefits for cognitive disorders such as dementia.",
              "Similarly, memory can be enhanced by targeting retrieval-induced reconsolidation, which occurs through repeated retrieval sessions.",
              "When a memory is retrieved, it can again return to a labile state and can undergo reconsolidation97.",
              "It has been suggested that a function of reconsolidation is to increase memory strength98.",
              "Recently in our laboratory it was found that, in IA, multiple memory reactivation by brief (10 sec) exposures to the context results in memory enhancement in rats through reconsolidation, whereas multiple retrievals consisting of a full testing session can result in fear extinction99.",
              "Notably memory changes over time, and in order to attain a memory enhancing effect, retrievals must occur within a relatively short time-span after training.",
              "Indeed the same multiple 10 second retrievals which had lead to enhancement if given during the first week after training, result in fear-extinction when given 4 weeks post-training, indicating that memory strengthening is a function of the age/stage of the memory and that likewise, memory storage is dynamic and changes over time.",
              "However, there is currently little knowledge about the mechanisms by which these changes occur, or whether the behavioral effect based on reconsolidation would be useful in aging and/or AD.",
              "Interestingly, the reconsolidation process does not promote memory enhancement by behavioral repetitions only.",
              "Memory enhancement can be in fact promoted via pharmacological manipulations given in concert with reconsolidation.",
              "Thus, injections of nicotine, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonists, PKA activators, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, angiotensin and IGF-II all enhance memory when injected after retrieval28, 100, 101.",
              "This suggests that memories can be enhanced even after they are consolidated, and indicates potential new directions for developing treatments for cognitive disorders that targets in addition to deficits of encoding/consolidation also deficits of already formed memories.",
              "Another behavioral approach that has been recently found to be effective in enhancing memories is physical exercise.",
              "Numerous studies over the past two decades in rodents have shown conclusively that exercise can improve memory in a number of tasks, including the spatial task water maze, the fear task IA and the non-aversive task novel object recognition.",
              "This effect may be more pronounced in aged rats, and has numerous possible underlying mechanisms, including increase of the neurotrophin brain derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF), neurogenesis, IGF-I, glucocorticoids, and CAMKII activation94, suggesting once again that mechanisms involved in memory consolidation may be the best targets to achieve memory enhancement or prevent memory decay.",
              "Though it is generally accepted that exercise is beneficial in regards to general health, extended lifespan and aging, the extent and type of exercise needed in humans to attain a benefit specifically for memory enhancement is not yet mechanistically well understood, and excessive forms of exercise may actually be deleterious for declarative, hippocampal-dependent memories by causing extreme stress, as noted above71.",
              "Behavioral methods for enhancing memory are an exciting avenue of research, and may be extremely useful in clinical practice with more basic knowledge of how best to implement their practice, as well as whether they can be even further augmented through pharmacological means, as with reconsolidation-mediated enhancement.",
