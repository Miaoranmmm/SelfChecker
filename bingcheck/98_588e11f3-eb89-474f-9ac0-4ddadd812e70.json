    "response": "Sure, I can tell you a brief story behind the discovery of penicillin and how it revolutionized medicine. Penicillin is a type of antibiotic derived from the mould Penicillium. Antibiotics are substances that can kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms. Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist **Alexander Fleming** as a crude extract of P. rubens[^1^]. He noticed that a mould contamination on a bacterial culture plate had prevented the growth of bacteria around it. He named the antibacterial substance penicillin and published his findings in 1929[^2^]. However, he was unable to isolate and purify penicillin at that time.\n\nIn 1939, a team of scientists at the University of Oxford, led by **Howard Florey** and **Ernst Chain**, began working on penicillin. They developed methods for cultivating the mould, extracting, purifying and storing penicillin from it. They also tested its safety and effectiveness on animals and humans. They showed that penicillin could cure various bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia and syphilis[^2^].\n\nPenicillin revolutionized medicine because it was the first widely available and effective treatment for many life-threatening infections. It saved millions of lives during World War II and afterwards. It also stimulated the development of other antibiotics and the field of microbiology[^5^]. Penicillin is still used today for some infections, but many bacteria have become resistant to it over time. Therefore, new antibiotics and strategies are needed to combat bacterial diseases[^2^].",

              "The several kinds of penicillin synthesized by various species of the mold Penicillium may be divided into two classes: the naturally occurring penicillins (those formed during the process of mold fermentation) and the semisynthetic penicillins (those in which the structure of a chemical substance\u20146-aminopenicillanic acid\u2014found in all penicillins is altered in various ways).",

              "[41] This difference makes methicillin resistant to the activity of \u03b2-lactamase, an enzyme by which many bacteria are naturally unsusceptible to penicillins.",
              "[44] Penicillin can easily enter bacterial cells in the case of Gram-positive species.",
              "This is because Gram-positive bacteria do not have an outer cell membrane and are simply enclosed in a thick cell wall.",
              "[45] Penicillin molecules are small enough to pass through the spaces of glycoproteins in the cell wall.",
              "For this reason Gram-positive bacteria are very susceptible to penicillin (as first evidenced by the discovery of penicillin in 1928[46]).",
              "[47] Penicillin, or any other molecule, enters Gram-negative bacteria in a different manner.",
              "The bacteria have thinner cell walls but the external surface is coated with an additional cell membrane, called the outer membrane.",
              "The outer membrane is a lipid layer (lipopolysaccharide chain) that blocks passage of water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules like penicillin.",
              "It thus acts as the first line of defence against any toxic substance, which is the reason for relative resistance to antibiotics compared to Gram-positive species[48] But penicillin can still enter Gram-negative species by diffusing through aqueous channels called porins (outer membrane proteins), which are dispersed among the fatty molecules and can transport nutrients and antibiotics into the bacteria.",
              "[49] Porins are large enough to allow diffusion of most penicillins, but the rate of diffusion through them is determined by the specific size of the drug molecules.",
              "For instance, penicillin G is large and enters through porins slowly;",
              "while smaller ampicillin and amoxicillin diffuse much faster.",
              "[50] In contrast, large vancomycin can not pass through porins and is thus ineffective for Gram-negative bacteria.",
              "[51] The size and number of porins are different in different bacteria.",
              "As a result of the two factors\u2014size of penicillin and porin\u2014Gram-negative bacteria can be unsusceptible or have varying degree of susceptibility to specific penicillin.",
              "[52] The chemical structure of penicillin is triggered with a very precise, pH-dependent directed mechanism, affected by a unique spatial assembly of molecular components, which can activate by protonation.",
              "It can travel through bodily fluids, targeting and inactivating enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis in gram-positive bacteria, meanwhile avoiding the surrounding non-targets.",
              "Penicillin can protect itself from spontaneous hydrolysis in the body in its anionic form while storing its potential as a strong acylating agent, activated only upon approach to the target transpeptidase enzyme and protonated in the active centre.",
              "This targeted protonation neutralizes the carboxylic acid moiety, which is weakening of the \u03b2-lactam ring N\u2013C(=O) bond, resulting in a self-activation.",
              "Specific structural requirements are equated to constructing the perfect mousetrap for catching targeted prey.",
              "[54] Penicillin kills bacteria by inhibiting the completion of the synthesis of peptidoglycans, the structural component of bacterial cell wall.",
              "It specifically inhibits the activity of enzymes that are needed for the cross-linking of peptidoglycans during the final step in cell wall biosynthesis.",
              "It does this by binding to penicillin binding proteins with the \u03b2-lactam ring, a structure found on penicillin molecules.",
              "[55][56] This causes the cell wall to weaken due to fewer cross-links and means water uncontrollably flows into the cell because it cannot maintain the correct osmotic gradient.",
              "This results in cell lysis and death.",
              "Bacteria constantly remodel their peptidoglycan cell walls, simultaneously building and breaking down portions of the cell wall as they grow and divide.",
              "During the last stages of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, uridine diphosphate-N-acetylmuramic acid pentapeptide (UDP-MurNAc) is formed in which the fourth and fifth amino acids are both D-alanyl-D-alanine.",
              "The transfer of D-alanine is done (catalysed) by the enzyme DD-transpeptidase (penicillin-binding proteins are such type).",
              "[50] The structural integrity of bacterial cell wall depends on the cross linking of UDP-MurNAc and N-acetyl glucosamine.",
              "[57] Penicillin and other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics act as an analogue of D-alanine-D-alanine (the dipeptide) in UDP-MurNAc owing to conformational similarities.",
              "The DD-transpeptidase then binds the four-membered \u03b2-lactam ring of penicillin instead of UDP-MurNAc.",
              "[50] As a consequence, DD-transpeptidase is inactivated, the formation of cross-links between UDP-MurNAc and N-acetyl glucosamine is blocked so that an imbalance between cell wall production and degradation develops, causing the cell to rapidly die.",
              "[58] The enzymes that hydrolyze the peptidoglycan cross-links continue to function, even while those that form such cross-links do not.",
              "This weakens the cell wall of the bacterium, and osmotic pressure becomes increasingly uncompensated\u2014eventually causing cell death (cytolysis).",
              "In addition, the build-up of peptidoglycan precursors triggers the activation of bacterial cell wall hydrolases and autolysins, which further digest the cell wall's peptidoglycans.",
              "The small size of the penicillins increases their potency, by allowing them to penetrate the entire depth of the cell wall.",
              "This is in contrast to the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin, which are both much larger than the penicillins.",
              "[59] Gram-positive bacteria are called protoplasts when they lose their cell walls.",
              "Gram-negative bacteria do not lose their cell walls completely and are called spheroplasts after treatment with penicillin.",
              "[53] Penicillin shows a synergistic effect with aminoglycosides, since the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis allows aminoglycosides to penetrate the bacterial cell wall more easily, allowing their disruption of bacterial protein synthesis within the cell.",
              "This results in a lowered MBC for susceptible organisms.[60] Penicillins, like other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, block not only the division of bacteria, including cyanobacteria, but also the division of cyanelles, the photosynthetic organelles of the glaucophytes, and the division of chloroplasts of bryophytes.",
              "In contrast, they have no effect on the plastids of the highly developed vascular plants.",
              "This supports the endosymbiotic theory of the evolution of plastid division in land plants.",

              "With the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, Florey and his colleague Norman Heatley traveled to the United States in the summer of 1941 to see if they could interest the American pharmaceutical industry in the effort to produce penicillin on a large scale.",

              "Back to top Orville May, Director of the NRRL, agreed to have the Laboratory undertake a vigorous program to increase penicillin yields under the direction of Robert Coghill, Chief of the Fermentation Division.",
              "It was agreed that Heatley would remain in Peoria to share his expertise with his American colleagues.",
              "Within a few weeks, Andrew Moyer found that he could significantly increase the yield of penicillin by substituting lactose for the sucrose used by the Oxford team in their culture medium.",
              "Shortly thereafter, Moyer made the even more important discovery that the addition of corn-steep liquor to the fermentation medium produced a ten-fold increase in yield.",
              "Corn-steep liquor was a by-product of the corn wetmilling process, and the NRRL, in an attempt to find a use for it, tried it in essentially all of its fermentation work.",
              "Later, the Peoria laboratory increased the yield of penicillin still further by the addition of penicillin precursors, such as phenylacetic acid, to the fermentation medium.",
              "It was recognized that the Oxford group's method of growing the mold on the surface of a nutrient medium was inefficient, and that growth in submerged culture would be a superior process.",
              "In submerged culture fermentation, the mold is grown in large tanks in a constantly agitated and aerated mixture, rather than just on the surface of the medium.",
              "Florey's Penicillium culture, however, produced only traces of penicillin when grown in submerged culture.",
              "Under the direction of Kenneth Raper, staff at the NRRL screened various Penicillium strains and found one that produced acceptable yields of penicillin in submerged culture.",
              "Soon a global search was underway for better penicillin producing strains, with soil samples being sent to the NRRL from around the world.",

              "He eventually received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945.",
              "As far back as the 19th century, antagonism between certain bacteria and molds had been observed, and a name was given to this phenomenon\u2014antibiosis\u2014but little was made of these observations.",

              "It was left to his fellow Nobelists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, to demonstrate in 1940 that penicillin could be used as a therapeutic agent to fight a large number of bacterial diseases.",
              "Born in Lochfield, Ayrshire, Scotland, Fleming was the seventh of eight surviving children in a farm family.",
              "His father died when he was seven years old, leaving his mother to manage the farm with her eldest stepson.",

              "There he began research that produced results more in keeping with Wright\u2019s thinking.",
              "He was able to demonstrate that then commonly used chemical antiseptics like carbolic acid do not sterilize jagged wounds;",
              "rather, pus has its own antibacterial powers.",
              "Using cells on a slide, he was able to show that chemical antiseptics in dilutions harmless to bacteria actually damage white blood corpuscles (leukocytes)\u2014the body\u2019s first line of defense.",
              "After World War I, Fleming continued to work on leukocytes and antisepsis.",
              "In 1921 he discovered a substance in nasal mucus that causes bacteria to disintegrate.",
              "Fleming and a colleague subsequently detected this substance, which he named lysozyme, in human blood serum, tears, saliva, milk, and a wide variety of other fluids.",
              "In its natural state lysozyme seemed to be more effective against harmless airborne bacteria than against disease-causing bacteria.",
              "And attempts to concentrate it, thereby strengthening its antiseptic properties, proved unsuccessful.",
              "Fleming\u2019s legendary discovery of penicillin occurred in 1928, while he was investigating staphylococcus, a common type of bacteria that causes boils and can also cause disastrous infections in patients with weakened immune systems. Before Fleming left for a two-week vacation, a petri dish containing a staphylococcus culture was left on a lab bench and never placed in the incubator as intended.",
              "Somehow, in preparing the culture, a Penicillium mold spore had been accidentally introduced into the medium\u2014perhaps coming in through a window, or more likely floating up a stairwell from the lab below where various molds were being cultured.",
              "The temperature conditions that prevailed during Fleming\u2019s absence permitted both the bacteria and the mold spores to grow;",

              "Fleming\u2019s laboratory notebooks are sketchy, and his subsequent accounts of the discovery are contradictory.",
              "The evidence of the first culture, which he photographed, indicated that he observed lysis, the weakening and destruction of bacteria\u2014as in his lysozyme studies.",
              "But sometimes he described the key observation as an instance of inhibition or prevention of bacterial growth in areas affected by the mold \u201cjuice,\u201d evidenced by a clear zone surrounding the mold.",
              "Although these two effects occur under quite different conditions, Fleming probably forgot which observation came first, for in the months subsequent to the original observation he conducted many experiments while varying conditions systematically.",
              "He discovered that the antibacterial substance was not produced by all molds, only by certain strains of Penicillium, namely, Penicillium notatum.",
              "Although he could not isolate it, he named the active substance \u201cpenicillin.",
              "\u201d He studied methods of producing the impure product and determined its stability at different temperatures and over various lengths of time.",
              "He investigated its effect on many microbes, curiously omitting the familiar spirochete that causes syphilis (which Salvarsan controlled but did not eliminate).",
              "He tested its toxicity on a laboratory mouse and a rabbit.",
              "Forever after, it has been a puzzle why he did not inject these or other laboratory animals with staphylococcus or other disease-causing bacteria before injecting them with the fluid containing penicillin.",
              "Perhaps the explanation lay in his belief that cures come from within the body itself, rather than from an external agent.",
              "So he was not looking for a curative agent but rather focused on his new find as a topical antiseptic.",
              "In later years he claimed that the difficulties he had experienced in isolating and stabilizing penicillin, let alone the problems of producing sufficient quantities for clinical trials, had prevented him from realizing the full fruits of his research.",
              "In fact, in the 1930s, little notice was taken by the scientific community of his paper published in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology (June 1929).",

              "for a decade after, he focused instead on penicillin\u2019s potential use as a topical antiseptic for wounds and surface infections and as a means of isolating certain bacteria in laboratory cultures.",
              "It was left to his fellow Nobelists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, to demonstrate in 1940 that penicillin could be used as a therapeutic agent to fight a large number of bacterial diseases.",

              "Fleming\u2019s legendary discovery of penicillin occurred in 1928, while he was investigating staphylococcus, a common type of bacteria that causes boils and can also cause disastrous infections in patients with weakened immune systems. Before Fleming left for a two-week vacation, a petri dish containing a staphylococcus culture was left on a lab bench and never placed in the incubator as intended.",

              "What Fleming also predicted during his speech accepting the Nobel Prize in 1945 was that bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.",
              "This is just happening due to evolution, because bacteria can adapt very quickly to overcome any hurdle limiting their growth.",

              "Florey recognized that large-scale production of penicillin was probably out of the question in Britain, where the chemical industry was fully absorbed in the war effort.",
              "With the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, Florey and his colleague Norman Heatley traveled to the United States in the summer of 1941 to see if they could interest the American pharmaceutical industry in the effort to produce penicillin on a large scale.",
              "Yale physiologist John Fulton helped to put his British colleagues in touch with individuals who might be able to assist them in their goal.",
              "They were referred to Robert Thom of the Department of Agriculture, a foremost mycologist and authority on the Penicillium mold, and eventually to the Department's Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL) in Peoria, Illinois, because of the expertise of its Fermentation Division.",
              "This contact proved to be crucial to the success of the project, as the NRRL was a key contributor of innovations that made large-scale production of penicillin possible.",
              "Back to top Orville May, Director of the NRRL, agreed to have the Laboratory undertake a vigorous program to increase penicillin yields under the direction of Robert Coghill, Chief of the Fermentation Division.",
              "It was agreed that Heatley would remain in Peoria to share his expertise with his American colleagues.",
              "Within a few weeks, Andrew Moyer found that he could significantly increase the yield of penicillin by substituting lactose for the sucrose used by the Oxford team in their culture medium.",
              "Shortly thereafter, Moyer made the even more important discovery that the addition of corn-steep liquor to the fermentation medium produced a ten-fold increase in yield.",
              "Corn-steep liquor was a by-product of the corn wetmilling process, and the NRRL, in an attempt to find a use for it, tried it in essentially all of its fermentation work.",
              "Later, the Peoria laboratory increased the yield of penicillin still further by the addition of penicillin precursors, such as phenylacetic acid, to the fermentation medium.",
              "It was recognized that the Oxford group's method of growing the mold on the surface of a nutrient medium was inefficient, and that growth in submerged culture would be a superior process.",
              "In submerged culture fermentation, the mold is grown in large tanks in a constantly agitated and aerated mixture, rather than just on the surface of the medium.",
              "Florey's Penicillium culture, however, produced only traces of penicillin when grown in submerged culture.",
              "Under the direction of Kenneth Raper, staff at the NRRL screened various Penicillium strains and found one that produced acceptable yields of penicillin in submerged culture.",
              "Soon a global search was underway for better penicillin producing strains, with soil samples being sent to the NRRL from around the world.",
              "Ironically, the most productive strain came from a moldy cantaloupe from a Peoria fruit market.",
              "A more productive mutant of the so-called cantaloupe strain was produced with the use of X-rays at the Carnegie Institution.",
              "When this strain was exposed to ultraviolet radiation at the University of Wisconsin, its productivity was increased still further.",
              "Back to top While Norman Heatley remained in Peoria helping the NRRL staff to get the penicillin work started, Howard Florey visited various pharmaceutical companies to try to interest them in the drug.",
              "Although Florey was disappointed in the immediate results of his trip, three of the companies (Merck, Squibb and Lilly) had actually conducted some penicillin research before Florey's arrival and Pfizer seemed on the verge of investigating the drug as well.",
              "At this time, however, the promise of penicillin was still based on only limited clinical trials.",
              "Florey next visited his old friend Alfred Newton Richards, then vice president for medical affairs at the University of Pennsylvania.",
              "More importantly, Richards was chair of the Committee on Medical Research (CMR) of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD).",

              "He approached the four drug firms that Florey indicated had shown some interest in the drug (Merck, Squibb, Lilly and Pfizer) and informed them that they would be serving the national interest if they undertook penicillin production and that there might be support from the federal government.",

              "Because penicillin needs air to grow, aerating the fermentation mixture in deep tanks presented a problem.",
              "When corn steep liquor was used as the culture medium, bubbling sterile air through the mixture caused severe foaming.",
              "Squibb solved this problem by introducing glyceryl monoricinolate as an anti-foaming agent.",

              "[12] In an article published in the medical journal The Lancet in 1917, he described an ingenious experiment, which he was able to conduct as a result of his own glassblowing skills, in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during the war.",
              "Antiseptics worked well on the surface, but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent, and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach.",

              "He then set his assistants, Stuart Craddock and Frederick Ridley, the difficult task of isolating pure penicillin from the mold juice.",
              "It proved to be very unstable, and they were only able to prepare solutions of crude material to work with.",
              "Fleming published his findings in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in June 1929, with only a passing reference to penicillin's potential therapeutic benefits.",
              "At this stage it looked as if its main application would be in isolating penicillin-insensitive bacteria from penicillin-sensitive bacteria in a mixed culture.",
              "This at least was of practical benefit to bacteriologists, and kept interest in penicillin going.",
              "Others, including Harold Raistrick, Professor of Biochemistry at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, tried to purify penicillin but failed.",
              "Back to top It was Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and their colleagues at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at Oxford University who turned penicillin from a laboratory curiosity into a life-saving drug.",
              "Their work on the purification and chemistry of penicillin began in earnest in 1939, just when wartime conditions were beginning to make research especially difficult.",
              "To carry out a program of animal experiments and clinical trials the team needed to process up to 500 liters a week of mold filtrate.",
              "They began growing it in a strange array of culture vessels such as baths, bedpans, milk churns and food tins.",
              "Later, a customized fermentation vessel was designed for ease of removing and, to save space, renewing the broth beneath the surface of the mold.",
              "A team of \"penicillin girls\" was employed, at \u00a32 a week, to inoculate and generally look after the fermentation.",
              "In effect, the Oxford laboratory was being turned into a penicillin factory.",
              "Meanwhile, biochemist Norman Heatley extracted penicillin from huge volumes of filtrate coming off the production line by extracting it into amyl acetate and then back into water, using a countercurrent system.",
              "Edward Abraham, another biochemist who was employed to help step up production, then used the newly discovered technique of alumina column chromatography to remove impurities from the penicillin prior to clinical trials.",
              "In 1940, Florey carried out vital experiments, showing that penicillin could protect mice against infection from deadly Streptococci.",
              "Then, on February 12, 1941, a 43-year old policeman, Albert Alexander, became the first recipient of the Oxford penicillin.",
              "He had scratched the side of his mouth while pruning roses, and had developed a life-threatening infection with huge abscesses affecting his eyes, face, and lungs.",
              "Penicillin was injected and within days he made a remarkable recovery.",
              "But supplies of the drug ran out and he died a few days later.",
              "Better results followed with other patients though and soon there were plans to make penicillin available for British troops on the battlefield.",
              "War-time conditions made industrial production of penicillin difficult.",
              "A number of British companies, including Glaxo (now GlaxoSmithKline) and Kemball Bishop, a London firm later bought by Pfizer, took up the challenge.",
              "Back to top Substantial amounts of penicillin would be needed for the extensive clinical trials required to confirm the promise of the early results and to provide adequate supplies of the drug for therapeutic use if it did live up to its potential.",
              "Florey recognized that large-scale production of penicillin was probably out of the question in Britain, where the chemical industry was fully absorbed in the war effort.",
              "With the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, Florey and his colleague Norman Heatley traveled to the United States in the summer of 1941 to see if they could interest the American pharmaceutical industry in the effort to produce penicillin on a large scale.",
              "Yale physiologist John Fulton helped to put his British colleagues in touch with individuals who might be able to assist them in their goal.",
              "They were referred to Robert Thom of the Department of Agriculture, a foremost mycologist and authority on the Penicillium mold, and eventually to the Department's Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL) in Peoria, Illinois, because of the expertise of its Fermentation Division.",
              "This contact proved to be crucial to the success of the project, as the NRRL was a key contributor of innovations that made large-scale production of penicillin possible.",
              "Back to top Orville May, Director of the NRRL, agreed to have the Laboratory undertake a vigorous program to increase penicillin yields under the direction of Robert Coghill, Chief of the Fermentation Division.",
              "It was agreed that Heatley would remain in Peoria to share his expertise with his American colleagues.",
              "Within a few weeks, Andrew Moyer found that he could significantly increase the yield of penicillin by substituting lactose for the sucrose used by the Oxford team in their culture medium.",
              "Shortly thereafter, Moyer made the even more important discovery that the addition of corn-steep liquor to the fermentation medium produced a ten-fold increase in yield.",
              "Corn-steep liquor was a by-product of the corn wetmilling process, and the NRRL, in an attempt to find a use for it, tried it in essentially all of its fermentation work.",
              "Later, the Peoria laboratory increased the yield of penicillin still further by the addition of penicillin precursors, such as phenylacetic acid, to the fermentation medium.",
              "It was recognized that the Oxford group's method of growing the mold on the surface of a nutrient medium was inefficient, and that growth in submerged culture would be a superior process.",
              "In submerged culture fermentation, the mold is grown in large tanks in a constantly agitated and aerated mixture, rather than just on the surface of the medium.",
              "Florey's Penicillium culture, however, produced only traces of penicillin when grown in submerged culture.",
              "Under the direction of Kenneth Raper, staff at the NRRL screened various Penicillium strains and found one that produced acceptable yields of penicillin in submerged culture.",
              "Soon a global search was underway for better penicillin producing strains, with soil samples being sent to the NRRL from around the world.",
              "Ironically, the most productive strain came from a moldy cantaloupe from a Peoria fruit market.",
              "A more productive mutant of the so-called cantaloupe strain was produced with the use of X-rays at the Carnegie Institution.",
              "When this strain was exposed to ultraviolet radiation at the University of Wisconsin, its productivity was increased still further.",
              "Back to top While Norman Heatley remained in Peoria helping the NRRL staff to get the penicillin work started, Howard Florey visited various pharmaceutical companies to try to interest them in the drug.",
              "Although Florey was disappointed in the immediate results of his trip, three of the companies (Merck, Squibb and Lilly) had actually conducted some penicillin research before Florey's arrival and Pfizer seemed on the verge of investigating the drug as well.",
              "At this time, however, the promise of penicillin was still based on only limited clinical trials.",
              "Florey next visited his old friend Alfred Newton Richards, then vice president for medical affairs at the University of Pennsylvania.",
              "More importantly, Richards was chair of the Committee on Medical Research (CMR) of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD).",

              "While serving as a private in the London Scottish Regiment of the Territorial Army, he became a recognised marksman.",
              "Wishing to keep Fleming in St Mary\u2019s to join its rifle club, the club\u2019s captain convinced him to pursue a career in research rather than in surgery, as the latter choice would require him to leave the school.",

              "It was with this research group that Fleming stayed throughout his entire career.",
              "When World War I broke out, Fleming served in the Army Medical Corps as a captain.",
              "During this time, he observed the death of many of his fellow soldiers, not always from wounds inflicted in battle, but from the ensuing infection that could not be controlled.",
              "The primary means to combat infection was antiseptics, which frequently did more harm than good.",
              "In an article he wrote during this time, Fleming discussed the presence of anaerobic bacteria in deep wounds, which proliferated despite antiseptics.",
              "Initially, his research was not accepted, but Fleming continued undaunted and in 1922, he discovered lysozyme, an enzyme with weak antibacterial properties.",
              "History tells us that, while infected with a cold, Fleming transferred some of his nasopharyngeal mucus onto a Petri dish.",
              "Not known for fastidious laboratory organisation, he placed the dish among the clutter at his desk and left it there, forgotten, for two weeks.",
              "In that time, numerous colonies of bacteria grew and proliferated.",
              "However, the area where the mucus had been inoculated remained clear.",
              "Upon further investigation, Fleming discovered the presence of a substance in the mucus that inhibited bacterial growth and he named it lysozyme.",
              "He also discovered lysozyme in tears, saliva, skin, hair and fingernails.",
              "He was soon able to isolate larger amounts of lysozyme from egg white, but in subsequent experiments found that this enzyme was effective against only a small number of non-harmful bacteria.",
              "Nevertheless, this would lay the groundwork for Fleming\u2019s next great discovery.",
              "In 1928, Fleming began a series of experiments involving the common staphylococcal bacteria.",
              "An uncovered Petri dish sitting next to an open window became contaminated with mould spores.",
              "Fleming observed that the bacteria in proximity to the mould colonies were dying, as evidenced by the dissolving and clearing of the surrounding agar gel.",
              "He was able to isolate the mould and identified it as a member of the Penicillium genus.",
              "He found it to be effective against all Gram-positive pathogens, which are responsible for diseases such as scarlet fever, pneumonia, gonorrhoea, meningitis and diphtheria.",
              "He discerned that it was not the mould itself but some \u2018juice\u2019 it had produced that had killed the bacteria.",
              "He named the \u2018mould juice\u2019 penicillin.",
              "Later, he would say: \u201cWhen I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn\u2019t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world\u2019s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer.",
              "But I suppose that was exactly what I did.",
              "\u201d Although Fleming published the discovery of penicillin in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in 1929, the scientific community greeted his work with little initial enthusiasm.",
              "Additionally, Fleming found it difficult to isolate this precious \u2018mould juice\u2019 in large quantities.",
              "It was not until 1940, just as he was contemplating retirement, that two scientists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, became interested in penicillin.",

              "Time Magazine named Fleming one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.",
              "Fleming was a quiet, patient and modest gentleman, not given to displays of emotion, with a natural shyness that made him avoid accolades and attention.",
              "He could be silent to the point of being inscrutable, making it difficult even for his wife and closest friends to gauge his moods and desires.",

              "Still, Eric Sidebottom suggests some sensitive decisions had to be made about how best to use what penicillin supplies there were: \u2018In 1943, Florey and Chain travelled out to North Africa to oversee the use of penicillin to treat infected injuries.",
              "Penicillin was also found to be extremely effective in treating the clap (gonorrhoea).",
              "This presented the military with a problem: with limited supplies, which soldiers should receive the drug \u2013 those with clap or those with horrific injuries?",
              "Churchill reportedly decided to use it to \u201cbest military advantage\u201d (give it those with the clap to get them back onto the front lines more quickly).",

              "After all, Fleming shared the Nobel Prize with Florey and Chain.",

              "During growth and division, PGN is continuously synthesized and remodeled.",
              "Therefore, it is essential for bacteria to be able to synthesize the components of PGN and assemble them into a single macromolecule.",
              "The characteristic strength of PGN resides in its net-like conformation that is mainly derived from peptide cross-linkages [13].",
              "These linkages are formed by the activity of specific enzymes called transpeptidases or Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs).",
              "Penicillin, like other components of the beta-lactam antibiotics, contains a four-membered beta-lactam ring (Figure 3), which is responsible for the inhibition of transpeptidase [14].",
              "By mimicking the last two D-alanine residues of the peptide, penicillin is able to bind irreversibly the active site of the transpeptidase, preventing the enzyme from cross-linking the peptidoglycan strands.",

              "The inability to act against Gram-negative bacteria is observed not only among benzylpenicillins but also across many different antibiotics.",

              "For instance, pexiganan, a natural peptide identified over ten years ago in the skin of the African clawed frog, was shown to be effective in killing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [63].",
              "This drug has now entered a Phase III clinical trial as a treatment against diabetic ulcers [64,65].",

              "Preventing infections in the first place is another strategy in tackling AMR.",
              "Access to clean water supply and effective healthcare systems will substantially reduce the burden of AMR by limiting the spread of infections and decreasing the overall number of infected individuals.",
              "Furthermore, improving the hygiene and sanitation in hospitals can lower the number of cases associated with multiple-drug resistant bacteria [55].",
              "Unlike antimicrobial therapies, vaccines have several advantages.",
              "Firstly, they can prevent infections by both antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive bacteria.",
              "Secondly, vaccines are able to provide herd immunity, offering protection to unvaccinated individuals by reducing the transmission of pathogens.",
              "Furthermore, vaccination may affect bacterial colonization, thus reducing the overall population of bacteria and possibly the spread of antimicrobial genes to the commensal microbiota [67].",
              "Thirdly, antibiotics are often given to individuals with viral infection to prevent any potential secondary implications caused by bacterial infection.",
              "Vaccination programs have the capacity to prevent viral infections which would subsequently lower antibiotic administration and combat the rising AMR.",
              "Similar to human immunization, vaccines have a potential to be exploited in agriculture to reduce the antibiotic usage in the farming sector.",
              "An example to show the successful impact of vaccines on AMR is the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).",
              "The vaccine was introduced in the U.",
              "S.",
              "in children during 2001 and led to a striking decrease in pneumococcal diseases, including antibiotic resistant infections.",
              "Penicillin-resistant cases dropped by 81 percent, and a general downturn of resistant pneumococcal infections was observed among older children as well as adults who did not receive the vaccine.",
              "This demonstrated herd immunity, leading to an estimated 50 percent reduction of the total number of penicillin resistant cases [68].",
              "Similar results were obtained following the introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine in 1990, which slowed down the incessant evolution of resistant strains [67].",
              "For vaccines to be effective as an antimicrobial strategy, several challenges have to be overcome.",
              "For instance, the pneumococcal vaccine introduced in 2001 was able to protect individuals against seven serotypes defined by their capsular polysaccharide.",
              "Over time, there was an increased incidence of disease caused by non-vaccine pneumococcal serotypes.",
              "This has led to reintroduction of a modified PCV, which covers six additional serotypes and offers broader protection.",
              "Therefore, the impact of vaccines has to be monitored so that the vaccines can be updated to cover emerging strains.",
              "The alternative therapies demand rapid diagnostic tools to identify bacterial infection quickly and efficiently.",
              "This will allow more targeted approaches to therapy by determining the bacteria species causing disease.",
              "Effective diagnostic techniques and rapid screens will also reduce empirical administration of the existing antibiotics, hopefully lowering the selective benefit for antibiotic-resistant strains.",
              "Understanding the mechanisms that underlie resistance remains a key priority, as the acquisition and development of resistance varies depending on the species as well as on the stage of the infection.",
              "Subverting resistance mechanisms themselves, for instance through the development of beta lactamase inhibitors, has proven highly successful in the past, and might prolong the effective lifespan of our current stock of antibiotics.",
              "The discovery and development of penicillin by Alexander Fleming, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Norman Heatley, opened a new chapter in modern medicine.",
              "The purification and characterization of penicillin resulted in identification of next generation penicillins and has led to the discovery of different classes of antibiotics, which has had a profound impact, saving many lives throughout the last 75 years.",
              "Unfortunately, the influence of antibiotics is now fading due to the progressive rise of resistance, and this phenomenon is observed among all antimicrobial drugs.",
              "Increasingly, there are reports of bacterial species which are resistant to all known antibiotics, leaving us very vulnerable to common infections.",
              "We now must respond to this challenge, keeping in mind the lessons we learned from the discovery of penicillin and the subsequent events.",
              "To begin to tackle AMR, countries across the world must unite to implement strict regulations for antibiotic administration in the medical and agricultural sectors.",
              "Secondly, alternative strategies such as phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides, and vaccines should be explored, as they offer another route to halt and prevent AMR.",
              "Sufficient funding and joint efforts from pharmaceutical companies, governments, and academia are necessary to turn promising therapies into valuable drugs.",
              "Thirdly, new techniques for rapid diagnostics of bacterial infection and better AMR surveillance schemes should be designed.",

              "He isolated the mold, grew it in a fluid medium, and found that it produced a substance capable of killing many of the common bacteria that infect humans.",
              "Australian pathologist Howard Florey and British biochemist Ernst Boris Chain isolated and purified penicillin in the late 1930s, and by 1941 an injectable form of the drug was available for therapeutic use.",
              "(Read Alexander Fleming\u2019s 1929 Britannica essay on antiseptics.)",
              "The several kinds of penicillin synthesized by various species of the mold Penicillium may be divided into two classes: the naturally occurring penicillins (those formed during the process of mold fermentation) and the semisynthetic penicillins (those in which the structure of a chemical substance\u20146-aminopenicillanic acid\u2014found in all penicillins is altered in various ways).",
              "Because it is possible to change the characteristics of the antibiotic, different types of penicillin are produced for different therapeutic purposes.",
              "The naturally occurring penicillins, penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) and penicillin V (phenoxymethylpenicillin), are still used clinically.",
              "Because of its poor stability in acid, much of penicillin G is broken down as it passes through the stomach;",
              "as a result of this characteristic, it must be given by intramuscular injection, which limits its usefulness.",
              "Penicillin V, on the other hand, typically is given orally;",
              "it is more resistant to digestive acids than penicillin G.",
              "Some of the semisynthetic penicillins are also more acid-stable and thus may be given as oral medication.",
              "All penicillins work in the same way\u2014namely, by inhibiting the bacterial enzymes responsible for cell wall synthesis in replicating microorganisms and by activating other enzymes to break down the protective wall of the microorganism.",
              "As a result, they are effective only against microorganisms that are actively replicating and producing cell walls;",
              "they also therefore do not harm human cells (which fundamentally lack cell walls).",
              "Some strains of previously susceptible bacteria, such as Staphylococcus, have developed a specific resistance to the naturally occurring penicillins;",
              "these bacteria either produce \u03b2-lactamase (penicillinase), an enzyme that disrupts the internal structure of penicillin and thus destroys the antimicrobial action of the drug, or they lack cell wall receptors for penicillin, greatly reducing the ability of the drug to enter bacterial cells.",
              "This has led to the production of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (second-generation penicillins).",
              "While able to resist the activity of \u03b2-lactamase, however, these agents are not as effective against Staphylococcus as the natural penicillins, and they are associated with an increased risk for liver toxicity.",
              "Moreover, some strains of Staphylococcus have become resistant to penicillinase-resistant penicillins;",
              "an example is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).",
              "Penicillins are used in the treatment of throat infections, meningitis, syphilis, and various other infections.",
              "The chief side effects of penicillin are hypersensitivity reactions, including skin rash, hives, swelling, and anaphylaxis, or allergic shock.",
              "The more serious reactions are uncommon.",
              "Milder symptoms may be treated with corticosteroids but usually are prevented by switching to alternative antibiotics.",

              "\u201d Ehrlich also coined the term chemotherapy: \u201cThere must be planned chemical synthesis: proceeding from a chemical substance with recognizable activity, making derivatives from it, and then trying each to discover the degree of its activity and effectiveness.",

              "Unfortunately, despite exhaustive searches, the promise of more magic bullets for microbial therapy remained elusive.",
              "For 20 years, Salvarsan and Neosalvarsan were the only chemotherapy for bacterial infections.",

              "During that time, Fleming sent his Penicillium mold to anyone who requested it in hopes that they might isolate penicillin for clinical use.",

              "Florey\u2019s predecessor, George Dreyer, had written Fleming earlier in the 1930s for a sample of his strain of Penicillium to test it for bacteriophages as a possible reason for antibacterial activity (it had none).",

              "Their work on the purification and chemistry of penicillin began in earnest in 1939, just when wartime conditions were beginning to make research especially difficult.",
              "To carry out a program of animal experiments and clinical trials the team needed to process up to 500 liters a week of mold filtrate.",
              "They began growing it in a strange array of culture vessels such as baths, bedpans, milk churns and food tins.",
              "Later, a customized fermentation vessel was designed for ease of removing and, to save space, renewing the broth beneath the surface of the mold.",
              "A team of \"penicillin girls\" was employed, at \u00a32 a week, to inoculate and generally look after the fermentation.",
              "In effect, the Oxford laboratory was being turned into a penicillin factory.",
              "Meanwhile, biochemist Norman Heatley extracted penicillin from huge volumes of filtrate coming off the production line by extracting it into amyl acetate and then back into water, using a countercurrent system.",
              "Edward Abraham, another biochemist who was employed to help step up production, then used the newly discovered technique of alumina column chromatography to remove impurities from the penicillin prior to clinical trials.",
              "In 1940, Florey carried out vital experiments, showing that penicillin could protect mice against infection from deadly Streptococci.",
              "Then, on February 12, 1941, a 43-year old policeman, Albert Alexander, became the first recipient of the Oxford penicillin.",

              "Back to top Substantial amounts of penicillin would be needed for the extensive clinical trials required to confirm the promise of the early results and to provide adequate supplies of the drug for therapeutic use if it did live up to its potential.",
              "Florey recognized that large-scale production of penicillin was probably out of the question in Britain, where the chemical industry was fully absorbed in the war effort.",
              "With the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, Florey and his colleague Norman Heatley traveled to the United States in the summer of 1941 to see if they could interest the American pharmaceutical industry in the effort to produce penicillin on a large scale.",
              "Yale physiologist John Fulton helped to put his British colleagues in touch with individuals who might be able to assist them in their goal.",
              "They were referred to Robert Thom of the Department of Agriculture, a foremost mycologist and authority on the Penicillium mold, and eventually to the Department's Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL) in Peoria, Illinois, because of the expertise of its Fermentation Division.",
              "This contact proved to be crucial to the success of the project, as the NRRL was a key contributor of innovations that made large-scale production of penicillin possible.",
              "Back to top Orville May, Director of the NRRL, agreed to have the Laboratory undertake a vigorous program to increase penicillin yields under the direction of Robert Coghill, Chief of the Fermentation Division.",
              "It was agreed that Heatley would remain in Peoria to share his expertise with his American colleagues.",
              "Within a few weeks, Andrew Moyer found that he could significantly increase the yield of penicillin by substituting lactose for the sucrose used by the Oxford team in their culture medium.",
              "Shortly thereafter, Moyer made the even more important discovery that the addition of corn-steep liquor to the fermentation medium produced a ten-fold increase in yield.",
              "Corn-steep liquor was a by-product of the corn wetmilling process, and the NRRL, in an attempt to find a use for it, tried it in essentially all of its fermentation work.",
              "Later, the Peoria laboratory increased the yield of penicillin still further by the addition of penicillin precursors, such as phenylacetic acid, to the fermentation medium.",
              "It was recognized that the Oxford group's method of growing the mold on the surface of a nutrient medium was inefficient, and that growth in submerged culture would be a superior process.",
              "In submerged culture fermentation, the mold is grown in large tanks in a constantly agitated and aerated mixture, rather than just on the surface of the medium.",
              "Florey's Penicillium culture, however, produced only traces of penicillin when grown in submerged culture.",
              "Under the direction of Kenneth Raper, staff at the NRRL screened various Penicillium strains and found one that produced acceptable yields of penicillin in submerged culture.",
              "Soon a global search was underway for better penicillin producing strains, with soil samples being sent to the NRRL from around the world.",
              "Ironically, the most productive strain came from a moldy cantaloupe from a Peoria fruit market.",
              "A more productive mutant of the so-called cantaloupe strain was produced with the use of X-rays at the Carnegie Institution.",
              "When this strain was exposed to ultraviolet radiation at the University of Wisconsin, its productivity was increased still further.",
              "Back to top While Norman Heatley remained in Peoria helping the NRRL staff to get the penicillin work started, Howard Florey visited various pharmaceutical companies to try to interest them in the drug.",
              "Although Florey was disappointed in the immediate results of his trip, three of the companies (Merck, Squibb and Lilly) had actually conducted some penicillin research before Florey's arrival and Pfizer seemed on the verge of investigating the drug as well.",
              "At this time, however, the promise of penicillin was still based on only limited clinical trials.",
              "Florey next visited his old friend Alfred Newton Richards, then vice president for medical affairs at the University of Pennsylvania.",
              "More importantly, Richards was chair of the Committee on Medical Research (CMR) of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD).",
              "The OSRD had been created in June, 1941, to assure that adequate attention was given to research on scientific and medical problems relating to national defense.",
              "Richards had great respect for Florey and trusted his judgment about the potential value of penicillin.",
              "He approached the four drug firms that Florey indicated had shown some interest in the drug (Merck, Squibb, Lilly and Pfizer) and informed them that they would be serving the national interest if they undertook penicillin production and that there might be support from the federal government.",

              "Because penicillin needs air to grow, aerating the fermentation mixture in deep tanks presented a problem.",
              "When corn steep liquor was used as the culture medium, bubbling sterile air through the mixture caused severe foaming.",
              "Squibb solved this problem by introducing glyceryl monoricinolate as an anti-foaming agent.",
              "Submerged fermentation also required the design of new cooling systems for the vats and new mixing technology to stir the penicillin mash efficiently.",
              "Lilly was particularly successful in making the mold synthesize new types of penicillin by feeding precursors of different structure.",
              "Once the fermentation was complete, recovery was also difficult;",

              "Clinical studies also demonstrated its effectiveness against syphilis, and by 1944, it was the primary treatment for this disease in the armed forces of Britain and the United States.",
              "Back to top The increasingly obvious value of penicillin in the war effort led the War Production Board (WPB) in 1943 to take responsibility for increased production of the drug.",

              "in addition to Lederle, Merck, Pfizer and Squibb, Abbott Laboratories (which had also been among the major producers of clinical supplies of penicillin to mid-1943) was one of the first companies to begin large-scale production.",
