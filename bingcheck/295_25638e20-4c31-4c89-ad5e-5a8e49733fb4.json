Ocean energy can be produced in various forms such as wave power (e.g., buoys), tidal power (e.g., turbines), ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), or salinity gradient power. Ocean energy can provide renewable electricity for coastal areas or islands that have limited access to other sources of energy. Ocean energy can also support other activities such as desalination,\naquaculture,\nand coastal protection.\nOcean energy technology is developing rapidly,\nwith pilot projects,\ndemonstration plants,\nand commercial deployments around the world .\n\nThese are some of the most promising advancements in renewable energy technology that could revolutionize our ability to transition away from fossil fuels and towards a sustainable energy future.

              "Islands and remote coastal areas face energy challenges that require attention.",
              "These regions tend to meet their energy needs through exchanges with mainland via submarine cables or their own fossil fuel-based generation facilities.",

              "Potential challenges to the adoption of ocean energy technologies in these markets have been identified and include: socio-environmental issues such as misinformation and social acceptance, regulatory and political barriers due to the relatively nascent nature of the ocean energy sector where support mechanisms are missing, infrastructure (both hard and soft) not in place in these isolated regions, and a lack of financial incentives to aid the economic feasibility of the technologies.",
