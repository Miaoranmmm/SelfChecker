    "query": "What was the inspiration behind the famous painting \"Starry Night\" by Vincent van Gogh and what techniques did he use to create the unique style of the painting?",
    "response": "The Starry Night is one of Vincent van Gogh's most celebrated paintings. He painted it in 1889, while he was staying at an asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, France, after suffering a mental breakdown[^1^]. The painting is based on van Gogh's direct observations as well as his imagination, memories, and emotions[^1^]. He was particularly fascinated by the night sky and the stars, which he saw as symbols of hope and beauty[^2^].\n\nAccording to some astronomers, the painting depicts the sky as it appeared on June 19th, 1889, around 4 am, with Venus as one of the brightest stars on the right of the cypress tree[^3^]. Van Gogh used short, painterly brushstrokes and an artificial color palette to create a dynamic and expressive representation of the night sky. He contrasted the swirling blue and gold hues of the sky with the dark and static forms of the village and the cypress tree[^4^]. He also used luminous colors to make the stars and the moon stand out against the dark background[^4^].\n\nThe Starry Night is an example of how van Gogh was influenced by the Post-Impressionist movement, which emphasized personal expression, emotion, and color over realism and accuracy[^4^]. The painting also shows how van Gogh was inspired by nature and its spiritual significance for him[^5^]. The Starry Night is a masterpiece of modern art that captures van Gogh's vision and feelings in a unique and captivating way.",

              "The Starry Night, a moderately abstract landscape painting (1889) of an expressive night sky over a small hillside village, one of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh\u2019s most celebrated works.",
              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",
              "Amid all this animation, a structured village sits in the distance on the lower right of the canvas.",
              "Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills.",
              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",
              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",

              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",
              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",
              "[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse (F1541r) was also a study for the painting.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",
              "When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he did not send.",
              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",
              ".",

              "And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big\u2014another failure\u2014and I have had my fill of that.\"",
              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",
              "These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.",

              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",
              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",

              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",

              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",
              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",
              "The painting was one of van Gogh\u2019s late works, as he committed suicide the following year.",
              "His artistic career was brief, comprising only 10 years, but it was very productive.",
              "He left more than 800 paintings and 700 to 850 drawings to his brother.",
              "When the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City purchased The Starry Night from a private collector in 1941, it was not well known, but it has since become one of van Gogh\u2019s most famous, if not one of the most recognized, works in the art history canon."

              "[13] During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum in Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.",

              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",

              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",

              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",

              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",

              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",

              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",

              "In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field.",
              "Van Gogh exaggerated their size in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.",
              "One of the first paintings of the view was F611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Re\u0301my, now in Copenhagen.",
              "Van Gogh made a number of sketches for the painting, of which F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm is typical.",
              "It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside.",
              "In his 9 June letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days.",
              "[19][20][L 3][15] Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889.",
              "[19][L 4] This is F719 Green Wheat Field with Cypress, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted en plein air.",
              "[19] F1548 Wheatfield, Saint-Re\u0301my de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it.",
              "Two days later, Vincent wrote to Theo stating that he had painted \"a starry sky\".",
              "[21][L 1] The Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window.",
              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",
              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",
              "[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse (F1541r) was also a study for the painting.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",
              "When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he did not send.",
              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",
              ".",
              ".",
              ".",
              "But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big\u2014another failure\u2014and I have had my fill of that.\"",
              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",
              "These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.",
              "[63] Harvard astronomer Charles A.",
              "Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of The Starry Night contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.",
              "C.",
              "L.",
              "A.)",
              ".",
              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",
              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",

              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",
              ".",

              ".",

              ".",
              "And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big\u2014another failure\u2014and I have had my fill of that.\"",
              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",
              "These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.",
              "[63] Harvard astronomer Charles A.",
              "Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of The Starry Night contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.",
              "C.",
              "L.",
              "A.)",
              ".",
              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",
              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",
              "Theo's widow Jo became the caretaker of Van Gogh's legacy.",
              "In Paris in 1900 she sold the painting to poet Julien Leclercq.",

              "This inner world was seemingly just like his use of complementary colors, a mix of inner turmoil, but not without a mix of his sincere appreciation of the beauty of the world he experienced during the day and night.",

              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",

              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",
              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",

              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",
              "The painting was one of van Gogh\u2019s late works, as he committed suicide the following year.",
              "His artistic career was brief, comprising only 10 years, but it was very productive.",

              "This particular garden is populated by frogs and cranes, both of which were allusions to prostitutes in French slang.",
              "While the stylistic features exhibited in this painting, in particular the strong, dark outlines and bright swaths of color, came to define Van Gogh's mature style, he also made the work his own.",
              "By working in paint rather than a woodblock print, Van Gogh was able to soften the work, relying on visible brushstrokes to lend dimension to the figure and her surroundings as well as creating a dynamic tension across the surface not present in the original prints.",
              "Oil on canvas - The Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam This was one of the scenes Van Gogh painted during his stay in Arles and a painting where he used his powerful nocturnal background.",
              "Using contrasting colors and tones, Van Gogh achieved a luminous surface that pulses with an interior light, almost in defiance of the darkening sky.",
              "The lines of composition all point to the center of the work drawing the eye along the pavement as if the viewer is strolling the cobblestone streets.",
              "The cafA\u0303\u00a9 still exists today and is a \"mecca\" for van Gogh fans visiting the south of France.",
              "Describing this painting in a letter to his sister he wrote, \"Here you have a night painting without black, with nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green and in this surrounding the illuminated area colors itself sulfur pale yellow and citron green.",
              "It amuses me enormously to paint the night right on the spot.",
              ".",
              ".\"",
              "Painted on the street at night, Van Gogh recreated the setting directly from his observations, a practice inherited from the Impressionists.",
              "However, unlike the Impressionists, he did not record the scene merely as his eye observed it, but imbued the image with a spiritual and psychological tone that echoed his individual and personal reaction.",
              "The brushstrokes vibrate with the sense of excitement and pleasure Van Gogh experienced while painting this work.",
              "Oil on canvas - KrA\u0303\u00b6ller-Muller Museum, Otterlo Van Gogh's Sunflower series was intended to decorate the room that was set aside for Gauguin at the \"Yellow House,\" his studio and apartment in Arles.",
              "The lush brushstrokes built up the texture of the sunflowers and Van Gogh employed a wide spectrum of yellows to describe the blossoms, due in part to recently invented pigments that made new colors and tonal nuances possible.",
              "Van Gogh used the sunny hues to express the entire lifespan of the flowers, from the full bloom in bright yellow to the wilting and dying blossoms rendered in melancholy ochre.",
              "The traditional painting of a vase of flowers is given new life through Van Gogh's experimentation with line and texture, infusing each sunflower with the fleeting nature of life, the brightness of the Provencal summer sun, as well as the artist's mindset.",
              "Oil on canvas - The National Gallery, London Van Gogh's Bedroom depicts his living quarters at 2 Place Lamartine, Arles, known as the \"Yellow House\".",
              "It is one of his most well known images.",
              "His use of bold and vibrant colors to depict the off-kilter perspective of his room demonstrated his liberation from the muted palette and realistic renderings of the Dutch artistic tradition, as well as the pastels commonly used by the Impressionists.",
              "He labored over the subject matter, colors, and arrangements of this composition, writing many letters to Theo about it, \"This time it's just simply my bedroom, only here color is to do everything, and giving by its simplification a grander style to things, is to be suggestive here of rest or of sleep in general.",
              "In a word, looking at the picture ought to rest the brain, or rather the imagination.\"",
              "While the bright yellows and blues might at first seem to echo a sense of disquiet, the bright hues call to mind a sunny summer day, evoking as sense of warmth and calm, as Van Gogh intended.",
              "This personal interpretation of a scene in which particular emotions and memories drive the composition and palette is a major contribution to modernist painting.",
              "Oil on canvas - The Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam After cutting off a portion of his left earlobe during a manic episode while in Arles, Van Gogh painted Self Portrait with a Bandaged Ear while recuperating and reflecting on his illness.",
              "He believed that the act of painting would help restore balance to his life, demonstrating the important role that artistic creation held for him.",
              "The painting bears witness to the artist's renewed strength and control in his art, as the composition is rendered with uncharacteristic realism, where all his facial features are clearly modeled and careful attention is given to contrasting textures of skin, cloth, and wood.",
              "The artist depicts himself in front of an easel with a canvas that is largely blank and a Japanese print hung on the wall.",
              "The loose and expressive brushstrokes typical of Van Gogh are clearly visible;",
              "the marks are both choppy and sinuous, at times becoming soft and diffuse, creating a tension between boundaries that are otherwise clearly marked.",
              "The strong outlines of his coat and hat mimic the linear quality of the Japanese print behind the artist.",
              "At the same time, Van Gogh deployed the technique of impasto, or the continual layering of wet paint, to develop a richly textured surface, which furthers the depth and emotive force of the canvas.",
              "This self-portrait, one of many Van Gogh created during his career, has an intensity unparalleled in its time, which is elucidated in the frank manner in which the artist portrays his self-inflicted wound as well as the evocative way he renders the scene.",
              "By combining influences as diverse as the loose brushwork of the Impressionists and the strong outlines from Japanese woodblock printing, Van Gogh arrived at a truly unique mode of expression in his paintings.",
              "Oil on canvas - The Courtauld Gallery, London Starry Night is often considered to be Van Gogh's pinnacle achievement.",
              "Unlike most of his works, Starry Night was painted from memory, and not out in the landscape.",
              "The emphasis on interior, emotional life is clear in his swirling, tumultuous depiction of the sky - a radical departure from his previous, more naturalistic landscapes.",
              "Here, Van Gogh followed a strict principal of structure and composition in which the forms are distributed across the surface of the canvas in an exact order to create balance and tension amidst the swirling torsion of the cypress trees and the night sky.",
              "The result is a landscape rendered through curves and lines, its seeming chaos subverted by a rigorous formal arrangement.",
              "Evocative of the spirituality Van Gogh found in nature, Starry Night is famous for advancing the act of painting beyond the representation of the physical world.",
              "Oil on canvas - The Museum of Modern Art, New York After Van Gogh left the asylum at Saint-Remy in May 1890 he travelled north to Auvers, outside of Paris.",
              "Church at Auvers is one of the most well-known images from the last few months of Van Gogh's life.",
              "Imbuing the landscape with movement and emotion, he rendered the scene with a palette of vividly contrasting colors and brushstrokes that lead the viewer through painting.",
              "Van Gogh distorted and flattened out the architecture of the church and depicted it caught within its own shadow - which reflects his own complex relationship to spirituality and religion.",
              "Van Gogh conveys a sense that true spirituality is found in nature, not in the buildings of man.",
              "The continued influence of Japanese woodblock printing is clear in the thick dark outlines and the flat swaths of color of the roofs and landscape, while the visible brushstrokes of the Impressionists are elongated and emphasized.",
              "The use of the acidic tones and the darkness of the church alludes to the impending mental disquiet that would eventually erupt within Van Gogh and lead to his suicide.",
              "This sense of instability plagued Van Gogh throughout his life, infusing his works with a unique blend of charm and tension.",

              "Gachet, something like another brother, so much do we resemble each other physically and also mentally.\"",
              "Van Gogh depicts Gachet seated at a red table, with two yellow books and foxglove in a vase near his elbow.",
              "The doctor gazes past the viewer, his eyes communicating a sense of inner sadness that reflects not only the doctor's state of mind, but Van Gogh's as well.",
              "Van Gogh focused the viewer's attention on the depiction of the doctor's expression by surrounding his face with the subtly varied blues of his jacket and the hills of the background.",
              "Van Gogh wrote to Gauguin that he desired to create a truly modern portrait, one that captured the \"the heartbroken expression of our time.\"",
              "Rendering Gachet's expression through a blend of melancholy and gentility, Van Gogh created a portrait that has resonated with viewers since its creation.",
              "A recent owner, Ryoei Saito, even claimed he planned to have the painting cremated with him after his death, as he was so moved by the image.",
              "The intensity of emotion that Van Gogh poured into each brushstroke is what has made his work so compelling to viewers over the decades, inspiring countless artists and individuals.",
              "Oil on canvas - Private Collection Vincent Van Gogh was born the second of six children into a religious Dutch Reformed Church family in the south of the Netherlands.",

              "In 1869, Van Gogh apprenticed at the headquarters of the international art dealers Goupil & Cie in Paris and eventually worked at the Hague branch of the firm.",

              "While living in southern Belgium as a poor preacher, he gave away his possessions to the local coal-miners until the church dismissed him because of his overly enthusiastic commitment to his faith.",
              "In 1880, Van Gogh decided he could be an artist and still remain in God's service, writing, \"To try to understand the real significance of what the great artists, the serious masters, tell us in their masterpieces, that leads to God;",

              "A year later, in 1881, dire poverty motivated Van Gogh to move back home with his parents, where he taught himself to draw.",
              "He became infatuated with his cousin, Kee Vos-Stricker.",
              "His continued pursuit of her affection, despite utter rejection, eventually split the family.",
              "With the support of Theo, Van Gogh moved to the Hague, rented a studio, and studied under Anton Mauve - a leading member of the Hague School.",
              "Mauve introduced Van Gogh to the work of the French painter Jean-FranA\u0303\u00a7ois Millet, who was renowned for depicting common laborers and peasants.",

              "She was destitute, addicted to alcohol, pregnant, and had her five year-old daughter Maria Wilhelmina, in tow.",
              "Van Gogh took pity on her, and took her into his care for the next year and a half.",

              "While Sien's account of their relationship portrays it as one merely of convenience and benevolence, it seems that Van Gogh felt more of a connection, and even had plans to marry her.",
              "In return for his support, Sien (as well as her children and mother) modeled for over fifty of Van Gogh's works, such as his 1882 drawing Sorrow, in which Sien appears pregnant, and which the artist once called \"the best figure I've drawn\".",
              "It seems, however, that what Van Gogh valued about her was the challenging life she had faced (she had during her life, become pregnant four different times by four different men, all of whom had abandoned her, and two of the children had died during infancy).",
              "He once referred to her as \"pockmarked\" and \"no longer beautifula\u0302\u0080\u009d, and often depicted her frowning, and in difficult or unflattering situations.",
              "Sien and her family also appeared in Van Gogha\u0302\u0080\u0099s 1883 series The Public Soup Kitchen.",

              "Although he found a professional calling, his personal life was in shambles.",
              "Van Gogh accused Theo of not trying hard enough to sell his paintings, to which Theo replied that Vincent's dark palette was out of vogue compared to the bold and bright style of the Impressionist artists that was popular.",
              "Suddenly, on March 26, 1885, their father died from a stroke, putting pressure on Van Gogh to have a successful career.",

              "There he discovered the art of Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens, whose swirling forms and loose brushwork had a clear impact on the young artist's style.",
              "However, the rigidity of academicism of the school did not appeal to Van Gogh and he left for Paris the following year.",
              "He moved in with Theo in Montmartre - the artist's district in northern Paris - and studied with painter Fernand Cormon, who introduced the young artist to the Impressionists.",
              "The influence of artists such as Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Edgar Degas, and Georges Seurat, as well as pressure from Theo to sell paintings, motivated Van Gogh to adopt a lighter palette.",

              "While at the \"Yellow House\" Gauguin and Van Gogh worked closely together and developed a concept of color symbolic of inner emotion and not dependent upon nature.",
              "Despite enormous productivity, Van Gogh suffered from various bouts of mental instability, likely including epilepsy, psychotic episodes, delusions, and bipolar disorder.",
              "Gauguin left for Tahiti, partially as a means of escaping Van Gogh's increasingly erratic behavior.",
              "The artist slipped away after a particularly violent fight in which Van Gogh threatened Gauguin with a razor and then cut off part of his own left ear.",
              "On May 8, 1889, reeling from his deteriorating mental condition, Van Gogh voluntarily committed himself into a psychiatric institution in Saint-Remy, near Arles.",
              "As the weeks passed, his mental well-being remained stable and he was allowed to resume painting.",
              "This period became one of his most productive.",
              "In the year spent at Saint-Remy, Van Gogh created over 100 works, including Starry Night (1889).",
              "The clinic and its garden became his main subjects, rendered in the dynamic brushstrokes and lush palettes typical of his mature period.",
              "On supervised walks, Van Gogh immersed himself in the experience of the natural surroundings, later recreating from memory the olive and cypress trees, irises, and other flora that populated the clinic's campus.",
              "Shortly after leaving the clinic, Van Gogh moved north to Auvers-sur-Oise outside of Paris, to the care of a homeopathic doctor and amateur artist, Dr.",
              "Gachet.",
              "The doctor encouraged Van Gogh to paint as part of his recovery, and he happily obliged.",

              "During his 10-year artistic career, Vincent van Gogh created a vivid personal style, noted for its striking colour, emphatic brushwork, and contoured forms.

              "The Starry Night, a moderately abstract landscape painting (1889) of an expressive night sky over a small hillside village, one of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh\u2019s most celebrated works.",
              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",
              "Amid all this animation, a structured village sits in the distance on the lower right of the canvas.",
              "Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills.",
              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",
              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",
              "The painting was one of van Gogh\u2019s late works, as he committed suicide the following year.",
              "His artistic career was brief, comprising only 10 years, but it was very productive.",
              "He left more than 800 paintings and 700 to 850 drawings to his brother.",
              "When the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City purchased The Starry Night from a private collector in 1941, it was not well known, but it has since become one of van Gogh\u2019s most famous, if not one of the most recognized, works in the art history canon."
