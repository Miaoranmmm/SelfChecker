    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. That's a great question. Ocean acidification is a serious environmental problem that affects marine life and ecosystems. It is caused by the increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean, which lowers the pH level and makes the water more acidic[^1^] [^2^]. Some of the effects of ocean acidification include coral bleaching, reduced shell formation, altered fish behavior, and biodiversity loss[^1^] [^2^].\n\nThere are different solutions being proposed and developed to address this issue, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, geoengineering, and growing sea plants[^1^] [^3^] [^4^]. One of the most innovative and promising solutions is to grow kelp, eelgrass, and other vegetation in the ocean, as they can effectively absorb CO2 and reduce acidity in the water[^4^]. This can also provide habitat, food, and oxygen for marine animals, as well as economic benefits for coastal communities[^4^].\n\nHowever, scaling up this solution to make a significant impact on the health of our oceans is not easy. It requires careful planning, monitoring, and management of the sea plants, as well as collaboration among scientists, policymakers, fishermen, farmers, and other stakeholders[^4^]. It also depends on the availability of suitable sites, the potential environmental impacts, and the legal and regulatory frameworks[^4^].

              "In the last decade (from 2008-2017), we\u2019ve dumped into the atmosphere about 40 gigatons of emissions of heat-trapping gases each year from the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change\u2014or the equivalent to 252 million blue whales.",
              "When carbon dioxide enters the ocean, it dissolves in saltwater.",
              "First, it forms carbonic acid.",
              "Then, this carbonic acid breaks apart \u2013 or \u201cdissociates\u201d \u2013 producing bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions.",
              "Ocean acidification results from an increased concentration of hydrogen ions and a reduction in carbonate ions due to the absorption of increased amounts of CO2.",
              "Clams, mussels, crabs, corals, and other sea life rely on carbonate ions to grow their shells and thrive.",
              "Acidity is a measure (in units of pH) of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution, in this case, ocean water.",
              "For millions of years, the exchange of CO2 between the surface of the ocean and the atmosphere remained constant.",
              "In the past 150 years, humans have greatly increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels and changing land-use practices.",
              "As a result, the ocean has absorbed about 29 percent of this additional carbon.",
              "This added CO2 has had significant effects on the ocean.",
              "Surface waters are now 30 percent more acidic than they were at the start of the industrial era.",
              "Ocean acidification is now happening at a faster rate than at any point in the last 66 million years, and possibly in the last 300 million years.",
              "And projections show that by the end of this century, ocean surface waters could be more than twice as acidic as they were at the end of last century if we do not reduce our carbon emissions.",
              "The rising concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is driving up ocean surface temperatures and causing ocean acidification.",
              "Although warming and acidification are different phenomena, they interact to the detriment of marine ecosystems. These changes to the ocean aren\u2019t occurring at the same rates everywhere: there are significant differences across gradients of temperature, latitude, and depth.",
              "The rate at which water absorbs CO2 decreases as water temperature increases.",
              "This means that polar regions like Alaska, where ocean water is relatively cold, can take up more CO2 than the warmer tropics.",
              "As a result, polar surface waters are generally acidifying faster than those in other latitudes, and on average, warmer regions of the ocean are releasing CO2 into the atmosphere instead of absorbing it.",
              "The regional differences in ocean acidification can also be partially explained by the effects of ocean circulation patterns.",
              "Due to prevailing wind patterns and other natural phenomena, the ocean upwells nutrient-rich and more acidic or corrosive deep waters.",
              "Under natural conditions, an infusion of nutrient-rich, cool, and corrosive deep waters into the upper layers is beneficial to coastal ecosystems. But in regions with acidifying waters, an infusion of cooler deep waters (which also tend to be more acidic) amplifies the effects of existing acidification.",
              "In other regions, usually the tropics, rising temperatures in surface waters is slowing down the exchange of carbon between deep waters and surface waters.",
              "Here wind plays a key role: it mixes upper and deeper waters and carries the CO2-saturated waters to deeper areas of the ocean.",
              "With rising surface temperatures, it\u2019s harder for winds to mix these layers, which become increasingly stratified, meaning that they sit on top of one another.",
              "Consequently, in locations with warmer waters, upper layers are becoming more saturated with CO2 and unable to absorb more, and lower layers have less oxygen (known as deoxygenation).",
              "Coastal and marine ecosystems are under tremendous stress from climate change.",
              "Ocean acidification, paired up with other climate impacts like warming waters, deoxygenation, melting ice, and coastal erosion, pose real threats to the survival of many marine species.",
              "Ocean acidification is particularly detrimental to species that build their skeletons and shells from calcium carbonate (like clams, mussels, crabs, phytoplankton, and corals), and that constitute the bottom of the food chain.",
              "Acidification reduces the availability of carbonate ions in ocean water, which provide the building blocks these organisms need to make their shells and skeletons, significantly reducing the chances for their offspring to survive.",
              "In the presence of other climate stressors, ocean acidification makes it harder for species to bounce back.",
              "Take the problem of coral bleaching, for example.",
              "Corals maintain a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic algae living in their tissue: corals provide shelter for the algae and each provide the other with nutrients necessary for their survival.",
              "But when water temperatures get too high, corals expel these algae, leaving them more vulnerable to disease and less able to maintain and build their skeletal structure.",
              "Ocean acidification hinders the ability of corals to recover from these bleaching events because it reduces the amount of calcium carbonate available that corals need to grow back to health.",
              "A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that 99 percent of the world\u2019s warm-water coral reefs could disappear if global average temperatures rise 2\u00b0C or more above pre-industrial levels.",

              "Shellfish fisheries are also feeling the impacts of carbon pollution.",
              "In places like the Pacific Coast of the United States, warming waters and ocean acidification are expected to reduce the Dungeness crab populations, the highest- revenue fishery in Oregon and Washington.",
              "Fisheries in the Northwest are already feeling the impacts of warming waters, which are wreaking havoc in the region and causing multimillion-dollar losses to local economies.",
              "Warming ocean temperatures have caused a rapid increase of toxic algal blooms. Toxic algae produce domoic acid, a dangerous neurotoxin, that builds up in the bodies of shellfish, posing a risk to human health.",
              "As a result, many West Coast fisheries have been forced to shut down.",
              "With increasingly acidic waters, and the subsequent reduction of the minerals that shellfish need to grow, these fisheries face serious challenges into the future.",
              "Regarding warming, the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations (PCFFA) filed a lawsuit against 30 fossil fuel companies in 2018.",
              "PCFFA alleges that these companies promoted and profited from increased oil, coal, and natural gas consumption despite being aware of the link between increased heat-trapping emissions and climate change.",
              "It is the first case brought by an industry association against fossil fuel companies.",
              "If you live in Kansas or Oklahoma, you may think that ocean acidification doesn\u2019t affect you.",
              "But it does.",
              "Ocean acidification impacts important sectors of the US economy, like fisheries and tourism, it affects food supply, and makes global warming worse by hindering the oceans\u2019 ability to absorb CO2.",
              "For communities that depend on coastal resources, their way of life and cultural identity are on the line.",
              "If CO2 emissions continue unabated, by the end of the century, ocean acidification is expected to reduce harvests of U.",
              "S.",
              "shellfish.",
              "It\u2019s estimated that by the end of the century annual supplies of clams could decrease by 35 percent, oysters supplies could fall by 50 percent, and scallops could see a decline of 55 percent.",
              "Overall, the shellfish industry could experience cumulative consumer losses of $230 million.",
              "In this same scenario, ocean acidification paired with warming could cost $140 billion in today\u2019s dollars in lost recreational benefits associated with coral reefs, and the US coral reef recreation industry could decline in value by more than 90 percent by 2100.",
              "The most effective way to limit ocean acidification is to act on climate change, implementing solutions to dramatically reduce the use of fossil fuels.",
              "If we dramatically cut our global warming emissions, and we limit future warming, we can significantly reduce the harm to marine ecosystems. We also need to ensure that resources reach those communities that will be most affected by ocean acidification.",
              "At present, taxpayers foot the bill for climate damages and adaptation costs.",
              "However, climate change negatively impacts local economies and stymies these communities\u2019 ability to adapt.",
              "Courts are beginning to consider holding fossil fuel producers accountable for damage they knew their products were causing because they chose to misinform investors and the public about those risks instead of acting to mitigate them.",
              "Making a case for these companies\u2019 responsibility, Henry Shue, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Oxford, argues \u201cCompanies knowingly violated the most basic moral principle of 'do no harm,' and now they must remedy the harm they caused by paying damages and their proportion of adaptation costs.",

              "Effects of Ocean Acidification on Corals A 20 percent increase above current carbon dioxide levels, which could occur within the next two decades, could significantly reduce the ability of corals to build their skeletons and some could become functionally extinct within this timeframe.",
              "In real terms, this does not just mean corals grow more slowly, but also that they will be less able to overcome typical pressures.",
              "Tropical coral reefs are constantly engaging in a battle to grow.",
              "Many reef dwellers actually break apart pieces of the corals\u2019 skeletons, either to feed upon or to create homes.",
              "This process is known as bioerosion.",
              "Even the healthiest reefs are constantly trying to grow faster than they are being eroded.",
              "In a high carbon dioxide world, not only is coral growth slower, it is also less robust, so the skeletons that are produced are weaker.",
              "Consequently, coral reefs in more acidic conditions may not be able to overcome the typical amount of destruction and may start to shrink.",
              "Millions of marine species depend on coral reefs to feed, reproduce, shelter larvae and take refuge from predators in their vast three dimensional networks.",
              "If coral reefs disappear, it will threaten the survival of many reef dependent species.",
              "For corals to grow in a healthy manner they require appropriate amounts of aragonite saturation, which will decrease globally due to ocean acidification.",
              "Prior to the Industrial Revolution, around 98 percent of coral reefs were surrounded by waters with adequate or optimal aragonite saturation states.",
              "However, this has rapidly changed with increasing ocean acidification.",
              "At today\u2019s carbon dioxide concentrations, about 60 percent of coral reefs are surrounded by waters that have less than adequate aragonite saturation states, and if carbon dioxide concentrations increase to 450 ppm, more than 90 percent of coral reefs will be surrounded by such waters.",
              "No corals that exist today will be near waters with adequate saturation states if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are allowed to reach 550 ppm.",
              "According to Dr.",
              "Ken Caldeira, \u201cThere is at least a reasonable expectation that if current carbon dioxide emission trends continue, corals will not survive this century.",
              "\u201d Recent studies on the growth rates of tropical corals have found that if concentrations of carbon dioxide reach 560 ppm (twice pre-industrial levels) coral reefs all across the globe will have stopped growing and will begin to erode.",
              "On a business-as-usual emissions path, this level of atmospheric carbon dioxide can be expected around the middle of this century.",
              "But this problem is not off in the distant future, we are already beginning to see that impacts of ocean acidification may already be occurring for corals.",
              "A recent study expressed a 14% decrease in coral growth in the Great Barrier Reef Australia since 1990, the most significant decrease in coral growth in the last 400 years.",
              "Alongside threatened tropical coral reefs, cold-water corals are some of the most vulnerable species when it comes to anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions.",
              "Cold-water reef-forming corals have extremely high biodiversity and provide habitat and nursery areas for many deep-sea organisms, including several commercially important fish species.",
              "There is still much that we do not know about these organisms and yet with the current rate of ocean acidification, we may cause their disappearance before we even fully appreciate their true beauty and importance.",
              "Cold-water corals, sponges and their associated ecosystems have been recognized as important sources of new medical treatments for diseases as varied as cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer\u2019s and skin conditions.",
              "For example, bamboo corals, a type of sea fan, have been used to synthesize human bone analogs for grafting and may provide a model for artificial synthesis for collagen.",
              "There are six species of cold-water, reef building, stony corals that create calcium carbonate skeletons out of aragonite.",

              "New research by NOAA, the University of Maryland, and international partners published in Nature Scientific Reports shows that the changing chemistry of seawater has implications for continued greenhouse gas absorption.",
              "The ocean has been playing an important role in helping slow down global climate change by removing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.",
              "However, decades of ocean observations show that the CO2 absorbed by the ocean is changing the chemistry of seawater, a process known as ocean acidification.",
              "The study discusses the reduced buffering capacity of the ocean as pH levels drop and its implications for reducing the ocean\u2019s role as a CO2 sink in the future.",
              "The researchers from NOAA's PMEL and NCEI and research institutions in Norway stress the importance of leveraging in situ observation-based global pH data products to help improve model projections.",
              "A climatology developed from this research may lead to more preventive and adaptive solutions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and, at the same time, allow for ocean acidification adaptation strategies in regional areas.",
              "The CO2 Problem Ocean acidification occurs when the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
              "Anthropogenic, or human-caused, carbon dioxide comes from greenhouse gas emissions.",
              "Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, cement production, and deforestation have pumped about two trillion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.",
              "Deforestation adds to the issue by contributing about 10 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions.",
              "The deforestation of the Amazon rainforest has a particularly devastating effect on rising CO2 levels.",
              "The ocean has taken up about 25 percent of the excess gas, the equivalent of over 600 billion tons of carbon dioxide, from 1750 to 2015.",
              "As atmospheric CO2 levels increase, so do the levels in the ocean.",
              "When seawater absorbs carbon dioxide its acidity is increased, which decreases the building blocks used by shellfish to grow their shells.",
              "Some studies have shown that ocean acidification has negative implications for marine life, particularly clams, mussels, coral reefs, and small sea snails, which could have difficulty building or maintaining their shells in increasingly acidic waters.",
              "A Decreasing Buffer The capacity of ocean waters to take up surplus anthropogenic CO2 has been decreasing rapidly.",
              "This study suggests that the ocean\u2019s \u201cbuffer capacity\u201d could decrease by as much as 34 percent from 2000 to 2100 under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) RCP8.",
              "5 scenario, which is the highest \u201cRepresentative Concentration Pathway\u201d of potential greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric concentration levels through 2100.",
              "The rapid decrease in this \"buffer capacity\" suggests that while the ocean will likely continue to take up more CO2 in the future due to the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the proportion of anthropogenic carbon dioxide entering the ocean will decrease.",
              "The ocean\u2019s role in buffering global climate change will gradually diminish, and ocean acidification could accelerate.",
              "Improving Trajectories The study is the first of its kind to link modern observed pH data with modeled carbon dioxide projections to provide a high-resolution regional view of the pH trajectory in all locations of the global surface ocean.",
              "The work will provide improved regional ocean acidification trajectories, above what the model output could produce alone.",

              "These extremes are exacerbated by climate change, driven primarily by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases that build up in the atmosphere and trap heat at the Earth\u2019s surface.",
              "With that in mind, researchers are exploring ways to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and lock it away \u2013 including using the ocean.",

              "We study climate change policy, sustainability and environmental justice.",
              "Before people start experimenting with the health of the ocean, there are several key questions to consider.",
              "The ocean covers about 70% of the planet, and it naturally takes up carbon dioxide.",
              "In fact, about a quarter of human-produced carbon dioxide ends up in the ocean.",
              "Ocean carbon dioxide removal is any action designed to use the ocean to remove even more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it already does and store it.",
              "It spans a wide range of techniques \u2013 from increasing the amount and vitality of carbon dioxide-absorbing mangrove forests to using ocean fertilization to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton that absorb carbon dioxide to building pipelines that pump liquid carbon dioxide into formations under the seabed, where it can eventually solidify as carbonate rock.",
              "There are other forms of carbon dioxide removal \u2013 planting trees, for example.",
              "But they require large amounts of land that is needed for other essential uses, such as agriculture.",
              "That\u2019s why interest in using the vast ocean is growing.",
              "The first crucial question is whether ocean carbon dioxide removal techniques could significantly reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide and store it long term, beyond what the ocean already does.",
              "Greenhouse gas emissions are still increasing globally, which means that ocean carbon dioxide removal would need to keep carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere for a long time, at least until greenhouse gas emissions have fallen.",
              "Initial evidence suggests that some forms of ocean carbon dioxide removal, such as those that rely on short-lived biomass like kelp forests or phytoplankton, may not keep captured carbon stored for more than a few decades.",
              "That\u2019s because most plant tissues are quickly recycled by decay or by sea creatures grazing on them.",
              "In contrast, mechanisms that form minerals, like the interaction when carbon dioxide is pumped into basalt formations, or that alter the way seawater retains carbon dioxide, such as increasing its alkalinity, prevent carbon from escaping and are much more likely to keep it out of the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years.",
              "Another key question is what ecological benefits or risks accompany different ocean carbon dioxide removal approaches.",
              "Research shows that some options, such as supporting mangrove forests, may promote biodiversity and benefit nearby human communities.",
              "However, other options could introduce novel risks.",
              "For example, growing and then sinking large amounts of kelp or algae could bring in invasive species.",
              "Dissolving certain types of rock in the ocean could reduce ocean acidity.",
              "This would enhance the ocean\u2019s ability to store carbon dioxide, but these rocks could also contain trace amounts of metals that could harm marine life, and these risks are not well understood.",
              "Each process could also release some greenhouse gases, reducing its overall effectiveness.",
              "The ocean affects everyone on the planet, but not everyone will have the same relationship to it or the same opportunities to have their opinions heard.",
              "Much of the global population lives near the ocean, and some interventions might impinge on places that support jobs and communities.",
              "For example, boosting algae growth could affect nearby wild fisheries or interfere with recreation.",
              "People and communities are going to evaluate these risks differently depending on how they are personally affected.",
              "In addition, people\u2019s trust in decision-makers often shapes their views of technologies.",
              "Some ways of using the ocean to remove carbon, such as those close to the shore, could be governed locally.",
              "It\u2019s less clear how decisions about the high seas or deep ocean would be made, since these areas are not under the jurisdiction of any one country or global governing body.",
              "People\u2019s perceptions will likely also be shaped by such factors as whether or not they see ocean carbon dioxide removal as interfering with nature or protecting it.",
              "However, views of what is acceptable or not can change.",
              "As the impacts of climate change increase, tolerance for some unconventional interventions seems to be growing.",
              "Ocean carbon dioxide removal also raises a variety of ethical questions that do not have straightforward answers.",
              "For example, it forces people to consider the relationship between humans and nonhumans.",
              "Are humans obliged to intervene to reduce the impact on the climate, or ought we avoid ocean interventions?",
              "Do people have the right to purposefully intervene in the ocean or not?",
              "Are there specific obligations that humans ought to recognize when considering such options?",
              "Other ethical questions revolve around who makes decisions about ocean carbon dioxide removal and the consequences.",
              "For example, who should be involved in decision-making about the ocean?",
              "Could relying on ocean carbon dioxide removal reduce societies\u2019 commitment to reducing emissions through other means, such as by reducing consumption, increasing efficiency and transforming energy systems?",
              "Finally, ocean carbon dioxide removal could be very expensive.",
              "For example, mining and then adding rocks to reduce the ocean\u2019s acidity has been estimated to cost between US$60 and $200 per ton of carbon dioxide removed.",
              "To put that into context, the world produced more than 36 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide from energy alone in 2021.",
              "Even macroalgae cultivation could be in the tens of billions of dollars if done at the scale likely necessary to have an impact.",
              "These methods are more expensive than many actions that reduce emissions right now.",
              "For instance, using solar panels to avoid carbon emissions can range from saving money to a cost of $50 per ton of carbon dioxide, while actions like reducing methane emissions are even less expensive.",
              "But the harm from continued climate change has been estimated to be in the hundreds of billions annually in the United States alone.",
              "These costs raise more questions.",
              "For example, how much debt is fair for future generations to carry, and how should the costs be distributed globally to fix a global problem?",
              "Ocean carbon dioxide removal could become a useful method for keeping global warming in check, but it should not be seen as a silver bullet, especially since there isn\u2019t an effective global system for making decisions about the ocean.",

              "But Netarts, like the whole west coast of North America, is getting more acidic.",

              "Corrosive waters like those suck up the building blocks for shells, and can literally eat away at the skeletons of corals.",
              "Last summer, Oregon State University marine ecologist George Waldbusser and his team boated around Netarts Bay planting baby oysters to see how they would fare.",
              "The only ones that thrived were those protected by beds of eelgrass, which seemed to swallow up enough carbon dioxide during the peak of each day to give the oysters a break from acid and a window of opportunity for growth.",
              "\u201cBasically nothing outside of those beds survived,\u201d says Waldbusser, who hasn\u2019t yet published the work.",
              "Meanwhile, the Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery in Netarts Bay has started only pulling water into their tanks in the afternoon, when photosynthesis peaks and the water is less acidic.",
              "Waldbusser is part of a small team of scientists now exploring the idea that seagrasses, kelps, and shell beds might be able to counteract the rising tide of ocean acidity in local hot spots, making life a little easier for struggling animals.",
              "He and other experts on the West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Science Panel, which released its first report this April, recommended that scientists and managers push forward such strategies to suck CO2 out of the water.",
              "The idea is a smaller, gentler cousin to grander schemes of geo-engineering.",
              "There have been proposals to soak up the ocean\u2019s excess acid by throwing iron, limestone, or olivine into the water, boosting plankton growth, adding the building blocks for shells, or chemically absorbing CO2.",
              "But the general response to such plans usually ranges from head-shaking disbelief that they might be feasible or effective, to widespread concern about the possible ecological side effects.",
              "The energy needed to mine and distribute rocks, and the unpredictable shift in food webs, have made these schemes unappealing on a global scale.",
              "On the local scale, however, lower-cost, lower-risk ecological restoration might have the dual benefit of giving threatened sea creatures both a better place to live and a refuge from ocean acid.",
              "Oysters would not be the only creatures to benefit.",
              "Derek Manzello manages a long-term ocean acidification monitoring site at Cheeca Rocks in the Florida Keys, as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) National Coral Reef Monitoring Program.",
              "That particular patch of coral is one of the only reefs in the Florida Keys that is still growing;",
              "in other reefs, most corals have died from disease and bleaching since the early 1980s.",
              "This is odd because Cheeca Rocks, like other near-shore spots in Florida, sees high temperature swings and large amounts of soil and nutrients dumped into the water, which should limit coral growth.",
              "There are several possible explanations for Cheeca Rocks\u2019 resistance to these problematic conditions, including that the corals there might be genetically adapted to thrive in harsh conditions.",
              "But another possible explanation is that they are living in a low-acidity refuge created by nearby seagrass beds.",
              "In 2012, Manzello showed that Florida\u2019s inshore waters, including where Cheeca Rocks sits, are packed with dissolved aragonite, the material that corals need to grow.",
              "Acids in the water decrease the aragonite saturation value;",
              "if it gets below 1, corals and shells start to dissolve.",
              "In pre-industrial times, these inshore waters typically had a saturation value of 4.",

              "\u201cThis is a huge difference,\u201d says Manzello.",
              "The reason is the banks of seagrass growing in Florida\u2019s inshore waters, like turtle grass and manatee grass, that suck up CO2 as they photosynthesize \u2014 particularly in the spring.",
              "Another study out that same year showed the same effect in the tropical Indo-Pacific.",
              "Seagrass meadows there have the potential to increase aragonite saturation by up to 2.",
              "9 units, and the pH by 0.",
              "38.",
              "That should give corals about an 18 percent boost in growth, making seagrass a potential tool for marine park managers, the authors write.",
              "The potential is huge.",
              "Plants in the ocean, from seagrasses to plankton, add up to just 0.",
              "05 percent of the plant biomass on land, but are so pervasive and efficient at sucking up carbon that they cycle through roughly the same amount of carbon every day as all the land-based plants.",
              "Yet seagrass ecosystems are being wiped out, thanks to everything from pandemic disease to water pollution and coastal construction projects.",
              "The rate of loss has skyrocketed from less than 1 percent of global seagrass cover per year in the 1970s to 7 percent annually in the 2000s, making seagrasses one of the planet\u2019s most threatened ecosystems. Efforts to restore or farm such plants could have a host of benefits, including soaking up atmospheric carbon.",
              "Waldbusser cautions that many scientists don\u2019t yet know about the effect of seagrasses on ocean chemistry.",
              "Some breeds, like the invasive Zostera japonica eelgrass in Oregon, tend to shed their leaves in the winter, and the degrading plant matter boosts carbon dioxide levels in the water rather than lowering them.",
              "And if the water is swift flowing, then any patches of water made less acidic by plants will likely be swept away before they have a chance to benefit local shellfish or corals.",
              "Seagrasses aren\u2019t the only possible solution.",
              "Kelp is also well known for soaking up excess nutrients and making waters cleaner for shellfish.",
              "Most academic papers looking at the benefits of kelp don\u2019t even mention acidification.",
              "But it didn\u2019t take much for Nichole Price of the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science in Maine to put two and two together.",
              "\u201cThe biggest challenge in land-based kelp nurseries is keeping the pH low enough because they consume so much CO2,\u201d says Price, who wondered how those same photosynthetic algae were affecting ocean waters.",
              "Price teamed up with Ocean Approved, North America\u2019s first commercial kelp farmer, to put instruments inside and outside of its kelp farms to see what was going on.",
              "In as-yet-unpublished work, they show that the aragonite saturation level is half a unit to a full unit higher within the kelp farm.",
              "\u201cThat\u2019s bigger than the change we expect from ocean acidification,\u201d she says.",
              "Next year they plan to map the extent of the impact, and test the effect of the kelp on a mussel farm around the corner.",
              "That farm, says Price, has already started growing kelp based on these preliminary results.",
              "The key, says Price, is to harvest the kelp so that the carbon it extracts gets removed from the ecosystem.",
              "It\u2019s hard to compete with Asian kelp suppliers, but local kelp could be dried and used as food or fertilizer, adding a layer of economic diversity to a struggling coastal economy.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for shellfish aquaculture, but people are really hesitant [because of acidification],\u201d says Price, who now heads up Bigelow\u2019s Centers for Venture Research.",
              "Pairing up with seaweeds might be the trick to buy new businesses a bit of insurance against future conditions, she says.",
              "This autumn, researchers will start the first large-scale project to intentionally plant and grow kelp to suck up carbon dioxide.",

              "8.",
              "Plans call for starting farming an acre of kelp this October.",
              "Ocean waters can be buffered against acids by non-living material, too.",
              "Instead of soaking up carbon dioxide, the strategy here is to add more carbonate to the water.",
              "That shifts the aragonite saturation point and, again, makes it easier for shells to grow.",
              "Nearly every estuary that once had a thriving oyster industry hosts an effort to put old shells back into the water, says Waldbusser.",
              "Most, if not all, of these projects are focused on giving the oysters or other shellfish something to grow on \u2014 their babies prefer to sit on piles of old shells, rather than getting buried or choked by mud.",
              "The fact that these shells help to buffer water acidity is an added bonus.",

              "About 196 million bushels of dredged oyster shells were put back into Chesapeake Bay from 1960 until 2006, before the project coordinators ran low on shells.",
              "They\u2019re still about 100 million bushels short of where the Chesapeake\u2019s ecology would have been had oysters not been extracted for centuries, notes Waldbusser, and the effects on the bay\u2019s complex water chemistry have so far been hard to track.",
              "But that doesn\u2019t mean that shells can\u2019t shift pH significantly under different conditions.",
              "In previous work off the coast of Maine, Waldbusser\u2019s team, led by Mark Green of Saint Joseph\u2019s College of Maine, mixed old ground-up shells with ocean sediments and replanted them.",
              "They then looked to see how that affected oysters.",
              "Three times as many oyster larvae settled in the shell-rich soils as in the non-shelled soils, they found.",
              "The reason, Waldbusser thinks, is because of a change in water acidity within the pores of the sediment.",
              "ALSO FROM YALE e360Examining How Marine Life Might Adapt to Acidified Oceans \u201cYou have this incredibly hostile environment in the pore water, which is generally more acidic than the overlying water,\u201d says Waldbusser.",

              "He wrote a proposal to use the waste CO2 emitted from a hatchery to dissolve calcium carbonate rocks and bubble the products back into the ocean, helping to buffer acidity in much the same way as is done in home aquariums. But it didn\u2019t get funded.",
              "\u201cThere are lots of technologies that exist and things you can do, but it comes back to scalability and unintended consequences,\u201d says Waldbusser.",
              "Using rocks to buffer ocean water, for example, involves using energy to treat the minerals beforehand so they dissolve, and then you have to worry about toxic levels of nickel or cadmium hitching a ride along with the rocks.",

              "Once there, the carbon dioxide goes through a series of chemical changes that have an acidifying effect on seawater.",
              "In addition to making seawater more acidic, these chemical reactions also reduce the amount of carbonate in seawater - an essential building block for the ocean\u2019s shell-building organisms. Carbonate is similarly used by coral reefs to form their white skeletons and fish to produce their ear bones.",
              "As carbon dioxide continues to infiltrate seawater, the associated loss of carbonate makes it much more challenging for these carbonate-dependent marine animals to build their protective structures.",
              "The lack of carbonate in seawater can become so severe that it can even cause mussel shells, fish ear bones, and coral reef skeletons to dissolve.",

              "For the many marine organisms that live within California\u2019s seagrass beds, including the commercially important Dungeness Crab and Olympia oyster, seagrass\u2019s ability to reduce the effects of ocean acidification could benefit ecosystems and the fishing industry, but only if we protect the seagrass we have and restore the seagrass we\u2019ve lost.",

              "When placed in seagrass beds, anchors can rip up this important underwater vegetation.",
              "While seagrass is challenging and expensive to restore, restoration is possible.",

              "In San Francisco Bay, efforts are underway to restore seagrass beds alongside oyster reefs.",
              "Still, retaining the seagrass we have left is vital.",
              "In addition to the underwater plant\u2019s potential to lessen the impact of ocean acidification on marine life living within these underwater grasslands, seagrass removes carbon from the atmosphere over 30 times faster than tropical rainforests.",
              "Once stored, this carbon does not contribute to climate change unless the seagrass is destroyed.",
              "In other words, the loss of seagrass both removes an important way in which carbon dioxide can be sucked out of the atmosphere and releases the carbon the seagrass already tucked away.",
              "With this new evidence of seagrass\u2019s ability to reduce the effects of ocean acidification, we have yet another reason to prioritize the protection and restoration of the world\u2019s seagrass meadows."

              "They are often confused with seaweeds, but are actually more closely related to the flowering plants that you see on land.",

              "Work is ongoing around the world to restore these important ecosystems. Even though seagrasses and seaweeds look superficially similar, they are very different organisms. Seagrasses belong to a group of plants called monocotyledons that include grasses, lilies and palms. Like their relatives, seagrasses have leaves, roots and veins, and produce flowers and seeds.",
              "Chloroplasts in their tissues use the sun's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen for growth through the process of photosynthesis.",
              "Veins transport nutrients and water throughout the plant, and have little air pockets called lacunae that help keep the leaves buoyant and exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the plant.",
              "Like other flowering plants, their roots can absorb nutrients.",
              "Unlike flowering plants on land, however, they lack stomata\u2014the tiny pores on leaves that open and close to control water and gas exchange.",
              "Instead, they have a thin cuticle layer, which allows gasses and nutrients to diffuse directly into and out of the leaves from the water.",
              "The roots and rhizomes (thicker horizontal stems) of seagrasses extend into the sediment of the seafloor and are used to store and absorb nutrients, as well as anchor the plants.",
              "In contrast, seaweeds (algae) are much simpler organisms. They have no flowers or veins, and their holdfasts simply attach to the bottom and are generally not specialized to take in nutrients.",
              "Scientists are studying what genes were lost and which were regained as seagrasses evolved from algae in the sea to plants on land, and then transitioned back to the sea.",
              "The entire genome of one seagrass, the eelgrass Zostera marina, was sequenced in 2016, helping us understand how these plants adapted to life in the sea, how they may respond to climate warming, and the evolution of salt tolerance in crop plants.",
              "Seagrasses grow in salty and brackish (semi-salty) waters around the world, typically along gently sloping, protected coastlines.",
              "Because they depend on light for photosynthesis, they are most commonly found in shallow depths where light levels are high.",
              "Many seagrass species live in depths of 3 to 9 feet (1 to 3 meters), but the deepest growing seagrass (Halophila decipiens) has been found at depths of 190 feet (58 meters).",
              "While most coastal regions are dominated by one or a few seagrass species, regions in the tropical waters of the Indian and western Pacific oceans have the highest seagrass diversity with as many as 14 species growing together.",
              "Antarctica is the only continent without seagrasses.",
              "Seagrasses grow both vertically and horizontally\u2014their blades reach upwards and their roots down and sideways\u2014to capture sunlight and nutrients from the water and sediment.",
              "They spread by two methods: asexual clonal growth and sexual reproduction.",
              "Asexual Clonal Growth: Similar to grasses on land, seagrass shoots are connected underground by a network of large root-like structures called rhizomes.",
              "The rhizomes can spread under the sediment and send up new shoots.",
              "When this happens, many stems within the same meadow can actually be part of the same plant and will have the same genetic code\u2014which is why it is called clonal growth.",
              "In fact, the oldest known plant is a clone of the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica, which may be up to 200,000 years old, dating back to the ice ages of the late Pleistocene.",
              "In some seagrass species, a meadow can develop from a single plant in less than a year, while in slow-growing species like Posidonia it can take hundreds of years.",
              "Sexual Reproduction: Seagrasses reproduce sexually like terrestrial grasses, but pollination for seagrasses is completed with the help of water.",
              "Male seagrass flowers release pollen from structures called stamens into the water.",
              "Seagrasses produce the longest pollen grains on the planet (up to 5mm long compared to under 0.",
              "1mm for land plants typically), and this pollen often collects into stringy clumps.",
              "The clumps are moved by currents until they land on the pistil of a female flower and fertilization takes place.",
              "There is also evidence that small invertebrates, such as amphipods (tiny shrimp-like crustaceans) and polychaetes (marine worms), feed on the pollen of one seagrass (Thalassia testudinum), which could help to fertilize the flowers in a way similar to how insects pollinate flowers on land.",
              "Self-pollination happens in some grass species, which can reduce genetic variation.",
              "Individual seagrass plants avoid this by producing only male or female flowers, or by producing the male and female flowers at different times.",
              "Just like land grasses, fertilized seagrass flowers develop seeds.",
              "Seagrass seeds are neutrally buoyant and can float many miles before they settle onto the soft seafloor and germinate to form a new plant.",
              "A few seagrass species such as the surfgrass Phylospadix can settle and live on rocky shores.",
              "Animals that eat seagrass seeds\u2014including fish and turtles\u2014may incidentally aid with their dispersal and germination if the seeds pass through their digestive tracks and remain viable.",
              "The 72 species of seagrasses are commonly divided into four main groups: Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae, Posidoniaceae and Cymodoceaceae.",
              "Their common names, like eelgrass, turtle grass, tape grass, shoal grass, and spoon grass, reflect their many shapes and sizes and roles in marine ecosystems. Seagrasses range from species with long flat blades that look like ribbons to fern or paddle-shaped leaves, cylindrical or spaghetti blades, or branching shoots.",

              "Seagrasses are often called foundation plant species or ecosystem engineers because they modify their environments to create unique habitats.",
              "These modifications not only make coastal habitats more suitable for the seagrasses themselves, but also have important effects on other animals and provide ecological functions and a variety of services for humans.",
              "Seagrasses have been used by humans for over 10,000 years.",
              "They've been used to fertilize fields, insulate houses, weave furniture, thatch roofs, make bandages, and fill mattresses and even car seats.",
              "But it's what they do in their native habitat that has the biggest benefits for humans and the ocean.",
              "Seagrasses support commercial fisheries and biodiversity, clean the surrounding water and help take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.",
              "Because of these benefits, seagrasses are believed to be the third most valuable ecosystem in the world (only preceded by estuaries and wetlands).",
              "One hectare of seagrass (about two football fields) is estimated to be worth over $19,000 per year, making them one of the most valuable ecosystems on the planet.",
              "Seagrasses are known as the \"lungs of the sea\" because one square meter of seagrass can generate 10 liters of oxygen every day through photosynthesis.",
              "Seagrass leaves also absorb nutrients and slow the flow of water, capturing sand, dirt and silt particles.",
              "Their roots trap and stabilize the sediment, which not only helps improve water clarity and quality, but also reduces erosion and buffers coastlines against storms. Seagrasses can further improve water quality by absorbing nutrients in runoff from the land.",
              "In nutrient poor regions, the seagrass plants themselves help nutrient cycling by taking up nutrients from the soil and releasing them into the water through their leaves, acting as a nutrient pump.",
              "Seagrasses are often called nursery habitats because the leafy underwater canopy they create provides shelter for small invertebrates (like crabs and shrimp and other types of crustaceans), small fish and juveniles of larger fish species.",
              "Many species of algae and microalgae (such as diatoms), bacteria and invertebrates grow as \u201cepiphytes\u201d directly on living seagrass leaves, much like lichens and Spanish moss grow on trees.",
              "Other invertebrates grow nestled between the blades or in the sediments\u2014such as sponges, clams, polychaete worms and sea anemones.",
              "The accumulation of smaller organisms amongst and on the seagrass blades, as well as the seagrass itself, attracts bigger animals.",
              "As a result, seagrasses can be home to many types of fish, sharks, turtles, marine mammals (dugongs and manatees), mollusks (octopus, squid, cuttlefish, snails, bivalves), sponges, crustaceans (shrimp, crabs, copepods, isopods and amphipods) polychaete worms, sea urchins and sea anemones\u2014and the list goes on.",
              "Some of these organisms are permanent residents in seagrass meadows, while others are temporary visitors.",
              "A single acre of seagrass can support upwards of 40,000 fish and 50 million small invertebrates, and there are often tens to hundreds more animals in a seagrass bed compared to adjacent bare sandy areas.",
              "Hundreds of species live in the seagrass near the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce in Florida.",
              "A number of the species that depend on seagrasses are important for commercial and recreational fisheries.",
              "In fact, in all regions of the world fishermen will specifically seek out seagrass beds for their abundance of fish.",
              "It is because of the wide variety of different species that live amongst the grasses that seagrass beds often form important \"biodiversity hotspots.\"",
              "Not only do seagrasses support a diversity of marine life, but populations of a given seagrass species can themselves be very genetically diverse and this diversity itself is linked to higher animal abundances.",
              "Understanding how seagrass genotypic diversity does this is an active area of research.",
              "Seagrass beds are important feeding grounds for thousands of species around the world, and they support this diverse food web in three different ways.",
              "Some organisms\u2014primarily large grazers like manatees, dugongs, green sea turtles and geese\u2014eat the living leaves directly, and seagrass forms a major component of their diets.",
              "For example, an adult dugong eats about 64 to 88 pounds (28 to 40 kg) of seagrass a day, while an adult green sea turtle can eat about 4.",
              "5 pounds (2 kg) per day.",
              "Many of these large grazers are endangered, in large part because of habitat destruction and hunting, but once they were very common.",
              "It's estimated that before Europeans settled the Americas in the 1400's, the number of green sea turtles supported by seagrass meadows was 15 to 20 times the number and biomass of large hooved animals in the Serengeti Desert alive today.",
              "These abundant large grazers probably kept seagrass meadows cropped short like a putting green.",
              "The epiphytic organisms growing on the surface of the seagrass blades provide other sources of food.",
              "Some epiphytic bacteria can extract nitrogen from the environment and make it available to larger animals.",
              "Small invertebrate mesograzers, such as crustaceans and snails, feed on epiphytes, and in doing so can help keep the seagrass clean, acting as mutualistic partners (or housekeepers) that promote seagrass growth.",
              "They are in turn consumed by larger crustaceans, fish and birds and are important links in the coastal food web.",
              "But, this partnership isn't always positive.",
              "Occasionally when some mesograzer species are at very high densities they can create thick masses of mucus and sediment tubes that block light to the seagrass leaves, and they can even eat the seagrass directly.",

              "As parts of the seagrass plants and associated organisms die and decay, they can collect on the seafloor and become buried, trapped in the sediment.",
              "It has been estimated that in this way the world's seagrass meadows can capture up to 83 million metric tons of carbon each year.",
              "The carbon stored in sediments from coastal ecosystems including seagrass meadows, mangrove forests and salt marshes is known as \"blue carbon\" because it is stored in the sea.",
              "While seagrasses occupy only 0.",
              "1 percent of the total ocean floor, they are estimated to be responsible for up to 11 percent of the organic carbon buried in the ocean.",
              "One acre of seagrass can sequester 740 pounds of carbon per year (83 g carbon per square meter per year), the same amount emitted by a car traveling around 3,860 miles (6,212 km).",

              "In a 2011 assessment, nearly one quarter of all seagrass species for which information was adequate to judge were threatened (endangered or vulnerable) or near threatened using the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria.",
              "This is especially worrying because seagrass losses are projected to have severe impacts on marine biodiversity, the health of other marine ecosystems, and on human livelihoods.",
              "Additionally, some threatened marine species such as sea turtles and marine mammals live in seagrass habitats and rely on them for food.",
              "For every seagrass species there is on average more than one associated threatened marine species.",
              "In fact, the only marine plant listed as endangered in the United States is a seagrass (Halophila johnsonii) found in Florida.",
              "Seagrasses are vulnerable to physical disturbances, such as wind-driven waves and storms. Some animals, such as skates and rays, disturb the rhizomes and roots of seagrasses, ripping up the seagrass as they forage for buried clams and other invertebrates.",
              "However, the direct and indirect effects of human activities account for most losses of seagrass beds in recent decades.",
              "Some fast growing seagrass meadows are able to rebound from disturbances, but many grow slowly over the course of centuries and are likely to be slow to recover and are thus most vulnerable.",
              "Nutrients, such as those from fertilizers and pollution, wash off the land and into the water, causing algal blooms that block sunlight necessary for seagrass growth.",
              "Sediment washing into the water from agriculture and land development can also damage seagrass beds by both smothering the seagrass and blocking sunlight.",
              "Similarly, dredging can both directly remove seagrass plants and cause lower light levels because of increased amounts of sediments in the water.",
              "Boat anchors and propellers can leave \"scars\" in a seagrass bed\u2014killing sections of the seagrass and fragmenting the habitat.",
              "This fragmentation of seagrass beds can increase erosion around the edges, as well as influence animal use and movement within the seagrass bed.",
              "Disease has also devastated seagrasses.",
              "In the early 1930s, a large die-off of up to 90 percent of all eelgrass (Zostera marina) growing in temperate North America was attributed to a \"wasting disease\".",
              "This die-off was so severe that a small snail specialized to live on eelgrass went extinct as a result.",
              "The disease was caused by the slime mold-like protist, Labyrinthula zosterae, which also ravaged eelgrass populations in Europe.",
              "This disease still affects eelgrass populations in the Atlantic and has contributed to some recent losses, though none as catastrophic as in the 1930s.",
              "Eelgrass leaves that are weak or stressed are more susceptible to the disease, developing brown spots and lesions that reduce the plant's ability to photosynthesize, eventually killing the plant.",
              "Healthy plants are thought to be resistant to the disease, indicating importance of reducing other stressors like pollution.",
              "Lower seawater salinity may also increase susceptibility to the Labyrinthula pathogen.",
              "Episodes of warm seawater temperatures can also damage seagrasses.",
              "Temperature affects how enzymes and metabolism work, influencing how organisms grow.",
              "Rising water temperatures tend to increase rates of seagrass respiration (using up oxygen) faster than rates of photosynthesis (producing oxygen), which makes them more susceptible to grazing by herbivores.",
              "Increased temperature also increases seagrass light requirements, influences how quickly seagrasses can take up nutrients in their environment, and can make seagrasses more susceptible to disease.",
              "Large eelgrass declines have been observed in the Chesapeake Bay in years in which water temperatures have persisted for several days above 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F), the thermal limit for this species.",
              "Removal of fish can also lead to seagrass death by disrupting important components of the food web.",
              "When large predators are removed, intermediate predators can become more abundant, and they in turn cause the decline of the smaller organisms that keep the blades of the seagrasses clean.",
              "This has been observed most strikingly in the Baltic sea with the disappearance of cod due to overfishing and corresponding increases in smaller fishes and crustaceans which limited epiphyte-grazing invertebrates, resulting in seagrass decline.",
              "In addition to the small epiphytic algae, larger algae also compete with seagrasses, and introduced invasive seaweed species can displace native seagrass species.",
              "One important example is the invasion of Caulerpa taxifolia, a seaweed nicknamed \"the killer algae.\"",
              "Released into the Mediterranean in the 1980s from aquaria, by 2000 it covered more than 131 square kilometers (50 square miles) of the Mediterranean coastline, overgrowing and replacing the native Neptune seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) and reducing the ecosystem's biodiversity.",
              "Since then, invasive Caulerpa has been found in California and southwestern Australia where eradication programs are in place to prevent its spread.",
              "Most management that protects seagrasses focuses on maintaining their biodiversity and the services these habitats provide for humans and ecosystems. There is no international legislation for seagrasses, and so protection typically occurs by local and regional agencies.",
              "Actions taken to help seagrasses include limiting damaging practices such as excessive trawling and dredging, runoff pollution and harmful fishing practices (such as dynamite or cyanide fishing).",
              "There are also attempts to rebuild and restore seagrass beds, often by planting seeds or seedlings grown in aquaria, or transplanting adult seagrasses from other healthy meadows.",
              "Some of the most successful restoration stories come from the Chesapeake Bay and coastal Virginia in the Eastern United States where, through 2014, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science has seeded 456 acres with 7.",
              "65 million seagrass seeds.",
              "As of 2015, the seagrass Zostera marina has increased from these seeded plots to cover 6,195 acres.",
              "Seagrass restoration in Tampa Bay, Florida, has also experienced important success including improvements in water quality and the associated fish community.",
              "For restoration to work, it is critical that the causes of the original decline in seagrasses have been eliminated.",
              "However, seagrass populations globally are still in trouble.",
              "Some simple steps everyone can take to help seagrasses and other marine habitats include: don't litter, limit the amount of fertilizer and pesticides you use, don't dump anything hazardous down the drain, be careful when boating by going slow and avoiding shallow areas, and support local conservation efforts.",
              "Because of their ecologic importance and global distribution, seagrass are important study systems for understanding how coastal habitats work and respond to environmental changes.",

              "In addition to making seawater more acidic, these chemical reactions also reduce the amount of carbonate in seawater - an essential building block for the ocean\u2019s shell-building organisms. Carbonate is similarly used by coral reefs to form their white skeletons and fish to produce their ear bones.",
              "As carbon dioxide continues to infiltrate seawater, the associated loss of carbonate makes it much more challenging for these carbonate-dependent marine animals to build their protective structures.",
              "The lack of carbonate in seawater can become so severe that it can even cause mussel shells, fish ear bones, and coral reef skeletons to dissolve.",
              "Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air and through photosynthesis.",
              "Underwater vegetation, like seagrass meadows and kelp forests, photosynthesize like their land-based relatives.",
              "In the process, this aquatic vegetation removes some of the excess carbon dioxide in the surrounding seawater that causes ocean acidification.",
              "In theory, scientists suspect the removal of carbon dioxide by marine plants and seaweeds could make the seawater around vegetation less acidic than the rest of the ocean.",
              "To test this theory, research led by scientists at UC Davis\u2019 Bodega Marina Laboratory assessed seven seagrass beds along the Northern California coast for six years.",

              "Overall, the seagrass meadows were consistently about 30% less acidic than seagrass-free areas.",
              "For the many marine organisms that live within California\u2019s seagrass beds, including the commercially important Dungeness Crab and Olympia oyster, seagrass\u2019s ability to reduce the effects of ocean acidification could benefit ecosystems and the fishing industry, but only if we protect the seagrass we have and restore the seagrass we\u2019ve lost.",
              "Since the twentieth century, about one-third of the world\u2019s seagrass has been lost.",
              "Seagrass\u2019s global demise is directly related to human activities.",
              "Boats and their anchors destroy seagrass when they drag against the seafloor.",
              "Pollution and channel deepening activities make coastal waters more turbulent, reducing the amount of light that reaches the seagrass\u2019s leaves for photosynthesis.",
              "When placed in seagrass beds, anchors can rip up this important underwater vegetation.",
              "While seagrass is challenging and expensive to restore, restoration is possible.",

              "In San Francisco Bay, efforts are underway to restore seagrass beds alongside oyster reefs.",
              "Still, retaining the seagrass we have left is vital.",
              "In addition to the underwater plant\u2019s potential to lessen the impact of ocean acidification on marine life living within these underwater grasslands, seagrass removes carbon from the atmosphere over 30 times faster than tropical rainforests.",
              "Once stored, this carbon does not contribute to climate change unless the seagrass is destroyed.",
              "In other words, the loss of seagrass both removes an important way in which carbon dioxide can be sucked out of the atmosphere and releases the carbon the seagrass already tucked away.",
              "With this new evidence of seagrass\u2019s ability to reduce the effects of ocean acidification, we have yet another reason to prioritize the protection and restoration of the world\u2019s seagrass meadows."

              "About 196 million bushels of dredged oyster shells were put back into Chesapeake Bay from 1960 until 2006, before the project coordinators ran low on shells.",
              "They\u2019re still about 100 million bushels short of where the Chesapeake\u2019s ecology would have been had oysters not been extracted for centuries, notes Waldbusser, and the effects on the bay\u2019s complex water chemistry have so far been hard to track.",
              "But that doesn\u2019t mean that shells can\u2019t shift pH significantly under different conditions.",
              "In previous work off the coast of Maine, Waldbusser\u2019s team, led by Mark Green of Saint Joseph\u2019s College of Maine, mixed old ground-up shells with ocean sediments and replanted them.",

              "Three times as many oyster larvae settled in the shell-rich soils as in the non-shelled soils, they found.",
              "The reason, Waldbusser thinks, is because of a change in water acidity within the pores of the sediment.",

              "\u201cThere are lots of technologies that exist and things you can do, but it comes back to scalability and unintended consequences,\u201d says Waldbusser.",
              "Using rocks to buffer ocean water, for example, involves using energy to treat the minerals beforehand so they dissolve, and then you have to worry about toxic levels of nickel or cadmium hitching a ride along with the rocks.",
              "In the end, says Waldbusser, \u201cI always come back to restoration.",
              "\u201d Replanting the seagrasses or shell banks that used to exist in an estuary is much safer, and often easier, than some industrial schemes.",

              "The Chesapeake Bay, he notes, has seen the largest oyster reef restoration effort to date and also possibly the largest (and unintentional) ocean acidification buffering experiment.",
              "About 196 million bushels of dredged oyster shells were put back into Chesapeake Bay from 1960 until 2006, before the project coordinators ran low on shells.",
              "They\u2019re still about 100 million bushels short of where the Chesapeake\u2019s ecology would have been had oysters not been extracted for centuries, notes Waldbusser, and the effects on the bay\u2019s complex water chemistry have so far been hard to track.",
              "But that doesn\u2019t mean that shells can\u2019t shift pH significantly under different conditions.",
              "In previous work off the coast of Maine, Waldbusser\u2019s team, led by Mark Green of Saint Joseph\u2019s College of Maine, mixed old ground-up shells with ocean sediments and replanted them.",

              "\u201cThere are lots of technologies that exist and things you can do, but it comes back to scalability and unintended consequences,\u201d says Waldbusser.",
              "Using rocks to buffer ocean water, for example, involves using energy to treat the minerals beforehand so they dissolve, and then you have to worry about toxic levels of nickel or cadmium hitching a ride along with the rocks.",
              "In the end, says Waldbusser, \u201cI always come back to restoration.",
              "\u201d Replanting the seagrasses or shell banks that used to exist in an estuary is much safer, and often easier, than some industrial schemes.",

              "The only ones that thrived were those protected by beds of eelgrass, which seemed to swallow up enough carbon dioxide during the peak of each day to give the oysters a break from acid and a window of opportunity for growth.",

              "Meanwhile, the Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery in Netarts Bay has started only pulling water into their tanks in the afternoon, when photosynthesis peaks and the water is less acidic.",
              "Waldbusser is part of a small team of scientists now exploring the idea that seagrasses, kelps, and shell beds might be able to counteract the rising tide of ocean acidity in local hot spots, making life a little easier for struggling animals.",
              "He and other experts on the West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Science Panel, which released its first report this April, recommended that scientists and managers push forward such strategies to suck CO2 out of the water.",
              "The idea is a smaller, gentler cousin to grander schemes of geo-engineering.",
              "There have been proposals to soak up the ocean\u2019s excess acid by throwing iron, limestone, or olivine into the water, boosting plankton growth, adding the building blocks for shells, or chemically absorbing CO2.",
              "But the general response to such plans usually ranges from head-shaking disbelief that they might be feasible or effective, to widespread concern about the possible ecological side effects.",
              "The energy needed to mine and distribute rocks, and the unpredictable shift in food webs, have made these schemes unappealing on a global scale.",
              "On the local scale, however, lower-cost, lower-risk ecological restoration might have the dual benefit of giving threatened sea creatures both a better place to live and a refuge from ocean acid.",
              "Oysters would not be the only creatures to benefit.",
              "Derek Manzello manages a long-term ocean acidification monitoring site at Cheeca Rocks in the Florida Keys, as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) National Coral Reef Monitoring Program.",
              "That particular patch of coral is one of the only reefs in the Florida Keys that is still growing;",
              "in other reefs, most corals have died from disease and bleaching since the early 1980s.",
              "This is odd because Cheeca Rocks, like other near-shore spots in Florida, sees high temperature swings and large amounts of soil and nutrients dumped into the water, which should limit coral growth.",
              "There are several possible explanations for Cheeca Rocks\u2019 resistance to these problematic conditions, including that the corals there might be genetically adapted to thrive in harsh conditions.",
              "But another possible explanation is that they are living in a low-acidity refuge created by nearby seagrass beds.",
              "In 2012, Manzello showed that Florida\u2019s inshore waters, including where Cheeca Rocks sits, are packed with dissolved aragonite, the material that corals need to grow.",
              "Acids in the water decrease the aragonite saturation value;",
              "if it gets below 1, corals and shells start to dissolve.",

              "\u201cThis is a huge difference,\u201d says Manzello.",
              "The reason is the banks of seagrass growing in Florida\u2019s inshore waters, like turtle grass and manatee grass, that suck up CO2 as they photosynthesize \u2014 particularly in the spring.",
              "Another study out that same year showed the same effect in the tropical Indo-Pacific.",

              "That should give corals about an 18 percent boost in growth, making seagrass a potential tool for marine park managers, the authors write.",
              "The potential is huge.",

              "Yet seagrass ecosystems are being wiped out, thanks to everything from pandemic disease to water pollution and coastal construction projects.",
              "The rate of loss has skyrocketed from less than 1 percent of global seagrass cover per year in the 1970s to 7 percent annually in the 2000s, making seagrasses one of the planet\u2019s most threatened ecosystems. Efforts to restore or farm such plants could have a host of benefits, including soaking up atmospheric carbon.",
              "Waldbusser cautions that many scientists don\u2019t yet know about the effect of seagrasses on ocean chemistry.",
              "Some breeds, like the invasive Zostera japonica eelgrass in Oregon, tend to shed their leaves in the winter, and the degrading plant matter boosts carbon dioxide levels in the water rather than lowering them.",
              "And if the water is swift flowing, then any patches of water made less acidic by plants will likely be swept away before they have a chance to benefit local shellfish or corals.",
              "Seagrasses aren\u2019t the only possible solution.",
              "Kelp is also well known for soaking up excess nutrients and making waters cleaner for shellfish.",
              "Most academic papers looking at the benefits of kelp don\u2019t even mention acidification.",
              "But it didn\u2019t take much for Nichole Price of the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science in Maine to put two and two together.",
              "\u201cThe biggest challenge in land-based kelp nurseries is keeping the pH low enough because they consume so much CO2,\u201d says Price, who wondered how those same photosynthetic algae were affecting ocean waters.",
              "Price teamed up with Ocean Approved, North America\u2019s first commercial kelp farmer, to put instruments inside and outside of its kelp farms to see what was going on.",
              "In as-yet-unpublished work, they show that the aragonite saturation level is half a unit to a full unit higher within the kelp farm.",
              "\u201cThat\u2019s bigger than the change we expect from ocean acidification,\u201d she says.",
              "Next year they plan to map the extent of the impact, and test the effect of the kelp on a mussel farm around the corner.",
              "That farm, says Price, has already started growing kelp based on these preliminary results.",
              "The key, says Price, is to harvest the kelp so that the carbon it extracts gets removed from the ecosystem.",
              "It\u2019s hard to compete with Asian kelp suppliers, but local kelp could be dried and used as food or fertilizer, adding a layer of economic diversity to a struggling coastal economy.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for shellfish aquaculture, but people are really hesitant [because of acidification],\u201d says Price, who now heads up Bigelow\u2019s Centers for Venture Research.",
              "Pairing up with seaweeds might be the trick to buy new businesses a bit of insurance against future conditions, she says.",
              "This autumn, researchers will start the first large-scale project to intentionally plant and grow kelp to suck up carbon dioxide.",
              "The Puget Sound Restoration Fund, based in Bainbridge Island, Washington, won $1.",

              "8.",
              "Plans call for starting farming an acre of kelp this October.",
              "Ocean waters can be buffered against acids by non-living material, too.",
              "Instead of soaking up carbon dioxide, the strategy here is to add more carbonate to the water.",
              "That shifts the aragonite saturation point and, again, makes it easier for shells to grow.",
              "Nearly every estuary that once had a thriving oyster industry hosts an effort to put old shells back into the water, says Waldbusser.",
              "Most, if not all, of these projects are focused on giving the oysters or other shellfish something to grow on \u2014 their babies prefer to sit on piles of old shells, rather than getting buried or choked by mud.",
              "The fact that these shells help to buffer water acidity is an added bonus.",
              "The Chesapeake Bay, he notes, has seen the largest oyster reef restoration effort to date and also possibly the largest (and unintentional) ocean acidification buffering experiment.",
              "About 196 million bushels of dredged oyster shells were put back into Chesapeake Bay from 1960 until 2006, before the project coordinators ran low on shells.",
              "They\u2019re still about 100 million bushels short of where the Chesapeake\u2019s ecology would have been had oysters not been extracted for centuries, notes Waldbusser, and the effects on the bay\u2019s complex water chemistry have so far been hard to track.",
              "But that doesn\u2019t mean that shells can\u2019t shift pH significantly under different conditions.",
              "In previous work off the coast of Maine, Waldbusser\u2019s team, led by Mark Green of Saint Joseph\u2019s College of Maine, mixed old ground-up shells with ocean sediments and replanted them.",
              "They then looked to see how that affected oysters.",
              "Three times as many oyster larvae settled in the shell-rich soils as in the non-shelled soils, they found.",
              "The reason, Waldbusser thinks, is because of a change in water acidity within the pores of the sediment.",
              "ALSO FROM YALE e360Examining How Marine Life Might Adapt to Acidified Oceans \u201cYou have this incredibly hostile environment in the pore water, which is generally more acidic than the overlying water,\u201d says Waldbusser.",

              "\u201d Waldbusser is familiar with other proposed ways of shifting ocean pH.",
              "He wrote a proposal to use the waste CO2 emitted from a hatchery to dissolve calcium carbonate rocks and bubble the products back into the ocean, helping to buffer acidity in much the same way as is done in home aquariums. But it didn\u2019t get funded.",
              "\u201cThere are lots of technologies that exist and things you can do, but it comes back to scalability and unintended consequences,\u201d says Waldbusser.",
              "Using rocks to buffer ocean water, for example, involves using energy to treat the minerals beforehand so they dissolve, and then you have to worry about toxic levels of nickel or cadmium hitching a ride along with the rocks.",
              "In the end, says Waldbusser, \u201cI always come back to restoration.",
              "\u201d Replanting the seagrasses or shell banks that used to exist in an estuary is much safer, and often easier, than some industrial schemes.",

          "Among the ocean-based NETs, artificial ocean alkalinization via the dissolution of Ca(OH)2, known in short as ocean liming, has attracted attention due to its capability of contemporarily addressing two issues: global warming via increased levels of CO2 and ocean acidification.",
          "The alkalinization strategies applied in this study to the Mediterranean Sea illustrate the potential of ocean alkalinization to mitigate climate change by increasing the air-sea flux of CO2 across the basin and counteracting acidification.",
          "Two different approaches of alkalinization scenarios have been explored: one with a constant annual discharge of lime over the entire scenario period and another with gradually increasing alkalinization levels proportional to the pH decreases in the baseline scenario RCP4.",
          "The simulations used in the study suggest the potential of nearly doubling the carbon-dioxide uptake rate of the Mediterranean Sea after 30 years of alkalinization, and of neutralizing the mean surface acidification trend of the baseline scenario without alkalinization over the same time span."
