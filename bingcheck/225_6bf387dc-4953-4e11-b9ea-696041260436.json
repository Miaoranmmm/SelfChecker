              "On the other hand, during development, where PCD appears to be mainly executed by apoptosis, it has been observed that reduction in caspase activity, by enzyme inhibition [332] or by null mutations in gene coding triggering caspases (caspase 9 and caspase 3) [333], does not prevent cell degeneration but causes the switch of PCD from apoptosis to autophagy.",

              "The proteins that participate in regulating the autophagy mechanism are highly conserved on an evolutionary scale.",
              "The autophagic mechanism overlaps with the mechanism for targeting cellular components to the vacuole (or lysosome), Cvt.",
              "However, the main difference is that autophagy is a degradative pathway triggered under fasting conditions, while the Cvt pathway is biosynthetic and occurs under nutrient-rich conditions.",
              "The vacuoles generated in both mechanisms are double-membranes, but those of autophagy are larger [236].",
              "The regulation of the phosphorylation of Atg genes, involved in autophagy, through TOR kinase could be the \u201cswitch\u201d that regulates the transition from the Cvt pathway to the Autophagic pathway under fasting conditions.",
              "Several factors can regulate autophagy: absence of nutrients, absence of growth factors, levels of glucose, amino acids, ROS, stress, aging, infections, etc.",
              "Therefore, autophagy impairment is characteristic of several pathologies of multiple organs, including the brain, muscle, bones, lungs, liver, pancreas, gut, and heart.",

              "The genes for MHC molecules are located on a 1\u20132-Mb stretch of DNA that can comprise dozens of genes, including the genes that encode proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation.",
              "Examples include genes encoding a component of the peptide-loading complex (PLC), which orchestrates peptide translocation and editing, inducibly expressed proteasome subunits and the two subunits of the peptide transporter, all of which are important for antigen presentation via MHC-I molecules, as we discuss later36.",

              "The human MHC and the mouse MHC encode proteins referred to as non-classical MHC-I molecules or MHC-Ib molecules.",
              "These include HLA-E, HLA-F and HLA-G for the human MHC, and Qa-1, TL and related proteins in the mouse18,37,38.",
              "The HLA-E molecules found in rhesus macaques are of particular interest in view of their proposed superior capacity to bind and present a far wider array of peptides than their classical counterparts39.",
              "The MHC of rhesus macaques encodes several such HLA-E-like proteins.",
              "On the other hand, HLA-F is less well studied, and has only recently been suggested to be a ligand for receptors on natural killer cells (NK cells) and to be capable of presenting peptides to T cells40.",

              "Recovery of peptides from purified MHC molecules and the determination of their sequence by mass spectrometry is a technique referred to as \u2018(immuno)peptidomics\u201941.",

              "X-ray structures of MHC molecules can further help define peptide-binding motifs on the basis of their molecular architecture42,43.",
              "Computational methods to predict peptides that can bind to a given MHC allele continue to improve but cannot replace mass spectrometry of recovered peptides and actual binding measurements44.",
              "What are the types of antigens that must be processed for presentation at the cell surface?",
              "The ligands for classical MHC molecules are protein-derived peptides and modified versions of such peptides, for example those containing glycans, phosphates or disulfide-linked substituents19.",
              "Non-classical MHC-I molecules and MHC-I-like molecules sample other classes of molecules, including lipids and small molecules27.",
              "The ensemble of MHC-I and MHC-II ligands is referred to as the \u2018(immuno)peptidome\u2019.",
              "Proteolysis, as will be discussed later herein, is an essential step in the generation of the (immuno)peptidome, and multiple types of proteases contribute.",
              "For lipids, glycolipids and other small molecules presented by MHC-like molecules, the requisite molecular transformations may be on a more limited scale and may require enzymes of types different from those that act on proteins and peptides27.",
              "Stability of MHC\u2013peptide complexes is important to ensure that T cells that recognize them are not led astray.",
              "The absence of an appropriate ligand tends to destabilize MHC-I molecules, both in the case of cell surface-displayed molecules and for those in transit during their synthesis10.",
              "If a source of a ligand is withheld, either genetically or through pharmacological intervention, the assembly and surface expression of MHC-I molecules are compromised to various degrees45.",
              "Should a peptide dissociate, the resulting \u2018empty\u2019 MHC-I molecule assumes a less stable conformation, loses its tightly associated \u03b22-microglobulin subunit and becomes prone to internalization and proteolysis.",
              "Timely destruction of an MHC-I molecule that has lost its ligand reduces the possibility of peptide capture from the circulation or from virus-infected cells in close proximity.",
              "Peptide capture in trans, as distinct from peptides being sourced internally from the same cell that displays the MHC-I molecule in question, entails the risk of inviting inappropriate attack by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.",
              "Continuous protein turnover ensures that changes in gene expression are reported out by the affected cell as an altered MHC-I peptidome.",
              "By contrast, the biosynthesis of MHC-II molecules yields exceptionally stable peptide\u2013MHC-II complexes that do not usually serve as a target for cytotoxic T cells and may not require such a molecular timer for self-immolation46.",
              "Over time, MHC-II molecules on antigen-presenting cells may thus activate many appropriately specific T cells.",
              "Recognition of an MHC-I\u2013peptide complex on a virus-infected cells by a single CD8+ cytotoxic T cell is all that is needed to eliminate that target47.",
              "The antigen processing and presentation pathways fit our understanding of biochemical and cell biological pathways common to all eukaryotes.",
              "MHC molecules are dispensable for survival of the cell that expresses them, which has facilitated the analysis of their biosynthesis and intracellular trafficking48,49.",
              "The division between the cytosol (and its topologically equivalent compartments) and the extracellular space (and its topological equivalents) is a helpful first distinction to understand why there are the two major classes of MHC molecule.",
              "To a first approximation, MHC-I molecules exploit the products of cytosolic proteolysis (with fine-tuning in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)), whereas MHC-II molecules mostly sample the extracellular world, by presenting antigens captured and processed in endolysosomal compartments4.",
              "Compartmentalization of proteolysis and the distinct intracellular distributions of MHC molecules are the primary drivers of antigen processing and presentation.",
              "The entire process can be broken down into six discrete steps, which we summarize next.",
              "Cells engaged in MHC-II-restricted presentation acquire antigens through phagocytosis and endocytosis, processes in which receptors with various degrees of specificity participate46,50.",
              "These include the B cell receptor (BCR) for an antigen, the mannose receptor, complement receptors, Fc receptors and probably scavenger receptors, all of which deliver the captured antigen to the various compartments of the endocytic pathway51.",
              "The BCR or surface immunoglobulin is a special case: not only does the BCR deliver an activation signal to B cells when it binds an antigen, it also internalizes the resulting immune complex for processing and presentation via MHC-II molecules as a call for CD4+ T cell help52,53.",
              "Decoration of antigens with antibodies or covalent modification with components of the complement pathway (opsonization) can facilitate antigen acquisition via Fc and complement receptors.",
              "Macropinocytosis and micropinocytosis deliver captured extracellular fluid and its contents to endocytic compartments54.",
              "Finally, autophagy targets damaged cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria to a lysosomal compartment for degradation55.",
              "Autophagy can also capture cytoplasmic viral replication machineries and therefore the viral products they contain.",
              "From an immunological perspective, the endolysosomal pathway should be viewed as a series of interconnected compartments, all of which can serve as a source of MHC ligands.",
              "Under homeostatic conditions, proteins that face or reside in the extracellular space, including membrane proteins, are continuously internalized and turned over through delivery to endolysosomal compartments.",
              "Consequently, in the absence of an infection with a pathogen, the source of peptide ligands for MHC-II molecules is the host\u2019s own proteins and possibly those obtained from commensals and ingested food56,57.",
              "The MHC-I-like molecules of the CD1 family (CD1a\u2013CD1e in humans;",
              "CD1d in mice) behave like MHC-II molecules in their trafficking behaviour and traverse endolysosomal compartments58 (Fig.",
              "2c).",
              "Members of the CD1 family present a heterogeneous set of lipids, often mimicked in experimental settings by the artificial CD1 ligand \u03b1-galactosyl ceramide59.",
              "CD1 ligands are acquired from an external source via lipoprotein receptors or generated endogenously through metabolic conversion of the appropriate precursor molecules60.",
              "MHC-I molecules sample the proteome of MHC-I-positive cells.",
              "Cytosolic proteins are also continuously turning over, albeit at widely different rates, and this involves proteolysis, predominantly by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system61.",
              "All nucleated cells express MHC-I molecules or can be induced to do so62.",
              "Replication of viral pathogens occurs in nucleated cells, which are capable of nucleic acid and protein synthesis, unlike red blood cells or platelets.",
              "In the case of a virus infection, viral protein synthesis contributes to the proteome of the infected cell and serves as a source of antigens for MHC-I molecules63.",
              "Proteins in the extracellular space or its equivalents can also contribute to peptides presented by MHC-I molecules.",
              "This is referred to as \u2018cross-presentation\u2019 and is discussed in more detail later64.",
              "Membrane and secreted proteins that fail to pass quality control in the ER are expelled into the cytosol in a process referred to as \u2018dislocation\u2019 or \u2018ER-associated degradation\u201965.",
              "These discarded proteins likewise contribute to the pool of antigens sampled by MHC-I molecules.",
              "Non-classical MHC-I molecules include HLA-E and its murine counterpart Qa-1, which predominantly present ligands derived from signal peptides66.",
              "These ligands are created in the ER through the combined action of signal peptidase and signal peptide peptidase.",
              "MHC-II molecules mostly rely on lysosomal proteolysis to convert proteins into peptides suitable for presentation11,56.",
              "The MHC-II presentation pathway exploits physico-chemical means to tag proteins for degradation.",
              "The protease-rich compartments of the endocytic pathway are acidified to various degrees by H+-pumping vacuolar ATPases.",
              "The resulting drop in pH can destabilize proteins not specifically designed to survive at acidic pH.",
              "Subtle changes in pH may also affect the outcome of proteolysis.",
              "What are believed to be the processing compartments in dendritic cells are less acidic than, for example, lysosomes in macrophages, a trait that may favour the generation of MHC-II ligands67.",
              "Endocytic compartments are also rich in reduced glutathione.",
              "This creates an environment that promotes reduction of disulfide bonds that stabilize many secreted and extracellular proteins.",
              "An interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3)-inducible oxidoreductase, GILT, assists in the reduction of S\u2013S bonds68.",
              "The combination of low pH and a reducing environment helps unfold proteins, making them better substrates for endolysosomal proteases.",
              "For MHC-I molecules, those proteins that serve as a source of MHC-I ligands are tagged for degradation by ubiquitylation for entry into the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system.",
              "How do proteins enter that pathway?",
              "Errors in translation are manifold.",
              "Misacylation of tRNAs, misreading of a codon, translational frameshifts, failure to remove introns from pre-mRNA, inappropriate initiation of translation, premature translational stops, a failure of nascent chains to engage chaperones in a timely manner, missing partner subunits and oxidative damage can all create defective polypeptides (defective ribosomal products) that must be cleared to prevent them from exerting harmful effects69,70,71,72,73.",
              "Frameshifts not only yield defective translation products with a high probability of misfolding and susceptibility to proteolysis, but in a tumour setting they might also serve as a source of neoantigens because of the aberrant sequence introduced by the frameshift.",
              "Recall that secretory and membrane proteins that fail to fold correctly in the ER are subject to dislocation to the cytosol.",
              "The ubiquitin\u2013proteasome machinery recognizes all these misfits and rapidly destroys them, presumably because they display structural features distinct from their properly folded counterparts74,75.",
              "The ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system evolved to deal with the complexity of the proteome, which is reflected in the make-up of the machinery responsible for covalent attachment of the 76-residue protein modifier ubiquitin76.",
              "It comprises a cascade of E1, E2 and many (hundreds of) E3-type ubiquitin ligase activities77.",
              "The rules that govern protein (mis)folding and degradation apply to host proteins and pathogen-derived proteins alike.",
              "As is the case for MHC-II molecules, in the absence of an intruder, the sets of proteins tagged for degradation are the host\u2019s own proteins4.",
              "Upon infection with a virus, host cells will make errors in translation or folding in both cellular and viral proteins.",
              "Both will therefore contribute to the immunopeptidome.",
              "The built-in timer of turnover of MHC-I molecules further ensures that the bound immunopeptidome reflects changes in gene expression in the MHC-I-expressing cell10.",
              "Proteolysis by lysosomal proteases and proteasomes generally involves the formation of acyl-enzyme reaction intermediates.",
              "Hydrolysis is the resolution of such covalent intermediates in a nucleophilic attack by a water molecule.",

              "Indeed, although it is well accepted that autophagy is important in many diseases, until now, the majority of clinical studies that involve deliberate attempts to manipulate autophagy are in cancer therapy, almost always in patients with advanced disease.",

              "For example, decreased autophagy is associated with infiltration of regulatory T cells that suppress the immune system and decrease effective immunosurveillance allowing for increased tumor initiation [3].",
              "Once malignant cancers are fully established, increased autophagy enables tumor cell survival and growth [2, 4].",
              "Thus, in premalignant lesions, enhancing autophagy might prevent cancer [5].",
              "Conversely, in advanced cancers, while both enhancing autophagy and inhibiting it have been proposed as therapeutic strategies [4, 6, 7], clinical interventions to deliberately manipulate autophagy in cancer therapy are already underway [7] with the vast majority focused on inhibiting autophagy.",
              "These studies focus on blocking the recycling mechanism of autophagy to prevent the renewal of cellular proteins and other molecules that help cancer cells survive under stressful conditions such as hypoxia [8,9,10], nutrient deprivation [11, 12] and to enhance other cancer treatments including chemotherapy [13] and radiation [14].",
              "Autophagy can have both tumor cell autonomous and non-autonomous promoting effects on tumor growth [15] and both the degradative process of autophagy itself related but distinct degradative processes as well as non-degradative activities of the autophagy machinery can affect tumor cell behavior [16].",

              "In this review, we focus on how we may be able to leverage our understanding of these interactions and mechanisms to better harness the power of autophagy manipulation in cancer care.",
              "Macroautophagy (referred to hereafter as autophagy) is a highly conserved catabolic process with the formation of double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes that engulf cellular proteins and organelles for delivery to the lysosome [17, 18] (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "Autophagy occurs at a basal level in all cells and can be induced by various signals and cellular stresses [7].",
              "Autophagy related (ATG) genes are evolutionarily conserved and tightly regulate the production of autophagosomes [18], which is divided into five distinct stages: initiation, nucleation of the autophagosome, expansion and elongation of the autophagosome membrane, closure and fusion with the lysosome, and degradation of intravesicular products.",
              "This breakdown of stages is important as each stage has a subset of potential therapeutic targets for inhibiting autophagy in humans.",
              "Importantly, while blocking autophagy at any stage should be similarly effective at preventing degradation of autophagic cargos, recent work raises the possibility that biological effects on tumor cell behavior may be different when the autophagy pathway is blocked at different stages.",
              "The process of autophagy is divided into five distinct stages: initiation, nucleation, expansion and elongation, closure and fusion, and cargo degradation.",
              "Each stage has potential clinical targets.",

              "Expansion and elongation are mediated by ubiquitin-like conjugation systems with conjugation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to LC3-II facilitated by the protease, ATG4B, and the E1-like enzyme, ATG7, resulting in LC3-II incorporation into the growing membrane.",
              "Multiple ATG4B inhibitors are in pre-clinical development.",
              "Finally, fusion of the autophagosome and lysosome as well as degradation of intravesicular products can be inhibited through the use of lysosomal targeted agents such as CQ and HCQ, which are already in clinical use and under investigation in clinical trials.",
              "Additionally, more potent drugs are in preclinical development that target the lysosome and the lysosomal enzyme PPT1.",
              "Initiation can be impeded at the activation complex which involves potential targets including the protein kinases ULK1and ULK2 [19, 20] and a scaffolding protein FIP200 [21].",
              "A class III PI3K complex, also important for initiation, includes the potential targets VPS34 [22,23,24] (also known as PIK3C3) and Beclin 1, a putative tumor suppressor [25].",
              "Expansion of the autophagosome proceeds as the LC3 and GABARAP families of proteins are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and added to the growing membrane.",
              "This part of the process can be interrupted by targeting the ATG4 family of proteases [26], which cleave LC3/GABARAP family members to allow them to undergo a lipid conjugation reaction that requires an E1-like enzyme ATG7.",
              "It is also theoretically possible to target the conjugation machinery with an ATG7 inhibitor.",

              "The contents of the autophagosome, including cargo proteins and organelles, are eventually degraded following fusion with a lysosome and the creation of the autophagolysosome.",
              "This is where currently clinically available drugs including chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) inhibit autophagy by decreasing autophagosome/lysosome fusion [30].",
              "Newer drugs are also in development to target this stage including lys05 [31], a bisaminoquinoline, and DQ661, a unique inhibitor of autophagy and mTOR that is much more lysosome-specific than the current widely used drugs like CQ [32].",
              "In most discussions, autophagy is synonymous for macroautophagy (as it is throughout this article).",
              "But, there are other important forms of autophagy that should be understood and considered when thinking of development of new cancer therapies.",

              "The chaperone complex translocates into the lysosome via the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A, LAMP2A [33, 34].",
              "CMA has been implicated in cancer with inhibition of LAMP2A resulting in decreased tumor growth and metastasis [35].",
              "However, as with macroautophagy, CMA\u2019s effects in cancer also appear to be context dependent.",
              "For example, CMA has also been shown to reduce MYC by regulating its proteasomal degradation, suggesting a tumor suppressive role of CMA in normal tissues [36].",
              "Importantly, some of the currently proposed therapeutic interventions designed to inhibit macroautophagy (those that target the lysosome) might also affect CMA, whereas others (e.",
              "g., those affecting the ULK1/2 initiation complex) should not.",
              "Selective macroautophagy is used to remove specific cellular components [37] and targeting specific selective autophagy processes may represent a way to more selectively achieve therapeutic effects with autophagy manipulations.",
              "Cargo adaptors such as Sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) target specific substrates to autophagosomes, including specific proteins and complexes of proteins, organelles including peroxisomes, mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum and other organisms such as bacteria.",
              "These cargos are often selected by adaptor recognition of polyubiquitinated molecules followed by binding of the adaptor to LC3 via LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) that bind hydrophobic pockets on LC3 (LIR-docking sites).",
              "Iron homeostasis is in part controlled by selective autophagy as well [38], but through a somewhat different mechanism.",
              "When cells sense that they are deficient in iron, ferritin is degraded by autophagy.",
              "The co-activator 4 (NCOA4) binds ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) molecules resulting in delivery to autophagosomes and release of iron into the cell [38].",
              "Interestingly, however, NCOA4 does not contain a conventional LIR [37].",
              "Identification of alternative LC3-binding proteins (also known as ATG8-binding proteins in lower eukaryotes) has grown substantially in recent years [39].",
              "Ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) have been shown to have high-affinity binding to ATG8 through recently described UIM-docking sites (UDS), a receptor binding patch on ATG8.",
              "This is important in the degradation of targets such as CDC48/p97, an essential segregase that extracts proteins from membranes or multi-subunit complexes [39].",
              "Mutations within CDC48/p97 have been implicated in diseases such as Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [40] and recycling of this protein through autophagy potentially influences the development or severity of such diseases [39].",
              "A better understanding of the mechanisms behind such targeted autophagy could enable us to make inhibitors that would block specific cargo from being taken in to autophagosomes in cancer cells, as well as other diseases, and could provide new ways to more selectively target autophagy for therapeutic benefit (Table 1).",
              "One potential approach of targeting autophagy is blocking the early stages of initiation and elongation through regulators such as ULK1 [19, 41], VPS34 [22, 23, 42] and ATG4B [26].",
              "ULK1 and ULK2 are the only serine/threonine kinases in the autophagy pathway making them a prime potential target [43].",
              "There are various ATP-competitive inhibitors against ULK1 kinase [44] including the selective SBI-0206965 (SBI) [43].",
              "SBI inhibits autophagy and synergizes with mTOR inhibition [43] and other standard chemotherapies [20].",
              "SBI also effectively induces a cytotoxic apoptotic response in lung cancer during nutrient starvation [19].",
              "This is important as solid tumors often have hypoxic and nutrient-deficient centers [45].",
              "Similarly, inhibitors of VPS34, such as VPS34-IN1 [22] and SB02024 [46], have been developed.",
              "SB02024 was shown to successfully block autophagy as well as reduce xenograft models of breast cancer as well as synergize with other therapies in vitro [46].",

              "It can be thought of as the body\u2019s recycling system that replaces and repairs damaged components.",
              "This helps to ensure that all cells remain in optimal functioning condition.",
              "When cells are constantly refreshed through autophagy, the body can conserve the energy it would normally use to generate new cells.",
              "Autophagy also allows healthy cells to better adapt to external stressors, such as nutrient deprivation, infections, or DNA damage.",
              "This keeps the body protected from neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and diseases like cancer.",
              "Inducing autophagy can have a number of potential benefits that can improve your overall well-being.",

              "Autophagy has also shown potential for preventing diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease.",
              "These diseases are characterized by the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates within neurons, which autophagy can help remove.",
              "In neurodegenerative diseases, misfolded proteins accumulate and disrupt normal cellular functions.",
              "Autophagy plays a crucial role in identifying and removing these misfolded proteins, preventing their toxic buildup.",
              "It can also replace these proteins with healthier cells.",

              "Prolonged fasting has been found to have a significant impact on autophagy because it acts as a natural stimulant.",
              "It can trigger autophagy in a few different ways: Reduced nutrient availability: During fasting, the body experiences a significant reduction in nutrient intake, which can activate autophagy.",
              "When the usual sources of energy and cellular building blocks are limited, the body uses autophagy to recycle and repurpose cell components to meet its needs.",
              "Changes in hormonal signaling: Fasting influences hormonal signaling pathways involving insulin and glucagon.",
              "During fasting, insulin levels drop, and glucagon levels rise.",
              "This shift in the hormone balance may cause the body to switch from storing energy to utilizing it.",
              "When this happens, autophagy occurs.",
              "Energy conservation: When you fast, you deliberately withhold food from the body.",
              "This causes the body to go into a \u201csurvival mode\u201d, which allows it to conserve energy.",
              "Autophagy is crucial for this conservation since it breaks down and recycles cellular components to generate energy.",
              "This ensures that cells have the necessary resources to maintain essential functions.",
              "Implementing fasting helps to naturally prompt the body to initiate autophagy.",
              "Let\u2019s take a look at some effective fasting methods that can induce this process.",
              "Intermittent fasting involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting.",
              "The most common forms of IF include: Extended fasting typically involves fasting for longer periods, ranging from 24 hours to several days.",
              "A popular example is the 24-hour fast, where you abstain from food for a full day.",
              "This type of fasting may also last 48 hours, 72 hours, or longer, and it requires careful planning and supervision.",
              "Extended fasting is not recommended for people who are just starting out with this dietary approach or with medical conditions like diabetes, as it may be too harsh on their bodies.",
              "The duration of fasting required to initiate significant autophagic responses can vary and depends on factors like diet, metabolic rate, and overall health.",
              "Below are some general guidelines that may be helpful: Short-term activation: Shorter fasting durations \u2014 such as 12 to 16 hours \u2014 can stimulate a moderate level of autophagy over a short period of time.",
              "This level of autophagy may help with routine cellular maintenance and contribute to overall health.",
              "Moderate activation: Extended fasts of 24 to 48 hours are more likely to induce a longer-term moderate autophagic response.",
              "During these fasting periods, the body begins relying on autophagy for energy and cellular repair.",
              "Significant activation: For a more sustained autophagic response, extended fasts exceeding 48 hours may be necessary.",
              "During these extended periods, autophagy preserves cellular function and promotes the breakdown of damaged components.",
              "While fasting can be a valuable tool for activating autophagy and promoting cellular health, it\u2019s important to know that it may not be a suitable dietary approach for everyone.",
              "It\u2019s also essential to prioritize following a balanced diet when implementing fasting to avoid factors like nutrient deficiencies and metabolic diseases.",
              "Your diet should include nutrient-dense foods like fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains that support your well-being.",
              "Prolonged nutrient deprivation can also lead to muscle loss and hormonal imbalances, which can have a negative effect on your overall health.",
              "There are a few different ways to initiate autophagy besides fasting.",

              "Many of these diseases cause insulin resistance, which impairs the body\u2019s response to autophagy and reduces its effectiveness.",
              "Hormonal balance: Hormones \u2014 particularly insulin and glucagon \u2014 play key roles in regulating autophagy.",
              "Insulin inhibits autophagy, while glucagon promotes it.",
              "Individuals with hormonal imbalances may experience differences in their autophagic responses during fasting.",
              "Exercises like resistance training and HIIT create cellular stress and energy demands.",

              "The scheme provides an overview on pathologies that might be targeted by the manipulation of autophagy.",
              "The final fate of cells is death, while that of cytoplasmic organelles is macroautophagy [1, 2].",
              "For this reason, many scientists that started their carrier on cell death switched the focus of their work to macroautophagy (hitherto \u201cautophagy\u201d).",
              "This move from one area of research to another has also been motivated by the ambiguous effect of autophagy on cell death.",
              "On one hand, autophagy constitutes a formidable process allowing cells to adapt to changing and stressful conditions by removing damaged subcellular structures and by digesting macromolecules to small molecules that then can either be used to fuel bioenergetics or to rebuild new organelles, thus rejuvenating the cytoplasm [3] and perhaps even the nuclear envelope and nucleoli [4].",
              "For this reason, autophagy is viewed as a major anti-aging mechanism that, if stimulated in an adequate fashion at the whole-body level, may enhance health span and longevity [5\u20137].",
              "Regrettably, autophagy may also enhance the fitness of cancer cells that attempt to strive in a hostile microenvironment, thus resisting endogenous stressors (absence of trophic support, hypoxia, and attack by the immune system) or therapeutic measures (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy) [8, 9].",
              "Moreover, autophagy may be important for maintaining the pool of cancer stem cells [10].",
              "Given the cytoprotective action of autophagy, scientists have been reasoning that autophagy should be stimulated when the goal is the preservation of normal cellular or organismal functions [5, 6], but inhibited when the goal is the treatment of cancer [8, 9].",
              "On the other hand, deregulated autophagy may participate in the destruction of cells, be it during normal development (to get rid of superfluous cells, especially in model organisms) [11] or in response to environmental stress [12, 13].",
              "Although nowadays the first idea (autophagy improving cellular fitness) largely dominates over the second one (autophagy as a cell death mechanism), there are indeed instances in mammalian pathophysiology in which excessive autophagy may destroy neurons (for instance in neonatal ischemia) [14, 15] or cardiomyocytes (in hypoxia\u2013ischemia) [16, 17].",
              "In this context, suppression of autophagy may protect specific cell types against death, calling for the development of cytoprotective autophagy inhibitors.",
              "In view of the disease-modulatory potential of autophagy, scientists working in academia, biotechnology, or pharmaceutical industry are developing pharmacological autophagy inhibitors and inducers [18, 19].",
              "This effort is encouraged by the increasingly accepted notion that the disease-preventive or therapeutic effects of some widely used drugs and food components can be explained by autophagy stimulation, as exemplified for aspirin [20], resveratrol [21], and spermidine [22, 23].",
              "In theory, there are multiple molecularly defined targets to suppress autophagy (each of the essential autophage gene [ATG]-encoded proteins) and to enhance autophagy (by targeting each of the numerous endogenous inhibitors of autophagy).",
              "Prominent pharmacological targets for autophagy inhibition include proteases (such as the ATG4 isoenzymes required for the proteolytic maturation of LC3 family proteins), lipid kinases (in particular, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3, PIK3C3, which acts within the Beclin 1, BECN1, complex) and protein kinases (especially, Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1, ULK1) [19, 24].",
              "Druggable targets to enhance autophagic flux include a series of negative regulators of autophagy such as multidomain proteins of the BCL-2 family (which can be targeted by so-called BH-3 mimetics and perhaps other agents that disrupt their inhibitory interaction with the Beclin 1/PIK3C3 complex) [25\u201328], the acetyltransferase E1A binding protein P300 (EP300, which is already known as the target of aspirin and spermidine) [20, 29], the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1, which is inhibited by rapamycin and rapalogs), as well as kinases acting upstream of MTORC1 such as the members of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (PKB) families [19, 30].",

              "Indications for autophagy inhibition.",
              "a Hypothetical desirable and side effects of autophagy inhibition are shown in green and red, respectively.",
              "b For reducing unacceptable side effects, it may be necessary to administer autophagy inhibitors at a reduced dose and in short-term or intermittent schedules Cell death is often preceded by signs of autophagy, an observation that led to the common belief that autophagy would constitute a major cell death modality (\u201ctype-2 cell death\u201d) [31, 32].",
              "However, when autophagy is inhibited by specific (i.",
              "e., genetic) methods, it turned out that, in most cases, autophagy is not necessary for lethality but rather acts as a cytoprotective mechanisms, hence increasing the resistance of cells to fatal stimuli and avoiding or postponing their death [33, 34].",
              "There are several notable exceptions to this rule.",
              "In model organisms, abolition of autophagy can affect the developmental death of some cell types, contrasting though with the observation that complete invalidation of conventional autophagy does not cause any developmental perturbations in mice [11].",
              "Moreover, in human or mouse cell cultures responding to specific stimuli, cell death may be favored by autophagy (as a process) or by the expression of ATG proteins, meaning that autophagy inhibition or depletion/deletion of ATG gene products increases the resistance of the cells to potentially lethal insults [12, 16].",
              "Thus, in mouse models, genetic inhibition of autophagy may reduce motorneuron loss in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [35], as well as cerebral damage after neonatal asphyxiation [14].",
              "Moreover, cardiac glycosides (CGs) can inhibit \u201cautosis\u201d, a peculiar autophagy-dependent cell death modality characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization and separation of the nuclear envelope from the nucleus [36].",
              "The precise molecular mechanisms through which autosis is inhibited by CG remains elusive, although it can be recapitulated by genetic interventions on the Na+, K+-ATPase, the molecular target of CG [16].",
              "Notwithstanding this limitation, it is tempting to speculate that the well-known cardioprotective effects of CG are not only due to a positive inotropic action but may also involve cytoprotection through the suppression of excessive autophagy.",
              "Indeed, administration of CG can prevent ischemic lesions to the myocardium in mice [16].",
              "Nonetheless, during recent years CGs have been largely replaced by other drugs, mainly due to safety concerns.",
              "Hence, it remains to be seen whether their recently discovered capacity to inhibit autosis will favor their reintroduction into the clinics.",
              "Malignant cells can be considered as abnormally fit cells that have escaped from cell-autonomous tumor-suppressive mechanisms, as well as from immunosurveillance.",
              "Although the inhibition of autophagy can stimulate oncogenesis, especially at the initial steps [37\u201339], it has been observed in several instances that autophagy inhibition reduces the growth of advanced cancers [9, 40].",
              "Thus, inducible knockout of Atg7 specifically within cancer cells (as opposed to stromal cells) reduces the growth of lung and pancreas cancers induced by oncogenic KRAS and inactivation of the tumor-suppressor TP53 [41, 42].",
              "There are multiple reports showing that inhibition of autophagy using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine may sensitize tumors to chemotherapy either in vitro or in vivo [43, 44].",
              "However, chloroquine and its derivatives cannot be considered as specific autophagy inhibitors (they actually mediate autophagy-independent cytotoxicity due to their lysosome-disrupting effects), shedding doubts on the question whether these anticancer effects are truly mediated by autophagy suppression [45, 46].",
              "Beyond the cancer cells themselves, autophagy in other cell types may also contribute to tumor progression.",
              "Thus, knockout of ATG genes in endothelial cells can retard tumor angiogenesis [47], whereas inhibition of autophagy in cancer-associated fibroblasts interrupts trophic support to malignant cells [48].",
              "One recent report shows that an inducible total-body knockout of Atg7 triggers major changes in metabolism including an increase in the hepatic release of arginase 1 (ARG1), causing a reduction in extracellular arginine levels and consequent growth reduction of arginine auxotroph cancers [49].",
              "This suggests that a global (rather than cancer cell-specific) inhibition of autophagy may be used for the treatment of neoplasia.",
              "That said, the inducible deletion of Atg7 from the mouse genome causes a general tissue-degenerative phenotype affecting all organs and causing death due to brain dysfunction within approximately 6 weeks [41].",
              "It remains to be determined whether temporary, partial, or intermittent inhibition of autophagy obtained by pharmacological agents can avoid the manifestation of such an accelerated aging phenotype, yet conserve antitumor efficacy in vivo (Fig.",
              "1b).",
              "Autophagy induction can be most easily obtained by reduced caloric intake and exercise, yet can also be stimulated by \u201ccaloric restriction mimetics (CRMs)\u201d and other pharmacological agents [19, 50].",
              "There are a number of pathological conditions that favorably respond to autophagy enhancement (Fig.",

              "Indications for autophagy enhancement.",
              "For a detailed discussion, consult main text In model organisms like yeast, nematodes, and fruit flies, there is overwhelming evidence that any kind of behavioral, nutritional, pharmacological, and genetic manipulation capable of extending longevity induces an increase in autophagic flux and actually requires autophagy to be efficient [51, 52].",
              "Similarly, in mice, it is sufficient to overexpress ATG5 as a transgene [53] or to introduce a gain-of-function mutant of BECN1 (encoding a BECN1 protein that does not interact any more with the autophagy-inhibitory protein BCL-2) [54] to induce an increase in health span and lifespan.",
              "Treatment of mice with autophagy inducers including rapamycin (an inhibitor of MTORC1) or spermidine (an inhibitor of EP300) has a positive impact on life expectancy as well [22, 55].",
              "Epidemiological observations in humans confirm that high nutritional spermidine uptake reduces mortality from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other causes [56, 57].",
              "Hence, spermidine might be used as a safe food supplement to reduce aging and to postpone the manifestations of age-related diseases.",
              "At this stage, however, it remains to be seen whether this type of intervention would be sufficiently lucrative for pharmaceutical companies to stimulate prospective clinical trials in this area.",
              "Moreover, aging is not yet considered as a disease, meaning that neither the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) nor the European Medical Agency (EMA) would authorize this kind of clinical trial to be launched, unless it would deal with the prevention or treatment of a particular pathology.",
              "We have given large room to the hypothesis that autophagy should be inhibited for the treatment of cancer (see above).",

              "Indeed, most cell biologists have been adhering to the idea that malignant disease arises from genetic and epigenetic alterations within cancer cells [58].",
              "This vision, has recently been revised when it was understood that cancers only manifest when immunosurveillance fails [59] and that antineoplastic therapies (such as cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and radiotherapy) only confer long-term benefits if they are capable of restoring immunosurveillance [60, 61].",
              "Accordingly, the (re)activation of anticancer immune responses using so-called immune checkpoint blockers has become a close-to-universal treatment of neoplastic disease [62, 63].",
              "In this context, it appears that the final outcome of chemotherapies and radiotherapies is not so much determined by the direct induction of cancer cell death but rather is dictated by the vigor of the antitumor immune response.",
              "Autophagy induction may favor the release of ATP from stressed and dying cancer cells, thus favoring the recruitment of myeloid cells including that of dendritic cell precursors into the tumor bed [64, 65].",
              "For this reason, pharmacological autophagy inducers may act as immunostimulators in the context of anticancer chemotherapies, provided that the cancer cells are autophagy competent [66].",
              "Accordingly, autophagy competence of malignant cells correlates with local immune responses and treatment outcome in human cancers [67\u201369].",
              "Based on these results, it is tempting to speculate that autophagy induction by nutritional interventions (such as fasting or caloric restriction) or pharmacological agents might be introduced into the oncological armamentarium [70].",
              "It appears plausible, yet remains to be clinically demonstrated, that short pulses of autophagy induction (as opposed to a protracted enhancement) would be sufficient to ignite durable anticancer immune responses, if appropriately combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy.",
              "Accumulating evidence suggests that repeated or continuous autophagy stimulation can protect against most if not all signs of cardiovascular aging including arteriosclerosis, increased arterial stiffness, and cardiac failure [71].",
              "For this reason, dietary and pharmacological measures for enhancing autophagy might be considered for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, perhaps in the context of a general strategy to promote healthy aging.",
              "Moreover, with the exception of the (controversial) maladaptive autophagy occurring during pressure overload [17], it appears that autophagy induction reduces myocardial damage after acute insult by ischemia.",

              "The most frequent mutation causing CF (responsible for 70\u201390% of all cases) consists in the deletion of amino-acid 506 (CFTRdel506).",
              "It has been thought for long that the cause of CF pathogenesis was the production of thick mucus, leading to infections of the respiratory tract and pancreatic/gastrointestinal dysfunction [74].",
              "However, recently it has been understood that CFTR malfunction also affects intracellular proteostasis due to the overactivation of transglutaminase-2 (TGM2) and the depletion of the pro-autophagic BECN1 complex [75\u201378].",
              "Feedforward loops amplifying the phenomenon (because TGM2 activation and BECN1 inhibition ultimately cause the disposal of CFTRdel506 protein, totally abolishing its residual function) then lock epithelial cells in a pro-inflammatory state and hinder them to return to homeostasis [77, 79].",
              "Of note, preclinical work in mice and two independent phase 2 clinical trials have shown that TGM2 inhibition with cysteamine combined with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, a green tea flavoid that can stimulate autophagy, presumably by inhibiting EP300) [80] efficiently reverse the disease caused by CFTRdel506 [81, 82].",
              "In CFTRdel506/del506 mice that are partially autophagy deficient due to BECN1 haploinsuffiency (BECN1+/-), the combination therapy with cysteamine plus EGCG fails, suggesting that this treatment indeed requires the induction of autophagy [82].",

              "It will be interesting to see whether new pharmacological agents designed to modulate autophagy will favorably compare with such natural therapies, although there is little doubt that the economic interests linked to modern medical practice, as well as the attitude of the patient/consumer will ultimately favor the oral or parenteral use of fully synthetic compounds.",
