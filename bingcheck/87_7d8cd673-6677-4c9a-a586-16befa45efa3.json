              "Regardless, UY Scuti is still one of the biggest known stars and if UY Scuti were placed in the Solar System, replacing our sun, its photosphere would reach the orbit of Saturn.",

              "It continues to fuse hydrogen in a shell around the core.",
              "When the star will finish fusing the heavy elements, the core will start to produce iron thus disrupting the balance of gravity, and radiation in its core will result in its collapse thus explode into a supernova.",
              "Scientists believe that UY Scuti will evolve back to hotter temperatures and become a yellow hypergiant, luminous blue variable, or a Wolf-Rayet star.",
              "This will create a strong stellar wind ejecting its outer layers and exposing its core, before exploding as a type llb, lln, or type lb/lc supernova.",
              "This will not affect us since the necessary distance in order for a supernova to do so, would require it to be around 50 light-years away from us.",
              "Currently, we do not know if there are planets orbiting around UY Scuti.",
              "Even if it has a habitable zone the radiations emitted by the enormous star will sterilize everything.",
              "It may have been possible for life to evolve around these hypothetical planets before the star grew to such sizes.",
              "When UY Scuti goes supernova, it will definitely be a sight to see.",
              "However, estimates are not precise when this will happen.",
