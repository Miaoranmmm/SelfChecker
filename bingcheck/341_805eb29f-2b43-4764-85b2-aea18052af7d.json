    "query": "What is the history and significance behind the traditional African drumming styles, such as djembe and sabar, and how have they influenced modern music genres across the globe?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. Traditional African drumming styles are diverse and rich, reflecting the cultural and historical diversity of the continent. According to [^1^], some of the most commonly used authentic and traditional drums played by African tribes are:\n\n- **Djembe**: A musical instrument from West Africa that originated from the Malian Empire. It is a percussion instrument and usually the first drum that comes to mind when talking about African drums. The drumming style is typically very fast, and it is played with bare hands. It has a big drum head and a small body and bottom.\n- **Udu**: A musical instrument from West Africa, Nigeria. It is a percussion instrument and looks like a clay pot. It has a hole at the top and in the biggest part of the pot. It was originally used for ceremonial purposes. It produces sound with its own vibrations after being hit by the drummers. It can be hit by hand or with other objects like wooden or metal sticks, each one producing an unique sound. The holes can be covered by hand to change the pitch of the sound.\n- **Bowl Drum (Kettle Drum)**: A musical instrument from West Africa that got its name from its shape: a bowl-shaped hand drum. It is a small drum that can be carried around and usually played with one hand only. Two of them can be played at the same time using one hand on each one. The head of the drum is made of animal skin, usually goat skin. The bottom of the drum is closed and made of traditional wood.\n- **Talking Drum**: A musical instrument from West Africa that has a big head and a big bottom both connected by cords while the middle is thinner, like an hourglass. It requires a curved beater, so it isn't a hand drum. Drummers hold it under one arm, usually supported by a strap over their shoulder, and squeeze the ropes against their bodies to change the pitch. It earns the nickname of a talking drum because of this modulation, which allows it to mimic human vocal sounds.\n- **Bata**: A three-drum set that can be struck by hand or with a stick. The Yoruba people consider the bata a sacred musical instrument belonging to the goddess of love, Oshun. The bata plays an important role in Cuban music, as it was brought to the island with African slaves.\n- **Bougarabou**: A cylindrical drum with the ends narrower than the middle, though some variations are narrower at one end than at the other. Sometimes, drummers wear bangle bracelets to make a tambourine-like sound while they strike the drum with their hands.\n\nThese are just some examples of traditional African drums, but there are many more types and variations across different regions and ethnic groups.\n\nTraditional African drumming styles have influenced modern music genres across the globe in various ways. For instance, according to [^4^], many aspects of African rhythm, such as syncopation, polyrhythm, cross-rhythm and call-and-response patterns, have been adopted by genres such as jazz, blues, rock, hip hop, reggae and salsa. Moreover, according to [^5^], some instruments such as the djembe and the bata have been incorporated into modern music ensembles as well.\n\nI hope this answer gives you some insight into the history and significance behind traditional African drumming styles and their global impact on modern music genres.",

              "This goblet-shaped drum is traditionally carved from a single piece of African hardwood and topped with an animal skin as a drumhead.",
              "In western understanding, the drum belongs to the membranophone class of instruments in the percussion family.",
              "Some say the name of the djembe came from the Bamana in Mali, who said \"Anke dje, anke be\" to call their people together, as the saying translates as \"everyone gather together.\"",
              "\"Dje\" means gather and \"be\" means everyone, which gave the drum used in these calls to order its name.",
              "The Bamanakans' mythology tells of the original djembe, which was made of the hide of a giraffe-zebra hybrid called the gebraffe.",
              "There are at least a dozen stories of the history of the drum told by many master drummers.",
              "My master tells these stories and then steps back as even he, doesn't purport to know the real truth.",
              "In history, the Mandinka of Manden became the Malinke of Mali.",
              "We often refer to them as the Mande\u0301.",
              "The djembe drum is most likely about 400-800 years old, and was created during the Malian Empire by the Mande\u0301 people.",
              "It spanned the modern-day countries of Senegal, southern Mauritania, Mali, northern Burkina Faso, western Niger, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, the Ivory Coast and northern Ghana.",
              "The Mali Empire grew out of an area referred to by its contemporary inhabitants as Mande.",
              "Mande, named for its inhabitants the Mandinka (initially Manden\u2019ka with \u201cka\u201d meaning people of), comprised most of present-day northern Guinea and southern Mali.",
              "The empire was originally established as a federation of Mandinka tribes called the Manden Kurufa (literally Manden Federation), but it later became an empire ruling millions of people from nearly every ethnic group in West Africa.",
              "It is taught that the Blacksmiths made the first djembes, making each drum custom-fitted to the drummer who would play it.",
              "This makes sense as they would be the people to cut the tree.",
              "The making of the drum was spiritual, and the blacksmith was obliged to make offerings to the spirits of the trees he cut down.",
              "With the lengue tree, a sacrifice would be made to ask for permission to cut the tree for a djembe.",
              "Once the blacksmith finished the djembe, it was delivered to the drummer who commissioned it, a member of the jeli caste.",
              "The jeli are musicians, who are responsible for the oral history of their people.",
              "This remains true to today.",
              "Traditionally, only those born into the djembe family would be allowed (or interested) to play the djembe.",
              "Castes have last names that have survived to this day and if your last name (your family name) is one of those families born into the djembe, it is your instrument and possibly your job to play the drum for the village.",
              "The djeli caste still exists today, and is responsible for the traditional music.",
              "The djeli sing and perform during rituals, baptisms, weddings and sometimes funerals, and are trusted with the music of their ancestors.",
              "Africans say that the drum contains three spirits.",
              "The belief is that the djembe drum contains the spirit of the tree from which it was made, the spirit of the animal whose skin is played, and the spirit of the carver or the one who cut the tree and the people who assemble the drum.",
              "We would add that possibly the most important is the spirit of the ancestors.",
              "I have seen the oldest djembe known today and it has the names of generations of djembe masters from many countries and villages.",
              "During a performance, the djembe may begin the ritual, followed by the singer and the other instruments.",
              "However, the music can also begin in a different fashion.",
              "The djembe player can change the beat of the drums in order to change the song, and the singer and instrumental players use the rhythm to recognize what they should be playing and adding to the whole.",

              "Highlighting the old culture of these newly sovereign states, djembe was used in national ballets, and drew emphasis to the djembe as a premier musical instrument and solo voice, rather than as an accompaniment to song and dance.",

              "The song is often lost.",
              "To hear the music of the song, the dance and the drumming along with the villagers clapping and moving in a circle is just amazing.",
              "And you may need to make that trek to Africa to experience it in an actual village setting.",
              "A djembe is normally 23-25\" in height but can be smaller in many villages in Africa.",

              "In the western world, children often start off in the kitchen with pots and pans.",
              "This is interesting to me as the djembe in Africa and in America comes from the kitchens of Africa.",
              "Most percussion instruments come from those outdoor African kitchens.",
              "Wood and metal make up the kitchen utensils and so it is with the djembe and dunun (the bass drum of the dununba).",
              "Even as recently as the 1950s, the djembe was not known beyond African music aficionados and those who grew up with the instrument.",

              "I have been in Guinea when the Japanese elders were sent to find out what was the djembe all about and the dance and the culture of djembe.",
              "Was it tied to evil spirits?",
              "So I sat and watched and listened as the grandmaster and bibliothe\u0300que of the djembe, Famoudou Konate\u0301, attempted to allay all fears.",
              "It was fascinating to me, that a country would send ambassadors and information gatherers before allowing their country to experience djembe and Guinean dance.",
              "In today's musical world, the djembe is making its way into the global consciousness.",
              "More people than ever listen to world music, popularized greatly by the rapid spread of West African ballets and orchestras especially during the mid 1980s.",
              "While it is hard to find a real djembe worth playing, built with the spirit of the wood, the skin and the maker it is worth the years necessary to invest in finding such a drum.",
              "Very often, current djembe-style drums are not being made traditionally.",
              "Some argue that it is better to have a djembe style drum than to not have a drum at all.",
              "I personally feel (due to experience) that even though those drums may be more accessible, they do not usually find their way into the hands of good drummers.",
              "To play djembe means to stay true to the history of the djembe;",
              "That includes the traditions of magic, knowledge and an open heart.",
              "If one of those is absent, the music will not sound correct to village-people of the seeding countries of the djembe.",
              "As of today, many traditional rhythms and songs have been lost to the past and the spirits that once were.",
              "Many current djembe teachers and historians have made it their purpose to make sure the rhythms we currently know and are learning, not be forgotten.",
              "Famoudou Konate\u0301, Mamady Keita, Fadouba Oulare\u0301 (passed in 2009), Mansa Cameo and their sons and descendants are continuing to keep the music alive.",
              "We owe it to the spirits of the past to learn their music.",
              "If we just jam (play stuff) on the djembe, we will surely lower it's value as an instrument and one day, like a lost and forgotten child, it will be forgotten and die.",
              "When you play the djembe, it needs to speak in the music.",
              "If it doesn't speak, it is like you are saying nonsense with your voice.",
              "When you learn how to make the drum talk the language of the people who even today play and sing with the djembe, it takes on a life of its own.",
              "The djembe can then share in the energy that comes from without and within.",
              "And try to leave western accents behind and learn some Sousou, Malinke\u0301 and Pular words and phrases so you can hear African sounding djembe phrases and djembe tone.",
              "The djembe player is then not 'just' a drummer but a vessel through which the spirit of the djembe comes through.",
              "I sometimes say that the sound of the djembe is in the past, present and the future;",
              "That it is not really in us yet until the moment it quickly comes into consciousness thru the hands and into the world.",
              "It is all at once!",
              "The drummer really doesn't own the sound and is certainly not the only one responsible for it.",
              "It comes from years of study with masters guiding your hands, fingers, arms, spine - your thinking and your spirit.",
              "That is the master's job.",
              "And it is not easy.",
              "When you align yourself with a master, you will stay with him for a long time and it is a bond that can touch you and should touch you at your innermost places.",

              "If you haven't I highly suggest this road BUT it is not easy and you may give up many other things in life to come to the knowledge and ability to make the djembe talk and sing.",
              "More djembe are built in Ghana, Bali and Thailand these days.",
              "The djembe has no history there.",
              "Some historians say that the djembe never really lived in those countries.",
              "Whether they were not born of those countries or not, they are able to export many more drums than the total of all the other djembe-seeding countries combined due to their industrial abilities and more westernized society.",
              "We feel strongly that for a djembe to be a djembe it should come from the seeding countries of origin: Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast.",
              "These five countries have the trees the djembe is made from and they sound like a djembe.",
              "No drum made in the Western World will have that sound or that spirit.",

              "According to the Bambara people in Mali, the name of the djembe comes from the saying \"Anke dje\u0301, anke be\u0301\" which translates to \"everyone gather together in peace\" and defines the drum's purpose.",
              "In the Bambara language, \"dje\u0301\" is the verb for \"gather\" and \"be\u0301\" translates as \"peace.\"",
              "[3] The djembe has a body (or shell) carved of hardwood and a drumhead made of untreated (not limed) rawhide, most commonly made from goatskin.",
              "Excluding rings, djembes have an exterior diameter of 30\u201338 cm (12\u201315 in) and a height of 58\u201363 cm (23\u201325 in).",
              "The majority have a diameter in the 13 to 14 inch range.",
              "The weight of a djembe ranges from 5 kg to 13 kg (11\u201329 lb) and depends on size and shell material.",
              "A medium-size djembe carved from one of the traditional woods (including skin, rings, and rope) weighs around 9 kg (20 lb).",
              "The djembe can produce a wide variety of sounds, making it an extremely versatile drum.",
              "The drum is very loud, allowing it to be heard clearly as a solo instrument over a large percussion ensemble.",
              "The Malinke\u0301 people say that a skilled drummer is one who \"can make the djembe talk\", meaning that the player can tell an emotional story (the Malinke\u0301 never used the djembe as a signaling drum).",
              "Traditionally, the djembe is played only by men, as are the dunun that always accompany the djembe.",
              "Conversely, other percussion instruments that are commonly played as part of an ensemble, such as the shekere (a hollowed-out gourd covered with a net of beads), karignan (a tubular bell), and kese kese (a woven basket rattle), are usually played by women.",
              "Even today, it is rare to see women play djembe or dunun in West Africa, and African women express astonishment when they do see a female djembe player.",
              "[4] There is general agreement that the origin of the djembe is associated with the Mandinka caste of blacksmiths, known as Numu.",
              "The wide dispersion of the djembe drum throughout West Africa may be due to Numu migrations during the first millennium AD.",
              "[5] Despite the association of the djembe with the Numu, there are no hereditary restrictions on who may become a djembefola (literally, \"one who plays the djembe\").",
              "This is in contrast to instruments whose use is reserved for members of the griot caste, such as the balafon, kora, and ngoni.",

              "[7] Anyone who plays djembe is a djembefola\u2014the term does not imply a particular level of skill.",
              "Geographically, the traditional distribution of the djembe is associated with the Mali Empire,[8] which dates back to 1230 AD and included parts of the modern-day countries of Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Gambia, and Senegal.",
              "However, due to the lack of written records in West African countries, it is unclear whether the djembe predates or postdates the Mali Empire.",
              "It seems likely that the history of the djembe reaches back for at least several centuries and possibly more than a millennium.",
              "[6] The goblet shape of the djembe suggests that it originally may have been created from a mortar.",
              "(Mortars are widely used throughout West Africa for food preparation.)",
              "[9] Prior to the 1950s and the decolonization of West Africa, due to the very limited travel of native Africans outside their own ethnic group, the djembe was known only in its original area.",
              "The djembe first came to the attention of audiences outside West Africa with the efforts of Fode\u0301ba Kei\u0308ta, who, in 1952, founded Les Ballets Africains.",
              "The ballet toured extensively in Europe and was declared Guinea's first national ballet by Guinea's first president, Se\u0301kou Toure\u0301, after Guinea gained independence in 1958, to be followed by two more national ballets, the Ballet d'Armee in 1961 and Ballet Djoliba in 1964.",
              "[9] Toure\u0301's policies alienated Guinea from the West and he followed the Eastern Bloc model of using the country's culture and music for promotional means.",
              "[10] He and Fode\u0301ba Kei\u0308ta, who had become a close friend of Toure\u0301, saw the ballets as a way to secularize traditional customs and rites of different ethnic groups in Guinea.",
              "The ballets combined rhythms and dances from widely different spiritual backgrounds in a single performance, which suited the aim of Toure\u0301's demystification program of \"doing away with 'fetishist' ritual practices\".",
              "[4][11] Toure\u0301 generously supported the ballets (to the point of building a special rehearsal and performance space in his palace for Ballet Djoliba) and, until his death in 1984, financed extensive world-wide performance tours, which brought the djembe to the attention of Western audiences.",
              "[12][13] Other countries followed Toure\u0301's example and founded national ballets in the 1960s, including Ivory Coast (Ballet Koteba), Mali (Les Ballets Malien),[14] and Senegal (Le Ballet National du Senegal), each with its own attached political agenda.",
              "[15] In the United States, Ladji Camara, a member of Ballets Africains in the 1950s, started teaching djembe in the 1960s and continued to teach into the 1990s.",
              "Camara performed extensively with Babatunde Olatunji during the 1970s, greatly raising awareness of the instrument in the US.",
              "[16] After the death of Sekou Toure\u0301 in 1984, funding for the ballets dried up and a number of djembefolas (who were never paid well by the ballets[17]) emigrated and made regular teaching and performance appearances in the west, including Mamady Kei\u0308ta (Belgium, US), Famoudou Konate\u0301 (Germany), and Epizo Bangoura (France, US, and Australia).",

              "The 1991 documentary Djembefola[12] by Laurent Chevallier depicts Mamady Kei\u0308ta's return to the village of his birth after a 26-year absence.",
              "Upon release, the movie won the Wisselzak Trophy and Special Jury Award at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, and the Audience Award at the Marseille Festival of Documentary Film, and brought the djembe to the attention of a wide audience.",
              "[20][21] A 1998 follow-up documentary, Mo\u0308go\u0308balu[22] (also by Chevallier), contains concert footage uniting four master drummers (Soungalo Coulibaly, Mamady Keita, Famoudou Konate\u0301, and Doudou N'Diaye Rose) on stage.",
              "The Oscar-nominated 2007 drama The Visitor ensured that the djembe was noticed internationally by mainstream viewers.",
              "The djembe has been used by many modern artists, including Paul Simon, Cirque du Soleil, and Tool, raising awareness of the instrument with western audiences.",
              "[23][24] Recordings of the djembe far surpass the number of recordings of any other African drum.",
              "Beginning in the late 1980s, a slew of djembe-centric recordings was released, a trend that, as of 2014, shows no sign of abating.",
              "This is significant because these recordings are driven by the demand of western audiences: there are almost no djembe recordings within African markets.",
              "[6] Among the earliest educational resources available to a student of the djembe were an educational VHS tape by Babatunde Olatunji released in 1993,[25] as well as books by Serge Blanc, Famoudou Konate\u0301, and Mamady Kei\u0308ta.",
              "[9][26][27] In 1998, these were supplemented by a three-volume VHS set by Kei\u0308ta[28] and, in 2000, by a VHS tape by Epizo Bangoura.",
              "[29] Since then, the market for educational materials has grown significantly.",

              "Starting in the 1980s, a number of Guinean djembefolas (Epizo Bangoura, Famoudou Konate\u0301, Mamady Kei\u0308ta) started hosting study tours to Guinea, allowing djembe students to experience Guinean culture first-hand.",
              "Many other djembefolas followed suit;",
              "as of 2014, a potential visitor can select from tens of djembe tours each year.",
              "Djembe tourism created a market for djembefolas in Guinea that previously did not exist.",
              "Young djembefolas try to emulate the success of their predecessors and cater to the needs of the tourists, leading to change and commodification of the original djembe culture.",
              "[4][30] Most djembes from Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, and Senegal are still hand carved from traditional species of wood, using traditional tools and methods.",
              "In the 1990s, djembes started being produced elsewhere, such as in Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, and Indonesia, often using modern machinery and substitute species of wood, such as tweneboa (Cordia platythyrsa) or mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni or Toona sureni).",
              "However, these woods, being softer and less dense, are not as suitable as the traditional woods.",
              "[31] A number of western percussion instrument manufacturers also produce djembe-like instruments, often with fibreglass bodies, synthetic skins, and a key tuning system.",
              "[7] The traditional barriers against women djembe and dunun players have come down over time.",
              "For its size, the djembe is an unusually loud drum.",
              "The volume of the drum rises with increasing skin tension.",
              "On a djembe tuned to solo pitch, skilled players can achieve sound pressure of more than 105 dB, about the same volume as a jackhammer.",
              "[40] Djembe players use three basic sounds: bass, tone, and slap, which have low, medium, and high pitch, respectively.",
              "These sounds are achieved by varying the striking technique and position.",
              "Other sounds are possible (masters achieve as many as twenty-five distinctly different sounds),[27] but these additional sounds are used rarely, mainly for special effects during a solo performance (djembe kan, literally, \"the sound of the djembe\").",
              "A skilled player can use the sounds to create very complex rhythmic patterns;",
              "the combination of rhythm and the differently pitched sounds often leads an inexpert listener to believe that more than one drum is being played.",
              "The bass sound is produced by striking the drum with the palm and flat fingers near the center of the skin.",
              "Tone and slap are produced by striking the drum closer to the edge;",
              "the contact area of the fingers determines whether the sound is a tone or a slap.",
              "For a tone, most of the area of the fingers and the edge of the palm contact the skin whereas, for a slap, the contact area is limited to the edge of the palm and the fingertips.",
              "The basic sounds are played \"open\", meaning that the hands rebound immediately after a strike, so the contact time with the skin is as short as possible.",
              "Acoustically, a djembe is a Helmholtz resonator: the frequency of the bass is determined by the size and shape of the shell and independent of the amount of tension on the skin.",
              "In contrast, the pitch of tones and slaps rises as the tension of the skin is increased.",
              "The bass has a frequency of 65\u201380 Hz.",
              "Depending on the size of the drum and the amount of tension on the skin, tone frequency varies from 300 Hz to 420 Hz and slap frequency from 700 Hz to 1000 Hz, with audible overtones reaching beyond 4 kHz.",

              "[44][45] A tone emphasizes the (0,1) mode while suppressing the bass (Helmholtz resonance) and higher-order modes as much as possible.",
              "A slap emphasizes the (2,1), (0,2), (3,1), (1,2), and (0,3) modes (as well as higher-order modes) while suppressing the Helmholtz resonance and the (0,1) and (1,1) modes.",
              "[40] Skilled players can also produce a medium-pitched sound (between a tone and slap) that is variously called third slap, tonpalo, or le\u0301;",

              "By slightly varying striking and finger position, skilled players can selectively emphasize different slap harmonics and create melodies of differently pitched slaps.",
              "[47] Traditionally, the djembe forms an ensemble with a number of other djembes and one or more dunun.",
              "Except for the lead (or solo) djembe, all instruments play a recurring rhythmic figure that is known as an accompaniment pattern or accompaniment part.",
              "The figure repeats after a certain number of beats, known as a cycle.",
              "The most common cycle length is four beats, but cycles often have other lengths, such as two, three, six, eight or more beats.",
              "(Some rhythms in the dundunba family from the Hamana region in Guinea have cycle lengths of 16, 24, 28, or 32 beats, among others.)",
              "Cycles longer than eight beats are rare for djembe accompaniments\u2014longer cycles are normally played only by the dununba or sangban.",
              "Each instrument plays a different rhythmic figure, and the cycle lengths of the different instruments need not necessarily be the same.",
              "This interplay results in complex rhythmic patterns (polyrhythms).",
              "The different accompaniment parts are played on djembes that are tuned to different pitches;",

              "In Mali, a traditional ensemble often consists of one dunun (called konkoni) and one djembe.",
              "The konkoni and djembe are in a rhythmic dialog, with each drum taking turns playing accompaniment while the other instrument plays improvised solos.",
              "If a second dunun player is available, he supplements the ensemble with a khassonka dunun, which is a bass drum similar in build to a konkoni, but larger.",
              "[48] In Guinea, a typical ensemble uses three djembes and three dunun, called sangban (medium pitch), dundunba (bass pitch), and kenkeni (high pitch, also called kensedeni).",
              "If an ensemble includes more than one djembe, the highest pitched (and therefore loudest) djembe plays solo phrases and the other djembes and dunun play accompaniment.",
              "An ensemble may have only two dunun, depending on whether a village has enough dunun players and is wealthy enough to afford three dunun.",
              "A djembe and dunun ensemble traditionally does not play music for people to simply sit back and listen to.",
              "Instead, the ensemble creates rhythm for people to dance, sing, clap, or work to.",
              "The western distinction between musicians and audience is inappropriate in a traditional context.",
              "A rhythm is rarely played as a performance, but is participatory: musicians, dancers, singers, and onlookers are all part of the ensemble and frequently change roles while the music is in progress.",
              "[49] Musicians and participants often form a circle, with the centre of the circle reserved for dancers.",
              "Depending on the particular rhythm being played, dances may be performed by groups of men and/or women with choreographed steps, or single dancers may take turns at performing short solos.",
              "The lead djembe's role is to play solo phrases that accentuate the movements of the dancers.",
              "Often, the aim is to \"mark the dancers' feet\", that is, to play rhythmic patterns that are synchronized with the dancers' steps.",
              "Individual solo dances are not choreographed, with the dancer freely moving in whatever way feels appropriate at that moment.",
              "Marking a solo dancer's feet requires the lead djembefola to have strong rapport with the dancer, and it takes many years of experience for a djembefola to acquire the necessary rhythmic repertoire.",
              "The lead djembefola also improvises to a rhythm at times when no-one is dancing.",
              "While there is considerable freedom in such improvisation, the solo phrases are not random.",
              "Instead, individual rhythms have specific key patterns (signature phrases) that the soloist is expected to know and integrate into his improvisation.",
              "A skilled soloist will also play phrases that harmonize with the background rhythm (groove) that is created by the other instruments.",
              "Traditionally crafted djembes are carved from a single log of hardwood.",
              "A number of different wood species are used, all of which are hard and dense.",
              "Hardness and density are important factors for the sound and projection of the djembe.",
              "The most prized djembe wood is lenke (Afzelia africana), not because it necessarily sounds better than other woods, but because the Malinke\u0301 believe that its spiritual qualities are superior.",

              "[6]) Besides lenke, traditional woods include djalla (Khaya senegalensis), dugura (Cordyla africana), gueni (Pterocarpus erinaceus), gele (Prosopis africana), and iroko (Milicia excelsa).",
              "[31] Shells are carved soon after the tree is felled while the wood still retains some moisture and is softer.",
              "This makes the wood easier to carve and avoids radial splits that tend to develop in logs that are allowed to dry naturally.",
              "[50] Carvers use simple hand tools, such as axes, adzes, spoke shaves, and rasps to shape the shell.",
              "[51][52] A well-carved djembe does not have a smooth interior but a texture of scallops or shallow grooves that influence the sound of the instrument.",
              "(Djembes with smooth interiors have tones and slaps with too much sustain.)",
              "Often, interior grooves form a spiral pattern, which indicates a carver taking pride in his work.",

              "Even though the fat content of male goats is lower than that of female goats,[53] many players prefer female skins because they do not smell as strongly and are reputed to be softer.",
              "The skin is mounted with the spine running through the centre of the drum head, with the line of the spine pointing at the player, so the hands strike either side of the spine.",
              "Animal skins are thicker at the spine than the sides;",
              "mounting the skin with the spine centered ensures that the left and right hand play symmetric areas of equal size and thickness.",

              "With thicker skins, such as from a cow or horse, the skin round is usually taken from the side of the hide so it does not include the spine, which is too thick for use on a djembe.",

              "Wooden pegs wedged between the shell and the lacing could be used to increase tension still further.",
              "[55] The pitch of these traditional djembes was much lower than it is today because the natural materials imposed a limit on the amount of tension that could be applied.",
              "Prior to playing, djembefolas heated the skin near the flames of an open fire, which drives moisture out of the skin and causes it to shrink and increase the pitch of the drum.",

              "The drum is very loud, allowing it to be heard clearly as a solo instrument over a large percussion ensemble.",
              "The Malinke\u0301 people say that a skilled drummer is one who \"can make the djembe talk\", meaning that the player can tell an emotional story (the Malinke\u0301 never used the djembe as a signaling drum).",
              "Traditionally, the djembe is played only by men, as are the dunun that always accompany the djembe.",
              "Conversely, other percussion instruments that are commonly played as part of an ensemble, such as the shekere (a hollowed-out gourd covered with a net of beads), karignan (a tubular bell), and kese kese (a woven basket rattle), are usually played by women.",

              "[4] There is general agreement that the origin of the djembe is associated with the Mandinka caste of blacksmiths, known as Numu.",
              "The wide dispersion of the djembe drum throughout West Africa may be due to Numu migrations during the first millennium AD.",

              "However, due to the lack of written records in West African countries, it is unclear whether the djembe predates or postdates the Mali Empire.",
              "It seems likely that the history of the djembe reaches back for at least several centuries and possibly more than a millennium.",
              "[6] The goblet shape of the djembe suggests that it originally may have been created from a mortar.",

              "[4][11] Toure\u0301 generously supported the ballets (to the point of building a special rehearsal and performance space in his palace for Ballet Djoliba) and, until his death in 1984, financed extensive world-wide performance tours, which brought the djembe to the attention of Western audiences.",
              "[12][13] Other countries followed Toure\u0301's example and founded national ballets in the 1960s, including Ivory Coast (Ballet Koteba), Mali (Les Ballets Malien),[14] and Senegal (Le Ballet National du Senegal), each with its own attached political agenda.",
              "[15] In the United States, Ladji Camara, a member of Ballets Africains in the 1950s, started teaching djembe in the 1960s and continued to teach into the 1990s.",
              "Camara performed extensively with Babatunde Olatunji during the 1970s, greatly raising awareness of the instrument in the US.",
              "[16] After the death of Sekou Toure\u0301 in 1984, funding for the ballets dried up and a number of djembefolas (who were never paid well by the ballets[17]) emigrated and made regular teaching and performance appearances in the west, including Mamady Kei\u0308ta (Belgium, US), Famoudou Konate\u0301 (Germany), and Epizo Bangoura (France, US, and Australia).",

              "This is significant because these recordings are driven by the demand of western audiences: there are almost no djembe recordings within African markets.",
              "[6] Among the earliest educational resources available to a student of the djembe were an educational VHS tape by Babatunde Olatunji released in 1993,[25] as well as books by Serge Blanc, Famoudou Konate\u0301, and Mamady Kei\u0308ta.",
              "[9][26][27] In 1998, these were supplemented by a three-volume VHS set by Kei\u0308ta[28] and, in 2000, by a VHS tape by Epizo Bangoura.",

              "[4][30] Most djembes from Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, and Senegal are still hand carved from traditional species of wood, using traditional tools and methods.",
              "In the 1990s, djembes started being produced elsewhere, such as in Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, and Indonesia, often using modern machinery and substitute species of wood, such as tweneboa (Cordia platythyrsa) or mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni or Toona sureni).",
              "However, these woods, being softer and less dense, are not as suitable as the traditional woods.",
              "[31] A number of western percussion instrument manufacturers also produce djembe-like instruments, often with fibreglass bodies, synthetic skins, and a key tuning system.",
              "[7] The traditional barriers against women djembe and dunun players have come down over time.",
              "For its size, the djembe is an unusually loud drum.",
              "The volume of the drum rises with increasing skin tension.",
              "On a djembe tuned to solo pitch, skilled players can achieve sound pressure of more than 105 dB, about the same volume as a jackhammer.",
              "[40] Djembe players use three basic sounds: bass, tone, and slap, which have low, medium, and high pitch, respectively.",
              "These sounds are achieved by varying the striking technique and position.",
              "Other sounds are possible (masters achieve as many as twenty-five distinctly different sounds),[27] but these additional sounds are used rarely, mainly for special effects during a solo performance (djembe kan, literally, \"the sound of the djembe\").",

              "the combination of rhythm and the differently pitched sounds often leads an inexpert listener to believe that more than one drum is being played.",
              "The bass sound is produced by striking the drum with the palm and flat fingers near the center of the skin.",
              "Tone and slap are produced by striking the drum closer to the edge;",
              "the contact area of the fingers determines whether the sound is a tone or a slap.",
              "For a tone, most of the area of the fingers and the edge of the palm contact the skin whereas, for a slap, the contact area is limited to the edge of the palm and the fingertips.",
              "The basic sounds are played \"open\", meaning that the hands rebound immediately after a strike, so the contact time with the skin is as short as possible.",
              "Acoustically, a djembe is a Helmholtz resonator: the frequency of the bass is determined by the size and shape of the shell and independent of the amount of tension on the skin.",

              "The bass has a frequency of 65\u201380 Hz.",
              "Depending on the size of the drum and the amount of tension on the skin, tone frequency varies from 300 Hz to 420 Hz and slap frequency from 700 Hz to 1000 Hz, with audible overtones reaching beyond 4 kHz.",

              "If a second dunun player is available, he supplements the ensemble with a khassonka dunun, which is a bass drum similar in build to a konkoni, but larger.",
              "[48] In Guinea, a typical ensemble uses three djembes and three dunun, called sangban (medium pitch), dundunba (bass pitch), and kenkeni (high pitch, also called kensedeni).",
              "If an ensemble includes more than one djembe, the highest pitched (and therefore loudest) djembe plays solo phrases and the other djembes and dunun play accompaniment.",
              "An ensemble may have only two dunun, depending on whether a village has enough dunun players and is wealthy enough to afford three dunun.",
              "A djembe and dunun ensemble traditionally does not play music for people to simply sit back and listen to.",
              "Instead, the ensemble creates rhythm for people to dance, sing, clap, or work to.",
              "The western distinction between musicians and audience is inappropriate in a traditional context.",
              "A rhythm is rarely played as a performance, but is participatory: musicians, dancers, singers, and onlookers are all part of the ensemble and frequently change roles while the music is in progress.",
              "[49] Musicians and participants often form a circle, with the centre of the circle reserved for dancers.",
              "Depending on the particular rhythm being played, dances may be performed by groups of men and/or women with choreographed steps, or single dancers may take turns at performing short solos.",
              "The lead djembe's role is to play solo phrases that accentuate the movements of the dancers.",
              "Often, the aim is to \"mark the dancers' feet\", that is, to play rhythmic patterns that are synchronized with the dancers' steps.",
              "Individual solo dances are not choreographed, with the dancer freely moving in whatever way feels appropriate at that moment.",
              "Marking a solo dancer's feet requires the lead djembefola to have strong rapport with the dancer, and it takes many years of experience for a djembefola to acquire the necessary rhythmic repertoire.",
              "The lead djembefola also improvises to a rhythm at times when no-one is dancing.",
              "While there is considerable freedom in such improvisation, the solo phrases are not random.",
              "Instead, individual rhythms have specific key patterns (signature phrases) that the soloist is expected to know and integrate into his improvisation.",

              "With thicker skins, such as from a cow or horse, the skin round is usually taken from the side of the hide so it does not include the spine, which is too thick for use on a djembe.",
              "Skins may be shaved prior to mounting or afterwards, or may be de-haired by liming.",
              "Liming weakens skins;",
              "some djembefolas also claim that limed skins are harder on their hands and do not sound as good as untreated skins.",
              "[54] Factory-made djembes often use skins made from synthetic materials, such as FiberSkyn.",
              "Modern djembes exclusively use synthetic rope, most commonly of kernmantle construction, 4\u20135 mm in diameter.",
              "Low-stretch (static) rope is preferred.",
              "Most djembe ropes have a polyester core with a 16\u2010 or 32\u2010plait mantle and around 5% stretch.",
              "Very low-stretch (<1%) rope materials, such as Vectran and Spectra, are used only rarely due to their much higher cost.",
              "The mounting system for the skin has undergone a number of changes over time.",
              "Originally, the skin was attached by wooden pegs that were driven through holes in the skin and the shell near the playing edge.",
              "Four to five people would stretch the wet skin over the drum to apply tension while the pegs were driven into the bowl.",
              "The shrinkage of the skin while it dried then applied sufficient additional tension for the skin to resonate.",
              "[55] A similar mounting technique is still used by the Landouma (a subgroup of the Baga people) for a djembe-like drum known as a gumbe.",
              "[56] This mounting technique most likely goes back hundreds of years;",
              "the exact period is unknown.",
              "Up until the 1980s, the most common mounting system used twisted strips of cowhide as rope.",
              "The skin was attached with rings made of cowhide;",
              "one ring was sewn into the perimeter of the skin and a second ring placed below it, with loops holding the skin in place and securing the two rings together.",
              "A long strip of cowhide was used to lace up the drum, applying tension between the top ring and a third ring placed around the stem.",
              "To apply further tension, the vertical sections of the rope were woven into a diamond pattern that shortens the verticals.",
              "Wooden pegs wedged between the shell and the lacing could be used to increase tension still further.",
              "[55] The pitch of these traditional djembes was much lower than it is today because the natural materials imposed a limit on the amount of tension that could be applied.",
              "Prior to playing, djembefolas heated the skin near the flames of an open fire, which drives moisture out of the skin and causes it to shrink and increase the pitch of the drum.",
              "This process had to be repeated frequently, every 15\u201330 minutes.",
              "[7] The modern mounting system arose in the early seventies, when touring ballets came into contact with synthetic rope used by the military.",
              "Initially, the synthetic rope was used to replace the twisted cowhide strips.",
              "However, the rope could now be tightened to the point where it tore through the skin;",
              "in response, drum makers started using steel rings instead of twisted cowhide to hold the skin in place.",
              "[55] Despite objections from many djembefolas, the modern mounting system gradually displaced the traditional one and, by 1991 had completely replaced it.",
              "[7] The skin is held in place by being trapped between the top ring, called the crown ring, and the ring below it, called the flesh ring.",
              "A third ring (the bottom ring) is placed around the stem.",
              "The rings are commonly made from 6\u20138 mm (1\u20444\u20131\u20443 in) rebar.",
              "A series of cow hitches on the crown ring and bottom ring form loops.",
              "Through these loops, a length of rope connects the crown ring and the bottom ring;",
              "tightening this rope applies tension.",
              "As the vertical rope is tensioned, the cow hitches on the crown ring press the skin against the flesh ring below;",
              "this attaches the skin to the flesh ring very securely and stretches the skin over the bearing edge of the drum.",
              "Schematic of two-ring skin mounting Schematic of three-ring skin mounting A variation of this technique, introduced in the early 2000s, uses three rings instead of two.",
              "The idea of this technique is to increase the number of friction points trapping the skin to make it less likely for the skin to slip between the rings as tension is applied.",
              "There is no firm consensus in the djembe community as to whether the benefits of this mounting are worth the extra weight and added complexity.",
              "[57][58] To prevent damage to the rope from rust flakes, as well as for aesthetic reasons, the rings are often wrapped with strips of colored cloth.",
              "Factory-made djembes (often from synthetic materials, such as fiberglass), use a similar system.",
              "However, instead of by vertical ropes, the top ring is pulled against the flesh ring by mechanical lugs that are tightened with a wrench.",
              "1st and 2nd row of twists on a djembe 3rd and 4th row of twists on a djembe After initial tightening of the verticals, a djembe is tuned by creating twists in the verticals to shorten them (Mali weave).",
              "With more than one completed row of twists, the vertical rope forms diamond shapes that can be quite decorative.",
              "Well-applied Mali weave keeps the rope that runs across the verticals horizontal, without gradually climbing up in a spiral pattern.",
              "The amount of tension that can be applied this way is considerable.",
              "A djembe tuned to solo pitch has a tone frequency of around 400 Hz.",
              "[40] For a drum with a 31 cm (12.",
              "2 in) playing surface, this equates to an overall pull force of around 455 kg (1,000 lb), or 15,000 newton per meter (N/m) of tension.",
              "[44][59] Instead of trimming the skin off above the crown ring, the drum maker can fold the skin over so it covers the crown ring.",

              "Depending on the country of origin, different patterns are used;",
              "traditional carving styles are usually quite plain and restrained.",
              "In the 2000s, western demand and competition among carvers resulted in more and more elaborate carvings that can cover all of the foot and, in some cases, include the bowl of the drum.",
              "Particularly in Guinea, drum makers often fit motorcycle tires to the foot of a djembe, both for decoration and to prevent the drum from slipping when playing seated on a slippery floor.",
              "This trend started in the late 1990s and evolved from the practice of attaching timing belts to the foot of djembes as a decoration.",
              "[61] Traditionally, as today, in Africa an individual needs to spend many years accompanying his master in ceremonies and other festivities before becoming a real djembefola (djembe player).",
