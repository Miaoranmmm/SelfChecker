    "query": "What is the most significant geological event that has ever occurred on Earth, and how did it shape the planet's geography, climate, and life forms?",
    "response": "That is a very interesting and complex question. There is no definitive answer to what is the most significant geological event that has ever occurred on Earth, as different events have different impacts on the planet's geography, climate, and life forms. However, some possible criteria for evaluating the significance of a geological event are:\n\n- How long ago did it happen and how long did it last?\n- How widespread was its effect and how much did it change the existing conditions?\n- How rare or unique was it in Earth's history and how likely is it to happen again?\n- How did it influence the evolution and diversity of life on Earth and how did it affect human civilization?\n\nUsing these criteria, some examples of geological events that could be considered significant are:\n\n- The formation of the Moon about 4.5 billion years ago by a giant impact with a Mars-sized object[^1^]. This event created Earth's only natural satellite, which stabilizes its rotation, influences its tides, and affects its climate. The impact also melted Earth's crust and mantle, allowing differentiation of layers and the formation of a magnetic field.\n- The Great Oxidation Event about 2.4 to 2.0 billion years ago, when cyanobacteria started producing oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis[^4^]. This event dramatically changed the composition of Earth's atmosphere and oceans, making them more hospitable for aerobic life forms. It also triggered the formation of ozone layer, which protects life from harmful ultraviolet radiation.\n- The end of the Paleozoic Era about 252 million years ago, when the largest mass extinction in Earth's history occurred[^3^]. This event wiped out about 95% of marine life and 70% of land life, possibly due to climate changes caused by volcanic eruptions, continental collisions, and ocean anoxia. It marked the transition from the era of ancient life to the era of modern life.\n- The Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary about 66 million years ago, when a large asteroid or comet hit Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula[^2^]. This event created a global impact winter that killed about 75% of all species, including most dinosaurs. It also opened up ecological niches for mammals and birds to diversify and dominate.\n- The Quaternary glaciation about 2.6 million years ago to present, when Earth entered a series of ice ages and interglacials[^7^]. This event shaped the landscape by eroding and depositing sediments, creating features such as moraines, drumlins, and fjords. It also influenced the evolution and migration of humans and other animals, as well as their culture and technology.\n\nThese are just some examples of geological events that have had significant effects on Earth's history. There are many other events that could be discussed, such as plate tectonics, volcanism, earthquakes, meteorite impacts, sea level changes, etc. Each event has its own causes, consequences, and implications for understanding Earth's past, present, and future.",

              "Four and a half billion years ago, two ancient planets collided and merged into one to become the Earth.",
              "During the colossal meeting of these two planets \u2013 proto-Earth and Theia \u2013 a small rocky mass spun off to become our moon.",

              "The effects of the Moon's actions upon Earth are still not fully understood.",

              "Wobbly orbit The most obvious effect the Moon has on the Earth can be seen in the ocean tides.",
              "As the Earth rotates each day, the Moon's gravity pulls the water on the nearest side of Earth towards it, creating a bulge.",
              "The sea bulges on the opposite side too due to centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation.",
              "The Earth rotates beneath these watery bulges, resulting in the two high tides and two low tides we see each day.",
              "Every 18.",
              "6 years the Moon's orbit \"wobbles\" between a maximum and minimum of plus or minus 5 degrees relative to the Earth's equator.",
              "This cycle, first documented in 1728, is called the lunar nodal cycle.",
              "When the lunar plane tilts away from the equatorial plane, the tides on Earth grow smaller.",
              "When the Moon's orbit is more in line with the Earth's equator, the tides are exaggerated.",
              "Now, Nasa says that rising sea levels due to climate change, combined with the influence of the lunar nodal cycle will cause a dramatic increase in the number of high-tide floods during the 2030s.",
              "Benjamin Hamlington, a research scientist and lead of Nasa's sea level change science team, is interested in how sea levels respond to both natural and human actions, and what that will mean for coastal populations.",
              "Before moving to California, Hamlington lived in coastal Virginia where flooding was already a big problem.",
              "\"High-tide flooding affects life very broadly in coastal communities.",
              "It impacts your ability to get to your job, makes it difficult for businesses to stay open,\" he says.",
              "\"Now it's an inconvenience \u2013 but it's going to become hard to ignore, hard to live with.\"",
              "These floods, exacerbated by the Moon, are set to damage infrastructure and change coastlines, Hamlington says.",
              "\"We may see four times the amount of flooding one decade to the next.",
              "The lunar nodal cycle affects all locations on Earth and sea levels are going up everywhere.",
              "So we'll see these rapid increases in high-tide floods across the globe.\"",
              "The lunar nodal cycle might be set to raise many challenges for humans, but for wildlife in coastal ecosystems it could be an existential threat.",
              "Ilia Rochlin, visiting professor at Rutgers University studies the link between the lunar nodal cycle and salt marsh mosquito populations.",
              "\"When the nodal cycle is at its peak, the high tides flood mosquito habitat further landward,\" Rochlin says.",
              "The tidal flooding occurs more often at this time, and brings with it killifish \u2013 a group of a few hundred species of minnow-like fish found in salt, brackish and fresh waters.",
              "These predators will eliminate or reduce mosquito populations that are in the egg, larva or pupa stages of development, before the insects are able to fly out of the water where they are born.",
              "\"Typically, there are fewer mosquitoes at the peak of the cycle,\" says Rochlin.",
              "\"At the trough of the nodal cycle, the tides may flood mosquito habitat very infrequently, giving them enough time to emerge thus increasing their populations.\"",
              "And it's not just mosquitos that are affected \u2013 their abundance is a proxy for the welfare of numerous other species.",
              "Salt marshes lack large mammalian herbivores, but in their place are invertebrates such as shrimp, crabs, snails, grasshoppers and other insects.",
              "These in turn are a major food source for shorebirds and fish.",
              "\"Peak lunar nodal cycle when combined with increased sea level rise creates the real possibility of drowning salt marshes,\" says Rochlin.",
              "And when the invertebrates of a salt marsh are drowned, the shorebird, fish and other species that depend on them suffer profoundly too.",
              "That includes people, as salt marshes are integral to the global economy, serving as nursery for a plethora of marine life that includes more than 75% of all fishery species.",
              "Salt marshes are also of significant environmental importance, able to store carbon at much greater rates than many land-based ecosystems. Freshwater wetlands, meanwhile, hold nearly 10 times more carbon than tidal saltwater sites, in part because of their very large extent.",
              "With increased flooding due to the Moon wobble and sea level rise, freshwater wetlands may also face a profound change.",
              "Kristine Hopfensperger is an environmental scientist at Northern Kentucky University who studies the salinisation of freshwater wetlands.",
              "\"Freshwater coastal wetlands experience great tidal fluctuations throughout a day, and are much more biodiverse than their salt marsh counterparts,\" she says.",
              "\"Many species are specialists so, as soon as the plants or first level of the food web begin to change composition from a diverse community of freshwater plant species to a less diverse community of salt-tolerating plants, the animals that rely on these plants may begin to change \u2013 the birds, terrestrial insects and so on.",
              "Freshwater aquatic species are also greatly impacted by increasing salinity and pushed upstream to remain in freshwater.",
              "\"Salinisation of freshwater coastal wetlands will continue to increase with rising sea levels \u2013 and the more frequent flooding is, the more the wetlands will be impacted by the salinity.\"",
              "A world without tides would have very different weather systems. Tides are one factor that influences the movement of ocean currents, which move warm or cool water about the Earth.",
              "Warm ocean currents bring warmer wetter weather, while cold ocean currents bring colder drier weather.",
              "One of the most important weather-producing phenomena on Earth may be affected by the lunar nodal cycle too.",
              "Usually, strong winds along the equator blow the warm surface water westward from South America towards Indonesia and cooler deep water rises up in its place.",
              "During an El Nin\u0303o event, these trade winds are weakened or even reversed, affecting weather all over the world.",
              "Warm surface water piles up near the west coast of South America and cold water remains deep in the ocean.",
              "Usually wet regions may be plunged into drought while dry regions may be deluged in rain, even causing deserts to burst into bloom.",
              "A La Nin\u0303a event, on the other hand, has the opposite effect of El Nin\u0303o.",
              "Trade winds are stronger than usual, pushing more warm water toward Asia.",
              "Cold waters that well up off the coast of the Americas then push the jet stream northward.",
              "The result is warmer than usual winter temperatures in the south and cooler than normal in the north.",
              "Together, the El Nin\u0303o and La Nin\u0303a phenomena are part of a cycle called the El Nin\u0303o-Southern Oscillation (Enso).",
              "(The \"Southern Oscillation\" part refers to the change in air pressure at sea level over the equatorial Pacific Ocean.)",
              "Scientists from Ohio State University have suggested the switch between El Nin\u0303o and La Nin\u0303a may be influenced by a subsurface ocean wave driven by lunar tidal gravitational force.",
              "Researchers at the University of Tokyo report that Enso may be predicted by looking at the Moon\u2019s 18.",
              "6-year nodal cycle.",
              "\"There certainly is a known lunar nodal effect on sea surface temperatures,\" says Phil Woodworth, a sea-level scientist and emeritus fellow of the UK's National Oceanography Centre.",
              "The Moon\u2019s gravitational pull influences tidal currents and so the movement and mixing of the upper layers of the ocean water, says Woodworth.",
              "\u201cThis especially applies to the North Pacific.\"",
              "Ice, land and air While the lunar nodal cycle is set to bring marked change over the coming decades, on a shorter timescale the Moon affects the Earth in a few other lesser-known ways.",
              "The Moon is also thought to affect polar temperatures and contribute to fluctuations in the extent of Arctic ice.",
              "Though here, the influence of the Moon is not its 18.",
              "6-year nodal cycle, but its more familiar monthly variation in the amount of light reflected from it as it waxes and wanes.",
              "Satellite measurements have shown that the poles are 0.",
              "55C warmer during a full Moon.",
              "In addition, tidal forces act to break up ice sheets and change ocean heat flows, altering the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean.",
              "The Moon generates tidal currents and waves both at the surface and deeper in the ocean, says Chris Wilson, expert in marine physics and ocean climate at the National Oceanography Centre.",

              "\u201cEverything that we\u2019ve thought about how magnetic fields are generated by planetary cores tells us that a body of the Moon\u2019s size should not be able to generate a field that\u2019s as strong as Earth\u2019s,\u201d said Alexander Evans, an assistant professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Brown and co-author of the study with Sonia Tikoo from Stanford University.",
              "\u201cBut instead of thinking about how to power a strong magnetic field continuously over billions of years, maybe there\u2019s a way to get a high-intensity field intermittently.",
              "Our model shows how that can happen, and it\u2019s consistent with what we know about the Moon\u2019s interior.",
              "\u201d Planetary bodies produce magnetic fields through what\u2019s known as a core dynamo.",
              "Slowly dissipating heat causes convection of molten metals in a planet\u2019s core.",

              "The Moon lacks a magnetic field today, and models of its core suggest that it was probably too small and lacked the convective force to have ever produced a continuously strong magnetic field.",
              "In order for a core to have a strong convective churn, it needs to dissipate a lot of heat.",
              "In the case of the early Moon, Evans says, the mantle surrounding the core wasn't much cooler than the core itself.",
              "Because the core\u2019s heat didn\u2019t have anywhere to go, there wasn\u2019t much convection in the core.",
              "But this new study shows how sinking rocks could have provided intermittent convective boosts.",
              "The story of these sinking stones starts a few million years after the Moon\u2019s formation.",
              "Very early in its history, the Moon is thought to have been covered by an ocean of molten rock.",
              "As the vast magma ocean began to cool and solidify, minerals like olivine and pyroxene that were denser than the liquid magma sank to the bottom, while less dense minerals like anorthosite floated to form the crust.",
              "The remaining liquid magma was rich in titanium as well as heat-producing elements like thorium, uranium and potassium, so it took a bit longer to solidify.",
              "When this titanium layer finally crystallized just beneath the crust, it was denser than the earlier-solidifying minerals below it.",
              "Over time, the titanium formations sank through the less-dense mantle rock underneath, a process known as gravitational overturn.",
              "For this new study, Evans and Tikoo modeled the dynamics of how those titanium formations would have sunk, as well as the effect they might have when they eventually reached the Moon\u2019s core.",
              "The analysis, which was based on the Moon\u2019s current composition and the estimated mantle viscosity, showed that the formations would likely break into blobs as small as 60 kilometers and diameter, and sink intermittently over the course of about a billion years.",
              "When each of these blobs eventually hit bottom, they would have given a major jolt to the Moon\u2019s core dynamo, the researchers found.",
              "Having been perched just below the Moon\u2019s crust, the titanium formations would have been relatively cool in temperature \u2014 far cooler than the core\u2019s estimated temperature of somewhere between 2,600 and 3,800 degrees Fahrenheit.",
              "When the cool blobs came in contact with the hot core after sinking, the temperature mismatch would have driven an increased core convection \u2014 enough to drive a magnetic field at the Moon\u2019s surface as strong or even stronger than Earth\u2019s.",
              "\u201cYou can think of it a little bit like a drop of water hitting a hot skillet,\u201d Evans said.",
              "\u201cYou have something really cold that touches the core, and suddenly a lot of heat can flux out.",
              "That causes churning in the core to increase, which gives you these intermittently strong magnetic fields.",
              "\u201d There could have been as many as 100 of these downwelling events over the Moon\u2019s first billion years of existence, the researchers say, and each one could have produced a strong magnetic field lasting a century or so.",
              "Evans says the intermittent magnetic model not only accounts for the strength of the magnetic signature found in the Apollo rock samples, but also for the fact that magnetic signatures vary widely in the Apollo collection\u2014with some having strong magnetic signatures while others don\u2019t.",
              "\u201cThis model is able to explain both the intensity and the variability we see in the Apollo samples \u2014 something that no other model has been able to do,\u201d Evans said.",
              "\u201cIt also gives us some time constraints on the foundering of this titanium material, which gives us a better picture of the Moon\u2019s early evolution.",
              "\u201d The idea is also quite testable, Evans says.",
              "It implies that there should have been a weak magnetic background on the Moon that was punctuated by these high-strength events.",
              "That should be evident in the Apollo collection.",
              "While the strong magnetic signatures in the Apollo samples stuck out like a sore thumb, weaker signatures have received less attention, Evans says.",
              "The presence of those weak signatures along with the strong ones would give this new idea a big boost, which could finally put the Moon\u2019s magnetic mystery to rest.",

              "[3] This began approximately 2.",
              "460\u20132.",
              "426 Ga (billion years) ago, during the Siderian period, and ended approximately 2.",
              "060 Ga, during the Rhyacian.",
              "[4] Geological, isotopic, and chemical evidence suggests that biologically-produced molecular oxygen (dioxygen or O2) started to accumulate in Earth's atmosphere and changed it from a weakly reducing atmosphere practically devoid of oxygen into an oxidizing one containing abundant free oxygen,[5] with oxygen levels being as high as 10% of their present atmospheric level by the end of the GOE.",
              "[6] The sudden injection of highly reactive free oxygen, toxic to the then-mostly anaerobic biosphere, may have caused the extinction of many existing organisms on Earth \u2013 then mostly archaeal colonies that used retinal to utilize green-spectrum light energy and power a form of anoxygenic photosynthesis (see Purple Earth hypothesis).",
              "Although the event is inferred to have constituted a mass extinction,[7] due in part to the great difficulty in surveying microscopic organisms' abundances, and in part to the extreme age of fossil remains from that time, the Great Oxidation Event is typically not counted among conventional lists of \"great extinctions\", which are implicitly limited to the Phanerozoic eon.",
              "In any case, Isotope geochemistry data from sulfate minerals have been interpreted to indicate a decrease in the size of the biosphere of >80% associated with changes in nutrient supplies at the end of the GOE.",
              "[8] The GOE is inferred to have been caused by cyanobacteria who evolved porphyrin-based photosynthesis, which produces dioxygen as a byproduct.",
              "The increasing oxygen level eventually depleted the reducing capacity of ferrous compounds, hydrogen sulfide and atmospheric methane, and compounded by a global glaciation, devastated the microbial mats around the Earth's surface.",
              "The subsequent adaptation of surviving archaea via symbiogenesis with aerobic proteobacteria (which went endosymbiont and became mitochondria) may have led to the rise of eukaryotic organisms and the subsequent evolution of multicellular life-forms.[9] The composition of the Earth's earliest atmosphere is not known with certainty.",
              "However, the bulk was likely nitrogen, N2, and carbon dioxide, CO2, which are also the predominant nitrogen- and carbon-bearing gases produced by volcanism today.",

              "A warm Earth, in spite of a faint Sun, is known as the faint young Sun paradox.",
              "[12] Either carbon dioxide levels were much higher at the time, providing enough of a greenhouse effect to warm the Earth, or other greenhouse gases were present.",
              "The most likely such gas is methane, CH4, which is a powerful greenhouse gas and was produced by early forms of life known as methanogens.",

              "[13] An atmosphere of N2 and CO2 with trace amounts of H2O, CH4, carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen (H2), is described as a weakly reducing atmosphere.",

              "[12] Cloud observed that detrital sediments older than about 2 billion years ago contained grains of pyrite, uraninite,[12] and siderite,[15] all minerals containing reduced forms of iron or uranium that are not found in younger sediments because they are rapidly oxidized in an oxidizing atmosphere.",

              "While the effects of an incomplete geological record have been discussed and quantified in the field of paleontology for several decades, particularly with respect to the evolution and extinction of organisms (the Signor-Lipps Effect), this is rarely quantified when considering geochemical records, and may therefore lead to uncertainties for scientists studying the timing of atmospheric oxygenation.",

              "[26][27] In contrast to redox-sensitive detrital minerals are red beds, red-colored sandstones that are coated with hematite.",
              "The occurrence of red beds indicates that there was sufficient oxygen to oxidize iron to its ferric state, and represent a marked contrast to sandstones deposited under anoxic conditions which are often beige, white, grey, or green.",

              "[29] Deposition of a banded iron formation requires both an anoxic deep ocean capable of transporting iron in soluble ferrous form, and an oxidized shallow ocean where the ferrous iron is oxidized to insoluble ferric iron and precipitates onto the ocean floor.",
              "[18] The deposition of banded iron formations before 1.",
              "8 billion years ago suggests the ocean was in a persistent ferruginous state, but deposition was episodic and there may have been significant intervals of euxinia.",
              "[30] The transition from deposition of banded iron formations to manganese oxides in some strata has been considered a key tipping point in the timing of the GOE because it is believed to indicate the escape of significant molecular oxygen into the atmosphere in the absence of ferrous iron as a reducing agent.",
              "[31] Black laminated shales, rich in organic matter, are often regarded as a marker for anoxic conditions.",
              "However, the deposition of abundant organic matter is not a sure indication of anoxia, and burrowing organisms that destroy lamination had not yet evolved during the time frame of the Great Oxygenation Event.",
              "Thus laminated black shale by itself is a poor indicator of oxygen levels.",
              "Scientists must look instead for geochemical evidence of anoxic conditions.",
              "These include ferruginous anoxia, in which dissolved ferrous iron is abundant, and euxinia, in which hydrogen sulfide is present in the water.",
              "[32] Examples of such indicators of anoxic conditions include the degree of pyritization (DOP), which is the ratio of iron present as pyrite to the total reactive iron.",
              "Reactive iron, in turn, is defined as iron found in oxides and oxyhydroxides, carbonates, and reduced sulfur minerals such as pyrites, in contrast with iron tightly bound in silicate minerals.",

              "Studies of the Black Sea, which is considered a modern model for ancient anoxic ocean basins, indicate that high DOP, a high ratio of reactive iron to total iron, and a high ratio of total iron to aluminum are all indicators of transport of iron into a euxinic environment.",
              "Ferruginous anoxic conditions can be distinguished from euxenic conditions by a DOP less than about 0.",
              "7.",
              "[32] The currently available evidence suggests that the deep ocean remained anoxic and ferruginous as late as 580 million years ago, well after the Great Oxygenation Event, remaining just short of euxenic during much of this interval of time.",
              "Deposition of banded iron formation ceased when conditions of local euxenia on continental platforms and shelves began precipitating iron out of upwelling ferruginous water as pyrite.",
              "[30][24][32] Some of the most persuasive evidence for the Great Oxidation Event is provided by the mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of sulfur.",

              "[34] The presence of this signature all but eliminates the possibility of an oxygenated atmosphere.",
              "[15] Different isotopes of a chemical element have slightly different atomic masses.",
              "Most of the differences in geochemistry between isotopes of the same element scale with this mass difference.",
              "These include small differences in molecular velocities and diffusion rates, which are described as mass-dependent fractionation processes.",
              "By contrast, mass-independent fractionation describes processes that are not proportional to the difference in mass between isotopes.",
              "The only such process likely to be significant in the geochemistry of sulfur is photodissociation.",
              "This is the process in which a molecule containing sulfur is broken up by solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.",
              "The presence of a clear MIF signature for sulfur prior to 2.",
              "4 billion years ago shows that UV radiation was penetrating deep into the Earth's atmosphere.",
              "This in turn rules out an atmosphere containing more than traces of oxygen, which would have produced an ozone layer that shielded the lower atmosphere from UV radiation.",
              "The disappearance of the MIF signature for sulfur indicates the formation of such an ozone shield as oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere.",
              "[15][24] Mass-dependent fractionation of sulphur also indicates the presence of oxygen in that oxygen is required to facilitate repeated redox cycling of sulphur.",
              "[35] Mass-dependent fractionation also provides clues to the Great Oxygenation Event.",
              "For example, oxidation of manganese in surface rocks by atmospheric oxygen leads to further reactions that oxidize chromium.",
              "The heavier 53Cr is oxidized preferentially over the lighter 52Cr, and the soluble oxidized chromium carried into the ocean shows this enhancement of the heavier isotope.",
              "The chromium isotope ratio in banded iron formation suggests small but significant quantities of oxygen in the atmosphere before the Great Oxidation Event, and a brief return to low oxygen abundance 500 million years after the Great Oxidation Event.",
              "However, the chromium data may conflict with the sulfur isotope data, which calls the reliability of the chromium data into question.",
              "[36][37] It is also possible that oxygen was present earlier only in localized \"oxygen oases\".",
              "[38] Since chromium is not easily dissolved, its release from rocks requires the presence of a powerful acid such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) which may have formed through bacterial oxidation of pyrite.",
              "This could provide some of the earliest evidence of oxygen-breathing life on land surfaces.",
              "[39] Other elements whose mass-dependent fractionation may provide clues to the Great Oxidation Event include carbon, nitrogen, transitional metals such as molybdenum and iron, and non-metal elements such as selenium.",

              "Before the infamous extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs, Earth experienced its worst ever mass extinction - and new evidence suggest it happened more rapidly in the sea than on land.",
              "Nearly 250 million years ago, massive volcanic eruptions caused the extinction of 95% of marine species and 70% of species on land.",
              "And, according to Pia Viglietti, a post-doctoral researcher at Chicago\u2019s Field Museum, \u201cPeople assumed that because the marine extinction happened over a short period of time, life on land should have followed the same pattern, but we found that the marine extinction may actually be a punctuation to a longer, more drawn-out event on land.",
              "\u201d Traditionally, scientists studying this extinction event have used marine fossils to understand what happened on land because aquatic fossils are better preserved.",
              "However, in this paper that is the first to examine how this extinction event affected vertebrates on land, the authors focused on nearly 600 fossilized species found within South Africa\u2019s Karoo Basin.",
              "After separating the fossils by age and grouping specimens by their occurrence within 300,000-year windows, the scientists were able to track when certain species disappeared from the fossil record.",
              "The researchers specifically focused on species like Lystrosaurus, which is considered a \u201cdisaster taxon\u201d because it continued to persist while other species disappeared.",
              "And, the fossils of these disaster-surviving individuals showed that species extinctions on land took nearly 10 times longer than they did in the sea.",
              "\u201cLystrosaurus is like a poster child for the end-Permian extinction that's always been portrayed as this animal that flourishes in the aftermath of all this extinction and just takes over,\" said Viglietti.",
              "\"But we see Lystrosaurus appearing before the extinction even got started, it was already abundant.",
              "It got us thinking about what was driving that abundance\u2014if Lystrosaurus just took over the barren landscape after other animals went extinct, or if the environment was changing and Lystrosaurus adapted to these changes that were causing extinction for all these other species.",
              "Our best guess is the latter.\"",
              "While it remains unclear why the extinction rates differ between the land and sea, one suggestion is that the oceans can absorb chemical changes in the atmosphere allowing conditions on land to stabilize (similar to today\u2019s ongoing climate crisis).",
              "Ultimately, understanding the conditions that led to this extinction could also help explain what gave rise to the age of the dinosaurs while also shining on a light on the biodiversity loss happening on Earth today.",
              "\"It takes a long time to recover from extinction.",
              "When we lose diversity, it's not going to recover in our lifetime, it's going to take hundreds of thousands of years, or even millions,\" said Viglietti.",

              "(Read about how Pangaea formed.)",
              "These huge eruptions, or flood basalt events, occurred during four periods over 600,000 years, but it\u2019s the first bout of volcanism that contributed to the death of so many organisms, said Blackburn.",
              "Some ancient crocodilian ancestors, eel-like animals called conodonts, and a mammalian group called therapsids were all hammered, with many disappearing from the fossil record around this time.",
              "Time Capsule Until now, the margin of error in calculating the timing of these eruptions ranged between one and three million years, leading to uncertainty over which happened first\u2014the eruptions or the mass extinction.",
              "But by using a rare mineral called zircon, found in igneous rocks like basalts, the researchers were able to narrow down their margin of error to 20,000 to 30,000 years\u2014pegging the initial eruptions to just before the mass extinction event.",
              "\u201cZircon is a perfect time capsule for dating those rocks,\u201d said Blackburn.",

              "By accurately placing the extinction event at the onset of the eruptions, climate modelers and other scientists may be able to pinpoint specific mechanisms like climate change that provoked the extinctions, Blackburn said.",
              "There is evidence that the initial volcanic eruptions doubled the amount of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which led to increased global temperatures and ocean acidification, he noted.",
              "This happened quickly, which probably didn\u2019t give organisms at the time much of a chance to adjust to the changes.",

              "Its center is offshore, but the crater is named after the onshore community of Chicxulub Pueblo.",
              "[3] It was formed slightly over 66 million years ago when a large asteroid, about ten kilometers (six miles) in diameter, struck Earth.",
              "The crater is estimated to be 180 kilometers (110 miles) in diameter and 20 kilometers (12 miles) in depth.",

              "It is now widely accepted that the resulting devastation and climate disruption was the cause of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction of 75% of plant and animal species on Earth, including all non-avian dinosaurs.",
              "[4] In the late 1970s, geologist Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth their theory that the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction was caused by an impact event.",
              "[5][6] The main evidence of such an impact was contained in a thin layer of clay present in the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary (K\u2013Pg boundary) in Gubbio, Italy.",
              "The Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium, a chemical element rare on Earth but common in asteroids.",
              "[5][7] Iridium levels in this layer were as much as 160 times above the background level.",
              "[8] It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across Earth's surface among other material thrown up by the impact, producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay.",
              "[9] At the time, there was no consensus on what caused the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction and the boundary layer, with theories including a nearby supernova, climate change, or a geomagnetic reversal.",
              "[8]: 1095 The Alvarezes' impact hypothesis was rejected by many paleontologists, who believed that the lack of fossils found close to the K\u2013Pg boundary\u2014the \"three-meter problem\"\u2014suggested a more gradual die-off of fossil species.",
              "[6][10] The Alvarezes, joined by Frank Asaro and Helen Michel from University of California, Berkeley, published their paper on the iridium anomaly in Science in June 1980.",
              "[8] Their paper was followed by other reports of similar iridium spikes at the K\u2013Pg boundary across the globe, and sparked wide interest in the cause of the K\u2013Pg extinction;",

              "[10]: 82 [11] There were no known impact craters that were the right age and size, spurring a search for a suitable candidate.",
              "[6] Recognizing the scope of the work, Lee Hunt and Lee Silver organized a cross-discipline meeting in Snowbird, Utah, in 1981.",
              "Unknown to them, evidence of the crater they were looking for was being presented the same week, and would be largely missed by the scientific community.",
              "[10]: 83\u201384 [11] In 1978, geophysicists Glen Penfield and Antonio Camargo were working for the Mexican state-owned oil company Petro\u0301leos Mexicanos (Pemex) as part of an airborne magnetic survey of the Gulf of Mexico north of the Yucata\u0301n Peninsula.",
              "[13]: 20\u20131 Penfield's job was to use geophysical data to scout possible locations for oil drilling.",
              "[5] In the offshore magnetic data, Penfield noted anomalies whose depth he estimated and mapped.",
              "He then obtained onshore gravity data from the 1940s.",
              "When the gravity maps and magnetic anomalies were compared, Penfield described a shallow \"bullseye\", 180 km (110 mi) in diameter, appearing on the otherwise non-magnetic and uniform surroundings\u2014clear evidence to him of an impact feature.",
              "[5][3] A decade earlier, the same map had suggested a crater to contractor Robert Baltosser, but Pemex corporate policy prevented him from publicizing his conclusion.",
              "[13]: 20 Penfield presented his findings to Pemex, who rejected the crater theory, instead deferring to findings that ascribed the feature to volcanic activity.",
              "[3] Pemex disallowed release of specific data, but let Penfield and Camargo present the results at the 1981 Society of Exploration Geophysicists conference.",
              "[11] That year's conference was under-attended and their report attracted scant attention, with many experts on impact craters and the K\u2013Pg boundary attending the Snowbird conference instead.",
              "Carlos Byars, a Houston Chronicle journalist who was familiar with Penfield and had seen the gravitational and magnetic data himself, wrote a story on Penfield and Camargo's claim, but the news did not disseminate widely.",

              "3 kilometers (4,300 ft) down.",
              "This layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an Earth impact, but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a lava dome\u2014a feature uncharacteristic of the region's geology.",

              "Phinney, curator of the lunar rocks at the Johnson Space Center, to find these samples to support his hypothesis.",
              "[3] Penfield tried to secure site samples, but was told they had been lost or destroyed.",
              "When attempts to return to the drill sites to look for corroborating rocks proved fruitless, Penfield abandoned his search, published his findings and returned to his Pemex work.",
              "[5] Seeing the 1980 Science paper, Penfield wrote to Walter Alvarez about the Yucata\u0301n structure, but received no response.",
              "[11] Alvarez and other scientists continued their search for the crater, although they were searching in oceans based on incorrect analysis of glassy spherules from the K\u2013Pg boundary that suggested the impactor had landed in open water.",

              "[14] Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, thought to have been scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by an impact event.",
              "Such deposits occur in many locations but seemed concentrated in the Caribbean Basin at the K\u2013Pg boundary.",
              "When Haitian professor Florentine Mora\u0301s discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact.",
              "Tests on samples retrieved from the K\u2013Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.",
              "[5] In 1990, Carlos Byars told Hildebrand of Penfield's earlier discovery of a possible impact crater.",
              "[15]: 50 Hildebrand contacted Penfield and the pair soon secured two drill samples from the Pemex wells, which had been stored in New Orleans for decades.",
              "[3] Hildebrand's team tested the samples, which clearly showed shock-metamorphic materials.",
              "[5] A team of California researchers surveying satellite images found a cenote (sinkhole) ring centered on the town of Chicxulub Pueblo that matched the one Penfield saw earlier;",
              "the cenotes were thought to be caused by subsidence of bolide-weakened lithostratigraphy around the impact crater wall.",
              "[16] More recent evidence suggests the crater is 300 km (190 mi) wide, and the 180 km (110 mi) ring is an inner wall of it.",
              "[17] Hildebrand, Penfield, Boynton, Camargo, and others published their paper identifying the crater in 1991.",
              "[10][14] The crater was named for the nearby town of Chicxulub.",
              "Penfield also recalled that part of the motivation for the name was \"to give the academics and NASA naysayers a challenging time pronouncing it\" after years of dismissing its existence.",
              "[3] In March 2010, forty-one experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: twenty years' worth of data spanning a variety of fields.",
              "They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the K\u2013Pg boundary.",
              "[6][4] Dissenters, notably Gerta Keller of Princeton University, have proposed an alternate culprit: the eruption of the Deccan Traps in what is now the Indian subcontinent.",
              "This period of intense volcanism occurred before and after the Chicxulub impact;",
              "[6][18] dissenting studies argue that the worst of the volcanic activity occurred before the impact, and the role of the Deccan Traps was instead shaping the evolution of surviving species post-impact.",
              "[19] A 2013 study compared isotopes in impact glass from the Chicxulub impact with isotopes in ash from the K\u2013Pg boundary, concluding that they were dated almost exactly the same within experimental error.",
              "[2] A 2013 study published in Science estimated the age of the impact as 66,043,000 \u00b1 11,000 years ago (\u00b1 43,000 years ago considering systematic error), based on multiple lines of evidence, including argon\u2013argon dating of tektites from Haiti and bentonite horizons overlying the impact horizon in northeastern Montana, United States.",
              "[2] This date was supported by a 2015 study based on argon\u2013argon dating of tephra found in lignite beds in the Hell Creek and overlying Fort Union formations in northeastern Montana.",
              "[20] A 2018 study based on argon\u2013argon dating of spherules from Gorgonilla Island, Colombia, obtained a slightly different result of 66,051,000 \u00b1 31,000 years ago.",
              "[21] The impact has been interpreted to have occurred in Northern Hemisphere spring based on annual isotope curves in sturgeon and paddlefish bones found in an ejecta-bearing sedimentary unit at the Tanis site in southwestern North Dakota.",
              "This sedimentary unit is thought to have formed within hours of impact.",
              "[22] A 2020 study concluded that the Chicxulub crater was formed by an inclined (45\u201360\u00b0 to horizontal) impact from the northeast.",
              "[23] The site of the crater at the time of impact was a marine carbonate platform.",
              "[24] The water depth at the impact site varied from 100 meters (330 ft) on the western edge of the crater to over 1,200 meters (3,900 ft) on the northeastern edge, with an estimated depth at the centre of the impact of approximately 650 meters (2,130 ft).",

              "[26] There is broad consensus that the Chicxulub impactor was a C-type asteroid with a carbonaceous chondrite-like composition, rather than a comet.",

              "The meteorite was suggested to represent a fragment of the Chicxulub impactor.",
              "Analysis suggested that it best fitted the criteria of the CV, CO and CR groups of carbonaceous chondrites.",

              "[27] The impactor was around 10 kilometers (6.",

              "The difference between the two impact melts is interpreted to be a result of the upper part of the initial impact melt, represented by the LIMB in the borehole, becoming mixed with materials from the shallow part of the crust either falling back into the crater or being brought back by the resurgence forming the UIM.",
              "[58] The \"pink granite\", a granitoid rich in alkali feldspar found in the peak ring borehole shows many deformation features that record the extreme strains associated with the formation of the crater and the subsequent development of the peak ring.",

              "[14]: 4 [64] From the cenote locations, the karstic aquifer is clearly related to the underlying crater rim,[65] possibly through higher levels of fracturing, caused by differential compaction.",

              "They proposed that the \"Chicxulub asteroid\" was also a member of this group.",
              "[67] The Baptistina family was subsequently considered an unlikely source of the Chicxulub asteroid because a spectrographic analysis published in 2009 revealed that 298 Baptistina has a different composition more typical of an S-type asteroid than the presumed carbonaceous chondrite composition of the Chicxulub impactor.",
              "[68] In 2011, data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer revised the date of the collision which created the Baptistina family to about 80 million years ago.",
              "This made an asteroid from the family highly unlikely to be the asteroid that created the Chicxulub crater, as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years.",

              "Using statistical analysis and gravitational simulations, Loeb and Siraj say that a significant fraction of a type of comet originating from the Oort cloud, a sphere of debris at the edge of the solar system, was bumped off-course by Jupiter\u2019s gravitational field during its orbit and sent close to the sun, whose tidal force broke apart pieces of the rock.",
              "That increases the rate of comets like Chicxulub (pronounced Chicks-uh-lub) because these fragments cross the Earth\u2019s orbit and hit the planet once every 250 to 730 million years or so.",

              "\u201d It\u2019s because of this that long-period comets, which take more than 200 years to orbit the sun, are called sun grazers, he said.",
              "\u201cWhen you have these sun grazers, it\u2019s not so much the melting that goes on, which is a pretty small fraction relative to the total mass, but the comet is so close to the sun that the part that\u2019s closer to the sun feels a stronger gravitational pull than the part that is farther from the sun, causing a tidal force\u201d he said.",

              "\u201d The calculations from Loeb and Siraj\u2019s theory increase the chances of long-period comets impacting Earth by a factor of about 10, and show that about 20 percent of long-period comets become sun grazers.",

              "The pair claim that their new rate of impact is consistent with the age of Chicxulub, providing a satisfactory explanation for its origin and other impactors like it.",

              "\u201cWe are suggesting that, in fact, if you break up an object as it comes close to the sun, it could give rise to the appropriate event rate and also the kind of impact that killed the dinosaurs.",

              "\u201cOur hypothesis predicts that other Chicxulub-size craters on Earth are more likely to correspond to an impactor with a primitive (carbonaceous chondrite) composition than expected from the conventional main-belt asteroids,\u201d the researchers wrote in the paper.",
              "This is important because a popular theory on the origin of Chicxulub claims the impactor is a fragment of a much larger asteroid that came from the main belt, which is an asteroid population between the orbit of Jupiter and Mars.",
              "Only about a tenth of all main-belt asteroids have a composition of carbonaceous chondrite, while it\u2019s assumed most long-period comets have it.",

              "The researchers say that composition evidence supports their model and that the years the objects hit support both their calculations on impact rates of Chicxulub-sized tidally disrupted comets and for smaller ones like the impactor that made the Zhamanshin crater.",

              "In addition to triggering a mass extinction, the impact sent superheated water cycling deep into the crust.",
              "Science Photo Library/Alamy Stock Photo By Carolyn Gramling June 1, 2020 at 12:56 pm The asteroid that slammed into Earth 66 million years ago left behind more than a legacy of mass destruction.",
              "That impact also sent superheated seawater swirling through the crust below for more than a million years, chemically overhauling the rocks.",
              "Similar transformative hydrothermal systems, left in the wake of powerful impacts much earlier in Earth\u2019s history, may have been a crucible for early microbial life on Earth, researchers report May 29 in Science Advances.",
              "The massive Chicxulub crater on Mexico\u2019s Yucata\u0301n Peninsula is the fingerprint of a killer, probably responsible for the destruction of more than 75 percent of life on Earth, including all nonbird dinosaurs (SN: 1/25/17).",
              "In 2016, a team of scientists made a historic trek to the partially submerged crater, drilling deep into the rock to study the crime scene from numerous angles.",
              "One of those researchers was planetary scientist David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.",
              "A dozen years earlier, Kring had found evidence at Chicxulub that the layers of rock bearing the signs of impact \u2014 telltale features such as shocked quartz and melted spherules \u2014 were subsequently cut through by veins of newer minerals such as quartz and anhydrite.",
              "Such veins, Kring thought, suggest that hot hydrothermal fluids had been circulating beneath Chicxulub some time after the impact.",
              "Hydrothermal systems can occur where Earth is tectonically active, such as where tectonic plates pull the seafloor apart, or where mantle plumes like the one beneath Yellowstone rise up into the crust.",
              "The molten rock rising through the crust in these regions superheats water already circulating within the crust.",
              "But the Yucata\u0301n Peninsula is tectonically quiescent, and has been for 66 million years, Kring says.",
              "So, as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program\u2019s Expedition 364 to Chicxulub, he and colleagues drilled 1,335 meters below the the crater\u2019s peak ring, a circular, mountainous region within the vast crater bowl, and retrieved long cores of sediment and rock.",
              "The team then analyzed the minerals found in the cores.",
              "\u201cIt was immediately obvious that they had been hydrothermally altered.",
              "It was pervasive and apparent,\u201d Kring says.",
              "The intense heat of the circulating seawater caused chemical reactions within the rock, transforming some minerals into others.",
              "By identifying the different types of minerals, the team determined that the initial temperature of the fluids was more than 300\u00b0 Celsius, later cooling to about 90\u00b0 C.",
              "The entire length of the cores showed chemically altered rocks, but computer simulations suggest the hydrothermal alteration beneath the crater likely goes much deeper into the crust, down to perhaps four or five kilometers.",
              "The hydrothermally altered zone covers a volume more than nine times that of the Yellowstone Caldera system, Kring says.",
              "Paleomagnetic data suggest that the hydrothermal system lasted for more than a million years.",
              "Those conditions, the researchers say, may have also been capable of fostering life akin to the extremophiles that thrive in Yellowstone\u2019s boiling pools.",
              "In addition to the metal-rich fluids that could provide an energy source for microbes, the Chicxulub cores revealed that the rocks were both porous and permeable \u2014 in other words, filled with interconnected nooks and crannies that could have been cozy shelters for microbes.",
              "\u201cIt looks like a perfect habitat,\u201d Kring says.",
              "Kring has previously suggested that the very same destructive impacts that annihilate life may also create appealing habitats \u2014 not just on Earth, but potentially on other planetary bodies such as Mars.",
              "Even more tantalizing is the possibility that hydrothermal systems, engendered beneath ancient impacts, may have been where life on Earth began (SN: 3/1/13).",
              "Evidence from lunar craters suggests that Earth was heavily bombarded by asteroids about 3.",
              "9 billion years ago (SN: 10/18/04).",
              "Most of those more ancient craters on Earth have long since vanished or been altered by the constant tectonic recycling of Earth\u2019s surface (SN: 12/18/18).",
              "So the hydrothermal system beneath Chicxulub offers a window into what such systems might have actually looked like much deeper in the past, says geophysicist Norman Sleep of Stanford University, who was not involved in the study.",
              "\u201cIt shows the reality of the process,\u201d Sleep says.",
              "The new study may set the stage for the possibility of life thriving beneath an impact.",
              "But whether a microbial cast of characters was actually present beneath Chicxulub is a question for future studies, Kring says.",
              "\u201cLet me be clear: This paper has no evidence of microbial life,\u201d Kring says.",
              "\u201cWe just have all the properties of hydrothermal systems that do support life elsewhere on Earth.",

              "The K\u2013Pg boundary marks the end of the Cretaceous Period, the last period of the Mesozoic Era, and marks the beginning of the Paleogene Period, the first period of the Cenozoic Era.",
              "Its age is usually estimated at around 66 million years,[2] with radiometric dating yielding a more precise age of 66.",

              "011 Ma.",
              "[3] The K\u2013Pg boundary is associated with the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction which destroyed a majority of the world's Mesozoic species, including all dinosaurs except for birds.",
              "[4] Strong evidence exists that the extinction coincided with a large meteorite impact at the Chicxulub crater and the generally accepted scientific theory is that this impact triggered the extinction event.",
              "The word \"Cretaceous\" is derived from the Latin \"creta\" (chalk).",
              "It is abbreviated K (as in \"K\u2013Pg boundary\") for its German translation \"Kreide\" (chalk).",
              "[5] In 1980, a team of researchers led by Nobel prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Vaughn Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary contain a concentration of iridium hundreds of times greater than normal.",
              "They suggested that this layer was evidence of an impact event that triggered worldwide climate disruption and caused the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth suddenly became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs.",
              "[8] When it was originally proposed, one issue with the \"Alvarez hypothesis\" (as it came to be known) was that no documented crater matched the event.",
              "This was not a lethal blow to the theory;",
              "while the crater resulting from the impact would have been larger than 250 km (160 mi) in diameter, Earth's geological processes hide or destroy craters over time.",
              "[9] The Chicxulub crater is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucata\u0301n Peninsula in Mexico.",
              "[10] Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named.",
              "[11] It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 10\u201315 km (6.",

              "The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary (K\u2013Pg boundary), slightly more than 66 million years ago.",
              "[7] The crater is estimated to be over 150 km (93 mi) in diameter[10] and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10\u201330 km (6.",
              "2\u201318.",

              "It makes the feature the second of the largest confirmed impact structures on Earth, and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.",
              "[14] The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucata\u0301n during the late 1970s.",
              "Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search.",
              "Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature.",
              "Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz,[15] a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.",
              "In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself.",
              "The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.",
              "The shape and location of the crater indicate further causes of devastation in addition to the dust cloud.",
              "The asteroid landed right on the coast and would have caused gigantic tsunamis, for which evidence has been found all around the coast of the Caribbean and eastern United States\u2014marine sand in locations which were then inland, and vegetation debris and terrestrial rocks in marine sediments dated to the time of the impact.",
              "[16][17] The asteroid landed in a bed of anhydrite (CaSO4) or gypsum (CaSO4\u00b72(H2O)), which would have ejected large quantities of sulfur trioxide SO3 that combined with water to produce a sulfuric acid aerosol.",
              "This would have further reduced the sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and then over several days, precipitated planet-wide as acid rain, killing vegetation, plankton and organisms which build shells from calcium carbonate (coccolithophorids and molluscs).",
              "[18][19] Before 2000, arguments that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 Ma and lasted for over 2 million years.",
              "However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created within 1 million years about 65.",
              "5 Ma, so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly a period of thousands of years, but still a longer period than what would be expected from a single impact event.",
              "[20][21] The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants.",
              "In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.",
              "[21] In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data.",
              "While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim.",
              "Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact.",
              "However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.",
              "[22] Several other craters also appear to have been formed about the time of the K\u2013Pg boundary.",
              "This suggests the possibility of nearly simultaneous multiple impacts, perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object, similar to the Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 cometary impact with Jupiter.",
              "Among these are the Boltysh crater, a 24 km (15 mi) diameter impact crater in Ukraine (65.",
              "17 \u00b1 0.",
              "64 Ma);",
              "and the Silverpit crater, a 20 km (12 mi) diameter impact crater in the North Sea (60\u201365 Ma).",
              "Any other craters that might have formed in the Tethys Ocean would have been obscured by erosion and tectonic events such as the relentless northward drift of Africa and India.",
              "[23][24][25] A very large structure in the sea floor off the west coast of India was interpreted in 2006 as a crater by three researchers.",
              "[26] The potential Shiva crater, 450\u2013600 km (280\u2013370 mi) in diameter, would substantially exceed Chicxulub in size and has been estimated to be about 66 mya, an age consistent with the K\u2013Pg boundary.",
              "An impact at this site could have been the triggering event for the nearby Deccan Traps.",
              "[27] However, this feature has not yet been accepted by the geologic community as an impact crater and may just be a sinkhole depression caused by salt withdrawal.",
              "[25] Clear evidence exists that sea levels fell in the final stage of the Cretaceous by more than at any other time in the Mesozoic era.",
              "In some Maastrichtian stage rock layers from various parts of the world, the later ones are terrestrial;",
              "earlier ones represent shorelines and the earliest represent seabeds.",
              "These layers do not show the tilting and distortion associated with mountain building;",
              "therefore, the likeliest explanation is a regression, that is, a buildout of sediment, but not necessarily a drop in sea level.",
              "No direct evidence exists for the cause of the regression, but the explanation which is currently accepted as the most likely is that the mid-ocean ridges became less active and therefore sank under their own weight as sediment from uplifted orogenic belts filled in structural basins.",
              "[28][29] A severe regression would have greatly reduced the continental shelf area, which is the most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction.",
              "However, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction.",
              "The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore increasing global temperatures.",
              "[30] Marine regression also resulted in the reduction in area of epeiric seas, such as the Western Interior Seaway of North America.",
              "The reduction of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing coastal plains that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the Dinosaur Park Formation.",
              "Another consequence was an expansion of freshwater environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans.",
              "While this change was favorable to freshwater vertebrates, those that prefer marine environments, such as sharks, suffered.",
              "[31] Another discredited cause for the K\u2013Pg extinction event is cosmic radiation from a nearby supernova explosion.",
              "An iridium anomaly at the boundary is consistent with this hypothesis.",
              "However, analysis of the boundary layer sediments failed to find 244Pu,[32] a supernova byproduct[clarification needed] which is the longest-lived plutonium isotope, with a half-life of 81 million years.",
              "An attempt to link volcanism - like the Deccan Traps - and impact events causally in the other direction compared to the proposed Shiva crater is the so-called Verneshot hypothesis (named for Jules Verne), which proposes that volcanism might have gotten so intense as to \"shoot up\" material into a ballistic trajectory into space before it fell down as an impactor.",
              "Due to the spectacular nature of this proposed mechanism, the scientific community has largely reacted with skepticism to this hypothesis.",
              "It is possible that more than one of these hypotheses may be a partial solution to the mystery, and that more than one of these events may have occurred.",
              "Both the Deccan Traps and the Chicxulub impact may have been important contributors.",
              "For example, the most recent dating of the Deccan Traps supports the idea that rapid eruption rates in the Deccan Traps may have been triggered by large seismic waves radiated by the impact.",

              "How did this placental ancestor, as well as the monotremes and the marsupials, survive when so many other vertebrate groups did not?",
              "There is growing debate about whether the ballistic impact ejecta that re-entered the Earth's atmosphere following the Chicxulub impact could have generated an initial infrared heat pulse sufficient to ignite wildfires globally [10\u201315].",
              "If global wildfires did occur, they would undoubtedly have been responsible for the extermination of all mammals that could not seek safe refuge from the short- and long-term effects of the fires.",
              "Indeed, it is the differential survival of vertebrates following the impact which currently provides one avenue of support for the wildfires notion [3,11].",
              "No large-sized, non-marine reptile, bird or mammal, that is, a vertebrate too large to seek refuge underground, in tree cavities or underwater, survived the K-Pg boundary extinction event [3].",
              "The predominant hypothesis is that small mammals survived both the short- and long-term effects of the impact by hibernating in a safe refuge, typically, underground [3,16].",
              "It has been estimated that the long-term effects of the impact lasted for a year or more [3,4].",
              "However, in extant tropical placental mammals there is no known hibernation phenotype that would allow such long periods of hibernation.",
              "Long-term hibernation (more than six months) is typically associated with mammals which inhabit temperate, high-latitude and/or high-altitude, highly seasonal cold environments [17].",
              "For example, year-long hibernation has been reported in captive mountain pygmy possums (a marsupial) [18].",
              "Cold environments appeared in the Late Cenozoic only, and certainly did not exist at the K-Pg boundary [19,20].",

              "In this study, we report a plesiomorphic (ancestral) capacity for long-term hibernation that exists in an extant, phylogenetically basal, tropical placental mammal, the common tenrec, Tenrec ecaudatus.",
              "The Tenrecidae belong to the superorder Afrotheria, which includes elephants, dugongs and manatees, hyraxes, golden moles, elephant-shrews (sengis) and the aardvark [27].",

              "We argue that the capacity for long-term tropical hibernation in basal placental mammals was the key attribute which enabled them to survive the K-Pg extinction event along with presumably heterothermic marsupial [29] and monotreme [25,26,30] ancestors.",

              "by Lucas Joel Tuesday, September 20, 2016 This jaw fragment is part of a specimen of Didelphodon, a cat-sized marsupial predator that went extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction.",
              "Credit: Nick Longrich.",
              "Mammals, unlike the remaining nonavian dinosaurs and many other animals, are thought to have fared relatively well through the massive meteorite impact and protracted volcanism at the end of the Cretaceous 66 million years ago.",
              "After the extinction, mammals went on to dominate terrestrial ecosystems. But new research indicates that mammals might have taken a bigger hit than paleontologists have realized: Instead of about 75 to 85 percent of species going extinct, as prior studies suggested, it looks like about 93 percent of all mammal species may have gone extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction.",
              "The problem with the earlier estimates is that most studies that have reconstructed what happened to mammals across the K-Pg boundary have only looked at limited geographic regions, says Nick Longrich, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Bath in England and lead author of a new study published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology.",
              "But \u201cthe big picture looks different than the local picture,\u201d Longrich says.",
              "\u201cTraditionally, people have picked one little area and focused on it, but we collected data a\u0302\u0080\u00a6 from all over North America.",
              "\u201d When researchers studying and quantifying the extinction focus only on specific localities, Longrich says, they run the risk of not accounting for species that lived outside that area, and whose geographic range was limited but that also went extinct along with more common mammals.",
              "Longrich and his co-authors compiled mammal fossil occurrence data from across the K-Pg boundary from a variety of different previous studies.",
              "Based on this more holistic view, they found that Earth\u2019s mammalian fauna \u201clost more than 90 percent of its diversity,\u201d Longrich says.",
              "However, it \u201cthen gained that back, and then doubled what it was before [the extinction] within 300,000 years, which, geologically, is not a long time,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cThis is an extraordinarily rapid recovery,\u201d and one in which there might have been almost no delay between the asteroid impact and when mammals began diversifying.",
              "The new study is novel in that it \u201cshows that the extinction might have been a little more intense than what people thought,\u201d says David Grossnickle, a graduate student studying paleontology at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the new work.",
              "At what tempo the mammalian recovery proceeded, though, is still up for debate, Grossnickle says.",
              "Whether mammals recovered and began diversifying quickly, as Longrich and his colleagues suggest, or whether \u201cit took mammals a little time [perhaps closer to 1 million years, according to other recent estimates] to actually recover, and then start to radiate\u201d is unclear, he says.",
              "Part of the reason for this discrepancy goes back to the fact that paleontologists aren\u2019t all looking at the same data.",
              "\u201cWe\u2019re not all looking at the same groups [of animals] at the same time,\u201d Grossnickle says, which can lead to different interpretations with respect to the timing of recovery.",
              "Another pattern Longrich and his team spotted was that, during the mammals' recovery, distinct populations became separated.",
              "Longrich likens what his team found to the hypothetical aftermath of a future extinction that leaves rats, cockroaches and pigeons living: You might expect that each of them would spread out, filling ecological niches globally, he says, \u201cbut instead what we have is that the rats dominate in one place, the pigeons dominate another place and the cockroaches\u201d yet another.",
              "Before the K-Pg extinction, many mammals were common and widespread, Longrich says.",
              "Afterward, though, mammalian populations fractured.",
              "Mammals that had been more widespread going into the extinction stood a better chance of surviving than those confined to specific areas, Longrich says.",
              "\u201cYou\u2019re more likely to survive if you don\u2019t have all your eggs in one basket.",
              "\u201d However, there was also an element of luck involved: Both Didelphodon, a marsupial, and the rodent-like Mesodma were common and widespread, for example, but while Mesodma survived through the extinction, Didelphodon did not.",
              "And the species that went on to dominate disparate locales were ones that were \u201clucky\u201d through the extinction more so than those that may have been best-adapted to each particular environment, he says.",
              "Grossnickle says that continuing work needs to further examine the impact that other forces, like food availability, had on mammalian diversity through the K-Pg extinction.",
              "For example, flowering plants, which evolved toward the end of the Cretaceous, had become a major mammalian food source, he notes, adding that it\u2019s possible \u201cmammals' evolutionary trajectories are more linked to the availability of the food that they are eating\u201d than has been realized.",
              "An \u201cecosystem-wide\u201d perspective would combine data on different mammal and plant groups, he says, and could help clarify mammalian diversification patterns across the K-Pg boundary.",

              "The northern extent of the ice is poorly known at best.",
              "Similar sequences are found from Scandinavian ice sheets and from ice in the Swiss and Austrian Alps.",
              "There have certainly been previous periods of geologic time in which glaciers were extensive (during the late Precambrian and the Permian Period, for example), but the Quaternary has left a distinctive imprint on modern landscapes and surface environments.",
              "The most distinguishing characteristics of the Quaternary in middle and high latitudes are glacial sediments and evidence of glacial erosion.",
              "Glacial erosion is the predominant feature of high mountains such as the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, and Rockies.",
              "Glacial erosion has sculpted deep alpine valleys, and it has left sharp erosional remnants such as the Matterhorn in Europe.",
              "Valley glaciers near the ocean sculpted deep fjords in Norway, Greenland, northern Canada, Alaska, Chile, and Antarctica.",
              "Submerged on the continental shelf are even larger sculpted troughs formed by ice streams, large fast-moving tongues of ice draining from continental ice sheets.",
              "These troughs are ubiquitous on the Antarctic shelf near the largest modern ice sheet.",
              "Relict examples are found in the Laurentian Trough, the Hudson Strait, the Barents Sea north of Norway, and many other locations.",
              "Other large-scale examples of glacial erosion include the Great Lakes and the Finger Lakes of New York.",
              "In innumerable smaller examples, a combination of glacial erosion and deposition so altered the landscape as to derange the drainage completely, resulting in the tens of thousands of lakes of Minnesota, Maine, and Alaska as well as Canada, Scandinavia, and northern Russia.",
              "Limited examples exist in the Southern Hemisphere, such as the lake districts of New Zealand and Chile.",
              "Glaciers deposit sediments and other geologic debris called till, especially near their bases, sides, or fronts.",
              "Ridges of till and outwash sand left at the terminal or lateral margins of glaciers are known as moraines, and major moraine belts mark former continental ice sheets in the middle portions of North America, Europe, and Scandinavia.",
              "Nowhere is the importance of moraines to forming the landscape more evident than Long Island, New York.",
              "The entire island is framed by two major terminal moraines (the Harbor Hill and Ronkonkama Moraines) associated with the Laurentide Ice Sheet.",
              "First deposited between 22,000 and 18,000 years ago, these glacial sediments were subsequently reworked by coastal and stream processes into the sandy barrier islands off of Long Island\u2019s south shore.",
              "Other types of glacial deposits are widespread in the Northern Hemisphere north of roughly 40\u201350\u00b0 N latitude, forming many landscapes and shorelines.",
              "Till also forms drumlins, streamlined hills that align with former ice movement.",
              "Excellent examples are seen in Boston Harbor, Nova Scotia, Ireland, Scandinavia, and northwestern Canada.",
              "In other areas, till is more irregular (see kame) or deposited as a thin blanket over bedrock.",
              "Moving water also plays a large part in sediment deposition and subglacial erosion.",
              "One of the most striking landforms in formerly glaciated terrain is the esker.",
              "Eskers are sinuous ridges 20 or 30 metres (65 or 100 feet) high and hundreds of kilometres in length, with steep side walls.",
              "They were deposited in pressurized tunnels at the base of ice sheets during melting phases.",
              "They are well displayed in Ontario, Maine, and Sweden.",
              "Other ice-contact stratified drift was emplaced adjacent to melting ice walls in valleys (kame terraces), as wet alluvial fans (valley train deposits), and as deltas built into glacial lakes and the sea.",
              "Glacial-marine deltas are well exposed in Maine and the Canadian Maritime Provinces, where they provide clear evidence of postglacial sea-level changes\u2014including some terrain that has risen more than 100 metres since the ice retreated, a phenomenon called isostatic rebound.",
              "In drier areas extensive sand dunes and loess sheets were produced.",
              "Loess blown from outwash fans and river valleys in front of the glaciers accumulated to more than eight metres in thickness along much of the Mississippi River valley.",
              "These deposits become thinner to the east, showing the influence of prevailing westerly winds.",
              "Other thick loess deposits are found in Europe and Asia, including extensive sections along the Huang He (Yellow River) west of Beijing.",
              "Extensive glacial lakes were formed by a variety of glacial-age dams. They could form simply as pools in the depressions created by the ice sheets, in eroded scours, such as the Great Lakes and the Finger Lakes of New York, by ice dams, or by dams of glacial sediments.",
              "Glacial lakes of various sizes ringed the decaying Laurentide Ice Sheet in North America, such as Canada\u2019s former Lake Agassiz, leaving extensive laminated silts and clays.",
              "Remnants of glacial lakes are found in the great arc of Canadian lakes such as Great Bear, Great Slave, Athabasca, Winnipeg, and the Great Lakes.",
              "Similar deposits and remnant lakes are found in Europe and Asia, with evidence that glacial-age rivers may have flowed extensively to the south into the Aral, Caspian, and Black seas.",
              "Away from the direct influence of glaciers, there were also many large pluvial lakes, water bodies formed by heavier rains brought by shifting jet streams and storm tracks.",
              "These regions are now dry, including many valleys in Nevada and Utah that now contain dry salt flats or shrunken remnants.",
              "Lake Lahontan and Lake Bonneville were two of the largest of these.",
              "The Great Salt Lake is the modern remnant of Lake Bonneville, whose highest shoreline was formed 18,000 years ago, 330 metres (1,000 feet) above the present lake level.",
              "Pluvial lakes were formed as far south as Mexico, Africa, and other locations.",
              "The timing of their formation, however, does not correlate easily because of the complex patterns of shifting climates.",
              "Lakes contain excellent records of climate change in their shorelines, deep-basin sediments, and fossil record.",
              "For example, Lake Tulane in Florida has been extensively studied for its fossil pollen, returning a 50,000-year record that seems to correlate with the marine record of Heinrich Events."

              "A wealth of evidence is available in Europe for the development of human technology and culture during the Upper Paleolithic through Neolithic cultural stages, ranging from the skillfully crafted stone, bone, and wooden tools found in many locations to rare but revealing cave art.",
              "These artifacts can be interpreted in various ways, but they clearly were the product of intelligent and emotionally complex humans.",
              "It is probably no coincidence that after the strictures imposed by cold and rapidly changing Pleistocene climates and landscapes, human civilization and recorded history arose during the more amenable climate of the Holocene.",

              "A striking aspect of Quaternary sediments is that many occur in recognizable association with landforms and environments in which they were produced.",
              "Thus, Quaternary lake shorelines and sediments are associated with modern remnant lakes, as at the Great Salt Lake in Utah, a remnant of Lake Bonneville.",

              "They form the breadbasket of the North American central plains.",
              "Much of this abundance comes from the vast floors of former glacial lakes, such as Lake Agassiz and the windblown glacial-age dust that accumulated as thick layers of silt called loess.",
              "Reworking of these primary deposits by streams and rivers formed the vast floodplains and deltas of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers of the United States, the Huang He and the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) of China, the Rhine valley of Europe, and others around the world.",
              "Deposits of sand and gravel left by melting glaciers are crucial raw materials for civil engineering and construction projects worldwide.",

              "Lawrence, the Grand Banks, and the Irish, Celtic, and North seas were all affected by sea-level changes and, in some cases, direct glacial activity that produced the variable seafloor types and deflections of currents that result in highly productive fisheries.",
              "Extensive groundwater supplies lie within Quaternary sediments.",
              "Occasionally, high-value minerals are found in Quaternary sediments.",

              "In most of Europe, the genetic diversity pattern was typical for species that experienced marked glaciation cycles.",
              "Except in refugia, European populations were characterized by the occurrence of one main haplotype and by a strong reduction in genetic diversity, which is expected in regions that were rapidly re-colonized when climatic conditions improved.",
              "In contrast, all other sub-clades around the Mediterranean Basin occurred in limited parts of the range and were strongly structured in space, as is expected in regions in which the impact of glaciations was limited.",
              "In such places, genetic diversity was retained in most populations, and almost all haplotypes were endemic.",
              "This pattern was extreme on remote Mediterranean islands (Crete, Cyprus, Corsica) where highly differentiated, endemic haplotypes were found.",
              "Recent introductions were typified by the existence of closely-related haplotypes in geographically distant populations, which is difficult to detect in most of Europe because of a lack of overall genetic structure.",
              "In regions that were not prone to marked glaciations, recent moth introductions/expansions could be detected due to the existence of a strong spatial genetic structure.",
              "In contrast, in regions that experienced the most intense Quaternary climatic oscillations, the natural populations are not genetically structured, and contemporary patterns of population expansion remain undetected.",
              "Past climate changes have had dramatic impact on the geographic distribution, demography, and thus the evolution of species.",
              "The contemporary distribution of genetic diversity cannot be understood without studying how organisms responded to climate over geological times.",
              "Many terrestrial species are today responding to the contemporary global warming [1], and their future response will at least partially depend on their previous reactions to climatic oscillations.",

              "e. the genetic footprint of species' responses to glacial-interglacial successions, has been extensively studied on many species in Europe and North-America, that is, in the geographical regions where glaciations were most intense [3, 4].",
              "Forest insect herbivores, such as those associated with oaks and pines in Europe and the Mediterranean, for example, are known to have responded to post-glacial warming with rapid range expansion northwards and eventually westwards, and to have survived glaciations in southern refugia [5\u201310].",
              "The intensity of the oscillations increased with latitude, which affected the impact they had on species occurring through a gradient in the so-called ORD (Orbitally forced species Range Dynamics: see [11]).",
              "Following Pinho and collaborators [12], we can make two predictions.",
              "In northern latitudes, where the effects of glaciations were more severe, fewer and smaller patches of suitable habitat were left for the survival of populations across multiple glaciation cycles, which would have resulted in overall lower diversity, and a lower number of differentiated lineages in northern than in southern areas.",
              "Moreover, the effects of climatic changes on the effective population sizes were more dramatic in northern than in southern regions, meaning that northern populations should bear the signature of a rapid demographic expansion following the climate amelioration, whereas southern populations should evidence marks of more stable, long-term effective population sizes.",

              "Ecological factors involved in differentiation include reproductive phenology, which can prevent mating by shifting adult emergence periods in different populations, or local adaptation to host characteristics, which, it has been proved, can lead to complete mortality in translocated larvae [30].",

              "Like many insects, the processionary moth has evolved the capacity of prolonged diapause, which allows the emergence of adults of the same generation over several years, thus limiting the risk of local extinction and increasing the probability of retaining local genetic diversity.",

              "As similar results can be obtained from different processes (see for instance [36, 37]), we conducted a mismatch analysis that also indicated that European populations underwent bottleneck events due to the recurrent glaciation periods and then recurrently expanded after the retreat of the ice.",
              "Such results are classically found for temperate and cold-sensitive species in this region [4, 9, 10].",
              "The spatial distribution of the rare haplotypes gives insights into the existence and locality of refugial areas where the moths survived the glaciations, and possibly also the interglacials as this Mediterranean species is susceptible to both winter cold and summer heat and aridity [28].",
              "As for most of the European temperate species, these moth refugia are located in the Balkans and in Italy, as well as in the western part of the Iberian Peninsula [4].",

              "Interestingly, the Alpine Arc was recently proved to be a refugial area for Pinus sylvestris [38], which suggests that the refugial moth populations could have survived the glacial maxima in this region on that particular host.",
              "With the exception of Lebanon and Israel where the moth settled and expanded only recently (see below), our results show contrasting patterns of evolution during the Quaternary in the different regions of the moth's distribution range, corresponding to our expectations.",

              "Moreover, signs of recent expansion were detected only in the European sub-clade, that is, in the region where glacial cycles were probably most intense.",
              "As for most European species, endemic haplotypes and some genetic variability can still be detected in plausible refugial areas near the Pyrenees, in Italy and in the Balkans [4, 8, 13].",
              "In the rest of the area, the recurrent northward expansions that followed climate warming after glacial maxima were probably rapid, pioneer-like [39], and lead to a genetic homogenization of populations.",
              "In other temperate forest insect species, genetic diversity was also mostly retained either in the southernmost populations [9, 31], or in the eastern regions where the impact of the Quaternary cycles was less pronounced (as for Andricus gall wasps developing on oaks, see [5, 6, 32]).",
              "In each of the three main clades, the most divergent sub-clade corresponds to an island, or to an island-like continental region.",
              "The Corsican ht are the most differentiated within the pityocampa clade, the Cretan ht form the sister-group of all other sub-clades within the wilkinsoni clade, and the highly isolated moths of Cyrenaica (Libya) are most divergent in the ENA clade.",

              "However, even if we consider only the estimated age of the MRCA (which could be overestimated because we used a rate from phylogenetic studies, see [40], though the use of a Bayesian coalescent prior should in part address this problem), we can suggest that the pine processionary moths survived locally on these remote islands without female exchanges from the continent during few glacial cycles.",
              "As a consequence, they had to evolve locally to cope with at least some Quaternary oscillations and environmental changes [13].",
              "The quite recent estimate for the age of MRCA for each island could be due to a founder effect followed by the effect of genetic drift in small populations [5], as well as by fixation of selected variation.",
              "We have evidence, in the pine processionary moth, that male gene flow have occurred between Cyprus and the continent [16], as was suggested by the strong genetic similarity between Cypriot and Turkish populations found with both AFLPs and microsatellite markers.",
              "This could also be true for islands situated at moderate distance from the continent.",
              "In recent years, the distribution range of the processionary moth has been affected by global changes, mainly through winter warming [18] and pine afforestation.",
              "Moreover, it is suspected that human-aided dispersal occurs over various distances, either via 'hitch-hiking' (passive transportation of individuals) or accidental transplantation of pupae with grown trees moved with a substantial amount of soil.",

              "These sites actually correspond to zones of recent moth expansion either following anthropogenic pine expansion, such as in Israel or Algeria where pines were planted both in the beginning and at the end of the XXth century, or following the ongoing climate warming that allows insects to survive winter in places where they could not some decades ago (site 53 near the Black Sea).",
              "Given the natural spatial genetic structure in these regions, the recent modifications in moth distributions due to global changes are actually easy to track.",
              "The populations discussed above all likely originated from the closest natural stand, and could be the result of non-assisted moth expansion (but a better sampling in Algeria is needed to confirm this).",
              "The mitochondrial marker we used here would also be useful to identify between-subclades female gene flow, but a nuclear marker is necessary to track male exchanges.",
              "In most of Europe, however, where the populations are not genetically structured in space and where overall genetic diversity is low, probably as a consequence of Quaternary history, one cannot distinguish recent and historical events, as contemporary expansions (proved at both higher latitudes and altitudes, see [18]) result in the loss of genetic diversity, as in the case of rapid, leptokurtic dispersal northwards that allowed re-colonization of northern habitats during interglacials [10, 19].",
