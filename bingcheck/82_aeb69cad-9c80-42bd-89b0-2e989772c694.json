              "In 1870s Bia\u0142ystok, just a few years before Zamenhof created Esperanto, Polish was banned in public places \u2014 a new and free language served as a response to the linguistic and cultural damage done.",

              "Its creator, Johann Martin Schleyer, and other learners of the language had different ideas about what direction it should take, and there were schisms about who had proprietary ownership of the language.",
              "The language eventually faded into obscurity because of infighting and the creation of Esperanto, which was considered an easier and more utilitarian auxlang.",
              "Also, Zamenhof was always very clear about not owning the language, and allowing new thinkers to help its growth.",
              "Because of its unique ability to bridge gaps between people from all philosophies and national backgrounds, Esperanto fills a niche even within the niche of constructed languages.",
              "Esperanto is heavily based on the Indo-European languages of Europe, the primary elements being Romance languages for vocabulary, Slavic languages for the sound systems and semantics, and minor contributions from Greek to both.",
              "Pragmatics of the language, in terms of how the language was used socially and how idioms were constructed, were largely tied into the native languages of Zamenhof and other early Esperanto users: Russian, Polish, German, and French.",
              "The grammar and vocabulary were both constructed with uniformly standardized rules, with different endings reflecting distinct grammatical categories, and the language is gendered in a way comparable to Italian, which was a language Zamenhof admired and was fascinated by \u2014 Mussolini notably allowed Esperanto under his regime because it sounded Italian, and some tourist publications were subsequently released in Esperanto.",

              "The fact that words are built from easy to learn, highly regular constructions and endings makes Esperanto a much less practically difficult language to learn than, for example, English, Spanish, or Mandarin, where there are myriad exceptions to rules, lexical items, and pronunciations that have emerged naturally over time.",
              "Esperanto skipped the problem of irregulars by making everything fit tidily into Zamenhof\u2019s parameters.",
              "Following the publication of Zamenhof\u2019s book in 1905, French Esperantists who liked the language and Zamenhof\u2019s ideas of international communication during difficult times in Europe helped to found the first ever World Esperanto Congress, which took place in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, in 1905.",
              "After that the language began picking up steam throughout the world, and with the exception of WWI, WWII, and COVID-19, the Congress has been repeated annually and in-person all over the globe as a way to discuss the future of the language and introduce Esperantists to one another \u2014 this year\u2019s conference was performed online, continuing the tradition digitally.",
              "There were two ideas inherent to the Esperantist movement following this first World Esperanto Congress: 1) Zamenhof\u2019s grammar book, Fundamento de Esperanto, would be the only grammatical governance over the language, and 2) Esperanto would always be a solely linguistic movement, with no other meaning ascribed to it.",
              "This latter concept became difficult to maintain when Esperanto speakers were persecuted in regimes such as Nazi Germany, Francoist Spain, and Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union, but the language persisted and publications with regional focuses continued to be produced.",
              "At this point, Esperanto became more than just a linguistic movement, and started to represent a political entity in and of itself.",
              "Esperanto was meant to be easy to learn, easy to use with people of any nationality, and was designed with the philosophy of overcoming differences between cultures, so it makes sense that it was often used for political activism or communication when a language that held power was undesirable or negatively politicized.",
              "Critics of Esperanto often note the Euro-centric nature of the language, and have expressed fear that a universal second language, as proposed by Zamenhof, might serve to reduce linguistic diversity rather than promote it, but regardless of these criticisms, the language has become widely distributed and spoken over its timeline.",
              "Esperanto has not become an official language in any country, staying true to its nationless origin philosophy, but it has been implemented partially in the educational systems of Hungary, Germany, Poland, and China, where it is sometimes taught as a foreign language just like any other language.",
              "The largest Esperanto organization, the Universal Esperanto Association, has official ties to UNESCO and the United Nations, and Esperanto is recognized as a medium for international communication by both.",
              "The acceptance of Esperanto has transcended these political relationships and frequently extends to the religious world, with many faith groups using Esperanto for global communication as well- Catholic popes have used Esperanto in blessings, Quakers have an Esperanto society, Shiite religious leaders have praised the languages potential for international communication, and Baha\u0301-i\u0301 faith practitioners can join the Baha\u0301-i\u0301 Esperanto-League.",
              "Holy books such as the Bible, the Qur\u2019an, and even parts of the Book of Mormon have been translated into Esperanto.",
              "As both political and spiritual movements affiliate themselves with Esperanto, the auxlang\u2019s influence and recognition worldwide continue to grow.",
              "Because the language can be learned at home through free online resources, estimates of speaker counts vary, but anywhere from tens of thousands to two million people have some usage of the language, and in recent years a new phenomenon has come to light: native Esperanto speakers.",
              "There were examples of native Esperanto speakers early in the language\u2019s history, but in the late 90s, it was found that there were hundreds of families worldwide with first language (L1) Esperanto users, and they were studied more extensively than ever before \u2014 this changed the landscape of Esperanto, insomuch as it drew attention to the fact that Esperanto could truly be a language that people speak, use, and communicate with just like any native natural language.",
              "The study of native language is necessarily different from the study of language as a whole.",
              "Native languages \u2014 and what these mother tongues are \u2014 affect people\u2019s ability to participate in their broader linguistic communities.",
              "Learning in a non-native language is an inherent disadvantage, and students often have to learn a new language while also taking regular classes.",
              "This changes whether or not they perform well in school and how they communicate with the people around them.",
              "It has been clearly shown that mother tongue education leads to greater success for students regarding academics, staying in school for longer periods of time, and test scores;",
              "students simply perform better when they learn in the language that they speak at home.",
              "Because so few people speak Esperanto at home, it\u2019s important to look at unique cases of native Esperanto speakers and think about how language education could be changed with an auxlang serving as a first language (or an immediate second language) \u2014 considering the implications of a hypothetical universal language is a worthy endeavor, simply because of how drastically it could change the global community in terms of how we think about language education and second language acquisition.",
              "To get a better understanding of Esperanto, the community that emerged around it, and the political nuances of a linguistic community I was previously unfamiliar with, I decided to sit down with a native speaker of the language who also happened to be an Esperanto community organizer, Stela Besenyei-Merger (she/her, s\u0302i/ri in Esperanto).",
              "Stela learned Esperanto as a first language when she was growing up, along with her other mother-tongue of Hungarian.",

              "She is an organizer for the Universal Esperanto Association\u2019s youth wing congress, the International Youth Congress, as well as other sporadic Esperantist community events, and therefore very involved with the Esperantist movement.",
              "The interview was generally fascinating, but certain parts of our conversation really illuminated what it means to be an auxlang user in an active language community \u2014 those excerpts have been pulled and discussed below.",
              "Esperanto and its speakers are, without doubt, part of a unique cultural community.",
              "The language has far exceeded simple translations or recreations of other languages\u2019 texts;",
              "people now write original books, songs, blogs, news articles, and plan entire events that are conducted in Esperanto \u2014 this latter organizational function is part of Stela\u2019s job.",

              "In 2016, while Esperantists in Paris discussed technology, surveillance and freedom, a question emerged, turning the political debate into a linguistic discussion: how to say drone in Esperanto?",
              "Relatedly, in a constructed language, how can speakers refer to things they have no words for?",

              "Tax calculation will be finalised at checkout Purchases are for personal use only This issue gained visibility in recent years with languages constructed for artistic purposes, such as Marc Okrand's Klingon (Star Trek) and Paul Frommer's Na'vi (Avatar), whose speakers recognise the language creators as ultimate authorities and the only people authorised to coin new words in these languages (Schreyer 2015, and personal communication).",
              "Over its history, similarly to what happened to Volapu\u0308k, Esperanto emerged as a fertile ground for language reformers (Garvi\u0301a 2015).",

              "This advice comes from Claude Piron (1989), to whom Esperanto\u2019s internationality depended on the language being understood by Esperanto speakers from culturally and geographically distant places, such as China and Japan.",
              "Along surprisingly similar lines, also Max Weber (1949: 58\u201359) prompted social scientists to write for a \u2018Chinese reader\u2019\u2014meaning someone less prone to share the commonsense assumptions of Western scholars.",

              "Accordingly, he restricted his initial proposal to a minimalist grammar, a vocabulary of some 900 words, some samples of poetry and prose, and a persuasive introductory essay.",
              "On this slender basis, through the cooperation of its users, Esperanto developed into a full-fledged language with its own worldwide speech community and full linguistic resources.",
              "In many of the linguistic ideas behind his language, Zamenhof anticipated the founder of modern linguistics, the structuralist Ferdinand de Saussure (whose brother Rene\u0301 de Saussure was a pioneer and active user of Esperanto).",

              "A country\u2019s language is its main source of communication, a means by which it establishes contact and correspondence with its people and those residing outside it.",
              "Natural languages have evolved through the ages and spread around owing to immigrants, trade, and business that took place between nations.",
              "But some languages are artificially constructed which emerge as a result of computer simulations or as part of a psychological practice or experiment.",
              "Esperanto is one such artificial language, dating back to the 18th century.",
              "Like all other languages in the world, Esperanto has its own culture and literature.",
              "However, unlike the other languages, it does not have a country of origin, nor its own people who speak it natively.",
              "Instead, it is a universal language that goes beyond the confines of a single nation\u2014more than 2 million people across 120 countries have learned it.",
              "But how exactly did Esperanto evolve?",
              "How many speakers does it have in recent times?",
              "Here is all that you need to know about Esperanto.",
              "The Esperanto language was invented by a Polish ophthalmologist Ludwik Leyzer Zamenhof (b.",
              "1859), who grew up in eastern Poland.",
              "Speaking Yiddish and Russian at home, Zamenhof observed that the world that he lived in was divided by language, facing turbulence and disturbance because of it.",
              "In an attempt to bring about world peace and unite the people under one language umbrella, Zamenhof invented the Esperanto language, which he called Lingvo Internacia or \u201cinternational language\u201d.",
              "Zamenhof had his own reasons to invent this artificial language.",
              "He believed that the languages already spoken by the people were highly influenced by politics, history, and power, making it difficult to communicate properly.",
              "Esperanto was invented as a politics-free language and a medium to deviate from all the barriers and difficulties that the natural languages faced\u2014a technology that would make its speakers\u2019 lives simpler.",
              "Zamenhof wanted to get rid of the linguistic discrimination present in the society by inventing a much simpler and easier language, one that would unite the people and make them feel unified as a single unit.",
              "The 19th century was marked by evolutions in the field of artificial languages, and before Esperanto was invented, Volapuk was the language being spoken by a huge majority.",
              "By the end of the 1880s, though, Volapuk had lost steam\u2014this was when Esperanto took over.",
              "Zamenhof was of the view that a language should be free from any political influence and jargon as that hindered communication and understanding.",
              "Consequently, he made Esperanto as simple as possible, with roots taken from the ancient Romance language.",
              "The language that he created was easy, genderless, and almost no case grammar.",
              "He published the under the pen name \u201cDoktoro Esperanto\u201d, meaning \u201csomeone who hopes\u201d.",
              "This name was especially chosen because it was hoped that Esperanto would one day rule the world as a second language of people, with clear, neutral, and politically-free dialogue that would unite them all.",
              "Although the progress of Esperanto was slow in the early days, Zamenhof\u2019s attempt to spread it by publishing a magazine in Esperanto soon led to its popularity across continents.",
              "A convention was organized where people gathered to discuss the new language.",
              "As the language began to gather more attention, it began to be adopted and dropped by a number of countries globally.",
              "The League of Nations adopted it but it was opposed by the French delegate, and had to be dropped.",
              "As Zamenhof was Jewish, Hitler opposed the language, terming it as the language of the Jewish conspiracy.",
              "Joseph Stalin adopted the language, but reportedly turned against it, calling it a language of spies.",
              "On the other hand, the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong embraced the language, helping to grow its popularity in China.",
              "The first book in Esperanto was published on 14 July, 1887 in Warsaw.",
              "Written by Zamenhof himself, the book contained 16 grammatical rules of the language as well as the root words taken from existing Romance, Slavic, and Germanic languages.",
              "The idea here was to make the language as simple as possible so that it could be easily learned by maximum people.",
              "The idea of its simplicity can be elaborated through an example.",
              "In Esperanto, bela means \u201cbeautiful\u201d, while granda means \u201cbig\u201d and tablo means \u201ctable\u201d.",
              "Combined together, this makes a \u201cbeautiful, big table\u201d.",
              "Similarly, in their plural form, the same words are called belaj, grandaj, and tabloj, meaning \u201cbeautiful, big tables\u201d.",
              "This is how simple the language really is.",
              "The language spread massively in the late 19th and early 20th century\u2014so much that Leo Tolstoy, the revolutionary Russian writer, learned the language in merely 3-4 hours.",
              "Consequently, the language spread far and wide to other countries and continents, and began to be considered a revolutionary instrument endorsed by the Socialists after World War 1.",
              "Although the Esperanto language failed to meet up with the expectations of its creator, who hoped that it would one day be the 2nd most widely spoken language, it still is the most popular constructed language in history.",
              "The language survived mostly through clubs and spread by chance encounters as well as through word of mouth.",
              "Today, nobody knows exactly how many people speak Esperanto fluently, but estimates point out that around 100,000 people can speak the language to some degree, while only 10,000 or so can speak it fluently.",
              "The language also has a huge literature to its name, with over 25,000 books written in it, including original as well as translated works\u2014among them translations of the Bible and Holy Quran.",
              "Learning a new language is always a tough task, one that is seldom taken by people except travelers and enthusiasts.",
              "However, once in every generation, a new artificially-constructed language is invented that deviates from the natural languages and is taken up by a large number of people.",
              "Esperanto is one such language that has survived turbulence, disturbance, and test of time to become the most popular artificial language on the globe.",
              "However, with the invention of more artificial languages, it is hoped that Esperanto will continue to be the most popular artificial language and would continue to make its speakers\u2019 lives simpler, neutral, and unbiased\u2014something that Zamenhof had predicted and wished.",
