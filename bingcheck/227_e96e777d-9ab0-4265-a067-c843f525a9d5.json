              "Ever since the rugby team known as the New Zealand Natives performed one on their tour of Australia and the United Kingdom in 1888-89, the haka \u2013 most notably Ka Mate \u2013 has become synonymous with the All Blacks.",
              "Originally only performed overseas, from 1986 it then became something done before every match.",
