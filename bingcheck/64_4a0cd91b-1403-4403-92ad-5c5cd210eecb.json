    "query": "What was the most challenging obstacle that Marie Curie had to overcome during her scientific career, and how did she manage to overcome it?",
    "response": "Marie Curie was a remarkable scientist who faced many challenges during her scientific career. Some of the challenges she had to overcome were:\n\n- Lack of access to higher education for women in Poland[^2^]. She had to work as a governess and a teacher to support herself and her sister's studies in Paris, where she eventually moved to pursue her own education at the Sorbonne[^2^].\n- Poverty and hardship in Paris. She lived in a small garret and barely had enough money for food and rent. She often worked late at night and suffered from cold and hunger[^2^].\n- Discrimination and prejudice from the male-dominated scientific community. She was often ignored or dismissed by her colleagues and faced opposition from the French Academy of Sciences when she was nominated for membership[^4^]. She was also denied the opportunity to give a speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony in 1903, while her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel were allowed to do so[^3^].\n- Personal tragedies and scandals. She lost her husband Pierre in a road accident in 1906, leaving her with two young daughters to raise alone. She also faced public criticism and hostility for having an affair with a married physicist, Paul Langevin, in 1911[^2^].\n- Exposure to radiation and its harmful effects. She worked with radioactive materials for many years without proper protection or awareness of the risks. She suffered from various health problems, such as anemia, cataracts, and leukemia, which eventually led to her death in 1934[^2^].\n\nDespite these challenges, Marie Curie managed to overcome them with her intelligence, perseverance, passion, and courage. Some of the ways she did so were:\n\n- She excelled in her studies and earned two degrees from the Sorbonne, one in physics and one in mathematics. She was the first woman to do so[^2^].\n- She collaborated with her husband Pierre Curie and discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, and coined the term radioactivity. She also developed methods for isolating and measuring radioactive substances[^2^].\n- She won two Nobel Prizes, one in physics (1903) and one in chemistry (1911). She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the only person to win two Nobel Prizes in different fields[^2^].\n- She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw, which are still leading centers for research and treatment of cancer. She also organized mobile radiological units during World War I to help wounded soldiers[^2^].\n- She inspired generations of women scientists and became a symbol of scientific excellence and humanism. She also supported various causes, such as women's education, international cooperation, and peace[^2^].\n\nMarie Curie was a remarkable scientist who faced many challenges during her scientific career, but she managed to overcome them with her intelligence, perseverance, passion, and courage.

              "Following Henri Becquerel\u2019s discovery (1896) of a new phenomenon (which she later called \u201cradioactivity\u201d), Marie Curie, looking for a subject for a thesis, decided to find out if the property discovered in uranium was to be found in other matter.",

              "Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose activity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity.",

              "With her husband, Pierre, the Polish-born Frenchwoman pioneered the study of radioactivity until her death in 1934.",
              "Today, she is recognized throughout the world not only for her groundbreaking Nobel Prize-winning discoveries but also for having boldly broken many gender barriers during her lifetime.",
              "Curie became the first woman to receive a Ph.",
              "D.",
              "from a French university, as well as the first woman to be employed as a professor at the University of Paris.",
              "Not only was she the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, but also the first person (man or woman) ever to win the award twice and for achievements in two distinct scientific fields.",
              "While Curie\u2019s major accomplishments may be well known, here are several surprising facts about her personal and professional life that may not be.",
              "It may come as a surprise to know that Curie and Pierre conducted the bulk of the research and experimentation which led to the discovery of the elements Radium and Polonium in what was described by the respected German chemist, Wilhelm Ostwald, as \u201ca cross between a stable and a potato shed.",
              "\u201d In fact, when he was first shown the premises, he assumed that it was \u201ca practical joke.",
              "\u201d Even after the couple had won the Nobel Prize for their discoveries, Pierre died never having set foot in the new laboratory that the University of Paris had promised to build them.",
              "Nonetheless, Curie would fondly recall their time together in the leaky, drafty shack despite the fact that, in order to extract and isolate the radioactive elements, she often spent entire days stirring boiling cauldrons of uranium-rich pitchblende until \u201cbroken with fatigue\u201d.",
              "By the time she and Pierre eventually submitted their discoveries for professional consideration, Curie had personally gone through multiple tons of uranium-rich slag in this manner.",
              "In 1903, members of the French Academy of Sciences wrote a letter to the Swedish Academy in which they nominated the collective discoveries in the field of radioactivity made by Marie and Pierre Curie, as well as their contemporary Henri Becquerel, for the Nobel Prize in Physics.",
              "Yet, in a sign of the times and its prevailing sexist attitudes, no recognition of Curie's contributions was offered, nor was there even any mention of her name.",
              "Thankfully, a sympathetic member of the nominating committee, a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University College named Go\u0308sta Mittage-Leffler, wrote a letter to Pierre warning him of the glaring omission.",
              "Pierre, in turn, wrote the committee insisting that he and Curie be \u201cconsidered together .",

              ".",
              "with respect to our research on radioactive bodies.",
              "\u201d Eventually, the wording of the official nomination was amended.",
              "Later that year, thanks to a combination of her accomplishments and the combined efforts of her husband and Mittage-Leffler, Curie became the first woman in history to receive the Nobel Prize.",
              "After discovering Radium in 1898, Curie and Pierre balked at the opportunity to pursue a patent for it and to profit from its production, despite the fact that they had barely enough money to procure the uranium slag they needed in order to extract the element.",
              "On the contrary, the Curies generously shared the isolated product of Marie's difficult labors with fellow researchers and openly distributed the secrets of the process needed for its production with interested industrial parties.",
              "During the \u2018Radium Boom\u2019 that followed, factories sprang up in the United States dedicated to supplying the element not only to the scientific community but also to the curious and gullible public.",
              "Though not yet fully understood, the glowing green material captivated consumers and found its way into everything from toothpaste to sexual enhancement products.",
              "By the 1920s, the price of a single gram of the element reached $100,000 and Curie could not afford to buy enough of the very thing she, herself, had discovered in order to continue her research.",
              "Nonetheless, she had no regrets.",
              "\u201cRadium is an element, it belongs to the people,\u201d she told American journalist Missy Maloney during a trip to the United States in 1921.",
              "\u201cRadium was not to enrich anyone.",
              "\u201d Albert Einstein and Curie first met in Brussels at the prestigious Solvay Conference in 1911.",
              "This invite-only event brought together the world\u2019s leading scientists in the field of physics, and Curie was the only woman out of its 24 members.",
              "Einstein was so impressed by Curie, that he came to her defense later that year when she became embroiled in controversy and the media frenzy that surrounded it.",
              "By this time, France had reached the peak of its rising sexism, xenophobia, and anti-semitism that defined the years preceding the First World War.",
              "Curie\u2019s nomination to the French Academy of Sciences was rejected, and many suspected that biases against her gender and immigrant roots were to blame.",
              "Furthermore, it came to light that she had been involved in a romantic relationship with her married colleague, Paul Langevin, though he was estranged from his wife at the time.",
              "Curie was labeled a traitor and a homewrecker and was accused of riding the coattails of her deceased husband (Pierre had died in 1906 from a road accident) rather than having accomplished anything based on her own merits.",
              "Though she had just been awarded a second Nobel Prize, the nominating committee now sought to discourage Curie from traveling to Stockholm to accept it so as to avoid a scandal.",
              "With her personal and professional life in disarray, she sank into a deep depression and retreated (as best she could) from the public eye.",
              "Around this time, Curie received a letter from Einstein in which he described his admiration for her, as well as offered his heart-felt advice on how to handle the events as they unfolded.",

              "Over the course of the next four years, Curie helped equip and operate more than twenty ambulances (known as \u201cLittle Curies\u201d) and hundreds of field hospitals with primitive x-ray machines so as to assist surgeons with the location and removal of shrapnel and bullets from the bodies of wounded soldiers.",
              "Not only did she personally instruct and supervise young women in the operation of the equipment, but she even drove and operated one such ambulance herself, despite the danger of venturing too close to the fighting on the front lines.",

              "Yet, from the very first years during which the scientists and their contemporaries were pioneering the study of radioactivity until the mid-1940s, little was concretely understood about both short and long-term health effects.",
              "Pierre liked to keep a sample in his pocket so he could demonstrate its glowing and heating properties to the curious, and even once strapped a vial of the stuff to his bare arm for ten hours in order to study the curious way it painlessly burned his skin.",
              "Curie, in turn, kept a sample at home next to her bed as a nightlight.",
              "Diligent researchers, the Curies spent nearly every day in the confines of their improvised laboratory, with various radioactive materials strewn about their workspaces.",

              "When her mother-in-law died weeks after Ire\u0300ne\u2019s birth, her father-in-law, Eugene, a retired physician, stepped in, becoming the hands-on parent that others expected Marie to be.",
              "By the time her second daughter, Eve, was born in 1904, Marie had grown accustomed to the disdain of colleagues who thought she spent too much time in the lab and not enough in the nursery.",

              "In labs across Europe, scientists were studying new and surprising phenomena.",
              "In 1895 Wilhelm Ro\u0308ntgen had discovered X-rays, and the mathematician Henri Poincare\u0301 sought to understand the luminescent rays that could pass through a hand and impress a ghostly image on photographic paper.",
              "Henri Becquerel was noting the emission of a different kind of mysterious rays, those from uranium salts.",

              "Thomson discovered negatively charged particles, which we now know as electrons (and which we now know are the source of X-rays).",
              "Curie built on Becquerel\u2019s observations of the element uranium.",
              "At first, she and other scientists were baffled about the source of the high-energy emissions.",
              "\u201cThe uranium shows no appreciable change of state, no visible chemical transformation, it remains, in appearance at least, the same as ever, the source of the energy it discharges remains undetectable,\u201d she wrote in 1900.",
              "She wondered whether the emitted rays were violating a basic law of thermodynamics: the conservation of energy.",
              "Finally, she posited a daring hypothesis: The rays emitted might be a basic property of uranium atoms, which we now know to be subatomic particles released as the atoms decay.",
              "Her theory had radical implications.",
              "Trish Baisden, a senior chemist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, describes it as a shocking proposal: \u201cIt was truly amazing and a bold statement at the time because the atom was thought to be the most elementary particle, one that could not be divided.",
              "It further meant that atoms are not necessarily stable.",
              "\u201d Curie\u2019s hypothesis would revise the scientific understanding of matter at its most elemental level.",
              "Curie set out to measure the intensity of uranium\u2019s rays by adapting the electrometer Pierre had invented with his brother.",
              "The device allowed her to measure extremely low electrical currents in air near mineral samples that contained uranium.",
              "She soon repeated the experiment with thorium, which behaved in similar ways.",
              "But she was puzzled by data that showed that the intensity of the radiation emitted by uranium and thorium was greater than expected based on the amounts of the elements she knew to be in her samples.",
              "\u201cThere must be, I thought, some unknown substance, very active, in these minerals,\u201d she concluded.",
              "\u201cMy husband agreed with me and I urged that we search at once for this hypothetical substance, thinking that, with joined efforts, a result would be quickly obtained.",
              "\u201d In 1898 she indeed identified one of the substances and named it polonium, after her homeland.",
              "Five months later, she identified a second element, which the world came to know as radium.",

              "The extraction required tons of the substance, which she dissolved in cauldrons of acid before obtaining barium sulphate and other alkalines, which she then purified and converted into chlorides.",
              "The separation of radium from the alkalines required thousands of tedious crystallizations.",
              "But as she wrote to her brother in 1894, \u201cone never notices what has been done;",

              "Working in a dilapidated shed with broken windows and poor ventilation, she nonetheless was able to make sensitive measurements.",

              "Both, too, were resistant to the suggestion that their research materials caused their ailments.",
              "In 1903, Curie became the first woman in France to earn a PhD in physics.",
              "Professors who reviewed her doctoral thesis, which was about radiation, declared that it was the greatest single contribution to science ever written.",
              "Rumors of a Nobel Prize began to circulate, but some members of the French Academy of Sciences attributed the brilliance of the work not to Marie, but to her co-workers.",
              "These skeptics began to lobby quietly for the prize to be split between Becquerel and Pierre.",
              "But Pierre insisted to influential people on the Nobel committee that Marie had originated their research, conceived experiments and generated theories about the nature of radioactivity.",

              "It was the first Nobel to be awarded to a woman.",
              "At the awards ceremony, the president of the Swedish Academy, which administered the prize, quoted the Bible in his remarks about the Curies\u2019 research: \u201cIt is not good that man should be alone, I will make a helpmeet for him.",
              "\u201d Whether Marie Curie took the remark as an insult is not known\u2014it surely rankles today\u2014but it must be among the most grudging comments ever said to a laureate.",
              "Moreover, the notion that Marie was a mere helpmeet to Pierre\u2014one of the more persistent myths about her\u2014was an opinion widely held, judging from published and unpublished comments by other scientists and observers.",
              "\u201cErrors are notoriously hard to kill,\u201d observed her friend, the British physicist Hertha Ayrton, \u201cbut an error that ascribes to a man what was actually the work of a woman has more lives than a cat.",

              "Marie was not promoted.",
              "Pierre hired more assistants and made Marie the official head of the laboratory, freeing her to conduct experiments and for the first time, be paid for it.",
              "The most successful collaboration between a husband and wife in the history of science ended suddenly on April 19, 1906, when Pierre, apparently lost in thought, walked into traffic on the rue Dauphine and was killed instantly by an onrushing carriage.",
              "Instead of accepting a widow\u2019s pension, Marie took over Pierre\u2019s position at the Sorbonne, becoming the first woman to teach there.",
              "Hundreds of people\u2014students, artists, photographers, celebrities\u2014lined up outside the university on November 5, 1906, hoping to attend her first lecture.",

              "\u201d In 1911, rumors spread that Curie was having an affair with the prominent physicist Paul Langevin, a man five years her junior who had been Pierre\u2019s student and had worked closely with Albert Einstein.",

              "The front-page coverage of the scandal threatened to overshadow another news story later that year: her second Nobel Prize.",
              "This one, in chemistry, was for the discovery of polonium and radium.",
              "In her acceptance speech in Stockholm, she paid tribute to her husband but also made clear that her work was independent from his, spelling out their separate contributions and describing the discoveries she had made after his death.",
              "At the end of 1911, Curie became very ill.",
              "She had an operation to remove lesions from her uterus and kidney, followed by a long recovery.",
              "In 1913, she began to travel again and return to science.",
              "In March of that year, Einstein paid her an extended visit, and later she opened and headed a new research facility in Warsaw.",
              "As she was setting up a second institute, in Paris, World War I broke out.",
              "She outfitted 18 portable X-ray stations that could treat wounded soldiers on the front lines.",
              "She sometimes operated and repaired the machines herself, and established 200 more permanent X-ray posts during the war.",
              "Eve became a journalist and wrote the definitive biography, Madame Curie, published in 1937.",
              "Ire\u0300ne studied at her mother\u2019s institute in Paris and married her mother\u2019s assistant, the charismatic physicist Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Joliot, with whom she bore two children.",
              "Ire\u0300ne maintained a strong presence in the lab, and in 1935, Ire\u0300ne and Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Joliot-Curie were awarded a Nobel Prize for synthesizing new radioactive elements.",
              "It was another record: the first time both a parent and child had separately won the Nobel Prize.",
              "After Marie Curie\u2019s second Nobel Prize and her subsequent research, she was rarely dismissed as a helpmeet.",
              "And once the tabloids moved on from the Langevin scandal, her image as a homewrecker faded.",
              "But there were deliberate efforts to shape her story.",
              "A case in point was Curie\u2019s first trip to America, in 1921.",
              "The tour was largely the work of a New York City journalist named Missy Meloney, who had interviewed Curie in 1920 in Paris for the women\u2019s magazine the Delineator, which Meloney edited.",
              "Meloney learned that the Curies had never patented the process for purifying radium.",

              "Sensing a human-interest story, Meloney created the Marie Curie Radium Fund to raise money to purchase radium for Curie\u2019s continuing research.",
              "American women would be inspired to give to Curie, Meloney figured, only if her image as a scientist\u2014which stereotypically suggested someone dispassionate, even severe\u2014could be softened.",
              "So Meloney\u2019s articles presented Curie as a benevolent healer, intent on using radium to treat cancer.",
              "Meloney also persuaded editor friends at other newspapers and magazines to emphasize the same image.",
              "Curie understood that radium might be useful in the clinic, but she had no direct role in using it for medical treatments.",
              "Nevertheless, Curie\u2019s motivation for discovering radium, according to a headline in the Delineator, was \u201cThat Millions Shall Not Die.",
              "\u201d Writers described her as the \u201cJeanne D\u2019Arc of the laboratory,\u201d with a face of \u201csuffering and patience.",

              "And yet Meloney\u2019s efforts succeeded: She raised more than $100,000 on Curie\u2019s behalf within months, enough to buy a gram of radium for the Curie Institute in Paris.",
              "Meloney invited Curie to the United States.",
              "Curie, who disliked travel and attention, agreed to come to thank Meloney and those who had contributed to the cause.",
              "But, she wrote Meloney, \u201cyou know how careful I am to avoid all publicity referring to my name.",
              "And how I should be very grateful to arrange for my voyage with the minimum of publicity.",
              "\u201d Curie sailed with Ire\u0300ne, 23, and Eve, 16, and within hours of disembarking in New York embarked on a whirlwind tour that took her as far west as the Grand Canyon.",
              "As it wore on, Curie became exhausted and asked to cancel events, or at least not have to speak at them.",
              "She appeared aloof and sometimes refused to shake hands with admirers.",
              "She did not appear to be the kindly maternal figure that Meloney had made her out to be.",

              "Because her father, a teacher of mathematics and physics, lost his savings through bad investment, she had to take work as a teacher and, at the same time, took part clandestinely in the nationalist \u201cfree university,\u201d reading in Polish to women workers.",

              "Their marriage (July 25, 1895) marked the start of a partnership that was soon to achieve results of world significance, in particular the discovery of polonium (so called by Marie in honour of her native land) in the summer of 1898 and that of radium a few months later.",
              "Following Henri Becquerel\u2019s discovery (1896) of a new phenomenon (which she later called \u201cradioactivity\u201d), Marie Curie, looking for a subject for a thesis, decided to find out if the property discovered in uranium was to be found in other matter.",

              "Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose activity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity.",

              "Having placed aluminium foil upon a sensitive plate, he laid glass laminae on it with the phosphorescent materials that were under study, contending that if the photographic plate was a\u00a3 fected through the aluminium foil, this could only take place by means of rays which like those of Ro\u0308ntgen had the property of passing through metals.",
              "Carrying his research further, Becquerel found that the sensitive plate bore images from certain substances, in particular from all the salts of uranium.",
              "He thus demonstrated that these substances emit rays of a special nature, distinct from ordinary light.",
              "Tests continued and he established an even more extraordinary fact, namely that this radiation is not in direct relation to the phenomenon of phosphorescence, that phosphorescent materials as well as those which are not can give rise to this radiation, that previous lighting is never necessary for the phenomenon to occur, and lastly that the radiation in question continues with invariable force to all appearances without its origin being traced to any of the known sources of energy.",
              "This was how Becquerel made the discovery of spontaneous radioactivity and the rays that bear his name.",
              "This discovery revealed a new property of matter and a new source of energy, the latter of puzzling origin.",
              "It goes without saying that a discovery such as this was bound to excite the liveliest interest in the scientific world and give birth to a whole host of new investigations with the aim of making a thorough study of the nature of the Becquerel rays and determining their origin.",

              "and Mme.",
              "Curie undertook the most comprehensive and systematic research into this topic, examining the majority of simple substances and a large number of minerals to find if possible new substances with the remarkable properties of uranium.",
              "The first discovery in this field was made at approximately the same time by the German Schmidt and by Mme.",
              "Curie, both of whom found that thorium possesses radioactive properties to about the same degree as uranium.",
              "During research, scientists have made full use of the property of the Becquerel rays, to make conductors of electricity out of bodies that are not so in normal circumstances.",
              "As a result, if rays of this kind fall on an electroscope charged with electricity, it will discharge more or less quickly, according to the greater or lesser activity of these rays which make the air round the electroscope a conductor.",
              "The electroscope has thus to some extent played the same part in respect of radioactive materials as the spectroscope in the search for new elements.",
              "M.",
              "and Mme.",
              "Curie, having thus found with the aid of the electroscope that the radioactive properties of the mineral pitchblende were more marked than those of uranium, came to the conclusion that pitchblende must contain one or more new radioactive substances.",
              "By breaking up pitchblende into its chemical components and examining, again with the aid of the electroscope, the radioactivity of the products that were obtained, they at last managed by means of a series of solutions and precipitates to isolate the materials that were distinguished by radioactivity of extraordinary intensity.",
              "Some idea of the prodigious work these results entail may be formed from the fact that it takes 1,000 kg of raw material to produce a few decigrams of these active substances.",
              "Of these, polonium was discovered by M.",
              "and Mme.",
              "Curie, radium was also discovered by them in collaboration with Be\u0301mont, and actinium by Debierne.",
              "Of all these materials, at least radium has been shown to be a simple substance.",
              "Becquerel had already shown by the study of radiation in uranium some of the most important properties of these rays.",
              "It was however only by means of the highly radioactive substances we have just mentioned that it became possible to carry out more comprehensive research into the Becquerel rays and in certain respects to amend findings on them.",
              "Foremost among scientists who carried out this programme, we find both Becquerel and also M.",
              "and Mme.",
              "Curie.",
              "Becquerel radiation resembles light in several respects.",
              "Propagation is rectilinear.",
              "Like certain light wavelengths, it has a strong photochemical action, causes phosphorescence, etc.",
              "Yet it differs from light in certain essentials, for example by its property to pass through metals and many other opaque bodies, by the intensity with which it brings about the discharge of bodies charged with electricity, and lastly by the absence of phenomena of reflection, interference and refraction, characteristic of light.",
              "In this the Becquerel rays are exactly similar to Ro\u0308ntgen rays and cathode rays.",
              "It has been found all the same that Becquerel radiation is not homogeneous, but is composed of different kinds of rays, some of which like those of Ro\u0308ntgen are not deflected by magnetic or electric forces, while others are, like cathode rays or Goldstein rays.",
              "Like Ro\u0308ntgen rays, Becquerel rays have a very strong physiological effect;",
              "thus, for example, they attack the skin, affect the eye, etc.",
              "Lastly, certain of the radioactive substances have a special property which bears no direct relation to their beams. This is to make temporarily radioactive all the bodies in their neighbourhood, by producing a radioactive emanation which communicates the radioactive property to the surroundings.",
              "It is thus beyond doubt that Becquerel rays are in strict relation to Ro\u0308ntgen rays and cathode rays.",
              "The modern theory of electrons, which is used to explain this last form of radiation, has also been applied with the greatest success to explain the Becquerel rays.",
              "We could close our account of the discoveries of Becquerel and the Curies at this point, as what we have covered is the main result of research they undertook early in 1903 and which is consequently to be considered in deciding the award of the Nobel Prize for 1903.",
              "Surely the discoveries we have outlined are important enough to deserve such a prize.",
              "These discoveries have taught us that special forms of radiation that were only known hitherto by electric discharges through rarefied gas are natural phenomena of wide occurrence.",
              "We have gained knowledge of a property of matter quite new to us, the capability of emitting, spontaneously as it seems, these marvellous rays.",
              "We have gained new methods, infinitely superior in subtlety to any we had in this sphere, to examine under certain conditions the existence of matter in nature.",
              "Finally we have found a new source of energy, for which the full explanation is not yet forthcoming.",
              "It will evidently give rise to new research of the very highest value in physics and in chemistry.",
              "The discoveries of Becquerel and the Curies in their own right herald a new era in the history of the physical sciences.",
              "Now we can only touch on the magnificent experiments carried out in this domain last year by Curie who discovered in radium the great spontaneous development of heat, together with the findings of Rutherford and Ramsay on the release of helium by radium, discoveries that are bound to be of great importance for the physicist and for the chemist alike.",
              "The promise for the future stemming from Becquerel\u2019s discovery seems near full realization.",

              "The last decade\u2019s record of development in the physical sciences is outstanding for the discoveries, as unexpected as they are impressive, that have been made.",
              "The Royal Academy of Sciences has been accorded the task of beginning to carry out the noble intentions expressed by Alfred Nobel in his will dating from this fruitful period for the physical sciences.",
              "The great discovery, to which the Academy of Sciences resolved to award the Nobel Prize of 1903 for Physics, marks a stage in this brilliant expansion, while it is at the same time strictly linked to the discovery which won the very first Nobel Prize for Physics.",
              "Further to the discovery of Ro\u0308ntgen rays, the question was raised whether they could not also be produced in other conditions than those in which they had been first observed.",
              "During the course of experiments in this field, Professor Henri Becquerel achieved results that not only contained an answer to this question, but led to a new discovery of the first order.",
              "When electricity is discharged through a tube filled with highly rarefied gas, the phenomenon of radiation occurs in this tube.",
              "This has been called cathode radiation, which when it meets an object in its turn produces the rays discovered by Ro\u0308ntgen.",
              "It often happens that these cathode rays also give rise to phenomena of light, called fluorescence and phosphorescence, in objects they encounter.",
              "Now it is this circumstance which occasioned Becquerel\u2019s experiments.",
              "He asked himself if the bodies whence the phosphorescent rays emanate, after having been subjected for a longer or lesser time to the action of ordinary light, would not likewise emit Ro\u0308ntgen rays.",
              "To solve this problem, Becquerel made use of the well-known property of Ro\u0308ntgen rays to affect a photographic plate.",
              "Having placed aluminium foil upon a sensitive plate, he laid glass laminae on it with the phosphorescent materials that were under study, contending that if the photographic plate was a\u00a3 fected through the aluminium foil, this could only take place by means of rays which like those of Ro\u0308ntgen had the property of passing through metals.",
              "Carrying his research further, Becquerel found that the sensitive plate bore images from certain substances, in particular from all the salts of uranium.",
              "He thus demonstrated that these substances emit rays of a special nature, distinct from ordinary light.",
              "Tests continued and he established an even more extraordinary fact, namely that this radiation is not in direct relation to the phenomenon of phosphorescence, that phosphorescent materials as well as those which are not can give rise to this radiation, that previous lighting is never necessary for the phenomenon to occur, and lastly that the radiation in question continues with invariable force to all appearances without its origin being traced to any of the known sources of energy.",
              "This was how Becquerel made the discovery of spontaneous radioactivity and the rays that bear his name.",
              "This discovery revealed a new property of matter and a new source of energy, the latter of puzzling origin.",
              "It goes without saying that a discovery such as this was bound to excite the liveliest interest in the scientific world and give birth to a whole host of new investigations with the aim of making a thorough study of the nature of the Becquerel rays and determining their origin.",
              "It was at this point that M.",
              "and Mme.",
              "Curie undertook the most comprehensive and systematic research into this topic, examining the majority of simple substances and a large number of minerals to find if possible new substances with the remarkable properties of uranium.",
              "The first discovery in this field was made at approximately the same time by the German Schmidt and by Mme.",
              "Curie, both of whom found that thorium possesses radioactive properties to about the same degree as uranium.",
              "During research, scientists have made full use of the property of the Becquerel rays, to make conductors of electricity out of bodies that are not so in normal circumstances.",
              "As a result, if rays of this kind fall on an electroscope charged with electricity, it will discharge more or less quickly, according to the greater or lesser activity of these rays which make the air round the electroscope a conductor.",
              "The electroscope has thus to some extent played the same part in respect of radioactive materials as the spectroscope in the search for new elements.",
              "M.",
              "and Mme.",
              "Curie, having thus found with the aid of the electroscope that the radioactive properties of the mineral pitchblende were more marked than those of uranium, came to the conclusion that pitchblende must contain one or more new radioactive substances.",
              "By breaking up pitchblende into its chemical components and examining, again with the aid of the electroscope, the radioactivity of the products that were obtained, they at last managed by means of a series of solutions and precipitates to isolate the materials that were distinguished by radioactivity of extraordinary intensity.",
              "Some idea of the prodigious work these results entail may be formed from the fact that it takes 1,000 kg of raw material to produce a few decigrams of these active substances.",
              "Of these, polonium was discovered by M.",
              "and Mme.",
              "Curie, radium was also discovered by them in collaboration with Be\u0301mont, and actinium by Debierne.",
              "Of all these materials, at least radium has been shown to be a simple substance.",
              "Becquerel had already shown by the study of radiation in uranium some of the most important properties of these rays.",
              "It was however only by means of the highly radioactive substances we have just mentioned that it became possible to carry out more comprehensive research into the Becquerel rays and in certain respects to amend findings on them.",
              "Foremost among scientists who carried out this programme, we find both Becquerel and also M.",
              "and Mme.",
              "Curie.",
              "Becquerel radiation resembles light in several respects.",
              "Propagation is rectilinear.",
              "Like certain light wavelengths, it has a strong photochemical action, causes phosphorescence, etc.",
              "Yet it differs from light in certain essentials, for example by its property to pass through metals and many other opaque bodies, by the intensity with which it brings about the discharge of bodies charged with electricity, and lastly by the absence of phenomena of reflection, interference and refraction, characteristic of light.",
              "In this the Becquerel rays are exactly similar to Ro\u0308ntgen rays and cathode rays.",
              "It has been found all the same that Becquerel radiation is not homogeneous, but is composed of different kinds of rays, some of which like those of Ro\u0308ntgen are not deflected by magnetic or electric forces, while others are, like cathode rays or Goldstein rays.",
              "Like Ro\u0308ntgen rays, Becquerel rays have a very strong physiological effect;",
              "thus, for example, they attack the skin, affect the eye, etc.",
              "Lastly, certain of the radioactive substances have a special property which bears no direct relation to their beams. This is to make temporarily radioactive all the bodies in their neighbourhood, by producing a radioactive emanation which communicates the radioactive property to the surroundings.",
              "It is thus beyond doubt that Becquerel rays are in strict relation to Ro\u0308ntgen rays and cathode rays.",
              "The modern theory of electrons, which is used to explain this last form of radiation, has also been applied with the greatest success to explain the Becquerel rays.",
              "We could close our account of the discoveries of Becquerel and the Curies at this point, as what we have covered is the main result of research they undertook early in 1903 and which is consequently to be considered in deciding the award of the Nobel Prize for 1903.",
              "Surely the discoveries we have outlined are important enough to deserve such a prize.",
              "These discoveries have taught us that special forms of radiation that were only known hitherto by electric discharges through rarefied gas are natural phenomena of wide occurrence.",
              "We have gained knowledge of a property of matter quite new to us, the capability of emitting, spontaneously as it seems, these marvellous rays.",
              "We have gained new methods, infinitely superior in subtlety to any we had in this sphere, to examine under certain conditions the existence of matter in nature.",
              "Finally we have found a new source of energy, for which the full explanation is not yet forthcoming.",
              "It will evidently give rise to new research of the very highest value in physics and in chemistry.",
              "The discoveries of Becquerel and the Curies in their own right herald a new era in the history of the physical sciences.",
              "Now we can only touch on the magnificent experiments carried out in this domain last year by Curie who discovered in radium the great spontaneous development of heat, together with the findings of Rutherford and Ramsay on the release of helium by radium, discoveries that are bound to be of great importance for the physicist and for the chemist alike.",
              "The promise for the future stemming from Becquerel\u2019s discovery seems near full realization.",
              "The discoveries and research of Becquerel and of M.",
              "and Mme.",

              "the latter were of course co-workers.",
              "The Royal Academy of Sciences did not think it right to distinguish between these eminent scientists, when it came to awarding the discovery of spontaneous radioactivity a Nobel Prize.",
              "The Academy thus deemed it equitable to share the Nobel Physics Prize for 1903 by awarding one half to Professor Henri Becquerel for the discovery of spontaneous radioactivity, and the other half to Professor and Madame Curie for great merit, of which they have given proof in work on rays first discovered by Henri Becquerel.",

              "[1] One of seven children born to teachers, Marie showed an interest in mathematics and physics, which her father taught at a high school.",
              "[1] Universities in Poland did not allow women to attend, so in 1891, Marie moved to Paris to attend Sorbonne.",
              "By 1894, she had graduated at the top of her class with degrees in both mathematics and physics, taking after her father.",
              "[2] While in attendance, she met Pierre Curie, a professor at the university.",
              "On July 26, 1895, Marie married Pierre and remained in Paris to conduct research alongside him.",
              "[2] Early in her career, Marie took an interest in Becquerel rays.",
              "She did not have the funding for a lab, so she conducted her research in a storeroom.",
              "In the tight working quarters, she discovered that the chemical or physical state of the uranium did not matter.",
              "The more uranium in the compound, the more radiation it gave off.",
              "[1] She continued exploring other types of compounds that emitted Becquerel rays and found that thorium also produced rays similar to uranium.",
              "She decided to name the activity of the two compounds radioactivity.",
              "[1] After this discovery, she and Pierre turned their attention to a mineral called pitchblende (uranium oxide), which is about 70 percent uranium, but more active than uranium.",
              "[3] They assumed there was a radioactive substance inside pitchblende causing this.",
              "Through fractional crystallization, they were able to discover polonium and radium.",
              "[1] With the new knowledge of these two substances, Curie later realized that radium could be used as a gamma ray source on X-ray machines.",
              "This was extremely useful during World War I because it allowed for smaller, more accurate x-ray machines that could be used by medics.",
              "[3] In 1903, following her and Pierres research on Becquerel rays, they both received the Nobel Prize for Physics.",
              "Pierre died in a car accident in 1906, but Marie continued her research.",
              "She went on to receive the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911 for her work on radioactivity (see Fig.",
              "1).",
              "She was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and remains the only woman to receive a Nobel Prize in two different fields of research.",
              "[1] Throughout her work with radium, Marie was unaware of the effects of radioactivity exposure on the body.",
              "In her lab, she would keep tubes of radium in her pocket.",
              "[3] She began to suspect that radium negatively impacted health when one of her fellow researchers died of a blood disease, and then a few years later her personal assistant died of a blood disease.",
              "Even though she suspected that radium exposure was bad for her health, she did very little to monitor her own blood.",
              "In 1932, she broke her wrist and the break took much longer to heal than it should have.",
              "She then began to notice that her vision was deteriorating and radiation burns on her fingers were becoming more and more painful.",
              "Some days she felt too ill to even go to the lab, and finally on July 4, 1934, Marie died from aplastic anemia.",
              "[1] Marie suspected that her health was being negatively impacted by radium exposure, but did nothing about it, most likely because there weren't any effective treatments for radium poisoning yet.",
              "At the time, scientists knew that radium was metabolized like calcium.",
              "In an attempt to remove it from the system, they manipulated calcium intake.",
              "[4] This caused little to no improvements, so parathyroid hormone was added to the treatment.",
              "Again, there was some reduction of radium, but not a significant amount.",
              "It wasn't until after Marie's death that they realized once radium is in the bones, it is extremely difficult to extract.",
              "The lack of therapies for radium exposure may explain why Marie just ignored her symptoms, because she was fully aware of her fate.",

              "There was no surprise there, given the little known about radiation and its effects on our bodies when she did her early work.",
              "But it turns out that it\u2019s not only Marie and Pierre Curie who were contaminated - even her notebooks are stored in a lead box.",
              "So what\u2019s the deal with Marie Curie\u2019s laboratory notebooks?",
              "I recently read a question on an internet Q&A website asking how they can still be dangerous after a century and claiming that even touching the pages can put one at risk.",
              "But I\u2019ve got to admit to being dubious \u2013 my background in radiation safety tells me that it\u2019s not very easy to contaminate anything so much as to make it dangerous.",

              "But that\u2019s just my guess \u2013 luckily, there\u2019s some information on the matter, so we don\u2019t have to guess.",
              "The reason for the concern is that Marie and Pierre Curie processed tons of uranium-bearing minerals in their laboratory, discovering the naturally radioactive elements polonium and radium through an arduous process of grinding tons of rock and painstakingly extracting the radioactive components.",
              "They were doing this work only a few years after the discovery of radiation and radioactivity, and little was known of the potential harm they could cause.",
              "Even less was known about good radiological work practices \u2013 it\u2019s not surprising that the laboratory and notebooks became contaminated.",
              "Considering radium\u2019s 1600-year half-life and the sensitivity of today\u2019s radiation detectors, it\u2019s equally unsurprising that this contamination is still detectable today.",
              "Oh \u2013 and if you\u2019re interested, you can see Marie Curie\u2019s notebook yourself \u2013 it\u2019s in the Wellcome Collection (located in London), and anybody can download a scan as a PDF.",
              "Scholars can handle the notebook, although the Christian Science Monitor tells us that they first need to sign a release and use gloves because of the contamination.",
              "But before we make an appointment to see the notebooks, let\u2019s talk about the risks!",
              "Contamination In 2014 the Wellcome Trust commissioned an evaluation of contamination and radiation levels from Marie Curie\u2019s notebook \u2013 the highest levels of contamination found were about 2500 counts per second (cps) of alpha contamination and 3500 cps of beta contamination.",
              "Further analysis (and a little bit of calculation) showed that the notebook has about 1.",
              "6 microCuries of radium-226 on the covers and about twice this amount of activity through the entire notebook.",
              "According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a person can ingest up to 2 microCuries annually without exceeding a dose limit \u2013 this means that someone who decided to eat Marie Curie\u2019s laboratory notebook would exceed their annual dose limit by about 60% for that year.",
              "Is this a lot of radiation exposure?",
              "Well.",

              "it depends on how you look at it.",
              "It\u2019s more than I\u2019d want someone to receive in a year, if only because we try not to let anybody exceed a radiation dose limit.",
              "Having said that \u2013 do we expect that anybody is going to lick the front and back covers, or to eat, Marie Curie\u2019s notebook?",
              "It seems unlikely \u2013 but even if they did, there\u2019s not enough radioactivity to cause radiation sickness in the short term or create a significant risk of cancer in the long term.",
              "The bottom line is that this notebook doesn\u2019t pose an appreciable risk to anybody who wants to read it \u2013 even if they do decide to lick the cover and pages.",
              "In reality, the likely radiation exposure from handling the diary is even lower \u2013 at most, about 0.",
              "0003 microCuries might be removed by holding the notebook.",
              "Were this to be ingested (perhaps by licking one\u2019s fingers or transferring it to a sandwich), one might receive a dose equivalent to the same amount of exposure we receive from natural radiation in just two days.",
              "Radiation exposure Radium primarily emits alpha radiation, which can\u2019t even pass through a half-inch (about 1 cm) of air and cannot penetrate through the dead layer of skin cells of our epidermis to reach the living cells beneath.",
              "Radium also gives off a small amount of gamma radiation, but the low levels of radium measured in Curie\u2019s notebook give off equally low levels of gamma radiation.",
              "Someone turning the pages wouldn\u2019t receive enough radiation exposures to cause any health concerns.",
              "So, neither staff nor visiting scholars are at risk from reading or handling this document.",
              "Marie and Pierre Curie\u2019s remains Marie Curie\u2019s body (Pierre\u2019s as well) was somewhat radioactive at the time of her death due to the radium and other radioactivity she had inhaled and ingested during her many years of laboratory work.",
              "As a result, she and Pierre were buried in lead coffins to shield the radiation both were emitting at the time of their death.",
              "In 1995 France honored both Marie and Pierre by moving their bodies to the Pantheon, where they were to be laid to rest with Victor Hugo, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, and other great French intellectuals.",
              "At this time, the French radiation protection agency (l\u2019Office de Protection contres les Rayonnements Ionisants \u2013 OPRI) directed that radiation measurements be made during the exhumation to determine the risk, if any, to those involved in the process.",
              "Radiation dose rates in the cemetery were slightly elevated, but this was determined to be due to natural radioactivity in the granite headstone, monuments, and pavers.",

              "24 \u03bcSv/hr \u2013 about 24 \u03bcR/hr), which is hardly enough to pose a risk to anyone.",
              "Marie\u2019s emitted even less, most likely because of improved work safety practices as well as the elimination of radium from her body in her later years.",

              "However, the average human skeleton weighs about 10 kg;",
              "if we assume for the sake of argument that Pierre\u2019s skeleton contained about half the mass of his remains, then the total amount of radioactivity in Pierre\u2019s body would have been about 0.",
              "16 microCuries \u2013 this number is almost certainly wrong, but there\u2019s no way to tell if it\u2019s high or low.",
              "If we multiply by a factor of 10 for the high estimate and divide by the same amount for the low estimate, it seems safe to say that Pierre had somewhere between 0.",

              "6 microCuries of radioactivity at the time of his death.",
              "The high estimate is still lower than what US regulations permit a radiation worker to ingest annually and would give a radiation dose of about 40 rem to the surface of the bone or about four rem to the whole body.",
              "Given the relatively long half-life (about 1600 years) of radium, there has been virtually no radioactive decay between the time of the Curies\u2019 death and today \u2013 if there\u2019s very little radioactivity today, then there was very little at the time of their death.",
              "Given what was known at that time about their work, it likely made sense to bury both Marie and Pierre in lead-lined coffins \u2013 given the more recent measurements (1995), this seems to have been overly protective.",
              "Conclusion Marie and Pierre Curie worked with large amounts of radioactivity in their laboratory in an era when laboratory safety and radiation safety practices were rudimentary.",
              "As a result, both were almost certainly contaminated with radioactivity inside and out.",
              "But the contamination left behind on their laboratory notebooks and the radioactivity inside their bodies does not seem to have posed a risk to others at the times of their death, nor does it pose a threat to others today.",

              "The two researchers who were to play a major role in the continued study of this new radiation were Marie and Pierre Curie.",

              "Marie had her first lessons in physics and chemistry from her father.",
              "She had a brilliant aptitude for study and a great thirst for knowledge;",
              "however, advanced study was not possible for women in Poland.",
              "Marie dreamed of being able to study at the Sorbonne in Paris, but this was beyond the means of her family.",
              "To solve the problem, Marie and her elder sister, Bronya, came to an arrangement: Marie should go to work as a governess and help her sister with the money she managed to save so that Bronya could study medicine at the Sorbonne.",
              "When Bronya had taken her degree she, in her turn, would contribute to the cost of Marie\u2019s studies.",
              "So it was not until she was 24 that Marie came to Paris to study mathematics and physics.",
              "Bronya was now married to a doctor of Polish origin, and it was at Bronya\u2019s urgent invitation to come and live with them that Marie took the step of leaving for Paris.",
              "By then she had been away from her studies for six years, nor had she had any training in understanding rapidly spoken French.",
              "But her keen interest in studying and her joy at being at the Sorbonne with all its opportunities helped her surmount all difficulties.",
              "To save herself a two-hours journey, she rented a little attic in the Quartier Latin.",
              "There the cold was so intense that at night she had to pile on everything she had in the way of clothing so as to be able to sleep.",
              "But as compensation for all her privations she had total freedom to be able to devote herself wholly to her studies.",

              "He was completely indifferent to outward distinctions and a career.",
              "He earned a living as the head of a laboratory at the School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry where engineers were trained and he lived for his research into crystals and into the magnetic properties of bodies at different temperatures.",
              "He had not attended one of the French elite schools but had been taught by his father, who was a physician, and by a private teacher.",
              "He passed his baccalaure\u0301at at the early age of 16 and at 21, with his brother Jacques, he had discovered piezoelectricity, which means that a difference in electrical potential is seen when mechanical stresses are applied on certain crystals, including quartz.",

              "Marie, too, was an idealist;",
              "though outwardly shy and retiring, she was in reality energetic and single-minded.",
              "Pierre and Marie immediately discovered an intellectual affinity, which was very soon transformed into deeper feelings.",
              "In July 1895, they were married at the town hall at Sceaux, where Pierre\u2019s parents lived.",
              "They were given money as a wedding present which they used to buy a bicycle for each of them, and long, sometimes adventurous, cycle rides became their way of relaxing.",
              "Their life was otherwise quietly monotonous, a life filled with work and study.",
              "Persuaded by his father and by Marie, Pierre submitted his doctoral thesis in 1895.",
              "It concerned various types of magnetism, and contained a presentation of the connection between temperature and magnetism that is now known as Curie\u2019s Law.",
              "In 1896, Marie passed her teacher\u2019s diploma, coming first in her group.",
              "Their daughter Ire\u0300ne was born in September 1897.",
              "Pierre had managed to arrange that Marie should be allowed to work in the school\u2019s laboratory, and in 1897, she concluded a number of investigations into the magnetic properties of steel on behalf of an industrial association.",
              "Deciding after a time to go on doing research, Marie looked around for a subject for a doctoral thesis.",
              "Becquerel\u2019s discovery had not aroused very much attention.",
              "When, just a day or so after his discovery, he informed the Monday meeting of l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, his colleagues listened politely, then went on to the next item on the agenda.",
              "It was Ro\u0308ntgen\u2019s discovery and the possibilities it provided that were the focus of the interest and enthusiasm of researchers.",
              "Becquerel himself made certain important observations, for instance that gases through which the rays passed become able to conduct electricity, but he was soon to leave this field.",
              "Marie decided to make a systematic investigation of the mysterious \u201curanium rays\u201d.",
              "She had an excellent aid at her disposal \u2013 an electrometer for the measurement of weak electrical currents, which was constructed by Pierre and his brother, and was based on the piezoelectric effect.",
              "Results were not long in coming.",
              "Just after a few days, Marie discovered that thorium gives off the same rays as uranium.",
              "Her continued systematic studies of the various chemical compounds gave the surprising result that the strength of the radiation did not depend on the compound that was being studied.",
              "It depended only on the amount of uranium or thorium.",
              "Chemical compounds of the same element generally have very different chemical and physical properties: one uranium compound is a dark powder, another is a transparent yellow crystal, but what was decisive for the radiation they gave off was only the amount of uranium they contained.",
              "Marie drew the conclusion that the ability to radiate did not depend on the arrangement of the atoms in a molecule, it must be linked to the interior of the atom itself.",
              "This discovery was absolutely revolutionary.",
              "From a conceptual point of view it is her most important contribution to the development of physics.",
              "She now went through the whole periodic system.",
              "Her findings were that only uranium and thorium gave off this radiation.",
              "Marie\u2019s next idea, seemingly simple but brilliant, was to study the natural ores that contain uranium and thorium.",
              "She obtained samples from geological museums and found that of these ores, pitchblende was four to five times more active than was motivated by the amount of uranium.",
              "It was her hypothesis that a new element that was considerably more active than uranium was present in small amounts in the ore.",
              "Fascinating new vistas were opening up.",
              "Pierre gave up his research into crystals and symmetry in nature which he was deeply involved in and joined Marie in her project.",
              "They found that the strong activity came with the fractions containing bismuth or barium.",
              "When Marie continued her analysis of the bismuth fractions, she found that every time she managed to take away an amount of bismuth, a residue with greater activity was left.",
              "At the end of June 1898, they had a substance that was about 300 times more strongly active than uranium.",
              "In the work they published in July 1898, they write, \u201cWe thus believe that the substance that we have extracted from pitchblende contains a metal never known before, akin to bismuth in its analytic properties.",
              "If the existence of this new metal is confirmed, we suggest that it should be called polonium after the name of the country of origin of one of us.",
              "\u201d It was also in this work that they used the term radioactivity for the first time.",
              "After another few months of work, the Curies informed the l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, on December 26, 1898, that they had demonstrated strong grounds for having come upon an additional very active substance that behaved chemically almost like pure barium.",
              "They suggested the name of radium for the new element.",
              "In order to be certain of showing that it was a matter of new elements, the Curies would have to produce them in demonstrable amounts, determine their atomic weight and preferably isolate them.",
              "To do so, the Curies would need tons of the costly pitchblende.",
              "However, it was known that at the Joachimsthal mine in Bohemia large slag-heaps had been left in the surrounding forests.",
              "Marie considered that radium ought to be left in the residue.",
              "A sample was sent to them from Bohemia and the slag was found to be even more active than the original mineral.",
              "Several tons of pitchblende was later put at their disposal through the good offices of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.",

              "In a preface to Pierre Curie\u2019s collected works, Marie describes the shed as having a bituminous floor, and a glass roof which provided incomplete protection against the rain, and where it was like a hothouse in the summer, draughty and cold in the winter;",

              "But Marie\u2019s personality, her aura of simplicity and competence made a great impression.",
              "Ire\u0300ne was now 9 years old.",
              "Marie had definite ideas about the upbringing and education of children that she now wanted to put into practice.",
              "Her circle of friends consisted of a small group of professors with children of school age.",
              "Marie organized a private school with the parents themselves acting as teachers.",
              "A group of some ten children were accordingly taught only by prominent professors: Jean Perrin, Paul Langevin, E\u0301douard Chavannes, a professor of Chinese, Henri Mouton from the Pasteur Institute, a sculptor was engaged for modeling and drawing.",
              "Marie took the view that scientific subjects should be taught at an early age but not according to a too rigid curriculum.",
              "It was important for children to be able to develop freely.",
              "Games and physical activities took up much of the time.",
              "Quite a lot of time was taken for travel, too, for the children had to travel to the homes of their teachers, to Marie at Sceaux or to Langevin\u2019s lessons in one of the Paris suburbs.",
              "The little group became a kind of school for the elite with a great emphasis on science.",
              "The children involved say that they have happy memories of that time.",
              "For Ire\u0300ne it was in those years that the foundation of her development into a researcher was laid.",
              "The educational experiment lasted two years.",
              "Subsequently the pupils had to prepare for their forthcoming baccalaure\u0301at exam and to follow the traditional educational programs. In 1908 Marie, as the first woman ever, was appointed to become a professor at the Sorbonne.",
              "She went on to produce several decigrams of very pure radium chloride before finally, in collaboration with Andre\u0301 Debierne, she was able to isolate radium in metallic form.",
              "Andre\u0301 Debierne, who began as a laboratory assistant, became her faithful collaborator until her death and then succeeded her as head of the laboratory.",
              "In 1911 she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "The citation by the Nobel Committee was, \u201cin recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.",
              "\u201d Now that the archives have been made available to the public, it is possible to study in detail the events surrounding the awarding of the two Prizes, in 1903 and 1911.",
              "In a letter in 1903, several members of the l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, including Henri Poincare\u0301 and Gaston Darboux, had nominated Becquerel and Pierre Curie for the Prize in Physics.",
              "Marie\u2019s name was not mentioned.",
              "This caused Go\u0308sta Mittag-Leffler, a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University College, to write to Pierre Curie.",
              "That letter has never survived but Pierre Curie\u2019s answer, dated August 6, 1903, has been preserved.",
              "He wrote, \u201cIf it is true that one is seriously thinking about me (for the Prize), I very much wish to be considered together with Madame Curie with respect to our research on radioactive bodies.",
              "\u201d Drawing attention to the role she played in the discovery of radium and polonium, he added, \u201cDo you not think that it would be more satisfying from the artistic point of view, if we were to be associated in this manner?",
              "\u201d (plus joli d\u2019un point de vue artistique).",
              "Some biographers have questioned whether Marie deserved the Prize for Chemistry in 1911.",
              "They have claimed that the discoveries of radium and polonium were part of the reason for the Prize in 1903, even though this was not stated explicitly.",
              "Marie was said to have been awarded the Prize again for the same discovery, the award possibly being an expression of sympathy for reasons that will be mentioned below.",
              "Actually, however, the citation for the Prize in 1903 was worded deliberately with a view to a future Prize in Chemistry.",
              "Chemists considered that the discovery and isolation of radium was the greatest event in chemistry since the discovery of oxygen.",
              "That for the first time in history it could be shown that an element could be transmuted into another element, revolutionized chemistry and signified a new epoch.",
              "Despite the second Nobel Prize and an invitation to the first Solvay Conference with the world\u2019s leading physicists, including Einstein, Poincare\u0301 and Planck, 1911 became a dark year in Marie\u2019s life.",
              "In two smear campaigns she was to experience the inconstancy of the French press.",
              "The first was started on 16 November 1910, when, by an article in Le Figaro, it became known that she was willing to be nominated for election to l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences.",
              "Examples of factors other than merit deciding an election did exist, but Marie herself and her eminent research colleagues seemed to have considered that with her exceptionally brilliant scientific merits, her election was self-evident.",
              "Notwithstanding, it turned out that it was not merit that was decisive.",
              "The dark underlying currents of anti-Semitism, prejudice against women, xenophobia and even anti-science attitudes that existed in French society came welling up to the surface.",
              "Normally the election was of no interest to the press.",
              "The most rabid paper was the ultra-nationalistic and anti-Semitic L\u2019Action Franc\u0327aise, which was led by Le\u0301on Daudet, the son of the writer Alphonse Daudet.",
              "Dreyfus had got redress for his wrongs in 1906 and had been decorated with the Legion of Honour, but in the eyes of the groups who had been against him during his trial, he was still guilty, was still \u201cthe Jewish traitor.",
              "\u201d The pro-Dreyfus groups who had supported his cause were suspect and the scientists who were supporting Marie were among them.",
              "Jokes in bad taste alternated with outrageous accusations.",
              "It was said that in her career, Pierre\u2019s research had given her a free ride.",
              "She came from Poland, though admittedly she was formally a Catholic but her name Sklodowska indicated that she might be of Jewish origin, and so on.",
              "A week before the election, an opposing candidate, E\u0301douard Branly, was launched.",
              "The vote on January 23, 1911 was taken in the presence of journalists, photographers and hordes of the curious.",
              "The election took place in a tumultuous atmosphere.",
              "In the first round Marie lost by one vote, in the second by two.",
              "In all, fifty-eight votes were cast.",
              "A Nobel Prize in 1903 and support from prominent researchers such as Jean Perrin, Henri Poincare\u0301, Paul Appell and the permanent secretary of the Acade\u0301mie, Gaston Darboux, were not sufficient to make the Acade\u0301mie open its doors.",
              "This event attracted international attention and indignation.",
              "It deeply wounded both Marie and indeed E\u0301douard Branly, too, himself a well-merited researcher.",
              "However, Marie\u2019s tribulations were not at an end.",
              "When, at the beginning of November 1911, Marie went to Belgium, being invited with the world\u2019s most eminent physicists to attend the first Solvay Conference, she received a message that a new campaign had started in the press.",
              "Now it was a matter of her private life and her relations with her colleague Paul Langevin, who had also been invited to the conference.",
              "He had had marital problems for several years and had moved from his suburban home to a small apartment in Paris.",
              "Marie was depicted as the reason.",
              "Both were described in slanderous terms. The scandal developed dramatically.",
              "Marie stands up in her own defence and managed to force an apology from the newspaper Le Temps.",
              "The same day she received word from Stockholm that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "However, the very newspapers that made her a legend when she received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, now completely ignored the fact that she had been awarded the Prize in Chemistry or merely reported it in a few words on an inside page.",
              "The Langevin scandal escalated into a serious affair that shook the university world in Paris and the French government at the highest level.",
              "Madame Langevin was preparing legal action to obtain custody of the four children.",
              "With a burglary in Langevin\u2019s apartment certain letters were stolen and delivered to the press.",
              "Le\u0301on Daudet made the whole thing into a new Dreyfus affair.",
              "Day after day Marie had to run the gauntlet in the newspapers: an alien, a Polish woman, a researcher supported by our French scientists, had come and stolen an honest French woman\u2019s husband.",
              "Daudet quoted Fouquier-Tinville\u2019s notorious words that during the Revolution had sent the chemist Lavoisier to the guillotine: \u201cThe Republic does not need any scientists.",

              "But the scandal kept up its impetus with headlines on the first pages such as \u201cMadame Curie, can she still remain a professor at the Sorbonne?",
              "\u201d With her children Marie stayed at Sceaux where she was practically a prisoner in her own home.",

              "There was no proof of the accusations made against Marie and the authenticity of the letters could be questioned but in the heated atmosphere there were few who thought clearly.",
              "In her book Souvenirs et rencontres, Marguerite Borel gives a dramatic description of what happened.",
              "E\u0301mile Borel was extremely indignant and acted quickly.",

              "Newspaper publishers who had come up against each other in this dispute had already fought duels.",
              "Swords were generally used and a duellist was usually content with inflicting a thorough scratch on his opponent for the duel to be considered decided.",

              "In the midst of all its gravity, the duel had turned into a farce.",
              "However, the publication of the letters and the duel were too much for those responsible at the Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm.",
              "Marie received a letter from a member, Svante Arrhenius, in which he said that the duel had given the impression that the published correspondence had not been falsified.",
              "He asked her to cable that she would not be coming to the prize award ceremony and to write him a letter to the effect that she did not want to accept the Prize until the Langevin court proceedings had shown that the accusations against her were absolutely without foundation.",
              "Of those most closely affected, the person who remained level-headed despite the enormous strain of the critical situation was in fact Marie herself.",
              "In a well-formulated and matter-of-fact reply, she pointed out that she had been awarded the Prize for her discovery of radium and polonium, and that she could not accept the principle that appreciation of the value of scientific work should be influenced by slander concerning a researcher\u2019s private life.",
              "On December 6, Langevin wrote a long letter to Svante Arrhenius, whom he had met previously.",
              "He described the whole situation, explained what circles were behind the smear campaign.",
              "He appealed to the Nobel Committee not to let it be influenced by a campaign which was fundamentally unjust.",

              "She spoke of the field of research which \u201cI have called radioactivity\u201d and \u201cmy hypothesis that radioactivity is an atomic property,\u201d but without detracting from his contributions.",
              "She declared that she also regarded this Prize as a tribute to Pierre Curie.",
              "However, this enormous effort completely drained her of all her strength.",
              "She sank into a depressed state.",
              "On December 29, she was taken to a hospital whose location was kept secret for her protection.",

              "[1] One of seven children born to teachers, Marie showed an interest in mathematics and physics, which her father taught at a high school.",
              "[1] Universities in Poland did not allow women to attend, so in 1891, Marie moved to Paris to attend Sorbonne.",
              "By 1894, she had graduated at the top of her class with degrees in both mathematics and physics, taking after her father.",
              "[2] While in attendance, she met Pierre Curie, a professor at the university.",
              "On July 26, 1895, Marie married Pierre and remained in Paris to conduct research alongside him.",
              "[2] Early in her career, Marie took an interest in Becquerel rays.",
              "She did not have the funding for a lab, so she conducted her research in a storeroom.",
              "In the tight working quarters, she discovered that the chemical or physical state of the uranium did not matter.",
              "The more uranium in the compound, the more radiation it gave off.",
              "[1] She continued exploring other types of compounds that emitted Becquerel rays and found that thorium also produced rays similar to uranium.",
              "She decided to name the activity of the two compounds radioactivity.",
              "[1] After this discovery, she and Pierre turned their attention to a mineral called pitchblende (uranium oxide), which is about 70 percent uranium, but more active than uranium.",
              "[3] They assumed there was a radioactive substance inside pitchblende causing this.",
              "Through fractional crystallization, they were able to discover polonium and radium.",
              "[1] With the new knowledge of these two substances, Curie later realized that radium could be used as a gamma ray source on X-ray machines.",
              "This was extremely useful during World War I because it allowed for smaller, more accurate x-ray machines that could be used by medics.",
              "[3] In 1903, following her and Pierres research on Becquerel rays, they both received the Nobel Prize for Physics.",
              "Pierre died in a car accident in 1906, but Marie continued her research.",
              "She went on to receive the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911 for her work on radioactivity (see Fig.",
              "1).",
              "She was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and remains the only woman to receive a Nobel Prize in two different fields of research.",
              "[1] Throughout her work with radium, Marie was unaware of the effects of radioactivity exposure on the body.",
              "In her lab, she would keep tubes of radium in her pocket.",
              "[3] She began to suspect that radium negatively impacted health when one of her fellow researchers died of a blood disease, and then a few years later her personal assistant died of a blood disease.",
              "Even though she suspected that radium exposure was bad for her health, she did very little to monitor her own blood.",
              "In 1932, she broke her wrist and the break took much longer to heal than it should have.",
              "She then began to notice that her vision was deteriorating and radiation burns on her fingers were becoming more and more painful.",
              "Some days she felt too ill to even go to the lab, and finally on July 4, 1934, Marie died from aplastic anemia.",
              "[1] Marie suspected that her health was being negatively impacted by radium exposure, but did nothing about it, most likely because there weren't any effective treatments for radium poisoning yet.",
              "At the time, scientists knew that radium was metabolized like calcium.",
              "In an attempt to remove it from the system, they manipulated calcium intake.",
              "[4] This caused little to no improvements, so parathyroid hormone was added to the treatment.",
              "Again, there was some reduction of radium, but not a significant amount.",
              "It wasn't until after Marie's death that they realized once radium is in the bones, it is extremely difficult to extract.",
              "The lack of therapies for radium exposure may explain why Marie just ignored her symptoms, because she was fully aware of her fate.",

              "I recently read a question on an internet Q&A website asking how they can still be dangerous after a century and claiming that even touching the pages can put one at risk.",
              "But I\u2019ve got to admit to being dubious \u2013 my background in radiation safety tells me that it\u2019s not very easy to contaminate anything so much as to make it dangerous.",

              "But that\u2019s just my guess \u2013 luckily, there\u2019s some information on the matter, so we don\u2019t have to guess.",
              "The reason for the concern is that Marie and Pierre Curie processed tons of uranium-bearing minerals in their laboratory, discovering the naturally radioactive elements polonium and radium through an arduous process of grinding tons of rock and painstakingly extracting the radioactive components.",
              "They were doing this work only a few years after the discovery of radiation and radioactivity, and little was known of the potential harm they could cause.",
              "Even less was known about good radiological work practices \u2013 it\u2019s not surprising that the laboratory and notebooks became contaminated.",
              "Considering radium\u2019s 1600-year half-life and the sensitivity of today\u2019s radiation detectors, it\u2019s equally unsurprising that this contamination is still detectable today.",
              "Oh \u2013 and if you\u2019re interested, you can see Marie Curie\u2019s notebook yourself \u2013 it\u2019s in the Wellcome Collection (located in London), and anybody can download a scan as a PDF.",
              "Scholars can handle the notebook, although the Christian Science Monitor tells us that they first need to sign a release and use gloves because of the contamination.",
              "But before we make an appointment to see the notebooks, let\u2019s talk about the risks!",
              "Contamination In 2014 the Wellcome Trust commissioned an evaluation of contamination and radiation levels from Marie Curie\u2019s notebook \u2013 the highest levels of contamination found were about 2500 counts per second (cps) of alpha contamination and 3500 cps of beta contamination.",
              "Further analysis (and a little bit of calculation) showed that the notebook has about 1.",

              "According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a person can ingest up to 2 microCuries annually without exceeding a dose limit \u2013 this means that someone who decided to eat Marie Curie\u2019s laboratory notebook would exceed their annual dose limit by about 60% for that year.",

              "Having said that \u2013 do we expect that anybody is going to lick the front and back covers, or to eat, Marie Curie\u2019s notebook?",
              "It seems unlikely \u2013 but even if they did, there\u2019s not enough radioactivity to cause radiation sickness in the short term or create a significant risk of cancer in the long term.",
              "The bottom line is that this notebook doesn\u2019t pose an appreciable risk to anybody who wants to read it \u2013 even if they do decide to lick the cover and pages.",
              "In reality, the likely radiation exposure from handling the diary is even lower \u2013 at most, about 0.",
              "0003 microCuries might be removed by holding the notebook.",
              "Were this to be ingested (perhaps by licking one\u2019s fingers or transferring it to a sandwich), one might receive a dose equivalent to the same amount of exposure we receive from natural radiation in just two days.",
              "Radiation exposure Radium primarily emits alpha radiation, which can\u2019t even pass through a half-inch (about 1 cm) of air and cannot penetrate through the dead layer of skin cells of our epidermis to reach the living cells beneath.",
              "Radium also gives off a small amount of gamma radiation, but the low levels of radium measured in Curie\u2019s notebook give off equally low levels of gamma radiation.",
              "Someone turning the pages wouldn\u2019t receive enough radiation exposures to cause any health concerns.",
              "So, neither staff nor visiting scholars are at risk from reading or handling this document.",
              "Marie and Pierre Curie\u2019s remains Marie Curie\u2019s body (Pierre\u2019s as well) was somewhat radioactive at the time of her death due to the radium and other radioactivity she had inhaled and ingested during her many years of laboratory work.",
              "As a result, she and Pierre were buried in lead coffins to shield the radiation both were emitting at the time of their death.",
              "In 1995 France honored both Marie and Pierre by moving their bodies to the Pantheon, where they were to be laid to rest with Victor Hugo, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, and other great French intellectuals.",
              "At this time, the French radiation protection agency (l\u2019Office de Protection contres les Rayonnements Ionisants \u2013 OPRI) directed that radiation measurements be made during the exhumation to determine the risk, if any, to those involved in the process.",
              "Radiation dose rates in the cemetery were slightly elevated, but this was determined to be due to natural radioactivity in the granite headstone, monuments, and pavers.",
              "Pierre Curie\u2019s body was found to emit elevated radiation levels (about 0.",
              "24 \u03bcSv/hr \u2013 about 24 \u03bcR/hr), which is hardly enough to pose a risk to anyone.",
              "Marie\u2019s emitted even less, most likely because of improved work safety practices as well as the elimination of radium from her body in her later years.",
              "The amount of radium in Pierre\u2019s remains was determined to be about 0.",

              "Still, there\u2019s no way to know how the radioactivity was distributed through his body (radium tends to concentrate in the bones) or if the measurements are representative of actual radium concentrations or only parts of his body.",
              "However, the average human skeleton weighs about 10 kg;",
              "if we assume for the sake of argument that Pierre\u2019s skeleton contained about half the mass of his remains, then the total amount of radioactivity in Pierre\u2019s body would have been about 0.",
              "16 microCuries \u2013 this number is almost certainly wrong, but there\u2019s no way to tell if it\u2019s high or low.",
              "If we multiply by a factor of 10 for the high estimate and divide by the same amount for the low estimate, it seems safe to say that Pierre had somewhere between 0.",

              "6 microCuries of radioactivity at the time of his death.",
              "The high estimate is still lower than what US regulations permit a radiation worker to ingest annually and would give a radiation dose of about 40 rem to the surface of the bone or about four rem to the whole body.",
              "Given the relatively long half-life (about 1600 years) of radium, there has been virtually no radioactive decay between the time of the Curies\u2019 death and today \u2013 if there\u2019s very little radioactivity today, then there was very little at the time of their death.",
              "Given what was known at that time about their work, it likely made sense to bury both Marie and Pierre in lead-lined coffins \u2013 given the more recent measurements (1995), this seems to have been overly protective.",
              "Conclusion Marie and Pierre Curie worked with large amounts of radioactivity in their laboratory in an era when laboratory safety and radiation safety practices were rudimentary.",
              "As a result, both were almost certainly contaminated with radioactivity inside and out.",
              "But the contamination left behind on their laboratory notebooks and the radioactivity inside their bodies does not seem to have posed a risk to others at the times of their death, nor does it pose a threat to others today.",

              "[14] They were introduced by Polish physicist Jo\u0301zef Wierusz-Kowalski, who had learned that she was looking for a larger laboratory space, something that Wierusz-Kowalski thought Pierre could access.",
              "[14][27] Though Curie did not have a large laboratory, he was able to find some space for Sk\u0142odowska where she was able to begin work.",
              "[27] Their mutual passion for science brought them increasingly closer, and they began to develop feelings for one another.",
              "[14][27] Eventually, Pierre proposed marriage, but at first Sk\u0142odowska did not accept as she was still planning to go back to her native country.",
              "Curie, however, declared that he was ready to move with her to Poland, even if it meant being reduced to teaching French.",
              "[14] Meanwhile, for the 1894 summer break, Sk\u0142odowska returned to Warsaw, where she visited her family.",

              "In Pierre, Marie had found a new love, a partner, and a scientific collaborator on whom she could depend.",
              "[17] In 1895, Wilhelm Ro\u0308ntgen discovered the existence of X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood.",
              "[30] In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power.",
              "[30] He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself.",
              "Influenced by these two important discoveries, Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.",
              "[14][30] She used an innovative technique to investigate samples.",
              "Fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had developed a version of the electrometer, a sensitive device for measuring electric charge.",
              "[30] Using her husband's electrometer, she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity.",
              "Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present.",
              "[30] She hypothesized that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itself.",
              "[30] This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible.",
              "[30][31] In 1897, her daughter Ire\u0300ne was born.",
              "To support her family, Curie began teaching at the E\u0301cole Normale Supe\u0301rieure.",
              "[25] The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory;",
              "most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to ESPCI.",
              "[25] The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof.",
              "[32] They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances.",
              "ESPCI did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.",
              "[25][32][33] Curie's systematic studies included two uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite).",
              "[32] Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was four times as active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active.",
              "She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium.",
              "[32][34] She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive.",
              "[30] Pierre Curie was increasingly intrigued by her work.",
              "By mid-1898 he was so invested in it that he decided to drop his work on crystals and to join her.",
              "[25][32] The [research] idea [writes Reid] was her own;",
              "no one helped her formulate it, and although she took it to her husband for his opinion she clearly established her ownership of it.",
              "She later recorded the fact twice in her biography of her husband to ensure there was no chance whatever of any ambiguity.",
              "It [is] likely that already at this early stage of her career [she] realized that.",

              ".",
              "many scientists would find it difficult to believe that a woman could be capable of the original work in which she was involved.",
              "[35] She was acutely aware of the importance of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority.",
              "Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Acade\u0301mie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity (and even a Nobel Prize), would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson.",
              "Curie chose the same rapid means of publication.",
              "Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Acade\u0301mie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann.",
              "[36] Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium;",
              "two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.",
              "[37] At that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: \"The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium.\"",
              "She later would recall how she felt \"a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible.\"",
              "[37] On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar.",
              "They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tonnes of the ore.",
              "[37] In July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element they named \"polonium\", in honour of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires (Russian, Austrian, and Prussian).",
              "[14] On 26 December 1898, the Curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named \"radium\", from the Latin word for \"ray\".",
              "[25][32][38] In the course of their research, they also coined the word \"radioactivity\".",
              "[14] To prove their discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form.",
              "[32] Pitchblende is a complex mineral;",
              "the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task.",
              "The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy;",
              "chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore.",
              "[32] Radium, however, was more elusive;",
              "it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements.",
              "By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach.",
              "[39] The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization.",
              "From a tonne of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902.",
              "In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal.",
              "[32][40] She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.",
              "[32] Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumour-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.",
              "[41] In 1900, Curie became the first woman faculty member at the E\u0301cole Normale Supe\u0301rieure and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris.",
              "[42][43] In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her father's death.",

              "[32][42] In December 1903 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics, \"in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel.\"",
              "[25] At first the committee had intended to honour only Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, but a committee member and advocate for women scientists, Swedish mathematician Magnus Go\u0308sta Mittag-Leffler, alerted Pierre to the situation, and after his complaint, Marie's name was added to the nomination.",
              "[46] Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.",
              "[25] Curie and her husband declined to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person;",
              "they were too busy with their work, and Pierre Curie, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill.",
              "[45][46] As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905.",
              "[46] The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant.",
              "[46] Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre Curie a position, the University of Paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still did not have a proper laboratory.",
              "[25][42][43] Upon Pierre Curie's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.",
              "[46] In December 1904, Curie gave birth to their second daughter, E\u0300ve.",
              "[46] She hired Polish governesses to teach her daughters her native language, and sent or took them on visits to Poland.",
              "[10] On 19 April 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident.",
              "Walking across the Rue Dauphine in heavy rain, he was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels, fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.",
              "[25][47] Curie was devastated by her husband's death.",
              "[48] On 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and offer it to Marie.",
              "She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre.",
              "[48][49] She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.",
              "[25] Curie's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris, however.",
              "In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris.",
              "[49] The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul E\u0301mile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute.",
              "[25][50] Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.",
              "[50] In 1910 Curie succeeded in isolating radium;",
              "she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre: the curie.",
              "[49] Nevertheless, in 1911 the French Academy of Sciences failed, by one[25] or two votes,[51] to elect her to membership in the academy.",
              "Elected instead was E\u0301douard Branly, an inventor who had helped Guglielmo Marconi develop the wireless telegraph.",
              "[52] It was only over half a century later, in 1962, that a doctoral student of Curie's, Marguerite Perey, became the first woman elected to membership in the academy.",
              "Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia\u2014the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair\u2014which also fuelled false speculation that Curie was Jewish.",
              "[25][51] During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right-wing press as a foreigner and atheist.",
              "[51] Her daughter later remarked on the French press's hypocrisy in portraying Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but portraying her as a French heroine when she received foreign honours such as her Nobel Prizes.",
              "[25] In 1911 it was revealed that Curie was involved in a year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's,[53] a married man who was estranged from his wife.",
              "[51] This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents.",
              "Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker.",
              "[54] When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium;",
              "on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.",
              "[51] International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honoured her a second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "[17] This award was \"in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.\"",
              "[55] Because of the negative publicity due to her affair with Langevin, the chair of the Nobel committee, Svante Arrhenius, attempted to prevent her attendance at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in Chemistry, citing her questionable moral standing.",
              "Curie replied that she would be present at the ceremony, because \"the prize has been given to her for her discovery of polonium and radium\" and that \"there is no relation between her scientific work and the facts of her private life\".",
              "She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each.",
              "A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning, headed by novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz, encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country.",
              "[17] Curie's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government to support the Radium Institute, built in 1914, where research was conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine.",
              "[50] A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment.",
              "For most of 1912, she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton.",
              "She returned to her laboratory only in December, after a break of about 14 months.",
              "[55] In 1912 the Warsaw Scientific Society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie (today rue Pierre-et-Marie-Curie).",
              "[50][55] She was appointed director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.",
              "[56] She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities.",
              "The institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.",
              "[50][55][57] During World War I, Curie recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible.",
              "[58] She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons,[57] including to obviate amputations when in fact limbs could be saved.",
              "[59][60] After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics, she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, and auxiliary generators, and she developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies (\"Little Curies\").",
              "[57] She became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914.",
              "[57] Assisted at first by a military doctor and her 17-year-old daughter Ire\u0300ne, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war.",
              "[50][57] Later, she began training other women as aides.",
              "[61] In 1915, Curie produced hollow needles containing \"radium emanation\", a colourless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue.",
              "She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply.",
              "[61] It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units.",
              "[21][50] Busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that period.",
              "[50] In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, Curie never received any formal recognition of it from the French government.",
              "[57] Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the French National Bank refused to accept them.",
              "[61] She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money.",
              "[61] She said: I am going to give up the little gold I possess.",
              "I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me.",

              "This philanthropic organization gave her the money needed to produce the first car, which ended up playing an important role in treating the wounded at the Battle of Marne in 1914 \u2013 a major Allied victory that kept the Germans from entering Paris.",
              "More radiological cars were needed.",
              "So Curie exploited her scientific clout to ask wealthy Parisian women to donate vehicles.",
              "Soon she had 20, which she outfitted with X-ray equipment.",
              "But the cars were useless without trained X-ray operators, so Curie started to train women volunteers.",
              "She recruited 20 women for the first training course, which she taught along with her daughter Irene, a future Nobel Prize winner herself.",
              "The curriculum included theoretical instruction about the physics of electricity and X-rays as well as practical lessons in anatomy and photographic processing.",
              "When that group had finished its training, it left for the front, and Curie then trained more women.",
              "In the end, a total of 150 women received X-ray training from Curie.",
              "Not content just to send out her trainees to the battlefront, Curie herself had her own \u201clittle Curie\u201d \u2013 as the radiological cars were nicknamed \u2013 that she took to the front.",

              "Although few, if any, of the women X-ray workers were injured as a consequence of combat, they were not without their casualties.",
              "Many suffered burns from overexposure to X-rays.",
              "Curie knew that such high exposures posed future health risks, such as cancer in later life.",
              "But there had been no time to perfect X-ray safety practices for the field, so many X-ray workers were overexposed.",
              "She worried much about this, and later wrote a book about X-ray safety drawn from her war experiences.",
              "Curie survived the war but was concerned that her intense X-ray work would ultimately cause her demise.",
