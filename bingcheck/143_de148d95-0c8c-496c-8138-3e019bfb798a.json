    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. That's a very interesting question. The study of ancient DNA and genetics can help us to better understand the migration and evolution of human populations throughout history by revealing the genetic relationships, origins, movements, adaptations and interactions of different groups of people over time[^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^]. Some of the most intriguing findings that have been discovered using these techniques so far include:\n\n- The discovery of a new ancient human group called the Denisovans, who interbred with both Neanderthals and modern humans in Asia[^5^].\n- The evidence of multiple waves of migration into the Americas by different populations, such as the Paleo-Eskimos, the Na-Dene speakers and the Thule people[^2^] [^3^].\n- The identification of favorable genetic variants that emerged and spread rapidly among human populations in response to environmental and cultural changes[^4^].\n- The detection of ancient DNA from sediments in caves where no human fossils were found, which can reveal the presence and diversity of archaic humans in regions where their remains are scarce or absent[^1^].\n\nThese are just some examples of how ancient DNA and genetics can shed light on our past and inform our present.

              "But exactly who crossed, or recrossed, and who survived as ancestors of today\u2019s Native Americans has been a matter of long debate.",
              "Two new DNA studies sourced from rare fossils on both sides of the Bering Strait help write new chapters in the stories of these prehistoric peoples.",
              "The first study delves into the genetics of North American peoples, the Paleo-Eskimos (some of the earliest people to populate the Arctic) and their descendants.",
              "\u201c[The research] focuses on the populations living in the past and today in northern North America, and it shows interesting links between Na-Dene speakers with both the first peoples to migrate into the Americas and Paleo-Eskimo peoples,\u201d Anne Stone, an anthropological geneticist at Arizona State University who assessed both studies for Nature, says via email.",
              "Beringia had formed by about 34,000 years ago, and the first mammoth-hunting humans crossed it more than 15,000 years ago and perhaps far earlier.",
              "A later, major migration some 5,000 years ago by people known as Paleo-Eskimos spread out across many regions of the American Arctic and Greenland.",
              "But whether they are direct ancestors of today\u2019s Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene speaking peoples, or if they were displaced by a later migration of the Neo-Eskimos, or Thule people, about 800 years ago, has remained something of a mystery.",
              "An international team studied the remains of 48 ancient humans from the region, as well as 93 living Alaskan In\u0303upiat and West Siberian peoples.",
              "Their work not only added to the relatively small number of ancient genomes from the region, but it also attempted to fit all the data together into a single population model.",
              "The findings reveal that both ancient and modern peoples in the American Arctic and Siberia inherited many of their genes from Paleo-Eskimos.",
              "Descendants of this ancient population include the Yup\u2019ik, Inuit, Aleuts and Na-Dene language speakers from Alaska and Northern Canada all the way to the Southwest United States.",
              "The findings stand in contrast to other genetic studies that had suggested the Paleo-Eskimos were an isolated people who vanished after some 4,000 years.",
              "\"For the last seven years, there has been a debate about whether Paleo-Eskimos contributed genetically to people living in North America today;",
              "our study resolves this debate and furthermore supports the theory that Paleo-Eskimos spread Na-Dene languages,\" co-author David Reich of Harvard Medical School and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute says in a press release.",
              "The second study focused on Asian lineages, Stone notes.",
              "\u201cThe study is exciting because it gives us insight into the population dynamics, over 30-plus thousand years, that have occurred in northeastern Siberia.",
              "And these insights, of course, also provide information about the people who migrated to the Americas.",
              "\u201d Researchers retrieved genetic samples for 34 individuals\u2019 remains in Siberia, dating from 600 to 31,600 years old.",
              "The latter are the oldest human remains known in the region, and they revealed a previously unknown group of Siberians.",
              "The DNA of one Siberian individual, about 10,000 years old, shows more genetic resemblance to Native Americans than any other remains found outside of the Americas.",
              "Fifteen years ago scientists unearthed a 31,000-year-old site along Russia\u2019s Yana River, well north of the Arctic Circle, with ancient animal bones, ivory and stone tools.",
              "But two tiny, children\u2019s milk teeth are the only human remains recovered from the Ice Age site\u2014and they yielded the only human genome yet known from people who lived in northeastern Siberia during the period before the Last Glacial Maximum.",
              "They represent a previously unrecognized population that the study\u2019s international team of authors have dubbed \u201cAncient North Siberians.",
              "\u201d The authors suggest that during the Last Glacial Maximum (26,500 to 19,000 years ago) some of these 500 or so Siberians sought more habitable climes in southern Beringia.",
              "Stone says the migration illustrates the ways that shifting climate impacted ancient population dynamics.",
              "\u201cI do think that the refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum were important,\u201d she says.",
              "\u201cAs populations moved to refugia, likely following the animals they hunted and to take advantage of the plants they gathered as those distributions shifted south, this resulted in population interactions and changes.",
              "These populations then expanded out of the refugia as the climate warmed and these climate dynamics likely affected population around the world.",
              "\u201d In this case, the Ancient North Siberians arrived in Beringia and likely mixed with migrating peoples from East Asia.",
              "Their population eventually gave rise to both the First Peoples of North America and other lineages that dispersed through Siberia.",
              "David Meltzer, an anthropologist at Southern Methodist University and coauthor of the new study, says when the Yana River site was discovered, the artifacts were said to look like the distinctive stone tools (specifically projectile \u201cpoints\u201d) of the Clovis culture\u2014an early Native American population that lived in present-day New Mexico about 13,000 years ago.",
              "But the observation was greeted with skepticism because Yana was separated from America\u2019s Clovis sites by 18,000 years, many hundreds of miles, and even the glaciers of the last Ice Age.",
              "It seemed more likely that different populations simply made similar stone points in different places and times.",
              "\u201cThe odd thing is, now as it turns out, they were related,\u201d Meltzer says.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool.",
              "It doesn\u2019t change the fact that there\u2019s no direct historical descent in terms of the artifacts, but it does tell us that there was this population floating around in far northern Russia 31,000 years ago whose descendants contributed a bit of DNA to Native Americans.",
              "\u201d The finding isn\u2019t particularly surprising given that at least some Native American ancestors have long been thought to hail from the Siberian region.",
              "But details that seemed unknowable are now coming to light after thousands of years.",
              "For example, the Ancient North Siberian peoples also appear to be ancestral to the Mal\u2019ta individual (dated to 24,000 years ago) from the Lake Baikal region of southern Russia, a population that showed a slice of European roots\u2014and from whom Native Americans, in turn, derived some 40 percent of their ancestry.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s making its way to Native Americans,\u201d Meltzer says of the ancient Yana genome, \u201cbut it\u2019s doing so through various other populations that come and go on the Siberian landscape over the course of the Ice Age.",
              "Every genome that we get right now is telling us a lot of things that we didn\u2019t know because ancient genomes in America and in Siberia from the Ice Age are rare.",
              "\u201d A more modern genome from 10,000-year-old remains found near Siberia\u2019s Kolyma River evidences a DNA mix of East Asian and Ancient North Siberian lineages similar to that seen in Native American populations\u2014a much closer match than any others found outside of North America.",
              "This finding, and others from both studies, serve as reminders that the tale of human admixture and migration in the Arctic wasn\u2019t a one-way street.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing about the Bering land bridge that says you can\u2019t go both ways,\u201d Meltzer says.",
              "\u201cIt was open, relatively flat, no glaciers\u2014it wasn\u2019t like you wander through and the door closes behind you and you\u2019re trapped in America.",
              "So there\u2019s no reason to doubt that the Bering land bridge was trafficking humans in both directions during the Pleistocene.",
              "The idea of going back to Asia is a big deal for us, but they had no clue.",
              "They didn\u2019t think they were going between continents.",
              "They were just moving around a large land mass.",

              "Lurking within our genome are traces of genetic material from a variety of ancient humans that no longer exist.",

              "Fossil evidence illustrates the spread of two long-extinct hominin species, Neanderthals and Denisovans.",
              "Modern humans carry genes from these species, indicating that our direct ancestors encountered and mated with archaic humans.",
              "Combining his expertise in biology and Darwinian evolution with computational and statistical methods, Akey studies the genetic connections between modern humans and two species of extinct hominins: Neanderthals, the classical \u201ccave men\u201d of paleoanthropology;",

              "Akey\u2019s research divulges a complex history of the intermixing of early humans, indicative of several millennia of population movements across the globe.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s often a divide between the researchers who go out and collect exotic samples and the researchers who do really creative theory and data analysis, and he\u2019s done both,\u201d said Kelley Harris, a former colleague of Akey\u2019s who is now an assistant professor of genome sciences at the University of Washington.",
              "Like many of us, Akey has long been interested in how the human species evolved.",
              "\u201cPeople want to learn about their past,\u201d he said.",
              "\u201cBut even more than that, we want to know what it means to be human.",
              "\u201d This curiosity followed Akey throughout his schooling.",
              "During his graduate work at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston in the late 1990s, he looked at how contemporary humans in different parts of the world were genetically related to one another, and used early gene sequencing methods to try to understand these relationships.",
              "Gene sequencers are devices that determine the order of the four chemical bases (A, T, C and G) that make up the DNA molecule.",
              "By determining the order of these bases, analysts can identify the genetic information encoded in a strand of DNA.",
              "Since the 1990s, however, gene sequencing technology has progressed dramatically.",
              "A new technology known as next-generation sequencing came into use around 2010 and allowed researchers to study a very large number of genetic sequences in the human genome.",
              "It took 10 years to sequence the first human genome, but these new machines get whole genome sequence data from thousands of individuals in only a matter of hours.",
              "\u201cWhen next-generation sequencing technology started to become the dominant force in genetics,\u201d Akey said, \u201cthat completely changed the entire field.",

              "\u201d The scale of the data that now can be analyzed has allowed researchers to address a whole slew of new questions that would not have been possible with the previous technology.",
              "Joshua Akey and his team use gene-sequencing technologies to reveal new information about archaic human lineages as well as our own evolutionary history.",
              "One of these questions is the relationship between modern humans and archaic humans, such as Neanderthals.",
              "In fact, this question fostered a vigorous debate about whether modern humans carried genes from Neanderthals.",
              "For many years, the opinions of researchers \u2014 both pro and con \u2014 ticked back and forth like a metronome.",
              "Gradually, however, a few researchers \u2014 including geneticists Svante Pa\u0308a\u0308bo of the Max Planck Institute in Germany and his colleague Richard (Ed) Green of the University of California-Santa Cruz \u2014 began to demonstrate strong evidence that, indeed, there had been gene flow from Neanderthals to modern humans.",
              "In a 2010 paper, these researchers estimated that people of non-African ancestry had about 2% Neanderthal ancestry.",
              "Neanderthals lived in a wide geographical swath across Europe, the Near East and Central Asia before dying out around 30,000 years ago.",
              "They lived alongside anatomically modern humans, who evolved in Africa some 200,000 years ago.",
              "The archaeological record shows that Neanderthals were adept at making stone tools and developed a number of physical traits that uniquely adapted them to cold, dark climates, such as broad noses, thick body hair and large eyes.",
              "Following on the heels of Pa\u0308a\u0308bo and Green\u2019s Neanderthal research, Akey and a colleague, Benjamin Vernot, published a paper in Science looking at recovering Neanderthal sequences from the genome of modern humans.",
              "Geneticist David Reich of Harvard University published a similar paper in Nature, and, together, the two papers provided the first data employing the modern genome to investigate our link with Neanderthals.",
              "Using the genetic variation in contemporary populations to learn about things that happened in the past involves scrutinizing the modern human genome for gene sequences that display traits expected to have been inherited from a different type of human.",
              "Akey and his colleagues then take those sequences and compare them to the Neanderthal genome, looking for a match.",
              "Using this technique, Akey has been able to uncover a rich human legacy of genetic interconnections on a scale previously unconceived.",
              "As stated, while the available evidence suggests that non-Africans carry about 2% of Neanderthal genes, Africans, who were once believed not to have any connections with Neanderthals, actually have approximately 0.",
              "5% Neanderthal genes.",
              "Researchers have further discovered that the Neanderthal genome has contributed to several diseases seen in modern human populations, such as diabetes, arthritis and celiac disease.",
              "By the same token, some genes inherited from Neanderthals have proven beneficial or neutral, such as genes for hair and skin color, sleep patterns and even mood.",
              "Akey has also discovered genetic fingerprints that suggest our human ancestry contains species about which we know nothing or very little.",
              "The Denisovans are a case in point.",
              "An archaic form of human, they coexisted with anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals and interbred with both before going extinct.",
              "The first evidence of their existence came in 2008 when a finger bone was discovered in Denisova Cave in the remote Altai Mountains of southern Siberia.",
              "At first the bone was assumed to be Neanderthal because the cave contained evidence of these species.",
              "Consequently, it sat in a museum drawer in Leipzig, Germany, for many years before it was analyzed.",
              "But when it was, the researchers were dumbfounded.",
              "It wasn\u2019t a Neanderthal \u2014 it was a hitherto unknown type of ancient human.",
              "\u201cThe Denisovans are the first species ever identified directly from their DNA and not from fossil data,\u201d Akey said.",
              "Since that time, continued genetic work \u2014 much of it conducted by Akey and his colleagues \u2014 has established that the closest living relatives of Denisovans are modern Melanesians, the inhabitants of the Melanesian islands of the western Pacific \u2014 places such as New Guinea, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Fiji.",
              "These populations carry between 4% and 6% of Denisovan genes, though they also carry Neanderthal genes.",
              "Examples like this highlight one of the main features of our human lineage, Akey said, that admixture has been a defining feature of our history.",
              "\u201cThroughout human history there\u2019s always been admixture,\u201d Akey said.",
              "\u201cPopulations split and they come back together.",
              "\u201d While there remains a lot of debate about the Denisovans, Akey believes they most likely were closely related to Neanderthals, perhaps an eastern version who split off from the latter sometime around 300,000 or 400,000 years ago.",
              "Recently, genetic analysis of fossils from Denisova Cave has uncovered evidence of an offspring between a Neanderthal woman and a Denisovan male.",
              "The offspring was a female who lived approximately 90,000 years ago.",
              "By looking at this genetic trail, Akey and other researchers have been able to piece together a fascinating story of human evolution \u2014 one that is promising to rewrite our understanding of early human origins.",
              "But there\u2019s so much more to discover, Akey said.",
              "\u201cEven though we have sequenced probably 100,000 genomes already, and we have pretty sophisticated tools for looking at that variation, the more we think about how to interpret genetic variation, the more we find these hidden stories in our DNA,\u201d he said.",
              "This article was originally published in the University\u2019s annual research magazine Discovery: Research at Princeton.",
              "A modern pygmy population living on an Indonesian island near a cave with Homo floresiensis fossils appears to have evolved short stature independently.",
              "After sequencing the Neanderthal genome, scientists discovered all modern humans carry some Neanderthal ancestry in their DNA \u2014 including Africans, which was previously not known.",
              "Despite years of research, the genetic factors behind many human diseases and characteristics remain unknown, and has been called the \"missing heritability\" problem.",
              "A new study by Princeton University researchers, however, suggests that heritability in humans may be hidden due only to the limitations of modern research tools, but could be discovered if scientists know where (and how) to look.",
              "Researchers from Princeton University and Uppsala University in Sweden have identified a gene in the Gala\u0301pagos finches studied by English naturalist Charles Darwin that influences beak shape and that played a role in the birds' evolution from a common ancestor more than 1 million years ago.",
              "The study illustrates the genetic foundation of evolution, including how genes can flow from one species to another, and how different versions of a gene within a species can contribute to the formation of entirely new species.",
              "Princeton University scientists have developed a new way to identify the hidden genetic material responsible for complex traits, a breakthrough they believe ultimately could lead to a deeper understanding of how multiple genes interact to produce everything from blue eyes to blood pressure problems. The arrival 36 years ago of a strange bird to a remote island in the Gala\u0301pagos archipelago has provided direct genetic evidence of a novel way in which new species arise.",
              "Alan Mann's sense of wonder about human origins and his bond with all animal species -- living and extinct -- have endeared him to students and colleagues for more than 40 years.",
              "Mann, a physical anthropologist, has focused his research on fossil remains -- mainly teeth -- of australopithecines and Neandertals to understand human growth and development.",
              "Mann also teaches a signature summer course in Bordeaux, France, \"Modern Human Origins,\" which culminates in two weeks of excavation at a site once frequented by Neandertals."

              "Fifteen years ago scientists unearthed a 31,000-year-old site along Russia\u2019s Yana River, well north of the Arctic Circle, with ancient animal bones, ivory and stone tools.",
              "But two tiny, children\u2019s milk teeth are the only human remains recovered from the Ice Age site\u2014and they yielded the only human genome yet known from people who lived in northeastern Siberia during the period before the Last Glacial Maximum.",
              "They represent a previously unrecognized population that the study\u2019s international team of authors have dubbed \u201cAncient North Siberians.",
              "\u201d The authors suggest that during the Last Glacial Maximum (26,500 to 19,000 years ago) some of these 500 or so Siberians sought more habitable climes in southern Beringia.",
              "Stone says the migration illustrates the ways that shifting climate impacted ancient population dynamics.",
              "\u201cI do think that the refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum were important,\u201d she says.",
              "\u201cAs populations moved to refugia, likely following the animals they hunted and to take advantage of the plants they gathered as those distributions shifted south, this resulted in population interactions and changes.",
              "These populations then expanded out of the refugia as the climate warmed and these climate dynamics likely affected population around the world.",
              "\u201d In this case, the Ancient North Siberians arrived in Beringia and likely mixed with migrating peoples from East Asia.",
              "Their population eventually gave rise to both the First Peoples of North America and other lineages that dispersed through Siberia.",
              "David Meltzer, an anthropologist at Southern Methodist University and coauthor of the new study, says when the Yana River site was discovered, the artifacts were said to look like the distinctive stone tools (specifically projectile \u201cpoints\u201d) of the Clovis culture\u2014an early Native American population that lived in present-day New Mexico about 13,000 years ago.",
              "But the observation was greeted with skepticism because Yana was separated from America\u2019s Clovis sites by 18,000 years, many hundreds of miles, and even the glaciers of the last Ice Age.",
              "It seemed more likely that different populations simply made similar stone points in different places and times.",
              "\u201cThe odd thing is, now as it turns out, they were related,\u201d Meltzer says.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool.",
              "It doesn\u2019t change the fact that there\u2019s no direct historical descent in terms of the artifacts, but it does tell us that there was this population floating around in far northern Russia 31,000 years ago whose descendants contributed a bit of DNA to Native Americans.",
              "\u201d The finding isn\u2019t particularly surprising given that at least some Native American ancestors have long been thought to hail from the Siberian region.",
              "But details that seemed unknowable are now coming to light after thousands of years.",
              "For example, the Ancient North Siberian peoples also appear to be ancestral to the Mal\u2019ta individual (dated to 24,000 years ago) from the Lake Baikal region of southern Russia, a population that showed a slice of European roots\u2014and from whom Native Americans, in turn, derived some 40 percent of their ancestry.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s making its way to Native Americans,\u201d Meltzer says of the ancient Yana genome, \u201cbut it\u2019s doing so through various other populations that come and go on the Siberian landscape over the course of the Ice Age.",
              "Every genome that we get right now is telling us a lot of things that we didn\u2019t know because ancient genomes in America and in Siberia from the Ice Age are rare.",
              "\u201d A more modern genome from 10,000-year-old remains found near Siberia\u2019s Kolyma River evidences a DNA mix of East Asian and Ancient North Siberian lineages similar to that seen in Native American populations\u2014a much closer match than any others found outside of North America.",
              "This finding, and others from both studies, serve as reminders that the tale of human admixture and migration in the Arctic wasn\u2019t a one-way street.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing about the Bering land bridge that says you can\u2019t go both ways,\u201d Meltzer says.",
              "\u201cIt was open, relatively flat, no glaciers\u2014it wasn\u2019t like you wander through and the door closes behind you and you\u2019re trapped in America.",
              "So there\u2019s no reason to doubt that the Bering land bridge was trafficking humans in both directions during the Pleistocene.",
              "The idea of going back to Asia is a big deal for us, but they had no clue.",
              "They didn\u2019t think they were going between continents.",

              "With equal amounts of Denisovan and Neanderthal DNA, the specimen seemed to have one parent from each hominin group.",

              "In more than 40% of cases, one of the DNA fragments matched the Neanderthal genome, whereas the other matched that of a Denisovan, suggesting that she had acquired one set of chromosomes from a Neanderthal and the other from a Denisovan.",

              "This raises another interesting question: if Neanderthals and Denisovans mated frequently, why did the two hominin populations remain genetically distinct for several hundred-thousand years?",
              "Harris suggests that Neanderthal\u2013Denisovan offspring could have been infertile or otherwise biologically unfit, preventing the two species from merging.",
              "Neanderthal-Denisovan pairings could also have had some advantages, even if there were other costs, says Chris Stringer, a palaeoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London.",
              "Neanderthals and Denisovans were less genetically diverse than modern humans, and so interbreeding might have provided a way of \u201ctopping up\u201d their genomes with a bit of extra genetic variation, he says.",
              "The study also raises questions over how matings between different human groups happened, says Stringer \u2014 for example, whether or not they were consensual.",
              "A more detailed account of the gene flow between Neanderthals and Denisovans in the future might offer hints into ancient human behaviour.",
              "Pa\u0308a\u0308bo agrees that Neanderthals and Denisovans would have readily bred with each other when they met - but he thinks that those encounters were rare.",
              "Most Neanderthal remains have been found across western Eurasia, whereas Denisovans have so far been discovered only in their eponymous Siberian cave.",
              "Although the two groups\u2019 home turf overlapped in the Altai Mountains and possibly elsewhere, these areas would have been sparsely populated.",
              "\u201cI think any Neanderthal that lived west of the Urals would never ever meet a Denisovan in their life,\u201d Pa\u0308a\u0308bo says, referring to the mountain range that slices through western Russia and Kazakhstan.",
              "Denny's remains were discovered in Denisova Cave in southern Siberia.",
              "Credit: Bence Viola/Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology But sometimes, Neanderthal populations might have travelled from western Eurasia to Siberia, or vice-versa.",
              "On the basis of the variation in the specimen\u2019s genome, the team deduced that Denny\u2019s Neanderthal mother was more closely related to a Neanderthal specimen found thousands of kilometres away, in Croatia, than to another found less than 1 metre away in the same cave.",
              "Neanderthals built cave structures \u2014 and no one knows why Neanderthals built cave structures \u2014 and no one knows why The Croatian Neanderthal died \ufeffdied much more recently than Denny \u2014 about 55,000 years ago \u2014 while the Neanderthal from Denisova Cave is around 120,000 years old.",
              "That leaves two possibilities to explain the ancestry of Denny's mother: either a population of European Neanderthals came east to the Altai Mountains and partly replaced the region\u2019s Neanderthals before the hybrid was born, or a group of Neanderthals could have left the Altai Mountains for Europe sometime after Denny\u2019s birth.",
              "Either way, says Harris, Neanderthals \u201cdidn\u2019t just stay in one place for thousands of years\u201d.",

              "The term implies that the two groups are discrete species of human, whereas in reality the boundaries between them are blurry \u2014 as the new study shows.",
              "Defining a species in the natural world is not always clear-cut, says Harris, and it\u2019s interesting to see long-running debates about how to categorize organisms start to be applied to humans.",

              "By analyzing current-day genetic data, we can look back into human history.",
              "The \u201cadmixing\u201d happened more than 50,000 years ago, as modern humans moved out of Africa and likely crossed paths with both Neanderthals and Denisovans.",
              "But pinning down exactly where it happened has proven difficult \u2013 particularly in the case of Denisovans.",
              "It\u2019s especially puzzling that the only Denisovan fossils were found in Siberia (with the potential exception of a jaw bone on the Tibetan plateau).",

              "Meet 'dragon man,' the latest addition to the human family tree \u201cThe fact that Ayta Magbukon have the highest amount of Denisovan ancestry of anywhere in the world is unexpected, and I am intrigued, as previous studies did not report such high amounts in other Philippines populations,\u201d said Joa\u0303o Teixeira, a visiting fellow at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at The University of Adelaide.",
              "He was not involved in the study.",

              "The study was published in the journal Current Biology on Thursday.",
              "The study found that the Ayta Magbukon had around 5% Denisovan ancestry, more than Aboriginal Australians and Papuans, whom previous research found to have around 4%, said Mattias Jakobsson, a geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden and an author of the study.",

              "It also suggests that different Denisovan populations mixed and intermingled with Homo sapiens in multiple locations and various points in time.",
              "\u201cIf the results are accurate, then human colonizations of the Philippines and surrounding regions were even more complex than we thought up to now,\u201d said Chris Stringer, a professor and research leader in Human Origins at The Natural History Museum in London.",

              "\u201cRelatively small groups of early modern humans interbred with Neanderthals in western Eurasia and then spread across Eurasia and beyond, passing on that level of acquired Neanderthal DNA to descendant populations,\u201d he said.",
              "\u201cIn the case of the Denisovans, it looks like they were genetically much more diverse, and they intermixed separately in different locations with differentiating early modern populations, hence the more varied patterns we see today.",

              "Beringia had formed by about 34,000 years ago, and the first mammoth-hunting humans crossed it more than 15,000 years ago and perhaps far earlier.",

              "Descendants of this ancient population include the Yup\u2019ik, Inuit, Aleuts and Na-Dene language speakers from Alaska and Northern Canada all the way to the Southwest United States.",
              "The findings stand in contrast to other genetic studies that had suggested the Paleo-Eskimos were an isolated people who vanished after some 4,000 years.",

              "Fifteen years ago scientists unearthed a 31,000-year-old site along Russia\u2019s Yana River, well north of the Arctic Circle, with ancient animal bones, ivory and stone tools.",
              "But two tiny, children\u2019s milk teeth are the only human remains recovered from the Ice Age site\u2014and they yielded the only human genome yet known from people who lived in northeastern Siberia during the period before the Last Glacial Maximum.",
              "They represent a previously unrecognized population that the study\u2019s international team of authors have dubbed \u201cAncient North Siberians.",
              "\u201d The authors suggest that during the Last Glacial Maximum (26,500 to 19,000 years ago) some of these 500 or so Siberians sought more habitable climes in southern Beringia.",
              "Stone says the migration illustrates the ways that shifting climate impacted ancient population dynamics.",
              "\u201cI do think that the refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum were important,\u201d she says.",
              "\u201cAs populations moved to refugia, likely following the animals they hunted and to take advantage of the plants they gathered as those distributions shifted south, this resulted in population interactions and changes.",
              "These populations then expanded out of the refugia as the climate warmed and these climate dynamics likely affected population around the world.",
              "\u201d In this case, the Ancient North Siberians arrived in Beringia and likely mixed with migrating peoples from East Asia.",
              "Their population eventually gave rise to both the First Peoples of North America and other lineages that dispersed through Siberia.",
              "David Meltzer, an anthropologist at Southern Methodist University and coauthor of the new study, says when the Yana River site was discovered, the artifacts were said to look like the distinctive stone tools (specifically projectile \u201cpoints\u201d) of the Clovis culture\u2014an early Native American population that lived in present-day New Mexico about 13,000 years ago.",
              "But the observation was greeted with skepticism because Yana was separated from America\u2019s Clovis sites by 18,000 years, many hundreds of miles, and even the glaciers of the last Ice Age.",
              "It seemed more likely that different populations simply made similar stone points in different places and times.",
              "\u201cThe odd thing is, now as it turns out, they were related,\u201d Meltzer says.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool.",
              "It doesn\u2019t change the fact that there\u2019s no direct historical descent in terms of the artifacts, but it does tell us that there was this population floating around in far northern Russia 31,000 years ago whose descendants contributed a bit of DNA to Native Americans.",
              "\u201d The finding isn\u2019t particularly surprising given that at least some Native American ancestors have long been thought to hail from the Siberian region.",
              "But details that seemed unknowable are now coming to light after thousands of years.",
              "For example, the Ancient North Siberian peoples also appear to be ancestral to the Mal\u2019ta individual (dated to 24,000 years ago) from the Lake Baikal region of southern Russia, a population that showed a slice of European roots\u2014and from whom Native Americans, in turn, derived some 40 percent of their ancestry.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s making its way to Native Americans,\u201d Meltzer says of the ancient Yana genome, \u201cbut it\u2019s doing so through various other populations that come and go on the Siberian landscape over the course of the Ice Age.",
              "Every genome that we get right now is telling us a lot of things that we didn\u2019t know because ancient genomes in America and in Siberia from the Ice Age are rare.",
              "\u201d A more modern genome from 10,000-year-old remains found near Siberia\u2019s Kolyma River evidences a DNA mix of East Asian and Ancient North Siberian lineages similar to that seen in Native American populations\u2014a much closer match than any others found outside of North America.",
              "This finding, and others from both studies, serve as reminders that the tale of human admixture and migration in the Arctic wasn\u2019t a one-way street.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing about the Bering land bridge that says you can\u2019t go both ways,\u201d Meltzer says.",
              "\u201cIt was open, relatively flat, no glaciers\u2014it wasn\u2019t like you wander through and the door closes behind you and you\u2019re trapped in America.",
              "So there\u2019s no reason to doubt that the Bering land bridge was trafficking humans in both directions during the Pleistocene.",

              "As an independent assessment of the PPE admixture cline model, we identified rare genetic variants in a large dataset of present-day full genomes outside of America and counted how often a given American genome shared those alleles.",

              "The consistently higher PPE proportion in ancient compared to present-day Athabaskans obtained here, in the qpAdm analysis and further analyses below suggests that ongoing bidirectional genetic exchange with neighboring Northern First Peoples has been reducing the PPE ancestry in Na-Dene.",
              "Rare allele sharing also shows that present-day Yup\u2019ik and Inuit genomes are inconsistent with this two-way admixture model, but instead exhibit higher allele sharing with C-K, consistent with the qpWave/qpAdm analysis above and our explicit demographic model below.",

              "A key feature in our best-fitting model is bidirectional gene flow between C-K and Neo-Eskimo populations, but not affecting Aleuts, consistent with the qpWave and rare allele sharing analyses.",
              "We further investigated the population history of the Aleuts by co-analyzing Paleo- and Neo-Aleuts, which we find are consistent with one homogenous population according to PCA (Fig.",

              "We then find that interactions with Northern First Peoples around 4,400\u20134,900 ya (consistent with estimates from ALDER, Supplementary Information section 12) led to this group contributing 55\u201362% genetic ancestry to ancestors of Eskimo-Aleut populations.",

              "While the full extent of sharing genetic risk factors for disease among populations is unclear, consistency (similar direction and effect size) and reproducibility of GWAS association signals across different populations can provide broad insights into the sharing of risk loci.",
              "Many loci discovered by GWAS are shared across diverse populations and may be readily reproducible or transferable among populations.",
              "For example, a multi-ethnic case\u2013control study, which included 6,142 cases and 7,403 controls, analysed 19 common genetic risk markers validated for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in European populations.",
              "This study showed broadly consistent direction of effects across ethnic groups, with the majority of these variants nominally significant in their association with diabetes risk across ethnic groups19.",
              "Analyses of 16,235 multi-ethnic diabetes cases and 46,122 controls from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) consortium recapitulated these findings, showing broad consistency in the direction of effect across different ethnic groups20.",
              "The DIAGRAM study, which included 26,488 cases of T2DM and 83,964 controls, corroborated these findings, showing statistically significant enrichment for directionally consistent effects across multiple ethnic populations21 and high correlation of effect estimates across populations.",
              "Where studies have shown poorer reproducibility across populations, differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) have been found to explain why many associations do not replicate directly across populations18.",
              "This phenomenon can occur when different observed variants tag the same causal variant in different populations, which can lead to the appearance of non-reproducibility when examining the variant (rather than locus).",
              "Limited reproducibility for traits can also reflect other factors, including false association signals in discovery studies (or false-negatives in other, less-powered studies), sparse data among diverse ethnic populations, differences in allele frequency, heterogeneity of effect due to gene\u2013gene or gene\u2013environment interactions, or allelic heterogeneity.",
              "Understanding the impact of these factors on reproducibility, and on susceptibility to disease, will require a comprehensive understanding of genetic diversity among populations, as well as large-scale and well-powered studies undertaken among genetically diverse populations.",

              "Where genetic risk factors differ among populations (for example, in the case of population-specific variants or because of gene\u2013gene or gene\u2013environment interactions), studying diverse populations can help understand differences in susceptibility, which may not be apparent in studies of more homogeneous populations.",
              "Genetic diversity varies globally among populations.",
              "Genetic variation in populations arises from new mutations occurring in each generation, random changes in allele frequencies due to genetic drift and non-random changes in allele frequencies owing to differences in fitness levels conferred by different alleles in the presence of certain environments (selection).",
              "The relative contribution and impact of the above factors on genetic variation in a population over time can depend on the demographic history of populations.",
              "For example, a population bottleneck (that is, lower effective population size) can lead to rapid changes in allele frequencies of background variation as a result of increased genetic drift acting on the population (Fig.",

              "Similarly, migration can expose the human genome to different environments, leading to adaptive changes and regional differentiation that can differentially influence genetic disease risk.",

              "Here, the term \u2018genetic diversity\u2019 refers to structural differences (genetic variation and differences in allele frequency), differences in genetic effects on traits (heterogeneity of effect) as well as epigenetic differences among populations.",
              "Differentiation in allele frequencies following divergence between African populations and populations that migrated out of Africa has been shaped by a combination of random drift and selection due to adaptive forces.",
              "Population bottlenecks, as undergone by modern non-African populations during out-of-Africa migrations, increase the impact of random drift, leading to genetic variants more rapidly drifting up or down in frequencies, relative to the ancestral population.",
              "This substantial genetic drift has resulted in non-African populations exhibiting allele frequencies with greater divergence (on average) from Africans23.",
              "This model of population demography is recapitulated by several studies of GWAS associations, which have shown marked heterogeneity in allele frequencies of risk variants for diseases among populations24,25.",
              "Differences in allele frequencies among populations have also been shaped by adaptive forces.",
              "An example of this is the sickle cell variant, which has increased to fairly high frequencies in malaria-endemic regions within Africa, while being rare or absent in other populations in non-endemic regions26.",
              "The presence of this allele is protective against severe malaria and thus confers a survival advantage.",
              "More recently, it has become clear that the global population history is far more elaborate than previously thought, with analyses of ancient DNA revealing complex migrations and replacement of populations in different regions27,28,29,30.",
              "Furthermore, European and Asian populations have come into contact with archaic populations (Neanderthal and Denisovan), with interbreeding resulting in small introgressed genomic segments evident in modern humans in these regions31,32.",
              "Similarly, there is evidence to suggest contact with archaic or basal populations (a lineage that split even earlier than the oldest known modern African lineage) among Africans30,33,34.",
              "These introgressed genomic regions among different ancestral groups have provided important insights about historical adaptation and selection events that resulted in segments of archaic ancestry persisting in modern humans, potentially because they afford a survival advantage in certain environments31,35,36.",
              "Understanding these differences in allele frequencies of variants among populations is important, as this can influence our ability to identify GWAS association signals (Fig.",
              "2).",
              "Because the power to detect associations is generally greater for common variation in a given population, most risk alleles identified to date have relatively high MAFs among European populations, having been discovered in European GWAS23,37.",
              "As a result, risk alleles in current GWAS databases are likely enriched for variants common among Europeans and depleted for variants that are rare among Europeans23.",
              "In this context, studying more diverse populations would provide opportunities for identification of new associations of variants with disease, as these studies would be better powered to detect disease associations of variants that are common in these populations but rare in other populations23.",
              "An example of associations that have been identified in a non-European population on the basis of higher allele frequencies in these populations includes variants in the gene KCNQ1 and T2DM38;",
              "the SNPs rs2237897 and rs2237892 in the KCNQ1 gene, which have been associated with T2DM in the Japanese population, have a much higher MAF in South East Asia (0.",

              "Identifying these associations in European populations would have required much larger sample sizes given the lower frequency of these variants, as has been discussed previously38.",
              "Nevertheless, it is important to recognize the trade-off between opportunities for novel discovery and loss of power that may occur due to heterogeneity of genetic structure or allele frequencies among populations in multi-ethnic studies.",
              "Heterogeneity in allele frequencies is likely to increase power in multi-ethnic studies in the context of genetic variants that are rare or absent in one population but more common in other ethnic groups, providing novel opportunities for discovery that would not exist if only the former population was sampled41.",
              "However, heterogeneity with regard to allele frequencies and population structure (differences in LD) can also reduce power in the context of common and shared genetic variation, where associations with traits are detected with higher statistical resolution in more homogeneous populations.",
              "For example, a simulation study showed that including an additional 10,000 individuals from an African population in a GWAS of 10,000 individuals from a European population substantially improved power to detect associations for variants that were of low frequency in Europeans, relative to conducting a GWAS of all 20,000 individuals from a population of European ancestry;",

              "In many cases, genetic variants impact phenotypes that contribute to disease pathology.",
              "Historically, family studies have been used to measure the contribution of genetics to a particular trait through studies comparing disease risk in monozygotic twins (100% shared genetic identity), dizygotic twins (50% shared genetic identity), and siblings (also 50% shared genetic identity) [10].",
              "Significant differences between monozygotic and dizygotic disease concordance establish strong genetic heritability.",
              "For example, three independent twin studies have identified a monozygotic twin concordance for Crohn\u2019s disease of ~50% compared to ~3\u20134% disease concordance in dizygotic twins [11\u201313].",
              "The difference in concordance of monozygotic and dizygotic twins also highlights the possible role of epistatic risk factors that require interactions between multiple genetic variants to increase disease risk [14].",
              "The over ten-fold increase in Crohn\u2019s disease concordance in siblings with identical DNA sequence compared to siblings sharing 50% genetic identity indicates a large genetic component to disease risk.",
              "Diseases with a genetic component can be monogenic (i.",
              "e., caused by a single rare mutation), complex (i.",
              "e., caused by the cumulative effect of multiple genetic events and/or the environment), or both.",
              "For example, cystic fibrosis is a monogenic condition caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene [15, 16], with additional genetic variants impacting disease presentation and severity [17].",
              "However, many \u201ccausal\u201d disease mutations are incompletely penetrant, with some individuals carrying the mutation expressing various degrees of symptoms and some individuals not expressing the disease at all [18].",
              "For example, only 10\u201330% of people with damaging mutations in the gene encoding complement component 2 (C2) develop systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) [19].",

              "e., allele frequencies greater than 1%) contributing to disease risk in an additive manner [20].",
              "Indeed, most patients with lupus do not have monogenetic disease [21], with the most common form of monogenic lupus (mutations in the TREX1 gene) contributing to only 0.",
              "5 to 2% of adult lupus cases [22].",
              "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as the predominant tool for the systematic, genome-wide identification of disease-associated genetic risk variants.",

              "While such studies are helpful for identifying disease risk loci for further functional analysis, they have shortcomings.",
              "First, study participant environments are not standardized, and thus, potential environmental effects are not well controlled.",
              "Second, only a small fraction of the variants identified in a given GWAS are causal, due to linkage disequilibrium;",
              "specifically, the particular variant(s) directly studied (\u201ctagged\u201d) in the GWAS may simply be in strong linkage disequilibrium with the variant that is functionally influencing the phenotype [25].",
              "Finally, GWAS to date have focused disproportionately (>78%) on individuals of European descent [26].",
              "Additional studies focused on nonwhite populations are thus needed to obtain a clearer picture of the disease spectrum across ancestries [27, 28].",
              "Despite these limitations, the increasing availability of GWAS data has enabled researchers to pursue novel hypotheses and design targeted studies to further investigate functional roles between a particular variant and its associated phenotype.",

              "For example, the identification of loss-of-function nonsynonymous coding genetic variants within the filaggrin (FLG) gene in ~10% of atopic dermatitis patients [29] led to further studies revealing the role of FLG in the development of a healthy epidermis [30, 31] and atopic dermatitis pathogenesis [32].",
              "In particular, studies in cells from patients with FLG mutations and in mice lacking a functional FLG helped shape the current hypothesis that defects in the skin barrier lead to allergic sensitization and the progression of atopic dermatis in infancy toward asthma and allergic disease in later childhood, commonly known as the atopic march [33].",

              "Their work is published in Science1.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see that you can end up with a whole pile of ancient-human DNA from just dirt,\u201d says Michael Bunce, an evolutionary biologist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia.",
              "Slon and Meyer are not the first to decode ancient dirt.",
              "Palaeogeneticist Eske Willerslev of the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen pioneered the approach in 2003, to find out about the plants and animals that populated prehistoric environments2,3.",
              "Using the technique, he and his team revealed that Greenland was once richly forested4.",
              "But Slon and Meyer are the first to use the technique on hominin DNA.",
              "Dirt detectives Isolating the genetic material of ancient peoples from dirt isn't easy.",
              "The DNA is exceedingly rare in the soil compared with that from plants, animals, fungi and microbes.",
              "It is also easy to mix it up with DNA from human excavators, for instance.",
              "To improve the odds, Slon and Meyer\u2019s team collected sediments from sites at which tools or the remains of Neanderthals or Denisovans had previously been found.",
              "They looked at seven caves, including two in southern Siberia.",
              "The team analysed the sediment samples with techniques that \u2018fish out\u2019 mammalian mitochondrial DNA, which is more abundant in cells than the DNA in the nucleus.",
              "To make sure that they weren\u2019t looking at modern genetic material, the researchers analysed only the short sequences with chemical damage typical of ancient DNA.",
              "The team recovered nine ancient-hominin mitochondrial genomes of varying completeness, from four of the sites.",
              "Neanderthal DNA was present in all four caves.",
              "Sequences of Denisovans, however, turned up only in a chamber of the southern Siberian cave where remains of the enigmatic group were first identified.",
              "But when?",
              "Determining when these individuals lived is tricky.",
              "DNA attached to dirt can be picked up by water, then seep through the soil of archaeological sites and end up in a geological layer containing much older material \u2014 potentially confounding efforts to date it.",
              "So the researchers tried to demonstrate that the DNA they recovered hadn't been displaced into older layers.",
              "In Siberia's Chagyrskaya Cave, the researchers found abundant animal DNA in geological layers that contained animal bones and stone tools and none in older layers that lacked any sign of human or animal presence.",
              "That means it's likely that hominin DNA didn't move through layers either, they suggest.",
              "But Robin Allaby, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Warwick in Coventry, UK, isn\u2019t convinced.",
              "He thinks that the large amount of DNA recovered from some sites is evidence that lots of different material might have mixed and settled in a particular layer.",
              "\u201cYou can identify the hominins, but dating them becomes a bit of an issue,\u201d he says.",
              "The exact source of the DNA is also unclear.",
              "Bodily fluids, faecal matter, hair and bone are all possibilities, says Slon.",
              "Whatever the source, the discovery of hominin DNA in soil should mean that the many archaeological sites that show signs of hominin habitation but lack obvious remains can now be probed genetically.",
              "For example, Slon\u2019s team identified Neanderthal DNA in soil from the Trou Al\u2019Wesse cave in Belgium, where archaeologists have found tools probably made by Neanderthals, but have never recovered bones.",
              "Underwater settlements Researchers have high hopes for dirt DNA.",
              "Allaby\u2019s team is sequencing sea-floor sediments off the coast of England, in search of suspected ancient settlements that might now be submerged.",
              "Cool, constant ocean temperatures are ideal for preserving DNA, and Allaby thinks genetic material found under water could reveal details of human migrations out of Africa and into Australasia and the Americas.",
              "Mikkel Winther Pedersen, a molecular palaeoecologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, and his colleagues last year decoded animal DNA from the soil of archaeological sites in Greenland, documenting bowhead whale hunting 4,000 years ago5.",
              "Pedersen hopes the latest study will change how field archaeologists excavate sites.",
