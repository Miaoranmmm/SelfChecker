    "response": "Sure, I can explain the science behind how vaccines work and how they are able to provide immunity against infectious diseases. Vaccines are a way of training your immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens (disease-causing organisms) such as viruses and bacteria[^1^] [^2^]. \n\nYour immune system has different types of white blood cells that help protect you from infections. Some of these cells, called macrophages, can swallow up and digest germs, leaving behind parts of them called antigens[^1^]. Antigens are like flags that signal your body that there is a foreign invader. Another type of white blood cells, called B-lymphocytes, can produce antibodies to fight off the antigens[^1^]. Antibodies are like soldiers that bind to the antigens and neutralize them. A third type of white blood cells, called T-lymphocytes, can recognize familiar antigens and help activate the B-lymphocytes to produce more antibodies[^1^].\n\nThe first time your body encounters a new pathogen, it takes some time for your immune system to make enough antibodies to fight it off. During this time, you may get sick from the infection. However, your immune system also creates memory cells that remember how to make the specific antibodies for that pathogen[^1^] [^2^]. If you encounter the same pathogen again in the future, your memory cells can quickly produce the right antibodies and prevent you from getting sick or reduce the severity of the illness[^1^] [^2^].\n\nVaccines work by imitating an infection with a weakened or inactive version of a pathogen or its antigens[^1^] [^2^]. This triggers your immune system to produce antibodies and memory cells without making you sick. This way, if you are exposed to the real pathogen later on, your immune system is ready to fight it off quickly and effectively[^1^] [^2^]. Vaccines can also protect other people around you by reducing the spread of infectious diseases[^2^].\n\nThere are different types of vaccines that use different methods to introduce the antigens to your body. Some vaccines use live but weakened versions of the pathogen, such as measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and chickenpox vaccines[^1^]. Some vaccines use killed or inactivated versions of the pathogen, such as polio and hepatitis A vaccines[^1^]. Some vaccines use only parts of the pathogen, such as protein or sugar molecules, such as pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines[^1^]. Some vaccines use genetic material that instructs your own cells to make the antigens, such as mRNA COVID-19 vaccines[^2^].\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand how vaccines work and how they are able to provide immunity against infectious diseases.",

              "A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that can cause disease within the body.",
              "Each pathogen is made up of several subparts, usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes.",
              "The subpart of a pathogen that causes the formation of antibodies is called an antigen.",
              "The antibodies produced in response to the pathogen\u2019s antigen are an important part of the immune system.",

              "We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies.",

              "In the meantime, the person is susceptible to becoming ill.",

              "If the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen.",
              "This means that if the person is exposed to the dangerous pathogen in the future, their immune system will be able to respond immediately, protecting against disease.",

              "The survival of the two cell populations is an independent process, LLPC may persist after elimination of peripheral B cells and are not sequentially replaced from the memory B cell pool [24].",
              "The adoptive transfer of any of these populations generates protection in the host upon reinfection [25].",
              "As most pathogens carry both protein and nonprotein epitopes, memory cells and LLPCs can be produced in three parallel ways: in a T-independent manner, and in a T-dependent manner either outside B-cell follicles or in the GCs of B-cell follicles.",
              "Theoretically, the B-cell response consists of successive stages: B1 cell-mediated innate immunity, marginal zone (MZ) B cells, extrafollicular and intrafollicular B cells, sequentially from lower affinity to higher affinity and faster to slower response.",
              "While these events are anatomically and functionally different, all of these cell types may contribute to both the production of antibodies and the formation of memory B cells.",
              "All of these effects can be considered during vaccination, it is presumably rational to find a balance between the induction of shorter and less focused responses versus long-lasting and sharply defined responses, taking into consideration the properties of the pathogen, of the host and also the epidemiology.",

              "However, the function and survival of these classical B cells may be deterministically more dependent on T cell help.",
              "It is known that T-cell-derived signals, such as CD40 activation or IL-21 production are generally required for class switching, somatic hypermutation (SHM), and enhancement of B-cell proliferation.",

              "Development of MZ B cells does not occur under 2 years of age.",
              "Polysaccharide-based vaccines have had limited use in newborns and because the response of MZ B cells is primarily spleen-specific it was also missing in spleen-deficient individuals [37], until the introduction of conjugate vaccines that circumvent T cell incompetence against saccharide antigens.",

              "Accordingly, T-dependent B cell activation occurs by two main mechanisms. The principal purpose of extrafollicular B cell activation is to generate a rapid response to eliminate the current pathogens, while intrafollicular, GC-related B cell responses primarily serve for long-term protection [45,46,47,48].",
              "The first phase of T and B cell interaction begins at the junction of the T cell-zone and B cell follicles, where the activated B cells present the specific antigen to the T cells already activated by dendritic cells (DCs) [47].",

              "The first line of defense provided by memory T cells is the immediate action towards the removal of target cells.",
              "This is brought about by cells that are continuously looking for targets and can instantly release cytokines or induce cell death: tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) (systematically reviewed [95,96]), and the somewhat later acting effector memory T cells (TEM).",
              "TRM, unlike circulating memory cells, remains localized in peripheral tissues defined by the previous infections, by downregulating tissue egress receptors [97] and expressing tissue specific adhesion molecules [98].",

              "It can be hypothesized that the main function of TRM is not to eliminate pathogens directly, but this accelerated antigen detection can facilitate the recruitment of circulating TEM and TCM cells by the induced cytokine production.",
              "Killing some infected cells may also accelerate cross-presentation by producing dead cells for DC-mediated phagocytosis, facilitating the antigen presentation of intracellular pathogens by DCs [96,103].",

              "These cells may also be reactive even after infection with newly emerging, antigen-shifted virus strains as was highlighted for example in influenza epidemics [127].",
              "T cell-related reactions, in parallel with or in combination with ADE, may contribute to vaccine-associated disease enhancement (VADE).",
              "Live vaccines such as dengue, RSV vaccines, or vaccines against coronaviruses may also increase susceptibility to viral infection by a mechanism that has not yet been fully elucidated.",
              "Vaccine-induced altered cytokine profile, inflammatory damage, TH2 activation, and subsequent eosinophil infiltration can be responsible for aberrant viral pathogenesis [128,129].",
              "The development of the immune system starts already in utero, but it is after birth that exposure to the abundance of environmental antigens and danger signals initiates immunological memory formation.",
              "This cumulative phase of memory corresponds to the diversification and tuning of immune responses and goes on until early adulthood.",
              "Following decades of maintenance of immune function in general, memory efficacy and diversity start to wane, typically at the age of 65\u201370 years.",
              "Due to the distinct characteristics of early and late years of life, we briefly summarize the critical changes that characterize the immune memory response in neonates and in the elderly (Figure 2).",
              "Changes of elements of memory response during life.",
              "Early in life the maternal immune memory provides protection by IgG and IgA transport and transfer.",
              "Memory cell levels are very low in neonates and only reach the intensity typical of adults around the age of 10\u201315 years.",
              "Weaker antigen receptor and costimulatory signals in the first years of life favor the development of anticipatory rather than effector memory.",
              "Memory efficacy and diversity start to wane, typically at the age of 65\u201370 years.",
              "After this age, the elderly respond poorly to new infections and memory response is also limited.",
              "The restricted repertoire of antigen specific cells primarily limits protection to recurrent infections.",
              "Immune maturation continues into adolescence, but the most significant changes occur in the first years of life.",
              "The immune system of newborns is typically tolerogenic, which influences memory cell formation and vaccination at several points.",
              "Basically, the number of lymphocytes at birth is high [130], but with unique characteristics in functionality in neonates.",
              "As there is no pathogenicity in the uterus, memory cell levels are very low and remain limited for years [131].",
              "Maternal immunological experience is transferred to a newborn by two means.",
              "IgG transfer from the mother to the fetus occurs during pregnancy across the placenta, while IgA is transferred to the neonatal gastrointestinal tract by breastfeeding.",
              "These antibodies not only protect but also direct the developing immune system towards target molecules, and are therefore expected to have a strong impact on the establishment of immunological memory of the offspring [132].",
              "Humoral immunity is impaired in neonates.",
              "Although B-cell levels are high at birth [130] and the repertoire is quite diverse, most of the cells are still immature B cells (approximately 95% of the B cells) that only slowly transform into peripheral mature B cells [133] and do not reach the adult level till childhood (5\u201310 years).",
              "Isotype switched and memory B cells are very rare in newborns and at 1 year of age, infant IgG levels are 70%, while IgA levels are even lower, only 30% of the adults [133].",
              "The T-independent B cell response is severely limited, among other things, because the peripheral zone of the spleen is not fully developed by the age of 2 years and the level of CD21 receptor (complement receptor 2) on B cells is reduced [133,134].",
              "Germinal center reactions, which are critical for the long-term memory response, are highly compromised.",
              "Weaker B cell receptor-mediated signaling in naive B cells, incomplete help provided by follicular dendritic cells, and limited expansion of TFH cells together result in suboptimal B cell activation in GCs [135,136].",
              "The number of memory B cells increases slowly with age and reaches adult levels only in children aged 10\u201315 years [137].",
              "Thus, higher sensitivity of memory cells, i.",
              "e., higher affinity of memory B cells or lower dependence on costimulation of memory T cells, cannot be exploited in neonate vaccination.",
              "Weaker BCR and TCR dependent signaling results in the dominance of memory B cells formation versus plasma cells and insufficient survival factors available LLPC further exacerbate this phenomenon [135].",
              "At birth, the number of T cells is high and increases steadily for years, and then begins to decline until it reaches adult levels in older childhood [130].",
              "Although the T cell number is high, their function is inadequate.",
              "The functional activity of neonatal APCs is impaired, and lower expression of costimulatory molecules complicates the activation of naive T cells, rather enhances the possibility of an anergic T cell response [138].",
              "In addition, functional exhaustion is also characteristic of neonatal effector T cells [139].",
              "In neonates CD8 + T cells are less responsive and require a greater degree of antigen specific stimuli [140].",
              "In contrast, the activity of regulatory T cells is upregulated.",
              "These cells are present in large amounts in human cord blood and are highly tolerogenic in their function [141,142,143].",
              "This overall decrease in antigen-specific response complicates the formation of both memory B cells and memory T cells.",
              "Not only does the strength of the T cell response decrease, but the balance of the response is also strongly skewed toward Th2 polarization [144].",
              "Overall reduced IFN and IL-12 production leads to decreased TH1 differentiation, highlighting the importance of using adjuvants capable of regulating T cell polarization during vaccination [131].",
              "Newborns are highly vulnerable to infectious diseases.",
              "It is therefore important to develop the most effective and safest vaccines possible for them.",
              "The highly tolerogenic immune system, decreased strength of antigen receptor signaling, lack of pre-existing memory cells, severely impaired GC function, TH imbalance, and the presence of the maternal neutralizing antibody all counteract successful vaccination.",
              "The need for early intervention and the suboptimal circumstances for vaccination require thoughtful strategies [145].",
              "Nonetheless, some vaccines are already suitable for newborns, and some, moreover, are the most effective in this age.",
              "An example is the BCG vaccine, which is one of the first and most widely used vaccines [146].",
              "BCG does not need to contain any exogenous adjuvants because the live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis induces immune responses via many PRRs [147].",
              "BCG induces a strong TH1 response demonstrating that decreased TH1 capacity in neonates is not absolute [148].",
              "There is growing evidence that BCG perhaps induces maturation of dendritic cells, affects TH cytokine balance and influences the heterologous trained immunity [10].",
              "Many studies suggest that early immunization with BCG may protect against, inter alia, leukemia, allergies, and childhood diabetes and that BCG elevates cytokine and antibody responses to other vaccine antigens (HBV and OPV) in neonates [149,150,151].",
              "The BCG vaccine is not only an example of a vaccine that can function under the tolerogenic conditions, typically present in newborns, but also of vaccines that can direct the maturation of the immune system.",
              "A special challenge in the vaccination of newborns is the prevention of the transmission of pathogens from mother to infant [152].",
              "The HBV vaccine induces at least as much antibody production in neonates as in adults and gives a lifetime protection after a minimum of three doses.",
              "The HBV vaccine represents that subunit vaccines with adjuvant (aluminum salts) can effectively function in newborns while oral polio vaccine demonstrates active intestinal immune response and the potential success of mucosal vaccination [145].",
              "Extending maternal immunization, which has already been successful with various vaccines among others tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis, influenza, hepatitis B, could be a promising strategy to solve the problem of early infections [153].",
              "The special characteristic of newborn immunity has to be considered in vaccination, for example in T-cell independent B-cell response to polysaccharide antigens.",
              "The delay in the development of the peripheral zone of the spleen, decreased CD21 receptor levels on B cells, lower complement activity [154], unbalanced cytokine profile [155], and increased susceptibility to tolerance induction in neonates may also play a role in suboptimal reactions to encapsulated bacteria [154,155].",
              "These mechanisms can be circumvented with conjugate vaccines that switch the reactions to T-dependent response.",
              "Experience with these existing vaccines suggests that in spite of the restricted memory response neonates are able to develop efficient immune response, especially to live attenuated vaccines, but these immune responses depend on several factors, such as maternal Ab at the time of administration, breastfeeding, timing of postpartum vaccination, and geographical location [133].",
              "The adaptive immune system undergoes numerous alterations with age and the last stage of life is characterized by relevant changes in the immune response.",
              "When the first exposure to an antigen occurs at an older age, a less effective immune response is induced.",
              "As a result, a weaker memory response is generated to new antigens and the success of vaccination is reduced in elderly.",
              "Long-lived memory cells (both T and B cells) do not just persist, but even protect the elderly, however, the diversity of the repertoire of memory cells narrows and their responsiveness also deteriorates [122,156,157,158,159,160].",
              "In the bone marrow, the production of B cells decreases as internal changes appear that preclude commitment to the lymphoid line, IL-7 survival factor production decreases, the proliferation rate regresses and apoptotic capacity increases [161].",
              "The number of naive B cells in the periphery is also declining in older adults [162].",
              "In addition to the decrease in number, the function of aging B cells is also impaired.",
              "Antigen-induced plasma cell differentiation and antigen-specific antibody production are reduced [163,164], although total levels of serum antibodies are rather increased in the elderly [165].",
              "Internal defects in germinal centers, including decreased AID production studied in mice, have been identified, resulting in impaired mechanisms of both class-switching recombination CSR and SHM [166,167].",
              "All of these processes limit the way memory B cells and LLPC are formed.",
              "As these changes have a lesser effect on TI B cells, the decrease in TI responses with age is less severe than that of TD responses [44].",
              "B memory cells accumulate in the periphery and the population of B cells in the periphery is saturated with memory B-cells over time.",
              "However, even in the presence of increased autoantibody levels, these memory B cells have limited repertoire diversity and exhibit paralyzed functions.",
              "A part of memory B cells differentiate to exhausted memory cells with poor ability to replicate and likely prone to apoptosis [168].",
              "Reduced function of TFH cells, decreased production of AID and impaired immune-complex retention of FDC compromise memory B cell functions [41,122] and consequently limits optimal plasma cell formation [165].",
              "Further exacerbating the problem, the imperfect bone marrow environment is less conducive to LLPC survival [169], accordingly, BM stores fewer plasma cells at old age [163].",
              "While the number of circulating T cells remains almost the same throughout life, there are decisive changes in their composition and reactivity.",
              "Due to the involution of the thymus, the development of T cells becomes independent of the thymus and a general decrease in the production and diversity of naive T cells occurs [170].",
              "The functionality of naive T cells was also impaired, including weaker TCR and costimulatory signals, reduced proliferative capacity and decreased IL-2 production [171].",
              "Three mechanisms compensate for the decrease in naive T cell production: (1) increased antigen-independent clonal expansion of naive T cells [172];",
              "(2) more naive T cells (both CD4 + and CD8 +) differentiate into \u201cvirtual\u201d memory cells [173,174], which are cells with a longer lifespan but reduced antigen reactivity;",
              "(3) memory T cells are activated from time to time by recurrent viral infections (average of 8-12 recurrent pathogens).",
              "Intermittent activation and proliferation of pathogen-specific memory T cells impairs the balance of naive and memory T cells and can account for 50% of all CD4 T cells turning memory T cells [175,176].",
              "All of these mechanisms result in a decrease in the diversity of T cells in the elderly, even a hundred-fold decrease in the diversity of CD4 T cells has been observed after the age of 70 years [177].",
              "Although the number of memory T cells increases with age, the diversity and reactivity of these cells also decrease, limiting the possibility of an effective response to some well-known antigens.",
              "It further limits the maintenance of T cell memory intensity that both primary and memory T cell responses generate short-lived effector T cells rather than memory precursor cells [122].",
              "In addition to cytokine production, the cytokine balance also changes with age.",
              "Th1 responses decrease, shifting toward Th2 cytokine predominance [178].",
              "In summary, the reactivity and plasticity of naive and memory T cells are reduced, limiting the possibility of developing a stronger immune response to an upcoming infection.",
              "Due to the aging of the immune system, the elderly are more vulnerable to infections, resulting in higher mortality and morbidity by pathogens.",
              "Changes in memory response also result in moderate vaccine efficacy in the elderly.",
              "For example knowing that long-lived memory T and B cells can provide effective protection against influenza infection that recurs after a long time, following influenza vaccination seroconversion (a fourfold increase in antibody titer) and protective hemagglutination inhibitor antibody titers is successfully produced in only 10\u201330% of the elderly, compared with 50\u201375% of the younger [179].",
              "Even when antibody levels rise, it has been observed that elevated levels do not persist for even a year [180].",
              "Crippled T cell response also manifested for example in suboptimal Th1 cells response in the lung [181].",
              "Changes not only in the intensity but also in the composition of the immune system may require new vaccination strategies, for example to avoid S.",
              "pneumoniae infection [181].",
              "However, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) stimulates T cells, via conjugating the pneumococcus glycans to CRM197 (nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin) and accordingly this vaccine is used for people under 65 years of age [182], but for adults \u226565 years of age the PPV23 is also recommended because the effectiveness of the T-independent response decreases less with age [44].",
              "Due to age-related immune system defects, the control of pathogen reactivation is also weakened, such as a latent varicella zoster infection can lead to herpes zoster disease.",
              "Limited susceptibility to vaccines makes it even more difficult to control such diseases at this age.",
              "Live attenuated virus vaccination against Varicella zoster virus, which is quite effective at age 60 (51%), is almost ineffective in older populations [183].",
              "Studies showed that the immune responses to the vaccine waned in 6-8 years [184].",
              "In summary, vaccines need to be improved to protect this highly vulnerable population through regular booster vaccinations, finding optimal doses and routes of administration or by innovative adjuvants and inventing new technologies.",
              "Social alterations in humanity increase the global risk of pandemics, which demand more effective vaccination.",
              "As the scope of the article highlights, the memory response relies on a wide variety of cell populations, with their different localizations, affinities, reaction times, and flexibility.",
              "Although neutralizing antibody production is the only way to generate sterilizing immunity, other cells and other mechanisms of immunological memory can/should be considered during vaccination.",
              "The variety and variability of pathogens requires the plasticity of the responses used against them.",
              "In addition, the heterogeneity of the human population, in terms of age, immune status, and comorbidities, may necessitate the development of several vaccines against the same pathogen.",
              "These challenges require a more accurate understanding of the complex processes of immunological memory, all of which can make targeted approaches in vaccination.",

              "This process has been termed \u2018trained immunity\u2019, a de facto innate immune memory.",
              "Research in the past decade has pointed to the broad benefits of trained immunity for host defence but has also suggested potentially detrimental outcomes in immune-mediated and chronic inflammatory diseases.",
              "Here we define \u2018trained immunity\u2019 as a biological process and discuss the innate stimuli and the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming events that shape the induction of trained immunity.",
              "The vertebrate immune system has traditionally been divided into innate and adaptive arms. Cells of the innate immune system recognize pathogens and tissue damage through germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)1,2, which sense diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns.",
              "The processes activated on engagement of PRRs are rapid, are considered to be non-specific and include responses such as phagocytosis, cell locomotion, killing of pathogens or cells, and cytokine production.",
              "These innate immune mechanisms are usually very effective in eliminating invading pathogens.",
              "Additionally, dendritic cells (DCs) and specialized T cells and B cells drive adaptive immune responses, which can be concomitantly induced.",
              "These lymphocyte-dependent adaptive immune responses are slower to develop but are antigen specific and lead to long-term immunological memory3.",
              "For a long time it was assumed that immunological memory was an exclusive hallmark of the adaptive immune response.",
              "However, a growing body of literature indicating that innate immune cells \u2014 and even tissue-resident stem cells \u2014 can show adaptive characteristics has challenged this dogma4,5,6,7,8.",
              "Greater protection against reinfection \u2014 a de facto immune memory function \u2014 has also been reported in plants and invertebrates9,10,11, which lack an adaptive immune system.",
              "This demonstrates that adaptation of host defence can occur on the basis of innate-like immune mechanisms. Moreover, certain infections and vaccinations can induce broad protection against other pathogens through innate immune mechanisms5,12.",
              "Conversely, the phenomenon called \u2018LPS tolerance\u2019, which can be induced by low doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other Toll-like receptor ligands, is also an adaptation of cellular responses to an external stimulus, but which leads to a lower inflammatory response to a second stimulation13.",
              "These studies have led to the hypothesis that the innate immune system also exhibits adaptive characteristics, a property that has been termed \u2018trained immunity\u2019.",
              "Understanding the properties of trained immunity will result in a better understanding of host defence mechanisms and the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases.",
              "The conceptual and mechanistic advances in this emerging field of science will open new avenues for clinical applications in vaccination as well as for disease prevention and treatment.",
              "In this Review, we discuss the latest discoveries in the field of trained immunity and highlight possible directions of future research in this field.",
              "The concept of trained immunity describes the long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells, which is evoked by exogenous or endogenous insults and which leads to an altered response towards a second challenge after the return to a non-activated state.",
              "The secondary response to the subsequent non-specific stimulus can be altered in such a way that the cells respond more or less strongly than to the primary response, conferring context-adjusted and time-adjusted responses.",
              "It is important to underline that trained immunity represents the concept of long-term adaptation of innate immune cells rather than a particular transcriptional or functional programme: indeed, different stimuli (for example, \u03b2-glucan, LPS or the bacillus Calmette\u2013Gue\u0301rin (BCG) vaccine) can induce different trained immunity programmes.",
              "In contrast to adaptive immune responses, epigenetic reprogramming of transcriptional pathways \u2014 rather than gene recombination \u2014 mediates trained immunity (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "The immunological phenotype of trained immunity has been proven to last at least 3 months and up to 1 year, although heterologous protection against infections induced by live vaccines can last for up to 5 years14.",
              "However, even considering this, trained immunity is generally reversible and shorter lived than classical epitope-specific adaptive immunological memory12,15.",

              "[1] They function in the humoral immunity component of the adaptive immune system.",
              "[1] B cells produce antibody molecules which may be either secreted or inserted into the plasma membrane where they serve as a part of B-cell receptors.",
              "[2] When a nai\u0308ve or memory B cell is activated by an antigen, it proliferates and differentiates into an antibody-secreting effector cell, known as a plasmablast or plasma cell.",
              "[2] In addition, B cells present antigens (they are also classified as professional antigen-presenting cells, APCs) and secrete cytokines.",
              "[1] In mammals, B cells mature in the bone marrow, which is at the core of most bones.",
              "[3] In birds, B cells mature in the bursa of Fabricius, a lymphoid organ where they were first discovered by Chang and Glick,[4] which is why the B stands for bursa and not bone marrow, as commonly believed.",
              "B cells, unlike the other two classes of lymphocytes, T cells and natural killer cells, express B cell receptors (BCRs) on their cell membrane.",
              "[1] BCRs allow the B cell to bind to a foreign antigen, against which it will initiate an antibody response.",
              "[1] B cell receptors are extremely specific, with all BCRs on a B cell recognizing the same epitope.",
              "[5] B cells develop from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that originate from bone marrow.",
              "[6][7] HSCs first differentiate into multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells, then common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells.",
              "[7] From here, their development into B cells occurs in several stages (shown in image to the right), each marked by various gene expression patterns and immunoglobulin H chain and L chain gene loci arrangements, the latter due to B cells undergoing V(D)J recombination as they develop.",
              "[8] B cells undergo two types of selection while developing in the bone marrow to ensure proper development, both involving B cell receptors (BCR) on the surface of the cell.",
              "Positive selection occurs through antigen-independent signalling involving both the pre-BCR and the BCR.",
              "[9][10] If these receptors do not bind to their ligand, B cells do not receive the proper signals and cease to develop.",
              "[9][10] Negative selection occurs through the binding of self-antigen with the BCR;",
              "if the BCR can bind strongly to self-antigen, then the B cell undergoes one of four fates: clonal deletion, receptor editing, anergy, or ignorance (B cell ignores signal and continues development).",
              "[10] This negative selection process leads to a state of central tolerance, in which the mature B cells do not bind self antigens present in the bone marrow.",
              "[8] To complete development, immature B cells migrate from the bone marrow into the spleen as transitional B cells, passing through two transitional stages: T1 and T2.",
              "[11] Throughout their migration to the spleen and after spleen entry, they are considered T1 B cells.",
              "[12] Within the spleen, T1 B cells transition to T2 B cells.",
              "[12] T2 B cells differentiate into either follicular (FO) B cells or marginal zone (MZ) B cells depending on signals received through the BCR and other receptors.",
              "[13] Once differentiated, they are now considered mature B cells, or naive B cells.",
              "[12] B cell activation occurs in the secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), such as the spleen and lymph nodes.",
              "[1] After B cells mature in the bone marrow, they migrate through the blood to SLOs, which receive a constant supply of antigen through circulating lymph.",
              "[14] At the SLO, B cell activation begins when the B cell binds to an antigen via its BCR.",
              "[15] Although the events taking place immediately after activation have yet to be completely determined, it is believed that B cells are activated in accordance with the kinetic segregation model[citation needed], initially determined in T lymphocytes.",
              "This model denotes that before antigen stimulation, receptors diffuse through the membrane coming into contact with Lck and CD45 in equal frequency, rendering a net equilibrium of phosphorylation and non-phosphorylation.",
              "It is only when the cell comes in contact with an antigen presenting cell that the larger CD45 is displaced due to the close distance between the two membranes.",
              "This allows for net phosphorylation of the BCR and the initiation of the signal transduction pathway[citation needed].",
              "Of the three B cell subsets, FO B cells preferentially undergo T cell-dependent activation while MZ B cells and B1 B cells preferentially undergo T cell-independent activation.",
              "[16] B cell activation is enhanced through the activity of CD21, a surface receptor in complex with surface proteins CD19 and CD81 (all three are collectively known as the B cell coreceptor complex).",
              "[17] When a BCR binds an antigen tagged with a fragment of the C3 complement protein, CD21 binds the C3 fragment, co-ligates with the bound BCR, and signals are transduced through CD19 and CD81 to lower the activation threshold of the cell.",
              "[18] Antigens that activate B cells with the help of T-cell are known as T cell-dependent (TD) antigens and include foreign proteins.",
              "[1] They are named as such because they are unable to induce a humoral response in organisms that lack T cells.",
              "[1] B cell responses to these antigens takes multiple days, though antibodies generated have a higher affinity and are more functionally versatile than those generated from T cell-independent activation.",
              "[1] Once a BCR binds a TD antigen, the antigen is taken up into the B cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, degraded, and presented to T cells as peptide pieces in complex with MHC-II molecules on the cell membrane.",
              "[19] T helper (TH) cells, typically follicular T helper (TFH) cells recognize and bind these MHC-II-peptide complexes through their T cell receptor (TCR).",
              "[20] Following TCR-MHC-II-peptide binding, T cells express the surface protein CD40L as well as cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-21.",
              "[20] CD40L serves as a necessary co-stimulatory factor for B cell activation by binding the B cell surface receptor CD40, which promotes B cell proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, and somatic hypermutation as well as sustains T cell growth and differentiation.",
              "[1] T cell-derived cytokines bound by B cell cytokine receptors also promote B cell proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, and somatic hypermutation as well as guide differentiation.",
              "[20] After B cells receive these signals, they are considered activated.",
              "[20] Once activated, B cells participate in a two-step differentiation process that yields both short-lived plasmablasts for immediate protection and long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells for persistent protection.",
              "[16] The first step, known as the extrafollicular response, occurs outside lymphoid follicles but still in the SLO.",
              "[16] During this step activated B cells proliferate, may undergo immunoglobulin class switching, and differentiate into plasmablasts that produce early, weak antibodies mostly of class IgM.",
              "[21] The second step consists of activated B cells entering a lymphoid follicle and forming a germinal center (GC), which is a specialized microenvironment where B cells undergo extensive proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, and affinity maturation directed by somatic hypermutation.",
              "[22] These processes are facilitated by TFH cells within the GC and generate both high-affinity memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells.",
              "[16] Resultant plasma cells secrete large amounts of antibody and either stay within the SLO or, more preferentially, migrate to bone marrow.",
              "[22] Antigens that activate B cells without T cell help are known as T cell-independent (TI) antigens[1] and include foreign polysaccharides and unmethylated CpG DNA.",
              "[16] They are named as such because they are able to induce a humoral response in organisms that lack T cells.",
              "[1] B cell response to these antigens is rapid, though antibodies generated tend to have lower affinity and are less functionally versatile than those generated from T cell-dependent activation.",
              "[1] As with TD antigens, B cells activated by TI antigens need additional signals to complete activation, but instead of receiving them from T cells, they are provided either by recognition and binding of a common microbial constituent to toll-like receptors (TLRs) or by extensive crosslinking of BCRs to repeated epitopes on a bacterial cell.",
              "[1] B cells activated by TI antigens go on to proliferate outside lymphoid follicles but still in SLOs (GCs do not form), possibly undergo immunoglobulin class switching, and differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts that produce early, weak antibodies mostly of class IgM, but also some populations of long-lived plasma cells.",
              "[23] Memory B cell activation begins with the detection and binding of their target antigen, which is shared by their parent B cell.",
              "[24] Some memory B cells can be activated without T cell help, such as certain virus-specific memory B cells, but others need T cell help.",
              "[25] Upon antigen binding, the memory B cell takes up the antigen through receptor-mediated endocytosis, degrades it, and presents it to T cells as peptide pieces in complex with MHC-II molecules on the cell membrane.",
              "[24] Memory T helper (TH) cells, typically memory follicular T helper (TFH) cells, that were derived from T cells activated with the same antigen recognize and bind these MHC-II-peptide complexes through their TCR.",
              "[24] Following TCR-MHC-II-peptide binding and the relay of other signals from the memory TFH cell, the memory B cell is activated and differentiates either into plasmablasts and plasma cells via an extrafollicular response or enter a germinal center reaction where they generate plasma cells and more memory B cells.",
              "[24][25] It is unclear whether the memory B cells undergo further affinity maturation within these secondary GCs.",
              "[24] In vitro activation of memory B cells can be achieved through stimulation with various activators, such as pokeweed mitogen or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies, however, a study found a combination of R-848 and recombinant human IL-2 to be the most efficient activator.",
              "[26] Autoimmune disease can result from abnormal B cell recognition of self-antigens followed by the production of autoantibodies.",
              "[31] Autoimmune diseases where disease activity is correlated with B cell activity include scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, post-infectious IBS, and rheumatoid arthritis.",
              "[31] Malignant transformation of B cells and their precursors can cause a host of cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), hairy cell leukemia, follicular lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and plasma cell malignancies such as multiple myeloma, Waldenstro\u0308m's macroglobulinemia, and certain forms of amyloidosis.",
              "[32][33] Abnormal B cells may be relatively large and some diseases include this in their names, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma.",
              "Patients with B cell alymphocytosis are predisposed to infections.",
              "[34] A study that investigated the methylome of B cells along their differentiation cycle, using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), showed that there is a hypomethylation from the earliest stages to the most differentiated stages.",
              "The largest methylation difference is between the stages of germinal center B cells and memory B cells.",
              "Furthermore, this study showed that there is a similarity between B cell tumors and long-lived B cells in their DNA methylation signatures.",

              "Antibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages or neutrophils, because they are highly attracted to macromolecules complexed with antibodies.",

              "Not all antibodies bind with the same strength, specificity, and stability.",
              "In fact, antibodies exhibit different affinities (attraction) depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules.",

              "Although avidity measures the strength of binding, just as affinity does, the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure.",
              "The avidity depends on the number of identical binding sites on the antigen being detected, as well as other physical and chemical factors.",
              "Typically, multimeric antibodies, such as pentameric IgM, are classified as having lower affinity than monomeric antibodies, but high avidity.",
              "Essentially, the fact that multimeric antibodies can bind many antigens simultaneously balances their slightly-lower-binding strength for each antibody/antigen interaction.",
              "Antibodies secreted after binding to one epitope on an antigen may exhibit cross reactivity for the same or similar epitopes on different antigens.",
              "Cross reactivity occurs when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion, but to a different antigen.",
              "Because an epitope corresponds to such a small region (the surface area of about four to six amino acids), it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short regions.",

              "However, if the organism is reexposed to the same antigen that stimulated their formation, the body mounts a second immune response that is led by these long-lasting memory cells, which then give rise to another population of identical effector and memory cells.",

              "Another signal is required, and it is provided in one of two ways: either through stimulation by a cytokine or through a costimulatory reaction between the signaling protein, B7, found on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell, and the receptor protein, CD28, on the surface of the helper T cell.",
              "If the first signal and one of the second signals are received, the helper T cell becomes activated to proliferate and to stimulate the appropriate immune cell.",

              "A discussion of helper-T-cell activation is complicated by the fact that helper T cells are not a uniform group of cells but rather can be divided into two general subpopulations\u2014TH1 and TH2 cells\u2014that have significantly different chemistry and function.",
              "These populations can be distinguished by the cytokines they secrete.",
              "TH1 cells primarily produce the cytokines gamma interferon, tumour necrosis factor-beta, and interleukin-2 (IL-2), while TH2 cells mainly synthesize the interleukins IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13.",
              "The main role of the TH1 cells is to stimulate cell-mediated responses (those involving cytotoxic T cells and macrophages), while TH2 cells primarily assist in stimulating B cells to make antibodies.",
              "Once the initial steps of activation have occurred, helper T cells synthesize other proteins, such as signaling proteins and the cell-surface receptors to which the signaling proteins bind.",
              "These signaling molecules play a critical role not only in activating the particular helper T cell but also in determining the ultimate functional role and final differentiation state of that cell.",
              "For example, the helper T cell produces and displays IL-2 receptors on its surface and also secretes IL-2 molecules, which bind to these receptors and stimulate the helper T cell to grow and divide.",
              "The overall result of helper-T-cell activation is an increase in the number of helper T cells that recognize a specific foreign antigen, and several T-cell cytokines are produced.",
              "The cytokines have other consequences, one of which is that IL-2 allows cytotoxic or regulatory T cells that recognize the same antigen to become activated and to multiply.",
              "Cytotoxic T cells, in turn, can attack and kill other cells that express the foreign antigen in association with class I MHC molecules, which\u2014as explained above\u2014are present on almost all cells.",
              "So, for example, cytotoxic T cells can attack target cells that express antigens made by viruses or bacteria growing within them.",
              "Regulatory T cells may be similar to cytotoxic T cells, but they are detected by their ability to suppress the action of B cells or even of helper T cells (perhaps by killing them).",

              "The helper T cell also secretes cytokines, which can interact with the B cell and provide additional stimulation.",

              "Regardless of cell division, the number of memory cells for a given antigen is highly regulated, remaining practically constant during the memory phase.",
              "Immunological memory can be measured experimentally in various ways.",
              "Adoptive transfer assays (seeAppendix I, Section A-42) of lymphocytes from animals immunized with simple, nonliving antigens have been favored for such studies, as the antigen cannot proliferate.",
              "When an animal is first immunized with a protein antigen, helper T-cell memory against that antigen appears abruptly and is at its maximal level after 5 days or so.",
              "Antigen-specific memory B cells appear some days later, because B-cell activation cannot begin until armed helper T cells are available, and B cells must then enter a phase of proliferation and selection in lymphoid tissue.",
              "By one month after immunization, memory B cells are present at their maximal levels.",
              "These levels are then maintained with little alteration for the lifetime of the animal.",

              "These antibodies are produced by memory B cells that have already switched from IgM to these more mature isotypes and express IgG, IgA, or IgE on their surface, as well as a somewhat higher level of MHC class II molecules than is characteristic of naive B cells.",
              "Increased affinity for antigen and increased levels of MHC class II facilitate antigen uptake and presentation, and allow memory B cells to initiate their critical interactions with armed helper T cells at lower doses of antigen.",
              "Unlike memory T cells, which can traffic to tissues owing to changes in cell-surface molecules that affect migration and homing, it is thought that memory B cells continue to recirculate through the same secondary lymphoid compartments that contain naive B cells, principally the follicles of spleen, lymph node, and Peyer's patch.",

              "The antibodies produced are encoded by the same VH and VL genes in all animals of the strain, suggesting that these variable regions have been selected during evolution for recognition of determinants on pathogens that happen to cross-react with some haptens.",
              "As a result of the uniformity of these primary responses, changes in the antibody molecules produced in secondary responses to the same antigens are easy to observe.",
              "These differences include not only numerous somatic hypermutations in antibodies containing the dominant variable regions but also the addition of antibodies containing VH and VL gene segments not detected in the primary response.",
              "These are thought to derive from B cells that were activated at low frequency during the primary response, and thus not detected, but that differentiated into memory B cells.",
              "Upon reexposure to the same antigen, a secondary immune response will ensue.",
              "In some ways, this resembles the primary immune response, with the initial proliferation of B cells and T cells at the interface between the T- and B-cell zones.",

              "Some B cells that have not yet undergone terminal differentiation can migrate into the follicle and become germinal center B cells.",
              "There, these B cells enter a second proliferative phase, during which the DNA encoding their immunoglobulin V domains again undergoes somatic hypermutation before the B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells (see Section 9-7).",

              "In secondary and subsequent immune responses, any persisting antibodies produced by the B cells that differentiated in the primary response are immediately available to bind the newly introduced antigen.",
              "Some of these antibodies divert antigen to phagocytes for degradation and disposal (see Section 9-20).",
              "If there is sufficient preexisting antibody to clear or inactivate the pathogen, it is possible that no immune response will ensue.",
              "However, if there is a trace excess of antigen, B cells whose receptors bind the antigen with sufficient avidity to compete with the preexisting antibody will take up the uncomplexed antigen, process it into peptide fragments, and present these peptides, bound to MHC class II molecules, to armed helper T cells surrounding and infiltrating the germinal centers (see Section 9-8).",
              "Contact between the B cells presenting antigenic peptides and armed helper T cells specific for the same peptide leads to an exchange of activating signals and the rapid proliferation of both activated antigen-specific B cells and helper T cells.",

              "In this way, the affinity of the antibody produced rises progressively, as only B cells with high-affinity antigen receptors can bind antigen efficiently and be driven to proliferate by antigen-specific helper T cells (Fig.",

              "This is because memory B cells are much more sensitive, because of their high affinity and alterations in their B-cell receptor signaling requirements, to smaller amounts of antigen that cannot be efficiently cleared by the passive anti-Rh antibody.",
              "The ability of memory B cells to be activated to produce antibody even when exposed to preexisting antibody also allows secondary antibody responses to occur in individuals who are already immune.",

              "For example, in a mouse model of West Nile virus infection, pre-existing protective antibodies secreted by LLPCs were shown to act as a first line of defence against reinfection with the homologous virus, whereas memory B cells encoded antibodies that were capable of binding viral variants8.",
              "Consistent with this observation, two recent lines of in vivo evidence from mouse models show that memory B cells indeed act as defence against re-challenge with variants of influenza virus and flavivirus9,10 and that pre-existing cross-reactive clones contained in the memory B cell, but not in the LLPC compartment, are positively selected and directly differentiate into plasma cells after re-challenge with a variant virus (Fig.",

              "In this regard, a report showing that T cell help is necessary to generate the immediate precursors for GC cells but must cease in order to allow for GC B cell progression41 supports the idea that there is an optimal window of BCR affinity (presumably intermediate affinity) in the TFH cell\u2013B cell interaction that allows for GC differentiation.",
              "However, given that microenvironmental states such as antigen accessibility undergo dynamic spatiotemporal alterations, particularly early in the immune response, other factors besides affinity should be considered in the determination of fate decisions.",
              "For instance, in the single-cell adoptive transfer experiments described above, about 5\u201310% of clones gave rise to all three effector cell types39.",
              "Such multiplicity of fates correlates well with a large clonal burst size.",
              "The high bursting clones can be evoked by their high BCR affinity and/or by a B cell-extrinsic highly inflammatory milieu, where bystander TFH cells provide survival signals regardless of their BCR affinity.",
              "Hence, it is possible that even a high-affinity B cell clone can give rise to the memory fate and that, on the other hand, even low-affinity B cells can join in the GC reaction, which can explain the fact that the unmutated ancestors of matured mutated broadly neutralizing BCRs to influenza virus or HIVs can enter the GC, even though they show limited or, apparently, even no antigen binding to the respective viruses42.",
              "Other types of experiments that involve the adoptive transfer of naive B cells with fixed BCR affinity (high affinity for hapten NP;",

              "Hence, in such settings, the provision of antigen for a sufficient amount of time, evoking high BCR signalling and subsequent high T cell help, facilitates plasma cell differentiation, whereas exposure to antigen for a relatively limited period causes the B cells to become precursors for GC and memory B cells (GC/memory precursor).",

              "The increase in the average affinity of GC B cells over time requires that B cells with higher affinity for antigen clonally expand, whereas those of lower affinity proportionally contract46.",
              "Such positive selection of higher-affinity GC B cells has been thought to take place through two (not necessarily mutually exclusive) potential mechanisms. One is that higher-affinity cells might receive stronger BCR signals that favour their survival compared with lower-affinity cells.",
              "The second is that higher-affinity cells could be more effective in subsequently engaging GC TFH cells and receiving stronger survival and proliferation signals through cognate T cell help.",

              "Second, some GCs undergo clonal bursting and are taken over by one or a few clones, whereas other GCs in the same lymphoid tissue do not undergo a clonal burst, thereby creating a diverse group of surviving clones52.",
              "Third, GC B cell diversity may be promoted by antibody-mediated feedback, as dominant GC B cell clones with BCRs specific for particular antigen epitopes give rise to plasma cells that secrete antibody which, in turn, masks these epitopes, thereby halting evolution of the corresponding clone, and instead enhancing the selection of clones that bind different epitopes55,56,57,58.",
              "Fourth, studies have shown that some naive B cells enter the GC at later stages during immune responses and that these late participants possess very low affinity for the original immunogen54,59,60.",
              "Last, it is now clear that some B cells in the naive repertoire have measurable autoreactivity (they are generally anergic) and are able to enter the GC61,62.",
              "These GC B cells are initially selected for mutations that diminish self-reactivity, in a process called redemption, while preserving foreign antigen reactivity63.",
              "In some cases, this might induce a paradoxical decrease in overall affinity for the foreign antigen, potentially enhancing the diversity of GC B cells.",
              "Given that human mature broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV and influenza possess many mutations and that most of their germ-line precursors are polyreactive and/or autoreactive11,64, B cells producing such antibodies are likely to have undergone redemption during their maturation.",
              "In support of this mechanism, it was shown that facilitating redemption by using CTLA4-targeted checkpoint inhibitors increased bnAb responses against influenza virus65.",

              "This leads to the formation of early secondary GCs, which contain B cells that are just as diverse and poorly mutated as those in early primary-immunized GCs.",
              "Such recruitment of naive B cells into secondary GCs was also observed in humans12, but the ratio of memory B cells versus naive B cells in secondary GC reactions is generally higher in humans compared with mice.",
              "This may reflect extensive histories of influenza antigen exposure in humans or profound biological differences in the reactivation of memory B cells between humans and mice.",

              "Recent studies also indicate that antibody feedback is particularly important in determining booster-mediated B cell fates.",
              "For instance, it was shown in adoptive transfer experiments that antibodies produced by IgG+ memory B cells could inhibit the formation of IgM+ memory B cell-derived secondary GCs110.",
              "Then, by using adoptive transfer of BCR knock-in memory or naive B cells, these donor B cells were only activated in naive mice, but not in immunized mice123, because of the existence of pre-existing masking antibodies in the latter.",
              "Together with the data obtained from experiments in which either antigen-specific or irrelevant antibodies were administered124,125, antibodies either present prior to boosting or produced acutely by boosted memory B cells are thought to compete with cognate naive as well as memory B cells for binding a specific epitope through antibody-mediated epitope masking (Fig.",

              "Many excellent reviews of the insights gained from SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines with regards to B cell differentiation have been published126,127,128.",
              "Here, we focus on human memory B cells and, in particular, how they acquire neutralizing antibody (nAb) breadth.",
              "Acquiring such a feature after only a single viral infection129 or after two or three doses of mRNA vaccines encoding the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike protein would not be expected.",
              "Two doses of mRNA vaccine or one incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection induces similar frequencies of IgG+ memory B cells that bind the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), with comparable SHM levels.",
              "Given that a substantial fraction of RBD+IgG+ memory B cells from individuals who have been vaccinated with two doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines can also bind to RBDs of variants of concern130,131, it appears that this vaccine regimen generated substantial numbers of affinity matured memory B cells132,133.",
              "However, the affinity maturation after a standard two-dose mRNA vaccine regimen is qualitatively poorer than that after a single SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
              "These differences may be related to the narrow window of time between dose 1 and dose 2 of the mRNA vaccines of usually 3 or 4 weeks, as experimental models of vaccination against HIV have shown that extending the priming period can result in better nAb responses126,134.",
              "After mRNA vaccination, GCs were observed to persist for at least 6 months in draining lymph nodes of healthy individuals after the second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine135,136,137.",
              "GCs have been shown to play a central role in the generation of nAb breadth of memory B cells132,133.",
              "Indeed, nAb responses are substantially reduced in many individuals who are immunocompromised, such as recipients of kidney transplants138.",
              "The lower GC responses in recipients of kidney transplant could be due to weaker GC TFH cell responses, as the frequency of GC TFH cells in these patients was severely reduced and associated with poor nAb titres.",
              "Thus, the question arises of why memory B cells acquire nAb breadth much more easily in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mRNA vaccination compared with HIV or influenza infection.",
              "Two types of studies have recently demonstrated the importance of antibody feedback in GC responses.",
              "First, in the context of mRNA vaccination, the introduction of high-affinity epitope-specific monoclonal Abs affected memory B cell selection by two mechanisms: the affinity threshold for the entry into the memory and GC compartment was altered, and the epitopes targeted on RBD were changed by direct masking125.",
              "Second, we and others have shown that, after a two-dose or three-dose mRNA vaccine regimen, the distribution of epitopes recognized by memory B cells is shifted away from the initial immunodominant RBD epitopes58,123.",
              "Thus, masking of these immunodominant epitopes by pre-generated antibodies diversifies immunogenicity of otherwise subdominant epitopes on the RBD.",
              "In the case of mRNA vaccination, these second-layer antibodies target RBD epitopes conserved between variants and acquire high-potency neutralizing activity through GC reactions, together contributing to the development of functional breadth.",
              "However, in the case of HIV or influenza vaccination, the antibody feedback mechanism might halt the maturation of memory B cells with potential bnAb BCRs11,123,139.",
              "For example, in the case of influenza vaccination and the response to the key conserved stem epitope, critical specific on-target neutralizing antibodies coexist with many off-target non-neutralizing antibodies11.",
              "Hence, the efficient generation of off-target antibodies probably limits access to this conserved epitope by memory B cells with on-target BCRs, thereby not allowing them to re-enter the GC.",
              "Eventually, this mechanism seems to operate by diverting immunity away from making memory B cells with on-target bnAbs, and instead towards those with strain-specific ones.",
              "How can we overcome the obstacles to bnAb development when designing vaccines?",
              "In the case of anti-stem influenza HA bnAbs, three potential obstacles exist with regard to B cell maturation: germ-line ancestors of matured broadly neutralizing BCRs may have extremely low affinity for the native epitopes;",
              "naive B cells with these ancestor BCRs may be extremely rare;",
              "and these bnAbs are immunosubdominant.",
              "So, in the competitive situation of a polyclonal naive B cell setting, knowing how such rare naive B cells specific for the conserved epitope (such as the stem epitope in the case of influenza) are recruited into the immune response, and subsequent GC reactions, and induced to generate memory B cells is key to successful vaccine development.",
              "Moreover, knowing how GC-dependent memory B cells are recruited again into GC responses upon boosting with a second immunization is also important.",
              "Hence, one way to induce memory B cells for re-entering GC responses would be to modify the immunogens, for example by introducing mutations or glycan masking140,141, so that they are recognized by the desired germ-line or intermediate BCRs, but not by non-neutralizing BCRs.",
              "Given that limited TFH cell help at the T\u2013B border is another bottleneck, increasing the number of antigen-specific TFH cells might allow low-affinity B cells to be recruited into the immune responses and subsequent GC reactions.",
              "Indeed, experiments using an HIV model showed that higher levels of T cell help allow rare B cells that express the germ-line BCRs of mature bnAbs to enter the GC reaction142.",
              "Hence, it is likely that with high quantities and qualities of TFH cells, rare B cells with germ-line BCRs of potential bnAbs could have a better chance of being recruited into GCs, wherein these BCRs become matured by SHM, eventually generating high-quality bnAb-expressing memory B cells81.",
              "Finally, as discussed above, particularly during booster vaccination, and differing from SARS-CoV-2 infection, avoidance of antibody feedback may make sense for generating memory B cells that are capable of producing bnAbs.",
              "In the past 10 years, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of memory B cell function in polyclonal settings have been carefully analysed, and the findings have broad implications for vaccinology and the treatment of autoimmunity.",
              "Although future directions and open questions have been discussed throughout this Review, we emphasize the importance of gaining a better fundamental understanding of the spatiotemporal aspects of memory B cell generation, maintenance and reactivation, and how memory B cell heterogeneity (such as conventional versus atypical memory B cells) can be formed, as well as how other types of cells, particularly TFH cells and FDCs, participate in these processes.",
              "Recent technical advances in high-throughput single-cell sequencing to explore both gene expression and immune repertoire profiles will allow us to uncover novel principles underlying clonal selection and the acquisition of different differentiation trajectories.",
              "The development of technologies to investigate immunization-induced memory B cells in higher primates shifts the studies to the human setting, which, in turn, will allow us to engineer vaccines optimized for the generation of memory B cells or to target memory B cells for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and allergies in humans.",

              "Even mild or symptom-less infections can be deadly.",
              "For example, most people infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV) never show any sign of infection.",

              "White blood cells are created in the bone marrow but dispersed throughout the body in low numbers, ready to begin multiplying and attacking microbes and substances not native to the body.",
              "After they have eliminated an infection, white blood cells stop multiplying and their numbers dwindle until only a few are left to keep watch.",
              "At that point, a person is considered immunized.",
              "Because immunity can take weeks to develop after vaccination, it is possible to become infected in the weeks immediately following vaccination.",
              "Even after that, vaccinated people can and sometimes do get infected.",
              "But a vaccinated person is far less likely to die or become seriously ill than someone whose immune system is unprepared to fight an infection.",
              "A single dose of vaccine provides only partial protection.",
              "The number of doses needed to achieve immunity depends on whether the antigen in a vaccine is alive or not.",
              "Because they contain living bacteria or viruses, live-attenuated vaccines can provide enduring protection with only two doses.",
              "By contrast, non-live vaccines typically require at least three doses to achieve protection that fades over time and must be restored with booster doses.",

              "A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that can cause disease within the body.",
              "Each pathogen is made up of several subparts, usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes.",

              "We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies.",
              "When the human body is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it takes time for the immune system to respond and produce antibodies specific to that antigen.",
              "In the meantime, the person is susceptible to becoming ill.",
              "Once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced, they work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease.",
              "Antibodies to one pathogen generally don\u2019t protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other, like cousins.",
              "Once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an antigen, it also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies.",
              "If the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen.",
              "This means that if the person is exposed to the dangerous pathogen in the future, their immune system will be able to respond immediately, protecting against disease.",
              "Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body.",
              "Newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself.",
              "Regardless of whether the vaccine is made up of the antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the antigen, this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogen.",
              "Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart.",
              "This is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies and development of memory cells.",
              "In this way, the body is trained to fight the specific disease-causing organism, building up memory of the pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future.",
              "When someone is vaccinated, they are very likely to be protected against the targeted disease.",
              "But not everyone can be vaccinated.",
              "People with underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems (such as cancer or HIV) or who have severe allergies to some vaccine components may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines.",
              "These people can still be protected if they live in and amongst others who are vaccinated.",
              "When a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the pathogen has a hard time circulating because most of the people it encounters are immune.",
              "So the more that others are vaccinated, the less likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines are at risk of even being exposed to the harmful pathogens.",
              "This is called herd immunity.",
              "This is especially important for those people who not only can\u2019t be vaccinated but may be more susceptible to the diseases we vaccinate against.",
              "No single vaccine provides 100% protection, and herd immunity does not provide full protection to those who cannot safely be vaccinated.",
              "But with herd immunity, these people will have substantial protection, thanks to those around them being vaccinated.",
              "Vaccinating not only protects yourself, but also protects those in the community who are unable to be vaccinated.",
              "If you are able to, get vaccinated.",

              "How vaccines protect against pathogens In response to a vaccine antigen, specialized immune system cells called T and B lymphocytes, or T and B cells, become activated so that if we are infected by the germ at a later time, our body\u2019s immune defence system will recognize the invaders and protect us.",

              "T-cells, on the other hand, attack and destroy infected cells in our body to stop the infection from spreading.",

              "Attenuated vaccines can be made in several ways.",
              "Some of the most common methods involve passing the disease-causing virus through a series of cell cultures or animal embryos (typically chick embryos).",
              "Using chick embryos as an example, the virus is grown in different embryos in a series.",
              "With each passage, the virus becomes better at replicating in chick cells, but loses its ability to replicate in human cells.",

              "Eventually, the attenuated virus will not replicate well (or at all) in human cells, and can be used in a vaccine.",
              "All the methods that involve passing a virus through a non-human host produce a version of the virus that can still be recognized by the human immune system, but cannot replicate well in a human host.",
              "When the resulting vaccine virus is given to a human, it will not replicate enough to cause illness, but will still provoke an immune response that can protect against future infection.",
              "One concern that must be considered is the potential for the vaccine virus to revert to a form capable of causing disease.",
              "Mutations that can occur when the vaccine virus replicates in the body may lead to a more virulent strain.",
              "This is unlikely, as the vaccine virus\u2019s ability to replicate is limited.",

              "Since testing for effective inactivation is dependent on assay sensitivity, sample volume, and the absence of interference by inactivated particles, the assay used to confirm completeness of inactivation (COI) should be designed to be easily scaled up, with high sensitivity and rigorous controls for assay sensitivity and matrix effects.",

              "The combination of these two variables allows the manufacturer to either specify a maximally tolerable level of outgoing infectivity (Cornfield et al.",

              "Additionally, to ensure no modification of epitopes occurs during inactivation, as was observed with RSV and measles in the past, the immunogenic potency of the inactivated virus particle must be measured.",
              "This can be achieved by measuring the immune response before and after immunization in vivo, for example the Rat potency assay which is used to measure poliovirus neutralizing antibodies after immunization of rats with an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (van Steenis et al.",
              "1981).",
              "In vivo immunogenicity testing can also been correlated to in vitro cell-based potency assays;",

              "Naturally, the development of such assays requires knowledge of the neutralizing epitopes necessary for an adequate immune response, and consequently, protection.",
              "Not only do inactivated vaccines possess a higher safety profile as compared to live vaccines, they are also generally less reactogenic, relatively straightforward, and technically feasible to produce with fewer regulatory hurdles for licensure (Zepp 2011).",
              "However, inactivated vaccines are typically associated with a lower immunogenicity which can imply the necessity of multiple doses or adjuvant addition which consequently raises the costs of goods and vaccine pricing.",
              "Therefore, choosing an inactivated vaccine approach is in general a trade-off with on one hand increased safety (if inactivation is of course complete) and a fast pathway to regulatory approval, but on the other hand the risk of reduced antigenicity of the immunogen which often requires adjuvant addition and/or multiple doses which not only raises production costs but also the complexity of formulation and administration.",

              "Although no studies have been performed regarding the effects of dexamethasone on microglial activation during pneumococcal meningitis, in vitro studies using LPS-stimulated glial cells demonstrated that microglial activation after bacterial exposure is limited by corticosteroid treatment, providing a possible explanation for the observed beneficial effects of dexamethasone treatment in vivo (115, 148, 197, 495).",

              "The early phase is initiated by the pneumococcal toxins H2O2 and pneumolysin and results in caspase-independent apoptosis-like pyknotic cell death of both mature and immature neurons throughout the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (63, 330).",
              "This is subsequently followed by caspase-dependent apoptosis of the immature neurons in the subgranular region of the dentate gyrus, triggered primarily by bacterial cell wall stimulation of leukocytes (178, 330).",
              "Pneumolysin, which is also implicated in apoptosis of microglial and brain microvascular endothelial cells, was shown to colocalize to dying neurons in the dentate gyrus in a rabbit model of pneumococcal meningitis (63, 318).",

              "The observation that in vitro exposure of isolated cultured neurons to PCW products does not lead to cell death led to the hypothesis that late-phase apoptosis may be dependent on the host inflammatory response (330).",

              "The effects of glycerol in the neurological/neurosurgical setting have been hypothesized to lie in the resulting increase of plasma osmolality, which was shown to reduce the excretion of CSF by some 20 to 30%, leading to increased cerebral blood flow and improvement of brain oxygenation (453).",
              "For acute stroke, glycerol has been shown to confer only a short-term advantage, without demonstrating benefits in the long-term outcome (416).",
              "The first clinical trial evaluating glycerol as a potential adjuvant treatment for bacterial meningitis was conducted with 122 Finnish children with bacterial meningitis and suggested a reduction in hearing impairment as well as in long-term neurological sequelae (234).",
              "More recently, a large South American trial using adjuvant glycerol for the treatment of children with bacterial meningitis provided additional support for its efficacy in the reduction of neurological sequelae, although hearing loss and mortality were not diminished (381, 382).",
              "However, reliable interpretation of the findings was compromised by several methodological problems (430).",
              "Nevertheless, the results fueled additional trials, most recently a study in Malawi where 256 adults with bacterial meningitis were randomized to receive either placebo or glycerol as adjuvant treatment (5).",
              "The trial was halted prematurely when an interim analysis after 100 deaths showed increased death in the glycerol group (5).",
              "The discrepancies in the various studies most likely lie in the variation in study populations, such as age, comorbidity, and causative pathogen, as well as in the variation in treatment regimens and methods of assessing outcome parameters.",
              "Relatively few animal studies have been performed with glycerol, and they have not been able to demonstrate clinical or histological benefits of adjuvant glycerol therapy (46).",
              "Moreover, in a rabbit model, pneumococcal meningitis treated with glycerol alone was associated with an increased level of hippocampal neuronal apoptosis (439).",
              "A study in which healthy mice were treated with high doses of glycerol (much higher than trial dosages) showed that treatment was associated with the occurrence of seizures (127), which were also seen more in the glycerol-treated patients in the Malawi trial (5).",
              "This finding was not in concurrence with the South American trial and may be explained by either the shorter glycerol regimen (2 days instead of 4 days) or increased disease severity in the Malawi group.",
              "Though glycerol seemed attractive as a potential adjuvant treatment for bacterial meningitis, the lack of effectiveness in experimental models, combined with its harmful effects in the Malawi trial, question the value of additional studies on adjunctive glycerol for the treatment of adult meningitis (72).",
              "The massive inflammatory response following pneumococcal meningitis has been shown to play a key role in the development of brain damage and subsequent poor outcomes (252).",
              "In part, the inflammatory response is determined by bacterial lysis products, as shown in experimental pneumococcal meningitis models where inoculation with PCW led to massive inflammation and neuronal damage (489, 490).",
              "Although bacteriolytic antibiotic regimens may limit the overall amount of release of bacterial products, temporary increases in the release of bacterial components have been documented following treatment (344).",

              "Treatment with daptomycin led to lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and possibly to less cortical brain damage and neuronal apoptosis than those for treatment with ceftriaxone alone (176, 177).",
              "Although adjunctive treatment with dexamethasone did not result in a reduction of overall pneumococcal clearance from the CSF, daptomycin penetration into the inflamed meninges was reduced in the presence of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy (136).",
              "Rifampin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis and was shown to lead to diminished levels of PCW product release in vitro (463).",
              "In a murine model of pneumococcal meningitis, a decrease in mortality was observed in mice treated with rifampin versus ceftriaxone, an effect which was most notable during the first hours following antibiotic therapy (347).",
              "Moreover, recent studies with a rabbit model demonstrated that short-term pretreatment with rifampin before ceftriaxone reduced the release of PCW products, inflammation, and neuronal damage compared to those with treatment with ceftriaxone alone (54, 165, 458).",
              "In a rabbit model of pneumococcal meningitis, treatment with moxifloxacin, a relatively novel quinolone, was shown to result in lower levels of the proinflammatory cell wall components LTA and TA in CSF than those obtained by treatment with ceftriaxone (463).",
              "Pneumococcal clearance from the CSF was comparable after treatment with either moxifloxacin or ceftriaxone, and drug levels were not reduced following adjunctive treatment with dexamethasone (367, 437).",
              "However, in a murine model, moxifloxacin failed to reduce mortality compared to standard cephalosporin therapy (124).",

              "In spite of some beneficial effects, such as reductions of proinflammatory cytokine pleocytosis (230), reductions in cortical damage (302), attenuated CSF pleocytosis (228, 230), and a diminished incidence of hearing loss (243), adverse outcomes have been reported, such as impaired bacterial killing, increased neuronal apoptosis, and impaired learning function (302).",
              "Of all potential antioxidant agents, only NAC is currently used routinely in clinical practice (for the treatment of acetaminophen intoxications), and therefore it is a likely candidate for evaluation in a clinical setting.",

              "In addition to the widespread introduction of dexamethasone, other options for adjuvant drugs may lie in modulating ROS/RNS-mediated damage, in caspase inhibition, or in drugs targeting specific mediators in the inflammatory, complement, or coagulation cascades.",

              "These bacteria can colonize infants and adults without symptoms, but in some cases can spread, invade other tissues and cause disease with high morbidity and mortality.",
              "The development of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) caused an enormous impact in invasive pneumococcal disease and protected unvaccinated people by herd effect.",
              "However, serotype replacement is a well-known phenomenon that has occurred after the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and has also been reported for other PCVs.",
              "Therefore, it is possible that serotype replacement will continue to occur even with higher valence formulations, but the development of serotype-independent vaccines might overcome this problem.",
              "Alternative vaccines are under development in order to improve cost effectiveness, either using proteins or the pneumococcal whole cell.",
              "These approaches can be used as a stand-alone strategy or together with polysaccharide vaccines.",
              "Looking ahead, the next generation of pneumococcal vaccines can be impacted by the new technologies recently approved for human use, such as mRNA vaccines and viral vectors.",
              "In this paper, we will review the advantages and disadvantages of the addition of new polysaccharides in the current PCVs, mainly for low- and middle-income countries, and we will also address future perspectives.",
              "Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn, the pneumococcus) is a frequent component of the human nasopharyngeal microbiota, but it is also an important pathogen, especially in children under five years of age and the elderly, as it is responsible for several hospitalizations and deaths [1,2].",
              "Pneumococci cause several diseases ranging from sinusitis and otitis media to life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis.",
              "The majority of the strains express a capsule, the most important virulence factor, which is associated with escape from opsonophagocytosis and other immune responses [3,4,5].",
              "The capsule is composed of polysaccharides (PS) that can be chemically and immunologically classified into 100 serotypes [6].",
              "Spn is genetically highly variable, especially in loci related to PS production and antibiotic resistance.",
              "In fact, Spn has mechanisms to rapidly adapt and evolve through recombination [7,8,9,10,11].",
              "Lower respiratory tract infections (LTRI) have been the fourth leading cause of death in the world since 2000, but a reduction from 3.",
              "1 million in 2000 to 2.",
              "6 million in total deaths caused by LRTI was observed in 2019 [12].",
              "Pneumonia cases alone were responsible for 15% of all deaths in children under 5 years of age [13].",
              "The World Health Organization (WHO) denoted Spn as an important human pathogen, as it is responsible for more than 50% of all deaths caused by LTRI [2,13,14].",
              "The WHO also established that vaccination is the most important policy to control pneumococcal disease [15].",
              "The first pneumococcal vaccine dates back to 1909 in the United States, where a whole cell vaccine was first licensed [16].",
              "Between 1923 and 1925, the characteristics of the PS, initially named soluble specific substance of pneumococcus (SSS), were described from some serotypes [17,18,19].",
              "Based on that discovery, many groups started to work with pneumococcal PS as vaccines, even in the wartime period [20,21,22,23].",
              "Additionally, during this time, two pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPV) with six different serotypes in two different formulations based on the prevalence of the serotypes in adults and infants, were licensed in the United States, but they were later removed from the market due to skepticism from physicians on the implementation of vaccines in clinics [24].",
              "In the 1970s, new efforts for the development of pneumococcal vaccines were made, especially by Robert Austrian, who was responsible for cataloguing serotypes from pneumococcal diseases and leading clinical trials with 7-valent and 12-valent vaccines which later evolved to include 14 different serotypes.",
              "In 1983, some companies started to produce the 23-valent PPV (PPV23), composed of purified PS from 23 different serotypes, after a position of WHO supporting its use [16].",
              "PPV23 induces a T-cell independent response, and for this reason, it is not indicated for children under two years.",
              "Even in people older than 60, the age group for which this vaccine is indicated, it presents a lower response when compared with young adults [25,26,27].",
              "After 2000, another generation of vaccines became important: the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV).",
              "PCVs were developed by the conjugation of PS to carrier proteins, which rendered a T-cell-dependent response to PS with the induction of memory T-cells and protection of infants [28,29,30,31].",
              "After the introduction of these vaccines, a huge decrease in pneumococcal disease and colonization was observed, as was reflected by the reduction of the circulation of vaccine serotypes and the protection of unvaccinated people through the herd effect [30,31,32,33,34].",
              "On the other hand, in the period after introduction of PCVs in immunization programs, an increasing trend in the incidence rate of serotypes not included in the vaccines was observed.",
              "This phenomenon led to concerns regarding vaccine efficacy, especially when an increasing prevalence in serotypes more related to strains resistant to antibiotics was observed [34,35].",
              "In this review, we aim to explore and exemplify the importance of pneumococcal vaccines and expose the necessity of exploring next generation strategies.",
              "We present here a variety of models and platforms to produce and design new vaccines to fight pneumococcal disease.",
              "Licensed PCVs have been extremely important in reducing pneumococcal disease worldwide.",
              "These vaccines included 7 to 13 PS from different pneumococcal serotypes conjugated to carrier proteins [36].",
              "After the introduction of PCV7 in the immunization program of several countries, a high rate of protection of vaccinated children has been demonstrated, with reductions in cases of pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) [37,38,39,40,41].",
              "However, a few years after the introduction of these vaccines, serotype replacement was observed, with previously circulating serotypes included in the vaccine being substituted by non-vaccine serotypes [42,43,44,45].",
              "Most countries have no indication for PCV use in young adults or the elderly, and some studies show a decline in cases of IPD caused by some vaccine serotypes in people over 65 years of age by herd immunity [43,46].",
              "However, it is still difficult to clearly confirm the effect of herd immunity on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to the routine use of bacterial isolation to determine pneumococcal serotypes [47].",
              "More sensitive techniques, such as qPCR, would be required for a better evaluation.",
              "Regardless of indirect protective capacity, adults and the elderly are usually colonized and have pneumococcal disease caused by a wider variety of serotypes than children [48,49].",
              "Therefore, current PCVs do not meet the specific needs of these populations.",
              "Currently, new vaccines are being studied which aim at broader protection for serotypes not included in licensed PCVs.",
              "Vaccines with 11, 12, 15 and 20 serotypes are in advanced stages of clinical trials in humans, having already demonstrated safety and tolerability in addition to non-inferior induction of antibodies and opsonophagocytosis of pneumococci compared to results obtained with PCV10 and PCV13.",
              "Moreover, promising results for the new serotypes included were obtained for children, adults and elderly people [50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57].",
              "In the pre-clinical phase, several other conjugate vaccines, with up to 30 serotypes, are under study [58,59].",
              "In order to predict the formulation of new PCVs, it is possible to propose the inclusion of serotypes with the highest probability to increase their incidence in diseases according to PS characteristics.",
              "For example, capsule monosaccharides with lower carbon content or molecules with a pronounced negative charge are able to better evade the immune system [60].",
              "However, several other variables can interfere with this prediction.",
              "For example, it is not possible to guarantee that new PCVs will have the same impact in serotype reduction and replacement as vaccines already in use in the population.",
              "For these reasons, new PCVs would need to constantly increase their valence, which leads to the question of if developing and using these vaccines is applicable in the long term.",
              "The need for continuous increases in PCV valence also involves a problem with conjugation.",
              "The crucial issue of a PCV is the binding process of a PS to a carrier protein that can induce a more effective immune response than the PS alone [61].",
              "The qualitative and quantitative increase of these molecules in the immunizing formulation can cause immune response interferences, both in the vaccine itself, and in other vaccines administered previously, jointly, and subsequently.",
              "These interferences can cause an imbalance in several arms of the immune response, so they must be readjusted to each new vaccine formulation.",
              "Therefore, the continuous addition of new PS in pneumococcal vaccines may be limited by potential interference in childhood vaccine schedules [62,63].",
              "The most obvious difficulty about PCV manufacturing is the complexity and the high process cost.",
              "These issues lead to insufficient vaccination coverage in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), such as African and Asian countries, which in 2009 accounted for 95% of pneumococcal deaths [1].",
              "More than ten years after PCV licensure, sub-Saharan African countries still have the highest mortality rate in children under five years old, with the lowest decrease in trends of pneumonia, morbidity and mortality among all countries [64].",
              "These data are also a direct consequence of vaccines based on Northern Hemisphere-prevalent serotypes that do not fully represent the needs of countries with a wider spectrum of serotypes causing disease, such as low-income countries (LIC) [65].",
              "Simpler and cheaper new vaccine strategies based on more conserved antigens could provide serotype-independent protection.",
              "These vaccines would provide protection from the early stages of pneumococcal carriage to the stages of invasive disease through strategies that induce different immune responses.",
              "A vaccine based on protein antigens would be able to protect against all Spn considering the selection of highly conserved proteins that must be present in most clinical isolates [66].",
              "In addition, the manufacturing process should be simpler and cheaper than for PCV [67], providing broad access to populations from LMIC.",
              "Their potential benefits depend on the ability to induce antibody production and cellular immune responses that will prevent carriage and disease [68,69].",
              "The first step towards the selection of protein antigens is the extensive knowledge of the role of virulence factors of Spn [70].",
              "The first virulence mechanism during the infection process is the reversible phase variation between transparent and opaque phenotypes, which occurs during carriage and invasion.",
              "The transparent phase predominates and seems to be required for carriage in the nasopharynx, where capsule expression is reduced to facilitate adhesion to epithelial cells, promoting colonization and expansion of the colonies.",
              "The expected response of protein vaccines is based on the recognition of the exposed molecules at this stage by antibodies and Th17 cells, leading to reduced colonization and, consequently, invasive diseases.",
              "It is also expected that they induce herd effect in the population [3,69,71,72].",
              "The opaque phase predominates during invasion, with increases in capsule thickness promoted by higher production of PS.",
              "This mechanism protects bacteria from opsonophagocytosis by covering most of the epitopes and avoiding antibody attachment to the cell surface [73,74,75].",
              "Protection against pneumococcal diseases is mainly mediated by high levels of antibodies and is also dependent on the recruitment of immune cells, especially neutrophils [76,77,78].",
              "Some protein antigens can be recognized by the immune system independently of phase variation, and several have been considered as potential antigens for a new generation of vaccines: Recently, several proposals of protein-based vaccines have advanced from the pre-clinical phase to clinical trials in humans (Table 1).",
              "Here, we review strategies that have thus far undergone clinical trials, but it is important to remember that there are many other proteins that were tested only in animal models.",
              "A phase I study used a vaccine based on several pneumococcal surface antigens, including PspA, pilus proteins and PdT, obtained by purification from bacteria that were cultivated in conditions leading to upregulated expression of these proteins.",
              "This non-adjuvanted vaccine was considered safe in adults and demonstrated a significant increase in IgG titers against several Spn antigens.",
              "In addition, serum from immunized individuals was capable to neutralize Ply hemolytic activity in different serotypes [89].",

              "PdT proved to be highly immunogenic, and serum from immunized individuals was able to neutralize Ply activity [66].",
              "PhtD immunization was also safe and immunogenic;",
              "however, adverse reactions and induction of antibodies proved to be dose-dependent [67].",
              "Other formulations containing two or three antigens have also been extensively tested in phase I clinical trials.",
              "The administration of PcpA + PhtD in two doses with three concentration levels for each protein, combined or not with aluminum hydroxide, were tested.",
              "All formulations proved to be safe with a considerable increase in antibody levels, which reached a plateau with the intermediate concentration of each protein.",
              "Furthermore, the addition of an adjuvant was not able to increase the immune response and was shown to be more reactogenic in adults [88].",
              "Immune sera from volunteers were shown to protect mice in a passive immunization model against serotype 3 Spn (strains A66.",
              "1 and WU2) [79].",
              "In another study, PdT + PhtD + PcpA was administered to adults, toddlers, and infants, with or without an adjuvant.",
              "All formulations were well tolerated in the three age groups and capable of inducing antibodies against all antigens.",
              "In infants, the target population of the vaccine, three doses with an adjuvant were necessary to obtain the best humoral response [90].",
              "Another promising strategy is to complement PCVs with protein candidates (Table 1).",
              "This approach was performed using PdT and PhtD administered with PCV10 in phase I and II studies in adults, toddlers and infants with two doses and a booster dose.",
              "The formulation proved to be safe and effective, inducing an increase in the levels of anti-Ply and anti-PhtD antibodies and not negatively affecting the response to PS [81,82,91].",
              "These proteins were also co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix Hexa, GSK), a vaccine commonly present in childhood vaccination schedules, and no differences were observed in the immune response for this vaccine [91].",
              "However, this formulation did not lead to a reduction in nasopharyngeal carriage in infants in The Gambia [92].",
              "In another study, PdT and PhtD were co-administered with PCV13 in Native American infants, generating a robust antibody response against the proteins used.",
              "However, efficacy against acute otitis media and acute LRTI was not verified in this population [93].",
              "PdT and PhtD were also used as PS carrier proteins in a phase I study with an elderly population.",
              "For the 8 polysaccharides included in the formulation, only 2 (19A and 22F) were conjugated to pneumococcal proteins.",
              "The results demonstrated the vaccine safety in this age group and the ability to increase antibodies against the proteins.",
              "However, the antibody induction was greater in the population immunized with the proteins alone.",
              "Regarding the response to 19A and 22F conjugates, both were shown to be immunogenic, with increased opsonophagocytic activity after two doses when compared to the PPV23, indicating that PhtD and PdT can improve the response against pneumococcus [80].",
              "An alternative to purified protein vaccines is live-vector based vaccines (Table 1), such as the one that underwent a phase I study where live-attenuated Salmonella typhi strains were used as vectors for oral PspA delivery in adults.",
              "Immunization was shown to be safe and well tolerated;",
              "however, these vaccines were not able to induce anti-PspA antibodies, probably due to pre-existing antibodies against the vector in participants [68].",
              "A second alternative is the classic whole cell vaccine (Table 1), which presents a wide variety of antigens in their native form, is self-adjuvanted by presenting toll-like receptor agonist molecules, and is a good choice of vaccine for the immunization of children in LIC due to its low manufacturing cost [69,94,95].",
              "It is expected that in countries with a high rate of colonization in early childhood, these vaccines could reduce pneumococcal colonization in the nasopharynx, maintaining the bacterial density at a minimum [69] and preventing the spread of new serotypes.",
              "The first human trial was carried out to verify the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a whole cell vaccine from a non-encapsulated strain, adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide and administered in three doses in adults.",
              "The results demonstrated that the vaccine was well tolerated and induced B and T cell responses as well as antibodies against Ply and PspA in 75% of the participants who received the highest dose used in the study.",
              "Furthermore, the antibodies demonstrated a protective capacity through the neutralization of Ply toxicity and by passive immunization of mice challenged with Spn serotype 3 (A66.",
              "1) [95].",
              "The generalization of results obtained from clinical trials should be done with caution, as differences between populations can lead to different vaccine efficacy results.",
              "In LMIC, differences in nutrition and basic sanitary and living conditions can modify the response to vaccines [69,81], as in the case of children from The Gambia, who present with pneumococcal carriage since early infancy, a situation that does not occur in European children [92].",
              "In the elderly, immunosenescence is a widely known condition that reduces vaccine effectiveness in this population [80,96].",
              "New generations of vaccines that are not based on PS will have important regulatory barriers to overcome, as the ideal endpoints and correlates of protection for these studies have not yet been defined [97].",
              "These new vaccines may not have their protection based on antibodies that induce opsonophagocytosis, such as PCV, but on several other immune responses that would also be able to reduce carriage and/or pneumococcal disease [69].",
              "In 2019, the world observed the spread and the magnification of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.",
              "In response to that, many groups started to use technologies they have been working on for years to fight the virus.",
              "Some first in-human approved technologies got more attention, such as the mRNA-based vaccines that received the Emergency Use Listing between December 2020 and April 2021, but there are several other candidates at different stages of clinical trials [101,102].",
              "Additionally, in this period, vaccines based on non-replicating viral vectors containing recombinant DNA received the same approval, becoming another important option for vaccine technology [103].",
              "These important advancements brought us new opportunities to facilitate development and approval of new vaccines against different pathogens.",
              "Emergency use of vaccines based on these new technologies will certainly impact the field of vaccine development against several pathogens, including pneumococci.",
              "Protective responses against viral and bacterial pathogens usually differ, but since most vaccines approved against SARS-CoV-2 rely on the induction of antibodies, such technologies may be effective against extracellular bacteria as well.",
              "Thinking about the development process of mRNA vaccines, the mRNA by itself has low efficiency in inducing protection, but combined with other techniques, such as polymer- or lipid-based nanoparticles, this kind of formulation can have a 60 to 95% efficiency in transfection rates, with a peak of protein production around 5 h after the administration [104].",
              "Depending on the composition and route of administration, the potential of expression of antigens at sites different from the inoculation can also lead to a broad and long-lasting protection against diseases, especially in early stages of infection in the mucosa, with a rapid response against the pathogen [105,106,107,108].",
              "Data have indicated that there is a similar immunological response induced by mRNA vaccines in both young and older adults, and recent trials have further confirmed that an identical response occurs in adolescents [109,110,111,112].",
              "In recent clinical trials, this kind of vaccine has shown the best effectiveness when compared to other vaccines used against COVID-19, with a high antibody titer and stimulation of a cellular response polarized to Th1 [113,114].",
              "The induced immune response can also be improved by the employment of an amplifying RNA sequence, which has a promoter sequence in the same molecule (self-amplifying RNA) or in another molecule at the same site (trans-amplifying RNA) that is responsible for producing more RNA [115].",
              "Another interesting point of mRNA vaccines is their easy exchangeable application, exemplified by the announcement by Moderna TX of a phase 1 clinical trial with two HIV vaccine candidates based on the successfully developed platform (ClinicalTrials.",
              "gov Identifier: {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT05001373\",\"term_id\":\"NCT05001373\"}}NCT05001373) [116].",
              "Other groups are also working on development of mRNA-based vaccines against HIV, influenza, Zika, chikungunya, and other pathogens with promising results [108,117,118,119].",
              "At the same level of importance of the mRNA application, nanotechnology applied to protein antigens has been explored in vaccine development for a long time against several pathogens, including pneumococci.",
              "The variety of components used to produce nanoparticles (NP) is enormous, from biodegradable polymers and lipids to inorganic materials, such as gold and silver NP [120,121].",
              "The production of NPs has also many platforms to work with: emulsions with natural or synthetic molecules, such as polymers and lipids;",
              "self-assembling proteins particles (SAPP), which are protein monomers bound together to form blocs at the nanoscale size;",

              "This list can increase in upcoming months, with at least two other vaccines based on NPs with recombinant proteins and five others based on VLP in different stages of clinical trials [102].",
              "There are many examples of nanovaccines that have been applied against several pathogens, such as human papillomavirus, Ebola, influenza, Leishmania, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and many others [120,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131].",
              "In fact, a good effort has been applied to develop next-generation pneumococcal vaccines based on many platforms, including NPs [132,133].",
              "In one study, the process of a mineralized Ply fused with the same protein without the inorganic component, forming a calcium phosphate NP, substantially increased protein thermal stability and resistance to proteases [134,135].",
