    "query": "What was the inspiration behind the famous Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci?",
    "response": "The inspiration behind the famous Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci is not entirely clear, as there are different theories and interpretations about the identity and meaning of the portrait. One of the most widely accepted views is that the painting depicts **Lisa del Giocondo** (n\u00e9e Gherardini), the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant, who commissioned Leonardo to paint her portrait[^1^]. However, some scholars have suggested other possible sitters, such as Leonardo's mother, his assistant, or even himself in drag[^2^].\n\nThe painting is also admired for its innovative technique and style, such as the use of **sfumato** (fine shading) to create a realistic and expressive face, the **three-quarter view** that broke from the traditional profile pose, and the **harmonious integration** of the sitter and the landscape behind her[^1^]. The painting has influenced many artists over the centuries, who have reinterpreted, parodied, or paid homage to Leonardo's masterpiece in various media and genres[^3^] [^4^]. The painting has also inspired songs, poems, novels, films, and even scientific research[^4^].\n\nThe Mona Lisa is considered one of the most famous and valuable works of art in history, and it attracts millions of visitors every year at the **Louvre Museum** in Paris, where it is displayed behind bulletproof glass[^1^]. The painting has also been subject to theft, vandalism, and conspiracy theories[^2^]. The Mona Lisa's enigmatic smile and mysterious gaze have fascinated and puzzled viewers for centuries, making her a universal symbol of beauty, mystery, and culture[^5^].",

              "Our editors will review what you\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.",
              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the Mona Lisa\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous possibilities, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo\u2014hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "The Mona Lisa hangs behind bulletproof glass in a gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it has been a part of the museum\u2019s collection since 1804.",
              "It was part of the royal collection before becoming the property of the French people during the Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "The Mona Lisa is priceless.",
              "Any speculative price (some say over a billion dollars!)",
              "would probably be so high that not one person would be able or willing to purchase and maintain the painting.",
              "Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it.",
              "The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for the Mona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment.",
              "Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.",
              "Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece\u2019s celebrity, including its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and its tour to the U.",
              "S.",
              "in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.",
              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal.",
              "Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world\u2019s most famous painting.",
              "It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century.",
              "The sitter\u2019s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.",
              "The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape.",
              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter\u2019s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.",
              "The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting\u2014especially apparent in the sitter\u2019s faint smile\u2014reflects Leonardo\u2019s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo\u2019s vision.",
              "In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits.",
              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",
              "The sitter\u2019s identity has not been definitively proven.",
              "Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo\u2019s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa about 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "French King Francis I, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life, acquired the work after the artist\u2019s death, and it became part of the royal collection.",
              "For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "Following a period hanging in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",

              "Another ubiquitous cultural image is the Mona Lisa.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci's inexhaustible portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the 24-year-old mother of five and wife of a wealthy Florentine silk merchant who sat for the High Renaissance master in 1503, is doubtless the most famous work of art in the world.",
              "Yet how many of us have ever consciously noted the object in the painting that is closer to us than any other \u2013 the chair on which the mysterious woman sits?",
              "Never mind that the piece of furniture is the only thing that Leonardo's sitter grips in her hand (she's literally pointing at it with every finger she has), the chair must surely be the single most neglected aspect of the otherwise over-stared-at icon.",
              "Hiding in plain sight, it may also be the arrow that points the way to the work's deepest meanings.",
              "More like this: - The fresco with multiple identities - The secret toilet humour in a Titian painting - The tragedy of art's greatest supermodel For centuries, our attention has largely been focused elsewhere in the small (77 x 53cm/30 x 21in) oil-on-poplar panel, which Da Vinci never fully finished and is thought to have continued to tinker with obsessively until his death in 1519 \u2013 as if the painting's endless emergence were the work itself.",
              "A preoccupation principally with Mona Lisa's inscrutable smile is almost as old as the painting, and dates back at least to the reaction of the legendary Renaissance writer and historian Giorgio Vasari, who was born a few years after Da Vinci began work on the likeness.",
              "\"The mouth with its opening and with its ends united by the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the face,\" Vasari observed in his celebrated Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, \"seemed, in truth, to be not colours but flesh.",

              "He concluded: \"In this work of Leonardo, there was a smile so pleasing, that it was a thing more divine than human to behold, and it was held to be something marvellous, in that it was not other than alive.\"",
              "Many scholars have been fascinated by the mystery of Mona Lisa's smile (Credit: Alamy) The mesmerising mystery of Mona Lisa's smile and how Leonardo magically leveraged it into creating \"a thing more divine than human\" and yet \"not other than alive\" would prove too intense for many to bear.",
              "The 19th-Century French art critic Alfred Dumesnil confessed to finding the painting's paradox utterly paralysing.",
              "In 1854 he asserted that the subject's \"smile is full of attraction, but it is the treacherous attraction of a sick soul that renders sickness.",
              "This so soft a look, but avid like the sea, devours\".",
              "If legend is to be believed, the \"treacherous attraction\" of Mona Lisa's irresolvable smirk consumed too the soul of an aspiring French artist by the name of Luc Maspero.",
              "According to popular myth, Maspero, who allegedly ended his days by leaping from the window of his Paris hotel room, was driven to destructive distraction by the mute whispers of Mona Lisa's engrossingly gladsome lips.",
              "\"For years I have grappled desperately with her smile,\" he is said to have written in the note he left behind.",
              "\"I prefer to die.\"",
              "Not everyone, however, has been content to locate the centre of Mona Lisa's magnetising mystique in her enigmatic grin.",
              "The Victorian writer Walter Pater believed it was the \"delicacy\" with which her hands and eyelids are rendered that transfix and hypnotise us into believing that the work possesses preternatural power.",
              "\"We all know the face and hands of the figure,\" he observed in an article on Da Vinci in 1869, \"in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea\".",
              "Pater proceeds to meditate on the Mona Lisa in such a singularly intense way that in 1936 the Irish poet William Butler Yeats found himself compelled to seize a sentence from Pater's description, break it up into free-verse lines, and install them as the opening poem in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, which Yeats was then compiling.",
              "The passage that Yeats couldn't help co-opting begins: \"She is older than the rocks among which she sits;",
              "like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave;",
              "and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her;",
              "and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants, and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary;",
              "and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes.\"",
              "The portrait \"lives\", Pater concludes, \"only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands\".",
              "Some viewers are as transfixed by Mona Lisa's hands as by her face (Credit: Alamy) Pater's description still astounds.",
              "Unlike Dumesnil and the doomed Maspero before him, Pater sees past the seductive snare of the portrait's smile to a larger vitality that percolates as if from deep below the surface.",
              "Contending that the painting depicts a figure suspended in ceaseless shuttle between the here-and-now and some otherworldly realm that lies beyond, Pater pinpoints the mystical essence of the panel's perennial appeal: its surreal sense of eternal flux.",
              "Like Vasari, Pater bears witness to a breathing and pulsing presence \u2013 \"changing lineaments\" \u2013 that transcends the inert materiality of the portrait's making.",
              "Key to the force of Pater's language is an insistence on aquatic imagery that reinforces the fluidity of the sitter's elusive self (\"faint light under the sea\", \"a diver in deep seas\", and \"trafficked.",
              ".",
              ".",

              "Perhaps she is.",
              "There is reason to think that such a reading, which sees the sitter as a shape-shifting spring of eternal resurgence, is precisely what Leonardo intended.",
              "Flanked on either side by bodies of flowing water that the artist has ingeniously positioned in such a way as to suggest that they are aspects of his sitter's very being, Da Vinci's subject has a strangely submarine quality to her that is accentuated by the algae green dress she wears \u2013 an amphibious second skin that has only grown murkier and darker with time.",
              "Pivoting her stare slightly to her left to meet ours, Mona Lisa is poised upon not just any old bench or stool, but a deep-seated perch known popularly as a pozzetto chair.",
              "Meaning \"little well\", the pozzetto introduces a subtle symbolism into the narrative that is as revealing as it is unexpected.",
              "By placing Mona Lisa on a 'little well', surrounded by water, Da Vinci could be drawing on earlier spiritual connections with springs (Credit: Alamy) Suddenly, the waters we see meandering with a mazy motion behind Mona Lisa (whether belonging to an actual landscape, such as the valley of the Italian River Arno, as some historians believe, or entirely imaginary, as others contend) are no longer distant and disconnected from the sitter, but are an essential resource that sustain her existence.",
              "They literally flow into her.",
              "By situating Mona Lisa inside a \"little well\", Da Vinci transforms her into an ever-fluctuating dimension of the physical universe she occupies.",
              "Art historian and leading Da Vinci expert Martin Kemp has likewise detected a fundamental connection between Mona Lisa's depiction and the geology of the world she inhabits.",
              "\"The artist was not literally portraying the prehistoric or future Arno,\" Kemp asserts in his study Leonardo: 100 Milestones (2019), \"but was shaping Lisa's landscape on the basis of what he had learned about change in the 'body of the Earth', to stand alongside the implicit transformations in the body of the woman as a 'lesser world' or microcosm.\"",
              "Mona Lisa isn't sitting before a landscape.",
              "She is the landscape.",
              "Drawing from a well As with all visual symbols employed by Leonardo, the pozzetto chair is multivalent and serves more than merely to link Mona Lisa with the artist's well-known fascination with the hydrological forces that shape the Earth.",
              "The subtle insinuation of a \"little well\" in the painting as the very channel through which Mona Lisa emerges into consciousness repositions the painting entirely in cultural discourse.",
              "No longer is this a straightforwardly secular portrait but something spiritually more complex.",
              "Portrayals of women \"at the well\" are a staple throughout Western art history.",
              "Old Testament stories of Eliezar meeting Rebekah at a well and of Jacob meeting Rachel at the well went on to become especially popular in the 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries, as everyone from Bartolome\u0301 Esteban Murillo to Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo to William Holman Hunt tried their hand at one or other of the narratives.",
              "There are many depictions in art of people at wells, such as Christ and the Samaritan Woman (1310-11) by Duccio di Buoninsegna (Credit: Alamy) Moreover apocryphal depictions of the New Testament Annunciation (the moment when the Archangel Gabriel informs the Virgin Mary that she will give birth to Christ) as occurring at the site of a spring were a mainstay among Medieval manuscript illustrators, and may even have inspired the oldest surviving visual portrayal of Mary.",
              "An endlessly elastic emblem, as Walter Pater intimated, Mona Lisa is doubtless capable of absorbing all such reflected resonances and many more besides.",
              "There is no one she isn't.",
              "But perhaps the most pertinent parallel between Da Vinci's Mona Lisa and pictorial precursors is one that can be drawn with the many representations of a biblical episode in which Jesus finds himself at a well, engaged in cryptic conversation with a woman from Samaria.",
              "In the Gospel of John, Jesus makes a distinction between the water that can be drawn from the natural spring \u2013 water which will inevitably leave one \"thirsty\" \u2013 and the \"living water\" that he can provide.",
              "Where water from a well can only sustain a perishable body, 'living water' is capable of quenching the eternal spirit.",
              "Notable depictions of the scene by the Medieval Italian painter Duccio di Buoninsegna and by the German Renaissance master Lucas Cranach the Elder tend to seat Jesus directly on the wall of the well, suggesting his dominion over the fleeting elements of this world.",
              "By placing his female sitter notionally inside the well, however, Da Vinci confounds the tradition, and suggests instead a merging of material and spiritual realms \u2013 a blurring of the here and hereafter \u2013 into a shared plane of eternal emergence.",
              "In Da Vinci's enthralling narrative, Mona Lisa is herself a miraculous surge of \"living water\", serenely content in the knowledge of her own raging infinitude.",

              "Some scholars have noted, however, that, as interest in the Renaissance grew in the 19th century, Leonardo became more popularly seen not only as a very good painter but also as a great scientist and inventor whose designs prefigured contemporary inventions.",
              "Many of his so-called inventions were later debunked, and his contributions to science and architecture came to be seen as small, but the myth of Leonardo as a genius has continued well into the 21st century, contributing to the Mona Lisa\u2019s popularity.",

              "He and two other workers took the portrait from the wall, hid with it in a closet overnight, and ran off with it in the morning.",
              "Unable to sell the painting because of the media attention, Peruggia hid it in the false bottom of a trunk until his capture.",
              "He was tried, convicted, and imprisoned for the theft while the painting toured Italy before it made its triumphant return to the Louvre.",
              "By then, many French people had come to regard the work as a national treasure that they had lost and recovered.",

              "Some scholars argue that Marcel Duchamp\u2019s playful defacement of a postcard reproduction in 1919 brought attention back to the Mona Lisa and started a trend that would make the painting one of the most-recognized in the world.",

              "Recent X-ray tests of the Baptism show that, whereas Verrocchio still painted his figures as contours in tempera on a white lead base, Leonardo used thin, superimposed glazes of colored oils in the sections assigned to him.",

              "Adoration paintings were popular in Florence, because they gave artists the opportunity to dress the three kings from the East in the rich cloth and silk that had made the city famous.",
              "But Leonardo\u2019s design rejected the typical Quattrocento stereotype of the subject, with Mary and the newborn Jesus in center foreground, while worshippers dutifully line up to pay their respects.",

              "Unfortunately, this quality was entirely lost on the good friars.",
              "The panel was left unfinished\u2014and not, as is so often assumed by historians, because Leonardo walked away from it.",
              "On the contrary: it is more likely that the monks, shocked by such an iconoclastic work, terminated the commission and went looking for another, more conventional artist.",
              "There followed the long interlude in Milan, at the court of Duke Ludovico \u201cIl Moro\u201d Sforza, where Leonardo was fe\u0302ted as a celebrity impresario, charged with a steady stream of entertainment including sets, costumes and vainglorious monuments to Sforza rule.",
              "In between, Leonardo was also called upon to produce portraits of various Milanese beauties, specifically two of the Duke\u2019s mistresses, Cecilia Gallerani and Lucrezia Crivelli.",
              "It is because of this fortunate happenstance that Leonardo directed his prodigious talent to the problem of secular portraiture.",
              "We should remember that secular portraiture\u2014that is, the depiction of everyday citizens, rather than prominent kings, aristocrats, or clerics\u2014was still a recent development in Italy at that time.",
              "Unlike in Northern Europe, and particularly among the rich burghers of Flanders, the idea of having one\u2019s portrait painted simply because one could afford it, was a relative novelty.",
              "The Quattrocento Renaissance accelerated the spread of the genre, but demanded that portrait artists\u2014like their brethren in architecture and sculpture\u2014follow the example of classical models.",

              "Though at this point Leonardo\u2019s portrait style was already fully developed, with a posture and placement of the hands that clearly anticipate the Mona Lisa, the Marquess\u2019s face is rigorously turned away so that she can present herself in the same manner as the Roman worthies portrayed in her extensive coin collection.",

              "The subject is uncertain, but in the end Leonardo produced a large drawing for a Virgin and Child with St.",

              "For whatever reason, he left Borgia\u2019s campaign and returned to Florence in March of 1503\u2014without a job, without commissions and, apparently, without money.",
              "That month, he took the unusual step of withdrawing fifty gold florins from his savings account at the Ospedale di S.",

              "iii This is when a character named Niccolo\u0300 Machiavelli enters the story.",
              "A secretary of the Second Chancery in Florence, which at the time was governed by Gonfaloniere Piero Soderini, Machiavelli would later garner fame for his controversial book The Prince, largely based on his close observations of the ruthless doings of Cesare Borgia.",
              "In fact, it was during Machiavelli\u2019s brief sojourn in Cesare\u2019s entourage that he had first been introduced to Leonardo da Vinci.",
              "Florence was mired in a war of attrition against its erstwhile vassal, the city of Pisa.",
              "Machiavelli believed he had come up with a brilliant plan to bring the war to a close: by diverting Pisa\u2019s lifeline, the Arno River, thus depriving the city from its trade and supplies.",
              "Leonardo obliged his friend with a series of designs, some of which have survived.",
              "Despite Machiavelli\u2019s efforts on Leonardo\u2019s behalf, the Signoria would ultimately accepted Leonardo\u2019s designs but not the man: the execution of the scheme, which by far exceeded the manpower and resources of Florence, was entrusted to a Maestro Colombino, a waterworks official.",
              "Perhaps Leonardo\u2019s reputation as a man who had abandoned not one, but two major commissions from prominent monasteries in the city played a role in the decision.",
              "Machiavelli may have felt a sense of obligation towards his friend.",
              "Indeed, it\u2019s attractive to think that it was Machiavelli who introduced Leonardo to another civic commission, namely a large fresco of the Battle of Anghiari\u2014one of Florence\u2019s few victories in its rather checkered military history\u2014which Soderini wished to have painted in the newly built Grand Council hall of the Palazzo della Signoria (now known as the Palazzo Vecchio).",
              "Machiavelli\u2019s role is evident from the fact that it was his secretary, Agostino Vespucci, who provided Leonardo with a detailed description of the battle, translated from a Latin elegy entitled Trophaeum Anglaricum (\u2018Victory at Anghiari\u2019), originally written by the humanist Leonardo di Piero Dati.",
              "The Grand Council Hall in the Palazzo della Signoria, which was substantially remodeled and enlarged by Vasari in 1537, and renamed the Salone dei Cinquecento (\u201cHall of the Five Hundred\u201d), for the purpose of extolling the benefits of Medici rule.",
              "Whether Machiavelli was also in a position to swing the support of the Signoria, the Florentine government, behind the selection of its wayward son Leonardo da Vinci, is debatable.",
              "Gonfaloniere Soderini favored a prodigy of Lorenzo de Medici, a brash young artist named Michelangelo Buonarroti.",
              "No doubt there were others among the Signoria who bridled at the idea of conferring this important commission on an artist who had yet to complete a major painting in his native town\u2014in glaring contrast to the works he\u2019d seen fit to finish in the capital of Florence\u2019s sworn enemy, the Duchy of Milan.",
              "Enter Francesco del Giocondo, a silk merchant who by 1503 had held four prominent positions in Florence\u2019s republican government, most recently in 1499 as a member of the advisory council of the Dodici Bonuomini.",
              "Giocondo and his extended family had connections throughout town;",
              "between 1480 and 1520, Giocondos held no less than forty positions at various levels of the Florentine government.",
              "iv Here was a man who could very well bring his influence to bear to grant Leonardo the Anghiari commission.",
              "But Giocondo was a shrewd businessman with a reputation for hardknuckle negotiating skills;",
              "a police document of 1510 describes him as confrontational, unscrupulous, and quite ruthless.",
              "v True to form, the merchant wanted something in return for his advocacy of Leonardo\u2019s talents.",
              "He wanted a small portrait of his young wife, Lisa del Giocondo, who had just presented him with their third child.",
              "It is very likely that at any other time in his life, Leonardo would have dismissed such a commission out of hand.",
              "He was a painter to the greatest courts of Italy, not a fawning petitioner to the mercantile parvenus of Florence.",
              "Most recently, he had fended off insistent demands from Isabelle d\u2019Este, the most formidable woman of her time, to paint her portrait\u2014and Isabella was Marquess of Mantua, not a Florentine housewife.",
              "But these were unusual times.",
              "Leonardo was subsisting from his savings at the Santa Maria Nuova, and the account was dwindling at an alarming rate.",
              "He needed to come up with a new source of revenue to support himself and his entourage, while demonstrating his bona fides to the city fathers.",
              "Giocondo was a man who could help him to accomplish both.",
              "The Via della Stufa in Florence, principal residence of the Giocondo family.",
              "Seen in this context, the claim by our leading witness, the 16th-century artist and author Giorgio Vasari, that \u201cLeonardo undertook to execute, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Monna Lisa, his wife,\u201d is eminently plausible.",
              "vi Giocondo was Leonardo\u2019s key to restoring his reputation in Florence and to receiving the biggest and most challenging art project in Italy since his Last Supper fresco in Milan of 1498.",
              "Nevertheless, Vasari\u2019s paragraph on the Mona Lisa commission has been under vigorous attack for some time, and for two reasons.",
              "One, it offers a detailed description of the painting, even though it is universally accepted that Vasari could have never seen the Louvre Mona Lisa, for the excellent reason that in the 1530\u2019s the Louvre portrait was already in France, a country Vasari never visited.",
              "And two, Vasari claims that the Mona Lisa portrait was left unfinished, though the Louvre panel is perhaps the most polished and complete of all of Leonardo\u2019s paintings.",
              "Consequently, Vasari\u2019s text was chalked up by many modern scholars as another example of the author\u2019s penchant for hyperbole and vivid imagination.",
              "But any serious student of Vasari\u2019s Lives of the Artists will recognize that, while the author might sometimes embellish his narrative, he would never go as far as to fabricate a two hundred-word description of a painting out of whole cloth.",
              "In fact, in all of Vasari\u2019s Vite, this detailed descriptive passage of the Mona Lisa is unprecedented.",
              "Indeed, the re-emergence of the Isleworth Mona Lisa from its long exile in a Swiss bank vault, and the subsequent authentication of the work as a genuine Leonardo by John Asmus and others, enables us to see Vasari\u2019s text in a dramatically new light.",
              "Every observer will be hard-pressed to recognize Vasari\u2019s description of the lady\u2019s \u201crosy and pearly tints\u201d in the gloomy hues of the Louvre Mona Lisa, even allowing for centuries of varnish, soot and dirt.",
              "But looking at the Isleworth Mona Lisa, Vasari\u2019s rapturous description of \u201cthat luster and watery sheen\u201d in the lady\u2019s eyes is spot on, just as her mouth does indeed \u201cunite the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the face\u201d and her nose, \u201cwith its beautiful nostrils, rosy and tender,\u201d truly appears to be alive.",
              "In sum, Vasari\u2019s description fits the Isleworth Mona Lisa to a remarkable degree, which strongly argues for the Isleworth portrait being an earlier version of the Mona Lisa.",
              "If we assume that Leonardo began to work on the portrait of La Gioconda in the spring of 1503, then it stands to reason that by the end of that year, when preparations for the Battle of Anghiari project began in earnest, the face and hands\u2014always the most important passages in a portrait\u2014would have been completed.",
              "But not much more was done to the portrait once Leonardo threw himself wholeheartedly in the challenging task of painting the huge fresco.",
              "That the Mona Lisa portrait was still unfinished in October of 1503 is borne out by the now-famous note written in a collection of Cicero\u2019s letters, entitled Epistulae ad Familiares (\u2018Letters to His Friends\u2019) published in Bologna in 1477.",
              "While reading the book, Machiavelli\u2019s secretary, Agostino Vespucci, came across a passage in which Cicero described how the Greek artist Apelles had begun to paint the portrait of the goddess Venus, but left it unfinished.",
              "Vespucci grabbed a pen and wrote in the margin, \u201cThat\u2019s the way Leonardo da Vinci works in all of his paintings, like, for example, the portrait of Lisa del Giocondo and Anne, the mother of the Virgin,\u201d referring to both the Mona Lisa and the ill-fated commission from the Servite monks of the Santissima Annunziata.",
              "The note clearly shows that at the time of Vespucci\u2019s writing, both of these works had been left unfinished as well.",
              "Vespucci was well aware of Leonardo\u2019s reputation for leaving things undone, for he added, \u201cWe will see what he\u2019s going to do with the chamber of the great council, the thing for which he\u2019s just come to terms with the gonfaloniere.",
              "\u201dvii This crucial piece of evidence has now solved two important issues in Mona Lisa scholarship: one, that the sitter of the Mona Lisa portrait is beyond question Lisa del Giocondo, as Vasari maintained all along, and two, that Leonardo left the Mona Lisa incomplete as he began his work on the Battle of Anghiari.",
              "For the next two and a half years, Leonardo was subsumed by the task of creating the vast Anghiari cartoon, and transferring the design to a fresco painting.",
              "The difficult project was made even more challenging by Leonardo\u2019s insistence of using the same type of oil-based glazes with which he had previously revolutionized the art of portraiture, rather than the usual, quick-drying tempera-based pigments on wet plaster.",
              "According to the anonymous Gaddiano, Leonardo created a concoction based on Pliny the Elder\u2019s book Natural History, using Greek pitch to seal the plaster wall.",
              "The experiment didn\u2019t work.",
              "The wall refused to absorb the oil-based pigments, and the paint began to drip and run.",
              "Paolo Giovio, historian and personal physician to Giulio di Giuliano de Medici, later wrote that the undercoat turned out to be \u201cresistant to paints mixed with walnut oil.",
              "\u201d As with the Last Supper, the fresco began to deteriorate almost as soon as Leonardo\u2019s brush left it.",
              "viii By early 1506, Leonardo recognized that the fresco that was to be the crowning achievement of his career was ruined.",
              "Battle of Anghiari, cartoon, ca.",
              "1505.",
              "Copy by Peter Paul Rubens, ca.",
              "1603.",
              "Deeply disappointed by the outcome of his labors, Leonardo once again set his sights on the city of his erstwhile glory: the Duchy of Milan.",
              "A perfect pretext presented itself: he and his Milanese collaborator, Ambrogio de Predis, were still owed payments for their work on the second version of the Virgin of the Rocks, which de Predis had delivered to the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception in 1502.",
              "The Confraternity claimed, however, that the painting was still \u201cunfinished.",
              "\u201d Ergo, Leonardo had to return to Milan and do whatever it took to see the client satisfied, and he and his partner paid.",
              "Leonardo, however, was not free to pull up the stakes and leave Florence on a whim.",
              "He was still under contract to the Signoria, the Florentine government, and they were not likely to let him go when the Anghiari fresco was still unfinished and in urgent need of repair.",
              "What followed in 1506, therefore, was a period of tense negotiations between Leonardo and representatives of the Signoria, which stretched over several months.",
              "I believe that during this period, when Leonardo needed every ally in the Florentine government to support his petition to leave for Milan, the urgency of the Giocondo commission once again presented itself.",
              "Throughout the preceding years, the unfinished portrait had probably been languishing in Leonardo\u2019s workshop once the master became absorbed in the problems of the Battle of Anghiari.",
              "I think we can also safely assume that Francesco del Giocondo, never a patient man, sent repeated missives to Leonardo\u2019s bottega at the Santa Maria Novella, inquiring about the status of his wife\u2019s portrait.",
              "But as long as Leonardo worked on the Battle of Anghiari, there was little Francesco could do: the interest of the state trumped everything else.",
              "However, with the news that Leonardo intended to depart from Florence, that particular alibi went out the window.",
              "Francesco had considerable influence among the Signoria, which could work in favor of Leonardo, or against him.",
              "Therefore, if Leonardo wanted to be free to pursue a job in Milan, there was no way he could get past Francesco del Giocondo, unless this client was appeased in some way.",
              "This is the moment when, I believe, Leonardo charged one of his assistants to complete the Mona Lisa portrait, and on an expedited basis.",
              "The meticulous care he usually applied to his work, even when it involved background elements painted by an assistant, had to make way for the urgency of this task.",
              "That is the only viable explanation for the rushed execution of the remainder of the Earlier Mona Lisa, particularly the background, which is notably inferior to the portrait figure itself.",
              "The artist charged with this task, I suspect, may have been Ferrando Spagnolo, \u2018Ferrando the Spaniard,\u2019 who had previously worked on the second version of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder (Buccleuch Collection).",

              "and after toiling over it for four years, he left it unfinished.",

              "But what about the Mona Lisa portrait in the Louvre?",
              "How did that come about?",
              "As almost all authors have noted, stylistically the Louvre portrait belongs to Leonardo\u2019s late period, roughly between 1507 and 1515.",
              "An important marker, in my opinion, is Leonardo\u2019s forced return to Florence in 1507, in order to fight a lawsuit by his half-brothers who attempted to deny him the inheritance of his uncle Francesco.",
              "Leonardo probably believed that the matter would be dealt with within the span of a few weeks;",
              "hence, he did not travel with his entourage of assistants.",
              "But the mood in Florence, and particularly the Signoria, was against him.",
              "The lawsuit dragged on for months, well into 1508, leaving Leonardo marooned in Florence with little to do, other than to appeal to various dignitaries\u2014including Charles d\u2019Amboise in Milan and Cardinal Ippolito d\u2019Este, the brother of Isabella\u2014for help in resolving the matter.",
              "This forced interlude was fortunate, however, in that it led to two initiatives.",
              "One, with plenty of time on his hands, Leonardo began to organize his notebooks.",
              "And two, he turned to the Ospedale di Santa Maria Nuova, a functioning hospital, to begin anatomical dissections of cadavers.",
              "By law, only the bodies of paupers or \u201cignoble\u201d corpses could be used for dissection, but Leonardo ignored this and, among others, dissected the bodies of various women.",
              "x In the months and years to come, he would produce some two hundred detailed anatomical studies, based on the autopsies of some thirty cadavers, most of which are now in the Royal Collection of Windsor Castle.",
              "xi In probing the mysteries of the female body, and that of unborn fetuses, Leonardo was inexorably drawn to the ultimate enigma: how a woman nurtures and sustains life within her.",
              "Or as he had written in Milan, he wanted to understand \u201cthe conception of man,\u201d and study \u201cthe form of the womb, and how the child lives in it, and to what stage it resides in it, and in what way it is given life and food.",

              "The origins of the Saint Anne are still shrouded in mystery, as Vincent Delieuvin, the author of a major 2012 exhibition at the Louvre, attests.",

              "Another painting he kept in his personal possession until the end is the Louvre Mona Lisa.",
              "Perhaps this Mona Lisa, a second version based on the original portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, should be seen in this same context: Leonardo\u2019s interest in maternity and the creative forces of nature.",
              "That he would produce two versions of the same painting is by no means unusual.",
              "Throughout his career, Leonardo (together with his assistants) would paint multiple versions of The Virgin of the Rocks, The Madonna of the Yarnwinder and the Saint Anne, to name a few, arguably to compensate for the fact that Leonardo\u2019s workshop (in contrast to his competitors) produced only a small number of originals.",
              "The Louvre Mona Lisa, ca.",
              "1508-1515 As several scholars have noted, the enigmatic landscape of the Louvre Mona Lisa seems to illustrate Leonardo\u2019s idea that the human body has analogous forms in nature.",

              "\u201d It therefore seems plausible to think that the Louvre Mona Lisa is the culmination of Leonardo\u2019s growing interest in the symbiosis between motherhood and nature, and the idea that both stem from a common source: the mystery of creation.",
              "If this assumption is correct, then the Louvre Mona Lisa is no longer a portrait in the true sense, but rather an allegorical meditation on womanhood as the font of life, in harmony with the awesome, Genesis-like depiction of Creation around her.",
              "So the inevitable conclusion is that Leonardo painted two portraits of Mona Lisa: one, the Isleworth (or Earlier) version of 1503-1507, as a commissioned likeness of Lisa del Giocondo;",

              "But as I\u2019ve discussed previously, as famous as Mona is, it\u2019s really hard to enjoy the painting itself if you have the pleasure--or even displeasure, some think-- of viewing her in person at the Louvre in Paris.",
              "It\u2019s all barriers, bulletproof glass, guards, and -- when not in a pandemic--hordes of visitors pushing and prodding to get to the front row to get as close a look as possible.",

              "Surely, these acquaintances have pressed, surely there\u2019s something going on behind this painting, something that explains why it\u2019s such a world-famous piece.",
              "And I understand why these questions bubble up.",

              "right?",
              "Back in the very first episode of ArtCurious, I gave you the background on Leonardo himself as well as the generally -accepted theories surrounding the creation of this work, but I\u2019m happy to give you a bit of a refresher here.",
              "Most art historians believe that Leonardo da Vinci began this portrait around 1503 or 1504, but that he never officially finished it, and indeed, he appears to have worked on it on and off for the better part of two decades, tweaking brushstrokes here, changing an element there.",
              "He took it with him when he moved to France under the purview of King Francis I.",
              "And it was Francis who purchased the work from an assistant of Leonardo, after the master\u2019s death in 1519.",
              "And that\u2019s why this work by an Italian artist has called France her home for nearly half a millennium, as it carried on through the French monarchy, through Napoleon\u2019s reign, and as one of the attractions at the Louvre after that royal palace was officially converted into a museum.",
              "One of the reasons that Mona is such a big draw is the acclaim that arose over her theft in 1911, which we\u2019ve discussed in depth.",
              "But here\u2019s another reason why she\u2019s a big deal, though it\u2019s probably not a reason that pops to the front of mind for the average Louvre attendee.",
              "But it is a fact: there actually aren\u2019t all that many surviving works by Leonardo da Vinci.",
              "Leonardo, that intensely curious polymath, an inventor, poet, astronomer, architect, engineer, proto-paleontologist, etc.",
              "etc.",
              "etc.",
              "was a painter, true, and yet it was just one of his many talents and interests.",
              "I often say that the term \u201cRenaissance Man,\u201d meaning someone with a broad and/or intense knowledge and skill base, was basically invented to describe Leonardo.",
              "But there was a flip side to his undying curiosity.",
              "He was a procrastinator extraordinaire, putting a project--like the Mona Lisa--aside to work on something else, perhaps something totally different, like plans for diverting the Arno River in Florence, or conceiving of a redesign of the cathedral in Milan.",
              "He had his hand in everything and that\u2019s what he liked-- he liked, it seems, to begin projects.",
              "But carrying them to fruition was much harder, so he\u2019d stop working on something when a new, and potentially more exciting, idea arose.",
              "Spread thin, serving many different patrons as well as his own busy mind, Leonardo was just slammed.",
              "He didn\u2019t have enough time to churn out an incredible number of paintings.",
              "He also worked slowly and methodically, as a perfectionist is sometimes wont to do.",
              "There\u2019s also his experimentation to consider.",
              "Leonardo merged his scientific and artistic minds frequently by trying new things, especially new materials and techniques, with occasionally disastrous results--as we discussed in our \u201cLittle Curious\u201d episode detailing his lost painting of the Battle of Anghiari in Florence.",
              "And this combination of perfectionism, experimentation, and procrastination--as well as the passage of time-- means that there are less than two dozen surviving paintings by one of the most famous artists of the Renaissance.",
              "And of those two dozen, probably about half are generally accepted as being by Leonardo himself, other than a follower or imitator.",
              "So, yeah: any Leonardo painting is a big deal.",
              "But it would be a lie to say that any of Leonardo\u2019s paintings is as big a deal as Mona is.",
              "Mona\u2019s part in Leonardo\u2019s artistic output is herself in rarefied company as one of the few surviving portraits attributed to the artist.",
              "Most of Leonardo\u2019s surviving paintings are religious in nature, which makes sense, as commissions in a highly Catholic country.",
              "But Leonardo surely subsidized his livelihood with commissioned portraits, too, and that\u2019s where Mona Lisa comes in.",
              "And while other works are super-widely thought to be portraits completed by Leonardo, like his gorgeous Lady with an Ermine from around 1489, and the portrait of Ginevra de\u2019 Benci, from around 1474 or so, those and other portraits have been a bit controversial in the past, though they are basically widely accepted as Leonardos now.",
              "But that level of controversy has never haunted Mona.",
              "She\u2019s always been a Leonardo.",
              "What\u2019s controversial about her, though, is who Mona really is.",
              "And we\u2019ll get into that controversy right after this quick break.",
              "Stay with us, grab some cool deals and coupons, and support our show.",
              "Welcome back to ArtCurious.",
              "When I typically talk about the Mona Lisa, I have a pat answer about her identity.",
              "When I was a budding art historian in college and beyond, I was told that we know the details of the woman we call Mona Lisa.",
              "A real woman, named Lisa Gherardini, is the sitter in this picture.",
              "Gherardini was the wife of a very wealthy Florentine silk merchant, named Francesco del Giocondo, who purportedly commissioned the artist to paint his wife\u2019s portrait.",
              "And there\u2019s not an insubstantial amount of evidence to back this up, beginning first with the title of the painting.",
              "Mona Lisa.",
              "Mona is a contraction of the Italian word for \u201clady, or my lady, \u201c Madonna-- which was then abbreviated down to \u201cMona\u201d-- kind of the way we say \u201cma\u2019am\u201d in English, instead of the more formal sounding \u201cmadam.",
              "\u201d And yeah, the lady\u2019s name was Lisa.",
              "My Lady Lisa: Mona Lisa.",
              "Need more convincing?",
              "If you go to the Louvre, you\u2019ll see her noted additionally as La Joconde, which is the French translation of the phrase La Gioconda, or the Gioconda woman-- the wife, then, of Francesco del Giocondo.",
              "(The Louvre, by the way, totally stands by this identification, with the wall label reading Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, called La Joconde or Mona Lisa.",
              "We actually know a little bit about the potential commissioning of this work, because we have some historical documentation of it.",
              "First up--get your drinks ready-- it\u2019s Giorgio Vasari, that semi-credible rascal who\u2019s the granddaddy of artist biographers.",
              "Vasari noted in his bio of Leo that, quote, \"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\"",
              "Unquote.",
              "And one of Leonardo\u2019s assistants, a man known by the name of Salai, had a painting called \u201cLa Gioconda\u201d listed as part of his estate after his 1524 death, which he inherited after Leonardo\u2019s death five years prior.",
              "So, there you have it.",
              "That\u2019s the backstory of the Mona Lisa.",
              "It seems pretty watertight to me.",
              "But for a not-insignificant portrait of the art world, there\u2019s always the question.",
              "Is this exact painting the one really known as \u201cMona Lisa?",
              "\u201d Or was it another painting?",
              "One that exists in limbo today as one of those \u201cmaybe Leonardos,\u201d or a lost work entirely?",
              "Maybe this painting has been misidentified all these years ago?",
              "So who would the sitter in this portrait be, if not Lisa Gherardini?",
              "I\u2019ve read many of them: she\u2019s Isabella of Aragon, the duchess of Milan;",
              "she\u2019s an even more famous Isabella-- Isabella d\u2019Este, the marquise of Mantua and a hugely important figure in both art and cultural history of Europe, who does have another unfinished chalk-and-pastel portrait by Leonardo to her name, also in the Louvre.",
              "Some say she\u2019s the same woman as in Leonardo\u2019s Lady with an Ermine, a noblewoman named Cecilia Gallerani.",
              "It\u2019s even been posited that Mona is based on the appearance of one of Leonardo\u2019s assistants and supposed lover.",

              "And I\u2019ll just put a little hint of my own out there that this won\u2019t be the last time we\u2019re talking about either Leonardo or Dan Brown in this season of the podcast.",
              "But part of the enduring interest in Dan Brown\u2019s book--and in its association with the Renaissance master-- is that Leonardo himself was fascinated by the workings of the human mind.",
              "Jason Rosenfeld, a professor of of art history at Marymount Manhattan College, argues, quote, \u201c[Leonardo] is interested in symbols, he is interested in puzzles, he is interested in keeping things kind of hidden, and this idea about the picture sort of relates to that, that is part of this whole mythologizing of Leonardo as someone who is playing tricks, who is always a step ahead of a viewer, and someone who is making you think of his works in a very different way.",
              "\u201d Unquote.",
              "At gatherings Leonardo would devise riddles, which he called \u201cprophecies,\u201d which he would share with the various courts he served;",
              "it\u2019s Leonardo as entertainer, and several of his \u201cprophecies\u201d still exist--like this one: Quite, \u201cSerpents of great length will be seen at a great height in the air, fighting with birds.",
              "\u201d unquote.",

              "\u201d Unquote.",
              "I never said that it translates well to a modern audience, but there you go.",
              "Leonardo was witty, a bit of a prankster, and he liked jokes.",
              "All of this makes some wonder: what\u2019s cleverer than obscuring your own identity and making everyone think that you actually painted a woman instead of yourself?",
              "What do we want to make of this idea of Leonardo-as-prankster, doing a gender performance as \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d whoever that is?",
              "We\u2019ll get into it when we come back from this short break.",
              "Welcome back to ArtCurious.",
              "It\u2019s entirely possible that this idea--that a jokester Leonardo disguised himself as a sallow, eyebrow-less lady and painted his own portrait-- had been floating around for a while, but it really caught fire beginning in 2010 with the publication of Leonardo\u2019s Hidden Face, a book co-written by artist Lillian F.",
              "Schwartz, writer Renzo Manetti, and art critic and Leonardo scholar Alessandro Vessozi.",
              "In this book, the authors posited the idea based on Lillian Schwartz and own modelings of Mona Lisa, something that had intrigued her for decades.",
              "In 1984, she scaled and bisected a (purported) Leonardo self-portrait called Portrait of a Man in Red Chalk and juxtaposed it next to the Mona Lisa.",
              "This combined image shows similarities between the eyes, forehead, nose, and mouths of the figures in both works.",
              "Thirty years later, with the combined use of computer programs, x-rays, anatomical analysis, the authors have updated Schwartz\u2019s original lo-fi experiment and found compelling similarities between the known Leonardo self-portrait drawing and Mona--most intriguing, that the figures appear to have the same supra-orbital ridge (or eyebrow ridge), associated anatomically most frequently with men.",
              "I know, I know.",
              "It\u2019s not super convincing to me, but it has been convincing to others.",
              "The team behind Mona Lisa\u2019s hidden face want to make it clear, though, that it\u2019s entirely possible that Mona began as a true portrait-- though not of Lisa Gherardini, they say, but Isabella of Aragon, and then opted to fuse his own facial features with the original image.",
              "To be fair, this wouldn\u2019t exactly be revolutionary, because artists use and re-use canvases, panels, even paper, all the time.",
              "And some scientists, like Pascal Cotte, have indeed uncovered some interesting underdrawings--including, perhaps, another face-- on the panel that was uncovered using multi-spectral analysis, as was reported last year in the Journal of Cultural Heritage.",
              "But whether or not that face belongs to Leonardo\u2019s is still up for grabs.",
              "All of this brings us back to the story at the top of the episode.",
              "2010, the same year that Leonardo\u2019s Hidden Face was published, that group of Italian scientists and historians petitioned to open the supposed grave of Leonardo, located in a chapel at the Chateau d\u2019Amboise in France\u2019s Loire Valley.",
              "And one of the reasons to open the grave was to explore the bones interred there and reconstruct the artist\u2019s face to see if it matches up in any way with Mona Lisa.",
              "It seems far-fetched, but this team of Italian scientists performed a similar reconstruction in 2009, when they came up with a computerized model of the face of the great poet Dante Alighieri, again based on cranial mapping.",
              "But with Leonardo, it has proved trickier, since he was buried in another country.",
              "And from most of my research, it doesn\u2019t exactly look like permission to exhume the supposed Leonardo remains was granted.",
              "Whoever is buried at Amboise is still buried there, though it must be noted that a little plaque nearby writes that it is indeed the purported--not 100% confirmed--remains of the artist.",
              "It doesn\u2019t appear that Leonardo has been exhumed quite yet, but people are still out there working on it.",
              "Who has been exhumed, though, is, potentially, someone with a link to Lisa Gherardini.",
              "In 2013, another team of researchers opened the family tomb of the Giocondo family with hopes of identifying not Lisa Gherardini herself, but her son.",
              "The hope was to use her son\u2019s DNA to match up with Lisa Gherardini\u2019s supposed remains, which had been found in a Florentine convent where Lisa had died in 1542.",
              "After that, the scientists hoped to do similar cranial mapping to create a visualization of Lisa\u2019s face that would then be compared to the Mona Lisa.",
              "Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work out, as the supposed remains of Lisa Gherardini were deemed too degraded to perform any DNA testing.",
              "And to make matters worse, it was discovered that no skull was located in Gherardini\u2019s tomb, which ultimately ruled out all hopes of facial reconstruction.",
              "So the final verification of the true identity of Mona Lisa still remains.",
              "Overall, though, Mona-who she really is, if she is really anyone at all or an amalgam or a symbol, or a portrayal of the artist himself, is just one of many, many mysteries surrounding this work of art.",
              "It\u2019s an important piece, a famous piece, so everybody has a thought about it.",
              "Alessandro Vezzosi, one of the authors of Leonardo\u2019s Hidden Face, revealed as much when he noted that the Mona Lisa is, quote, \u201clike a mirror: Everybody starts from his own hypothesis or obsession and tries to find it there.",
              "\u201d And it\u2019s not hard to do, when your work of art is over 500 years old and there are gaps in its provenance and no 100% confirmation of the sitter\u2019s identity from Leonardo himself.",
              "But I\u2019ve mentioned it before and I\u2019ll mention it again: it is a bit strange that Leonardo kept this painting with him for his whole life.",
              "If it was indeed a commission, it\u2019s odd that it wouldn\u2019t have ended up with the commissioning party.",
              "If it did come from Lisa Gherardini and the Giocondo family--which I still think is the likeliest case--why did Leonardo hold onto it for so long?",
              "Did the Giocondo family reject it?",
              "Was Leonardo so unhappy that he kept tinkering with it for his own purposes?",
              "Suddenly, things make just a tiny bit more sense if we think Leonardo kept it because it bore his own portrait.",
              "That jokester in disguise, hiding in plain sight.",
              "And to be fair, some have referenced that the surname \u201cGiocondo\u201d is actually an adjective, meaning jocular, joyous, carefree in Italian.",
              "Leonardo was known to make visual and grammatical puns--his Ginevra de \u2018 Benci a prime example, with Ginevra bearing a resemblance to the Italian word ginepro, so Leonardo\u2019s portrait showcases her flanked with its greenery.",
              "No one, perhaps, was more jocund than Leonardo himself.",
              "So perhaps, he really was La Gioconda in this case.",
              "As always, I\u2019m skeptical, but one thing truly makes sense to me: I think I\u2019ve got a good idea now why Mona Lisa has that incredible enigmatic smile.",
              "She\u2019s amused, perhaps, after half a millennium, we\u2019re still trying to figure who she truly is.",
              "Coming up next time on ArtCurious, it\u2019s another big big name of the Renaissance, known to be a surly, do-it-yourself type.",
              "But did he really do one of his biggest projects all by himself?",

              "Proposed sitters for the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d have included da Vinci\u2019s mother Caterina, Princess Isabella of Naples, a Spanish noblewoman named Costanza d\u2019Avalos and an unnamed courtesan, among others.",
              "Some of the more provocative theories emphasize the subject\u2019s masculine facial features, suggesting that da Vinci based the portrait on his own likeness or that of his longtime apprentice and possible lover, Salai\u0300.",
              "Lisa Gherardini del Giocondo, a wealthy silk merchant\u2019s wife and the mother of five children, has been a leading contender since an art historian identified her as the sitter in 1550, more than four decades after the iconic painting\u2019s completion.",
              "The 2005 discovery of a 500-year-old note by an acquaintance of da Vinci, which states that the artist was working on Lisa\u2019s portrait, confirmed the theory for many scholars.",

              "Along with the mysteries of the sitter\u2019s identity and her enigmatic look, the reason for the work\u2019s popularity is one of its many conundrums. Although many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece\u2019s celebrity, the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.",

              "The writer Giorgio Vasari later extolled Leonardo\u2019s ability to closely imitate nature.",
              "Indeed, the Mona Lisa is a very realistic portrait.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato, an artistic technique that uses subtle gradations of light and shadow to model form, and shows his understanding of the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric reveal Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "And, although the sitter\u2019s steady gaze and restrained smile were not regarded as mysterious until the 19th century, viewers today can appreciate her equivocal expression.",

              "Some scholars have noted, however, that, as interest in the Renaissance grew in the 19th century, Leonardo became more popularly seen not only as a very good painter but also as a great scientist and inventor whose designs prefigured contemporary inventions.",
              "Many of his so-called inventions were later debunked, and his contributions to science and architecture came to be seen as small, but the myth of Leonardo as a genius has continued well into the 21st century, contributing to the Mona Lisa\u2019s popularity.",

              "Although the Mona Lisa is undoubtedly good art, there is no single reason for its celebrity.",

              "The Florentine lady's wealthy silk merchant husband may have commissioned the portrait to celebrate the impending birth of their child, but for some unexplained reason, the Giocondo family never actually came into possession of the painting.",
              "The pregnancy theory does add up though, if you believe scholars who speculate the subject's sly smile and loose clothing are a nod to motherhood on the horizon.",
              "Most historians agree that da Vinci started the painting in 1503 and continued to work on it for about four years.",
              "Advertisement Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but most art experts \u2014 whether they fawn over Mona Lisa or not \u2014 agree that da Vinci's painting includes some revolutionary techniques that make it technically impressive.",
              "The style of the painting in itself is the most famous example of da Vinci's signature sfumato method, which blends colors and tones in a soft, shaded way without hard lines or borders (\"sfumare\" is the Italian word for \"shade,\" and \"fumare\" means \"smoke\").",
              "Da Vinci incorporated another pioneering technique into his creation: the integration of an imaginary landscape and the use of aerial perspective.",
              "Mona Lisa is seated in open space, with decidedly nonspecific mountains, bridges and winding paths behind her in the distance.",
              "The dreamy landscape is a departure from the realistic backgrounds artists of the time painted into their portraits, and many have associated the serene natural elements and the subject's calm expression with a greater commentary on the human connection to nature.",
              "Advertisement The Mona Lisa is also one of the earliest examples of an Italian portrait portraying a subject at \"half-length\";",
              "the arms and hands are displayed, but they don't touch the frame, and she's sitting in a chair.",
              "And of course, there's that creepy but iconic characteristic of Mona Lisa's eyes seemingly following the viewer wherever they go.",
              "The weirdly intimate attribute is a result of da Vinci's mastery of shadows and light, and while he wasn't the first one to implement the technique, many people refer to the illusion as the \"Mona Lisa Effect.\"",
              "Advertisement While Mona Lisa definitely has a lot going for her in the way of artistic skill level, thematic complexity and unique presentation, she definitely developed the majority of her fan following after an infamous incident at the Louvre.",

              "The fact that it took 26 hours for anyone to notice she was missing perhaps speaks to the low level of fame the painting had up to that point.",
              "Even though da Vinci had created the piece in the early 1500s, critics didn't really take notice until the 1860s, and even then, the positive accolades were few and far between, and exclusively within the art world itself.",

              "Leonardo da Vinci's inexhaustible portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the 24-year-old mother of five and wife of a wealthy Florentine silk merchant who sat for the High Renaissance master in 1503, is doubtless the most famous work of art in the world.",
              "Yet how many of us have ever consciously noted the object in the painting that is closer to us than any other \u2013 the chair on which the mysterious woman sits?",
              "Never mind that the piece of furniture is the only thing that Leonardo's sitter grips in her hand (she's literally pointing at it with every finger she has), the chair must surely be the single most neglected aspect of the otherwise over-stared-at icon.",

              "More like this: - The fresco with multiple identities - The secret toilet humour in a Titian painting - The tragedy of art's greatest supermodel For centuries, our attention has largely been focused elsewhere in the small (77 x 53cm/30 x 21in) oil-on-poplar panel, which Da Vinci never fully finished and is thought to have continued to tinker with obsessively until his death in 1519 \u2013 as if the painting's endless emergence were the work itself.",
              "A preoccupation principally with Mona Lisa's inscrutable smile is almost as old as the painting, and dates back at least to the reaction of the legendary Renaissance writer and historian Giorgio Vasari, who was born a few years after Da Vinci began work on the likeness.",
              "\"The mouth with its opening and with its ends united by the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the face,\" Vasari observed in his celebrated Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, \"seemed, in truth, to be not colours but flesh.",

              "The 19th-Century French art critic Alfred Dumesnil confessed to finding the painting's paradox utterly paralysing.",

              "If legend is to be believed, the \"treacherous attraction\" of Mona Lisa's irresolvable smirk consumed too the soul of an aspiring French artist by the name of Luc Maspero.",

              "\"I prefer to die.\"",
              "Not everyone, however, has been content to locate the centre of Mona Lisa's magnetising mystique in her enigmatic grin.",
              "The Victorian writer Walter Pater believed it was the \"delicacy\" with which her hands and eyelids are rendered that transfix and hypnotise us into believing that the work possesses preternatural power.",
              "\"We all know the face and hands of the figure,\" he observed in an article on Da Vinci in 1869, \"in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea\".",
              "Pater proceeds to meditate on the Mona Lisa in such a singularly intense way that in 1936 the Irish poet William Butler Yeats found himself compelled to seize a sentence from Pater's description, break it up into free-verse lines, and install them as the opening poem in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, which Yeats was then compiling.",
              "The passage that Yeats couldn't help co-opting begins: \"She is older than the rocks among which she sits;",
              "like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave;",
              "and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her;",
              "and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants, and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary;",
              "and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes.\"",
              "The portrait \"lives\", Pater concludes, \"only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands\".",
              "Some viewers are as transfixed by Mona Lisa's hands as by her face (Credit: Alamy) Pater's description still astounds.",
              "Unlike Dumesnil and the doomed Maspero before him, Pater sees past the seductive snare of the portrait's smile to a larger vitality that percolates as if from deep below the surface.",
              "Contending that the painting depicts a figure suspended in ceaseless shuttle between the here-and-now and some otherworldly realm that lies beyond, Pater pinpoints the mystical essence of the panel's perennial appeal: its surreal sense of eternal flux.",
              "Like Vasari, Pater bears witness to a breathing and pulsing presence \u2013 \"changing lineaments\" \u2013 that transcends the inert materiality of the portrait's making.",
              "Key to the force of Pater's language is an insistence on aquatic imagery that reinforces the fluidity of the sitter's elusive self (\"faint light under the sea\", \"a diver in deep seas\", and \"trafficked.",
              ".",
              ".",

              "Perhaps she is.",
              "There is reason to think that such a reading, which sees the sitter as a shape-shifting spring of eternal resurgence, is precisely what Leonardo intended.",
              "Flanked on either side by bodies of flowing water that the artist has ingeniously positioned in such a way as to suggest that they are aspects of his sitter's very being, Da Vinci's subject has a strangely submarine quality to her that is accentuated by the algae green dress she wears \u2013 an amphibious second skin that has only grown murkier and darker with time.",
              "Pivoting her stare slightly to her left to meet ours, Mona Lisa is poised upon not just any old bench or stool, but a deep-seated perch known popularly as a pozzetto chair.",
              "Meaning \"little well\", the pozzetto introduces a subtle symbolism into the narrative that is as revealing as it is unexpected.",
              "By placing Mona Lisa on a 'little well', surrounded by water, Da Vinci could be drawing on earlier spiritual connections with springs (Credit: Alamy) Suddenly, the waters we see meandering with a mazy motion behind Mona Lisa (whether belonging to an actual landscape, such as the valley of the Italian River Arno, as some historians believe, or entirely imaginary, as others contend) are no longer distant and disconnected from the sitter, but are an essential resource that sustain her existence.",
              "They literally flow into her.",
              "By situating Mona Lisa inside a \"little well\", Da Vinci transforms her into an ever-fluctuating dimension of the physical universe she occupies.",
              "Art historian and leading Da Vinci expert Martin Kemp has likewise detected a fundamental connection between Mona Lisa's depiction and the geology of the world she inhabits.",
              "\"The artist was not literally portraying the prehistoric or future Arno,\" Kemp asserts in his study Leonardo: 100 Milestones (2019), \"but was shaping Lisa's landscape on the basis of what he had learned about change in the 'body of the Earth', to stand alongside the implicit transformations in the body of the woman as a 'lesser world' or microcosm.\"",
              "Mona Lisa isn't sitting before a landscape.",
              "She is the landscape.",
              "Drawing from a well As with all visual symbols employed by Leonardo, the pozzetto chair is multivalent and serves more than merely to link Mona Lisa with the artist's well-known fascination with the hydrological forces that shape the Earth.",
              "The subtle insinuation of a \"little well\" in the painting as the very channel through which Mona Lisa emerges into consciousness repositions the painting entirely in cultural discourse.",
              "No longer is this a straightforwardly secular portrait but something spiritually more complex.",
              "Portrayals of women \"at the well\" are a staple throughout Western art history.",
              "Old Testament stories of Eliezar meeting Rebekah at a well and of Jacob meeting Rachel at the well went on to become especially popular in the 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries, as everyone from Bartolome\u0301 Esteban Murillo to Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo to William Holman Hunt tried their hand at one or other of the narratives.",
              "There are many depictions in art of people at wells, such as Christ and the Samaritan Woman (1310-11) by Duccio di Buoninsegna (Credit: Alamy) Moreover apocryphal depictions of the New Testament Annunciation (the moment when the Archangel Gabriel informs the Virgin Mary that she will give birth to Christ) as occurring at the site of a spring were a mainstay among Medieval manuscript illustrators, and may even have inspired the oldest surviving visual portrayal of Mary.",
              "An endlessly elastic emblem, as Walter Pater intimated, Mona Lisa is doubtless capable of absorbing all such reflected resonances and many more besides.",
              "There is no one she isn't.",
              "But perhaps the most pertinent parallel between Da Vinci's Mona Lisa and pictorial precursors is one that can be drawn with the many representations of a biblical episode in which Jesus finds himself at a well, engaged in cryptic conversation with a woman from Samaria.",
              "In the Gospel of John, Jesus makes a distinction between the water that can be drawn from the natural spring \u2013 water which will inevitably leave one \"thirsty\" \u2013 and the \"living water\" that he can provide.",
              "Where water from a well can only sustain a perishable body, 'living water' is capable of quenching the eternal spirit.",
              "Notable depictions of the scene by the Medieval Italian painter Duccio di Buoninsegna and by the German Renaissance master Lucas Cranach the Elder tend to seat Jesus directly on the wall of the well, suggesting his dominion over the fleeting elements of this world.",
              "By placing his female sitter notionally inside the well, however, Da Vinci confounds the tradition, and suggests instead a merging of material and spiritual realms \u2013 a blurring of the here and hereafter \u2013 into a shared plane of eternal emergence.",
              "In Da Vinci's enthralling narrative, Mona Lisa is herself a miraculous surge of \"living water\", serenely content in the knowledge of her own raging infinitude.",

              "It must also be pointed out that the other famous portraits of Isabella d'Este, by Titian and later Rubens, do not accurately resemble what we see in the Mona Lisa, and so this theory seems unlikely.",
              "DescriptionThe model is pictured from the waist up, in what is known as a \"half-length\" portrait.",
              "She is turned two-thirds towards us, and her eyes gaze directly in our direction.",

              "This enlarged outline helps to increase our connection her, whilst also giving more opportunity to the artist to expand upon his subtle details, as found previously within his portraits.",
              "The landscape found within Mona Lisa is entirely typical of how he worked within this genre.",
              "There are rocky structures, areas of natural water, and also a softening of outlines as we push towards the back of the painting.",
              "Typically, his landscapes would slowly merge with the sky above and the artist often wrote about his technical reasons for doing this.",
              "The model's hair is modestly styled and runs straight down to her shoulders, with just the suggesting of curls above her pale shoulders.",
              "She wears a dark gown, though the artist manages to deliver aesthetic interest through the beautifully crafted rolls of material which run along both sleeves.",
              "The clothing itself reminds us of Lisa Gherardini's status within the Italian middle classes, thanks to her marriage several years earlier.",
              "The model within Mona Lisa also wears a veil which many do not immediately spot (it's outline slightly hangs out to our left hand side).",
              "Other than the sprawling landscape at the back, this painting appears relatively straight forward at first glance, but it is the incredible subtleties used by the artist which make it such an accomplished painting.",
              "AnalysisHow could such a seemingly simple composition rise to become the most famous painting of all time?",
              "Da Vinci's Mona Lisa features a wealth of innovations which would become the default style of portraiture for all Italian artists that followed.",
              "The three-quarter view in which the model is sat broke with tradition.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci had also perfected his use of sfumato, which delivered life like qualities to his portraits that lifted the bar in Renaissance art.",
              "We see many examples of it in previous decades, but by the time of the Mona Lisa this technique of subtle variations of colour, with delicate layers of transparent glazes, had been perfected.",
              "Many scholars have claimed that in this portrait we are connected to the inner soul of the subject, and that the artist is somehow able to portray their personality through the aesthetics.",
              "Many have been drawn in by the ambiguity of the subject's facial expression, which borders on a smile.",
              "Leonardo would also incorporate elements of chiaroscuro, where light varies considerably from the foreground to the background and this helps to deliver a strong feeling of depth to the painting.",
              "He also takes his landscape work as far as had been seen within this painting, providing a complex myriad of elements which drift off into the distance.",
              "MeaningLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa may not carry the same symbolism that you might find in other genres, but there are secrets within the artwork that you may not initially pick up.",
              "Lisa Gherardini's personality is portrayed through the subtle uplifts around the lips and eyes, giving us an insight into the life of a happy mother and wife.",
              "The artist also combines the features of the landscape with the sitter's clothing and hair, with free flowing material on her sleeves offering a consistent look with the meandering rivers in the far distance.",
              "This is no coincidence, but a carefully planned artwork which took many years to finally complete.",
              "Technical InformationDateLeonardo da Vinci worked on the Mona Lisa between the years of 1503a\u0302\u0080\u00931506, at which point he would have been in his early fifties.",
              "There is considerable evidence to suggest, however, that he continued to re-visit the work from time to time, making minor adjustments until 1517 at the latest.",
              "That would mean that Leonardo would have been working on the Mona Lisa right up until just a few years before his death in 1519, aged 67.",

              "He also completed some secular portraits which were compositionally-similar to the Mona Lisa in previous decades, such as Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, and many of the qualities found in these paintings would continue into his portrait of Lisa Gherardini.",
              "SizeLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is 77 cm in height and 53 cm in width (30 inches A\u0303\u0097 21 inches).",
              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",
              "LocationLeonardo's Mona Lisa has resided at the Louvre in Paris, France since 1797.",
              "Its precise location is in Room 711 (Salle des A\u0303\u0089tats) of the Denon wing on Level 1.",
              "It remains the greatest highlight in the permanent collection of the Louvre, and attracts millions of visitors each and every year.",
              "It is joined within this room by The Wedding Feast at Cana, Supper at Emmaus, The Crucifixion, Portrait of a Venetian Woman and Jupiter Hurling Thunderbolts at the Vices by Paolo Veronese, The Pastoral Concert, Woman with a Mirror, Man with a Glove and The Virgin and Child with Saint Catherine and a Shepherd by Titian as well as The Coronation of the Virgin by Tintoretto.",
              "ProvenanceFrancis I of France, or FranA\u0303\u00a7ois Ier (roi de France), would purchase the Mona Lisa fairly early on in its life, possibly as early as 1518.",
              "It would then make its way over to Fontainebleau Palace, where it would be displayed alongside two other artworks by Leonardo, namely Leda and the Swan, La Belle FerronniA\u0303 \u0308re and St John the Baptist.",
              "The Mona Lisa would then remain here for around two centuries as part of the growing Royal Collection.",
              "As we head towards the end of the 18th century, the painting would be relocated to Versailles, then back to Paris, before being returned to Versailles.",
              "Eventually it would pass to the Louvre in 1797 and has remained there ever since.",
              "Having remained in the French Royal family for many centuries, after initially been purchased by King Francis I, the piece is now owned by the French Republic.",
              "It is also considered a cultural asset of great significance and is therefore highly unlikely to be sold.",
              "RestorationLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa remains in fairly good condition, despite the artwork's age.",
              "The piece has never received a fall restoration, and any work completed on it in the past has been done so in a relatively subtle manner, meaning most of the work is much the same as when the artist first completed the piece.",
              "Two of the main issues to occur have been the darkening of the varnish which has impacted the clarity of all detail within the painting, as well as some warping to the wooden panel.",
              "Both of these problems are entirely typical of art from the 15th and 16th century, and so restorers are well accustomed to dealing with these type of issues.",
              "Other works have previously been transferred to canvas to avoid other common issues such as woodworm, but the Mona Lisa remains one its original panel of popular wood.",
              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",
              "Whilst hidden away in storage during WWII, the painting may have suffered somewhat from the alternative conditions but is today given the very best care possible - it is on display behind a bullet proof glass screen which protects against any unruly members of the public.",
              "CopiesA large number of copies of the Mona Lisa exist today.",
              "The three most famous of those are known as the Prado Museum La Gioconda, the Isleworth Mona Lisa and the Hermitage Mona Lisa.",
              "Many visitors to Da Vinci's studio, as well as some of his own assistants, would sit and produce their own versions of the Mona Lisa, and so it has proven difficult to attribute these different copies accurately.",
              "All three have been received support for also being from Leonardo's hand, though other scholars have also suggested that he was not involved.",
              "Da Vinci did produce multiple versions of the same painting several times, and so it is not impossible that he produced copies of the Mona Lisa, but the more likely scenario is that highly skilled members of his studio created these other versions.",
              "LegacyThe Mona Lisa would have a greater influence on the direction of Renaissance art than any artwork by Leonardo da Vinci.",
              "It was admired for many different reasons, and the most famous artist to learn directly from this piece would be Raphael, who used some of its qualities in portraits such as Young Woman with Unicorn, Portrait of Maddalena Doni, La Velata and Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione.",
              "Da Vinci's lifelike portraits had impressed many for several decades but the Mona Lisa represented his greatest achievement, at which point his evolution as a portrait painter was now complete.",
              "All of his innovations with oils were on display within this single piece.",
              "It would be used as a benchmark for all portaiture going forwards, both in terms of precise, lifelike aesthetics as well as the manner in which the artist composed the scene.",
              "Italian art during the Renaissance was famous for the different schools which would put forward their own ideas and styles, each learning from each other, but the Mona Lisa represented the starting point from which all later portrait painters should refer - an unchallengeable, perhaps even perfect display of the visual arts.",
              "Over time the painting's fame would lead to a magical quality falling upon its reputation, with viewers becoming mesmerised by the ambigious qualities of the subject's facial expressions.",
              "It would go on to become the most researched artwork in history too, with academics desperate to uncover new secrets about it for centuries to come.",
              "The World's Most Famous PaintingLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa remains the world's most famous painting of all time.",
              "A number of studies over the past few decades have continually placed this oil painting from the early 16th century as the most well known piece across the world, in a list which is dominated by western art, underlining the spread of western culture across the planet.",
              "Large, High Resolution Images of Mona LisaThe Mona Lisa is famed for its use of subtle tones and the layers of transparent glazes which allowed the artist to create the most lifelike of images for this portrait.",

              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",

              "The Mona Lisa would then remain here for around two centuries as part of the growing Royal Collection.",

              "The piece has never received a fall restoration, and any work completed on it in the past has been done so in a relatively subtle manner, meaning most of the work is much the same as when the artist first completed the piece.",
              "Two of the main issues to occur have been the darkening of the varnish which has impacted the clarity of all detail within the painting, as well as some warping to the wooden panel.",
              "Both of these problems are entirely typical of art from the 15th and 16th century, and so restorers are well accustomed to dealing with these type of issues.",

              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",

              "Da Vinci did produce multiple versions of the same painting several times, and so it is not impossible that he produced copies of the Mona Lisa, but the more likely scenario is that highly skilled members of his studio created these other versions.",

              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",

              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",

              "Da Vinci did produce multiple versions of the same painting several times, and so it is not impossible that he produced copies of the Mona Lisa, but the more likely scenario is that highly skilled members of his studio created these other versions.",

              "Many have been drawn in by the ambiguity of the subject's facial expression, which borders on a smile.",
              "Leonardo would also incorporate elements of chiaroscuro, where light varies considerably from the foreground to the background and this helps to deliver a strong feeling of depth to the painting.",

              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",

              "He also completed some secular portraits which were compositionally-similar to the Mona Lisa in previous decades, such as Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, and many of the qualities found in these paintings would continue into his portrait of Lisa Gherardini.",
              "SizeLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is 77 cm in height and 53 cm in width (30 inches A\u0303\u0097 21 inches).",
              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",
              "LocationLeonardo's Mona Lisa has resided at the Louvre in Paris, France since 1797.",
              "Its precise location is in Room 711 (Salle des A\u0303\u0089tats) of the Denon wing on Level 1.",
              "It remains the greatest highlight in the permanent collection of the Louvre, and attracts millions of visitors each and every year.",
              "It is joined within this room by The Wedding Feast at Cana, Supper at Emmaus, The Crucifixion, Portrait of a Venetian Woman and Jupiter Hurling Thunderbolts at the Vices by Paolo Veronese, The Pastoral Concert, Woman with a Mirror, Man with a Glove and The Virgin and Child with Saint Catherine and a Shepherd by Titian as well as The Coronation of the Virgin by Tintoretto.",
              "ProvenanceFrancis I of France, or FranA\u0303\u00a7ois Ier (roi de France), would purchase the Mona Lisa fairly early on in its life, possibly as early as 1518.",
              "It would then make its way over to Fontainebleau Palace, where it would be displayed alongside two other artworks by Leonardo, namely Leda and the Swan, La Belle FerronniA\u0303 \u0308re and St John the Baptist.",
              "The Mona Lisa would then remain here for around two centuries as part of the growing Royal Collection.",
              "As we head towards the end of the 18th century, the painting would be relocated to Versailles, then back to Paris, before being returned to Versailles.",
              "Eventually it would pass to the Louvre in 1797 and has remained there ever since.",
              "Having remained in the French Royal family for many centuries, after initially been purchased by King Francis I, the piece is now owned by the French Republic.",
              "It is also considered a cultural asset of great significance and is therefore highly unlikely to be sold.",
              "RestorationLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa remains in fairly good condition, despite the artwork's age.",
              "The piece has never received a fall restoration, and any work completed on it in the past has been done so in a relatively subtle manner, meaning most of the work is much the same as when the artist first completed the piece.",
              "Two of the main issues to occur have been the darkening of the varnish which has impacted the clarity of all detail within the painting, as well as some warping to the wooden panel.",
              "Both of these problems are entirely typical of art from the 15th and 16th century, and so restorers are well accustomed to dealing with these type of issues.",
              "Other works have previously been transferred to canvas to avoid other common issues such as woodworm, but the Mona Lisa remains one its original panel of popular wood.",
              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",
              "Whilst hidden away in storage during WWII, the painting may have suffered somewhat from the alternative conditions but is today given the very best care possible - it is on display behind a bullet proof glass screen which protects against any unruly members of the public.",
              "CopiesA large number of copies of the Mona Lisa exist today.",
              "The three most famous of those are known as the Prado Museum La Gioconda, the Isleworth Mona Lisa and the Hermitage Mona Lisa.",
              "Many visitors to Da Vinci's studio, as well as some of his own assistants, would sit and produce their own versions of the Mona Lisa, and so it has proven difficult to attribute these different copies accurately.",
              "All three have been received support for also being from Leonardo's hand, though other scholars have also suggested that he was not involved.",
              "Da Vinci did produce multiple versions of the same painting several times, and so it is not impossible that he produced copies of the Mona Lisa, but the more likely scenario is that highly skilled members of his studio created these other versions.",
              "LegacyThe Mona Lisa would have a greater influence on the direction of Renaissance art than any artwork by Leonardo da Vinci.",
              "It was admired for many different reasons, and the most famous artist to learn directly from this piece would be Raphael, who used some of its qualities in portraits such as Young Woman with Unicorn, Portrait of Maddalena Doni, La Velata and Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione.",
              "Da Vinci's lifelike portraits had impressed many for several decades but the Mona Lisa represented his greatest achievement, at which point his evolution as a portrait painter was now complete.",
              "All of his innovations with oils were on display within this single piece.",
              "It would be used as a benchmark for all portaiture going forwards, both in terms of precise, lifelike aesthetics as well as the manner in which the artist composed the scene.",
              "Italian art during the Renaissance was famous for the different schools which would put forward their own ideas and styles, each learning from each other, but the Mona Lisa represented the starting point from which all later portrait painters should refer - an unchallengeable, perhaps even perfect display of the visual arts.",
              "Over time the painting's fame would lead to a magical quality falling upon its reputation, with viewers becoming mesmerised by the ambigious qualities of the subject's facial expressions.",
              "It would go on to become the most researched artwork in history too, with academics desperate to uncover new secrets about it for centuries to come.",

              "A number of studies over the past few decades have continually placed this oil painting from the early 16th century as the most well known piece across the world, in a list which is dominated by western art, underlining the spread of western culture across the planet.",
              "Large, High Resolution Images of Mona LisaThe Mona Lisa is famed for its use of subtle tones and the layers of transparent glazes which allowed the artist to create the most lifelike of images for this portrait.",

              "He also completed some secular portraits which were compositionally-similar to the Mona Lisa in previous decades, such as Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, and many of the qualities found in these paintings would continue into his portrait of Lisa Gherardini.",
              "SizeLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is 77 cm in height and 53 cm in width (30 inches A\u0303\u0097 21 inches).",
              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",
              "LocationLeonardo's Mona Lisa has resided at the Louvre in Paris, France since 1797.",

              "It would then make its way over to Fontainebleau Palace, where it would be displayed alongside two other artworks by Leonardo, namely Leda and the Swan, La Belle FerronniA\u0303 \u0308re and St John the Baptist.",
              "The Mona Lisa would then remain here for around two centuries as part of the growing Royal Collection.",
              "As we head towards the end of the 18th century, the painting would be relocated to Versailles, then back to Paris, before being returned to Versailles.",
              "Eventually it would pass to the Louvre in 1797 and has remained there ever since.",
              "Having remained in the French Royal family for many centuries, after initially been purchased by King Francis I, the piece is now owned by the French Republic.",

              "RestorationLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa remains in fairly good condition, despite the artwork's age.",
              "The piece has never received a fall restoration, and any work completed on it in the past has been done so in a relatively subtle manner, meaning most of the work is much the same as when the artist first completed the piece.",
              "Two of the main issues to occur have been the darkening of the varnish which has impacted the clarity of all detail within the painting, as well as some warping to the wooden panel.",
              "Both of these problems are entirely typical of art from the 15th and 16th century, and so restorers are well accustomed to dealing with these type of issues.",
              "Other works have previously been transferred to canvas to avoid other common issues such as woodworm, but the Mona Lisa remains one its original panel of popular wood.",
              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",

              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",

              "She was well known to Leonardo, as he had worked for her in 1499, and there are a number of commissions for her which he never completed.",
              "Some have suggested that after writing to him about this, perhaps the Mona Lisa was born from that.",
              "There are potential discrepancies between her own image, and that found within this portrait, such as her natural hair colour, and there is also far more evidence in favour of it being Lisa del Giocondo in any case.",
              "It must also be pointed out that the other famous portraits of Isabella d'Este, by Titian and later Rubens, do not accurately resemble what we see in the Mona Lisa, and so this theory seems unlikely.",
              "DescriptionThe model is pictured from the waist up, in what is known as a \"half-length\" portrait.",
              "She is turned two-thirds towards us, and her eyes gaze directly in our direction.",

              "There are rocky structures, areas of natural water, and also a softening of outlines as we push towards the back of the painting.",
              "Typically, his landscapes would slowly merge with the sky above and the artist often wrote about his technical reasons for doing this.",
              "The model's hair is modestly styled and runs straight down to her shoulders, with just the suggesting of curls above her pale shoulders.",
              "She wears a dark gown, though the artist manages to deliver aesthetic interest through the beautifully crafted rolls of material which run along both sleeves.",

              "Many scholars have claimed that in this portrait we are connected to the inner soul of the subject, and that the artist is somehow able to portray their personality through the aesthetics.",
              "Many have been drawn in by the ambiguity of the subject's facial expression, which borders on a smile.",
              "Leonardo would also incorporate elements of chiaroscuro, where light varies considerably from the foreground to the background and this helps to deliver a strong feeling of depth to the painting.",

              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",

              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",

              "The Mona Lisa would then remain here for around two centuries as part of the growing Royal Collection.",
              "As we head towards the end of the 18th century, the painting would be relocated to Versailles, then back to Paris, before being returned to Versailles.",
              "Eventually it would pass to the Louvre in 1797 and has remained there ever since.",
              "Having remained in the French Royal family for many centuries, after initially been purchased by King Francis I, the piece is now owned by the French Republic.",

              "RestorationLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa remains in fairly good condition, despite the artwork's age.",
              "The piece has never received a fall restoration, and any work completed on it in the past has been done so in a relatively subtle manner, meaning most of the work is much the same as when the artist first completed the piece.",
              "Two of the main issues to occur have been the darkening of the varnish which has impacted the clarity of all detail within the painting, as well as some warping to the wooden panel.",
              "Both of these problems are entirely typical of art from the 15th and 16th century, and so restorers are well accustomed to dealing with these type of issues.",
              "Other works have previously been transferred to canvas to avoid other common issues such as woodworm, but the Mona Lisa remains one its original panel of popular wood.",
              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",
              "Whilst hidden away in storage during WWII, the painting may have suffered somewhat from the alternative conditions but is today given the very best care possible - it is on display behind a bullet proof glass screen which protects against any unruly members of the public.",

              "Many visitors to Da Vinci's studio, as well as some of his own assistants, would sit and produce their own versions of the Mona Lisa, and so it has proven difficult to attribute these different copies accurately.",
              "All three have been received support for also being from Leonardo's hand, though other scholars have also suggested that he was not involved.",
              "Da Vinci did produce multiple versions of the same painting several times, and so it is not impossible that he produced copies of the Mona Lisa, but the more likely scenario is that highly skilled members of his studio created these other versions.",
              "LegacyThe Mona Lisa would have a greater influence on the direction of Renaissance art than any artwork by Leonardo da Vinci.",
              "It was admired for many different reasons, and the most famous artist to learn directly from this piece would be Raphael, who used some of its qualities in portraits such as Young Woman with Unicorn, Portrait of Maddalena Doni, La Velata and Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione.",
              "Da Vinci's lifelike portraits had impressed many for several decades but the Mona Lisa represented his greatest achievement, at which point his evolution as a portrait painter was now complete.",
              "All of his innovations with oils were on display within this single piece.",
              "It would be used as a benchmark for all portaiture going forwards, both in terms of precise, lifelike aesthetics as well as the manner in which the artist composed the scene.",
              "Italian art during the Renaissance was famous for the different schools which would put forward their own ideas and styles, each learning from each other, but the Mona Lisa represented the starting point from which all later portrait painters should refer - an unchallengeable, perhaps even perfect display of the visual arts.",
              "Over time the painting's fame would lead to a magical quality falling upon its reputation, with viewers becoming mesmerised by the ambigious qualities of the subject's facial expressions.",

              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",

              "Da Vinci did produce multiple versions of the same painting several times, and so it is not impossible that he produced copies of the Mona Lisa, but the more likely scenario is that highly skilled members of his studio created these other versions.",

              "While exploring for such potential resources, we find that one of the prominent examples that have been largely ignored in designing the multidisciplinary science curriculum is the Renaissance paintings, most of which reflect transcendent unity of visual art and science, on the one hand, and depict reality interwoven with extraordinary ideas, on the other.",
              "Among a handful of Renaissance paintings, Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa is the one that could serve as one of the best examples, because its inner details encircle widely different disciplines in such a way that they appear as a requirement of imitating Nature.",

              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the Mona Lisa\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous possibilities, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo\u2014hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "The Mona Lisa hangs behind bulletproof glass in a gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it has been a part of the museum\u2019s collection since 1804.",
              "It was part of the royal collection before becoming the property of the French people during the Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "The Mona Lisa is priceless.",
              "Any speculative price (some say over a billion dollars!)",
              "would probably be so high that not one person would be able or willing to purchase and maintain the painting.",
              "Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it.",
              "The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for the Mona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment.",
              "Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.",
              "Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece\u2019s celebrity, including its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and its tour to the U.",
              "S.",
              "in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.",
              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal.",
              "Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world\u2019s most famous painting.",
              "It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century.",
              "The sitter\u2019s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.",

              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",

              "The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting\u2014especially apparent in the sitter\u2019s faint smile\u2014reflects Leonardo\u2019s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo\u2019s vision.",
              "In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits.",
              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",

              "Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo\u2019s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa about 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",

              "Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it.",
              "The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for the Mona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment.",
              "Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.",
              "Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece\u2019s celebrity, including its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and its tour to the U.",

              "in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.",
              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal.",
              "Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world\u2019s most famous painting.",
              "It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century.",
              "The sitter\u2019s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.",
              "The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape.",
              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter\u2019s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.",
              "The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting\u2014especially apparent in the sitter\u2019s faint smile\u2014reflects Leonardo\u2019s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo\u2019s vision.",
              "In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits.",
              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",
              "The sitter\u2019s identity has not been definitively proven.",
              "Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo\u2019s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa about 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "French King Francis I, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life, acquired the work after the artist\u2019s death, and it became part of the royal collection.",
              "For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "Following a period hanging in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",
              "During World War II the Mona Lisa, singled out as the most-endangered artwork in the Louvre, was evacuated to various locations in France\u2019s countryside, returning to the museum in 1945 after peace had been declared.",
              "It later traveled to the United States in 1963, drawing about 40,000 people per day during its six-week stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              "It also toured to Tokyo and Moscow in 1974.",
              "Scholars have noted that the Mona Lisa is in fairly good condition for its age.",
              "The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its original frame and to braces added by early restorers.",
              "To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting.",
              "Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail.",
              "The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject\u2019s left elbow.",
              "The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work\u2019s visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it."

              "When the Parisian police interrogated him in November 1911 as a part of their interviews of all Louvre employees, he blithely said he only learned of the theft from the newspapers and that the reason he was late to work that Monday in August\u2014as his employer had told the police\u2014was that he had drunk too much the night before and overslept.",

              "By Alex Greenberger Senior Editor, ARTnews Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa may be one of the most beloved artworks in the world.",
              "Seen by millions of people each year, it is considered to be the crown jewel of the Louvre\u2019s collection, an iconic work of the Renaissance, and a painting that is impossible to value because it is seen as being priceless.",
              "It has also been the target of theft and vandalism on several occasions.",
              "Since the start of the 20th century, the painting, which was acquired by France in 1797, has had spray paint and a teacup thrown at it.",
              "This week, it was caked.",
              "In 1956 alone, two vandals tried to use a razor blade and a rock to defile it on separate occasions.",
              "Each time, the Mona Lisa has emerged without damage.",
              "(All of this doesn\u2019t count the various artists who have altered the Mona Lisa\u2019s image, among the Marcel Duchamp, who famously put a mustache on a reproduction of the Leonardo painting, or the era during World War II when the painting risked being seized by the Nazis during their occupation of France.)",
              "In short, the Mona Lisa has faced so much potential damage that even Salvador Dali\u0301 was once moved to speak on all the vandalism, attributing to the painting \u201ca power, unique in all art history, to provoke the most violent and different kinds of aggressions.",
              "\u201d To look back on this unusual art-historical lineage, ARTnews has charted below five times in which the Mona Lisa was vandalized or stolen.",
              "Part of the reason the Mona Lisa is known worldwide is because of its theft in 1911 by the Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia.",
              "That year, Peruggia and two others stowed themselves away in a closet of the Louvre, hung around until the museum closed, and then took the painting, which at the time was considered a minor work by Leonardo, with them, hopping on a train out of Paris.",
              "As the theft gained more and more press, both within France and outside it, Peruggia held on to the work, at one point stashing it beneath the floorboards of his Paris apartment.",
              "A little over two years after the theft, Peruggia made an attempt to sell the work to a dealer in Florence, in an attempt, he believed, to bring back to Italy a treasure that it had lost.",
              "The proposed sale backfired when the dealer called the director of the Uffizi Galleries, who obtained the work and called the police.",
              "Peruggia went on to spend six months in prison, and the painting was returned to the Louvre.",
              "In 1956, the Mona Lisa was vandalized not once but twice.",
              "First, a vandal attempted to take a razor blade to the painting, though no damage ended up being inflicted.",
              "Then, a Bolivian man named Hugo Unjaga Villegas tossed a rock at the painting.",
              "\u201cI had a stone in my pocket and suddenly the idea to throw it came to mind,\u201d he said at the time.",
              "Thankfully, the painting was already behind glass, which meant that Villegas did not do permanent damage to the painting.",
              "The rock managed to knock off a speck of paint in one area, though that was easily repaired by experts with the French state, who restored the painting and put it back on view several days after the vandalism.",
              "The Mona Lisa has rarely ever left the Louvre, which may explain why 1.",
              "15 million people reportedly saw the painting when it traveled to the National Museum in Tokyo.",
              "One of those people was Tomoko Yonezu, a 25-year-old Japanese woman who tried to spray paint the canvas in red on its first day on view.",
              "In the days before the opening, the presentation had been the subject of discussion among disability activists, who claimed that in refusing access to those who needed assistance in the name of crowd control, the National Museum was discriminating against the disabled.",
              "Yonezu then took matters into her own hands with some degree of success\u2014somewhere between 20 and 30 droplets of spray paint made it onto Leonardo\u2019s painting, but in the end, the work was spared.",
              "Yonezu continued to face the consequences, however, and she was later brought to court after being detained.",
              "The art historian Penelope Jackson has reported that women\u2019s rights groups perceived sexism in the legal proceedings and protested outside the courthouse.",
              "Ultimately, in 1975, Yonezu was convicted of a misdemeanor and made to pay a fine of 3,000 yen, although her act bore fruit, as the National Museum set aside a day when the disabled could exclusively visit the Mona Lisa.",
              "It was an otherwise ordinary day at the Louvre when, in 2009, a Russian woman came to the gallery that held the Mona Lisa at the time and smashed a teacup against the painting.",
              "She had come to the museum with the cup concealed inside her bag, and Louvre representatives said she had let loose because she had been denied French citizenship.",
              "Calling the woman \u201cclearly deranged,\u201d a Louvre spokesperson told the New York Times that \u201cviewing was only disturbed the time it took to pick up the pieces.",
              "\u201d Thanks once again to her glass case, the Mona Lisa was not damaged.",
              "Still, some took the attempted vandalism as proof that greater security was needed.",
              "\u201cThe truth is that the Louvre needs to consider moving the Mona Lisa to its own gallery, at a safe distance from other works,\u201d Jonathan Jones wrote in the Guardian.",
              "Ultimately, the Louvre did just that, partially in an effort to stem lines of people that had been spilling over, and in 2019, the glass on the Mona Lisa was upgraded.",
              "More than a century after the Mona Lisa was stolen, La Gioconda was smeared with cake this week in what appeared to be a protest against climate change.",
              "The 36-year-old man who staged this intervention had come to the museum in a wheelchair dressed as a woman.",
              "Some caught the aftermath of the event on video and posted it to social media.",
              "\u201cThere are people who are destroying the Earth,\u201d the man said in one video, speaking in French.",

              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",

              "Any speculative price (some say over a billion dollars!)",

              "Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it.",
              "The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for the Mona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment.",
              "Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.",

              "The sitter\u2019s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.",
              "The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape.",
              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",

              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",
              "The sitter\u2019s identity has not been definitively proven.",
              "Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo\u2019s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa about 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "French King Francis I, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life, acquired the work after the artist\u2019s death, and it became part of the royal collection.",
              "For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "Following a period hanging in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",
              "During World War II the Mona Lisa, singled out as the most-endangered artwork in the Louvre, was evacuated to various locations in France\u2019s countryside, returning to the museum in 1945 after peace had been declared.",
              "It later traveled to the United States in 1963, drawing about 40,000 people per day during its six-week stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              "It also toured to Tokyo and Moscow in 1974.",
              "Scholars have noted that the Mona Lisa is in fairly good condition for its age.",
              "The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its original frame and to braces added by early restorers.",
              "To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting.",
              "Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail.",
              "The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject\u2019s left elbow.",
              "The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work\u2019s visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it."

              "The 1503 painting by Leonardo da Vinci is the world's most famous piece of art.",
              "Kelly Grovier explores an overlooked object that offers a different perspective on the masterpiece.",
              "Some things are so obvious you never really notice them.",
              "Take, for instance, the way the white space between the \"E\" and the \"x\" in the FedEx logo forms a big white arrow pointing forward.",
              "We've seen the sign whizz past us countless times without ever clocking its subliminal point.",
              "Another ubiquitous cultural image is the Mona Lisa.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci's inexhaustible portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the 24-year-old mother of five and wife of a wealthy Florentine silk merchant who sat for the High Renaissance master in 1503, is doubtless the most famous work of art in the world.",
              "Yet how many of us have ever consciously noted the object in the painting that is closer to us than any other \u2013 the chair on which the mysterious woman sits?",
              "Never mind that the piece of furniture is the only thing that Leonardo's sitter grips in her hand (she's literally pointing at it with every finger she has), the chair must surely be the single most neglected aspect of the otherwise over-stared-at icon.",
              "Hiding in plain sight, it may also be the arrow that points the way to the work's deepest meanings.",
              "More like this: - The fresco with multiple identities - The secret toilet humour in a Titian painting - The tragedy of art's greatest supermodel For centuries, our attention has largely been focused elsewhere in the small (77 x 53cm/30 x 21in) oil-on-poplar panel, which Da Vinci never fully finished and is thought to have continued to tinker with obsessively until his death in 1519 \u2013 as if the painting's endless emergence were the work itself.",
              "A preoccupation principally with Mona Lisa's inscrutable smile is almost as old as the painting, and dates back at least to the reaction of the legendary Renaissance writer and historian Giorgio Vasari, who was born a few years after Da Vinci began work on the likeness.",
              "\"The mouth with its opening and with its ends united by the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the face,\" Vasari observed in his celebrated Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, \"seemed, in truth, to be not colours but flesh.",
              "In the pit of the throat, if one gazed upon it intently, could be seen the beating of the pulse.\"",
              "He concluded: \"In this work of Leonardo, there was a smile so pleasing, that it was a thing more divine than human to behold, and it was held to be something marvellous, in that it was not other than alive.\"",
              "The mesmerising mystery of Mona Lisa's smile and how Leonardo magically leveraged it into creating \"a thing more divine than human\" and yet \"not other than alive\" would prove too intense for many to bear.",
              "The 19th-Century French art critic Alfred Dumesnil confessed to finding the painting's paradox utterly paralysing.",
              "In 1854 he asserted that the subject's \"smile is full of attraction, but it is the treacherous attraction of a sick soul that renders sickness.",
              "This so soft a look, but avid like the sea, devours\".",
              "If legend is to be believed, the \"treacherous attraction\" of Mona Lisa's irresolvable smirk consumed too the soul of an aspiring French artist by the name of Luc Maspero.",
              "According to popular myth, Maspero, who allegedly ended his days by leaping from the window of his Paris hotel room, was driven to destructive distraction by the mute whispers of Mona Lisa's engrossingly gladsome lips.",
              "\"For years I have grappled desperately with her smile,\" he is said to have written in the note he left behind.",
              "\"I prefer to die.\"",
              "Not everyone, however, has been content to locate the centre of Mona Lisa's magnetising mystique in her enigmatic grin.",
              "The Victorian writer Walter Pater believed it was the \"delicacy\" with which her hands and eyelids are rendered that transfix and hypnotise us into believing that the work possesses preternatural power.",
              "\"We all know the face and hands of the figure,\" he observed in an article on Da Vinci in 1869, \"in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea\".",
              "Pater proceeds to meditate on the Mona Lisa in such a singularly intense way that in 1936 the Irish poet William Butler Yeats found himself compelled to seize a sentence from Pater's description, break it up into free-verse lines, and install them as the opening poem in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, which Yeats was then compiling.",
              "The passage that Yeats couldn't help co-opting begins: \"She is older than the rocks among which she sits;",
              "like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave;",
              "and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her;",
              "and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants, and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary;",
              "and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes.\"",
              "The portrait \"lives\", Pater concludes, \"only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands\".",
              "Pater's description still astounds.",
              "Unlike Dumesnil and the doomed Maspero before him, Pater sees past the seductive snare of the portrait's smile to a larger vitality that percolates as if from deep below the surface.",
              "Contending that the painting depicts a figure suspended in ceaseless shuttle between the here-and-now and some otherworldly realm that lies beyond, Pater pinpoints the mystical essence of the panel's perennial appeal: its surreal sense of eternal flux.",
              "Like Vasari, Pater bears witness to a breathing and pulsing presence \u2013 \"changing lineaments\" \u2013 that transcends the inert materiality of the portrait's making.",
              "Key to the force of Pater's language is an insistence on aquatic imagery that reinforces the fluidity of the sitter's elusive self (\"faint light under the sea\", \"a diver in deep seas\", and \"trafficked.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "with Eastern merchants\"), as if Mona Lisa were an ever-flowing fountain of living water \u2013 an interminable ripple in the endless eddies of time.",
              "Perhaps she is.",
              "There is reason to think that such a reading, which sees the sitter as a shape-shifting spring of eternal resurgence, is precisely what Leonardo intended.",
              "Flanked on either side by bodies of flowing water that the artist has ingeniously positioned in such a way as to suggest that they are aspects of his sitter's very being, Da Vinci's subject has a strangely submarine quality to her that is accentuated by the algae green dress she wears \u2013 an amphibious second skin that has only grown murkier and darker with time.",
              "Pivoting her stare slightly to her left to meet ours, Mona Lisa is poised upon not just any old bench or stool, but a deep-seated perch known popularly as a pozzetto chair.",
              "Meaning \"little well\", the pozzetto introduces a subtle symbolism into the narrative that is as revealing as it is unexpected.",
              "Suddenly, the waters we see meandering with a mazy motion behind Mona Lisa (whether belonging to an actual landscape, such as the valley of the Italian River Arno, as some historians believe, or entirely imaginary, as others contend) are no longer distant and disconnected from the sitter, but are an essential resource that sustain her existence.",
              "They literally flow into her.",
              "By situating Mona Lisa inside a \"little well\", Da Vinci transforms her into an ever-fluctuating dimension of the physical universe she occupies.",
              "Art historian and leading Da Vinci expert Martin Kemp has likewise detected a fundamental connection between Mona Lisa's depiction and the geology of the world she inhabits.",
              "\"The artist was not literally portraying the prehistoric or future Arno,\" Kemp asserts in his study Leonardo: 100 Milestones (2019), \"but was shaping Lisa's landscape on the basis of what he had learned about change in the 'body of the Earth', to stand alongside the implicit transformations in the body of the woman as a 'lesser world' or microcosm.\"",
              "Mona Lisa isn't sitting before a landscape.",
              "She is the landscape.",
              "Drawing from a well As with all visual symbols employed by Leonardo, the pozzetto chair is multivalent and serves more than merely to link Mona Lisa with the artist's well-known fascination with the hydrological forces that shape the Earth.",
              "The subtle insinuation of a \"little well\" in the painting as the very channel through which Mona Lisa emerges into consciousness repositions the painting entirely in cultural discourse.",
              "No longer is this a straightforwardly secular portrait but something spiritually more complex.",
              "Portrayals of women \"at the well\" are a staple throughout Western art history.",
              "Old Testament stories of Eliezar meeting Rebekah at a well and of Jacob meeting Rachel at the well went on to become especially popular in the 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries, as everyone from Bartolome\u0301 Esteban Murillo to Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo to William Holman Hunt tried their hand at one or other of the narratives.",
              "Moreover apocryphal depictions of the New Testament Annunciation (the moment when the Archangel Gabriel informs the Virgin Mary that she will give birth to Christ) as occurring at the site of a spring were a mainstay among Medieval manuscript illustrators, and may even have inspired the oldest surviving visual portrayal of Mary.",
              "An endlessly elastic emblem, as Walter Pater intimated, Mona Lisa is doubtless capable of absorbing all such reflected resonances and many more besides.",
              "There is no one she isn't.",
              "But perhaps the most pertinent parallel between Da Vinci's Mona Lisa and pictorial precursors is one that can be drawn with the many representations of a biblical episode in which Jesus finds himself at a well, engaged in cryptic conversation with a woman from Samaria.",
              "In the Gospel of John, Jesus makes a distinction between the water that can be drawn from the natural spring \u2013 water which will inevitably leave one \"thirsty\" \u2013 and the \"living water\" that he can provide.",
              "Where water from a well can only sustain a perishable body, 'living water' is capable of quenching the eternal spirit.",
              "Notable depictions of the scene by the Medieval Italian painter Duccio di Buoninsegna and by the German Renaissance master Lucas Cranach the Elder tend to seat Jesus directly on the wall of the well, suggesting his dominion over the fleeting elements of this world.",
              "By placing his female sitter notionally inside the well, however, Da Vinci confounds the tradition, and suggests instead a merging of material and spiritual realms \u2013 a blurring of the here and hereafter \u2013 into a shared plane of eternal emergence.",
              "In Da Vinci's enthralling narrative, Mona Lisa is herself a miraculous surge of \"living water\", serenely content in the knowledge of her own raging infinitude.",

              "Five centuries after Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa (1503\u201319), the portrait hangs behind bulletproof glass within the Louvre Museum and draws thousands of jostling spectators each day.",
              "It is the most famous painting in the world, and yet, when viewers manage to see the artwork up close, they are likely to be baffled by the small subdued portrait of an ordinary woman.",
              "She\u2019s dressed modestly in a translucent veil, dark robes, and no jewelry.",
              "Much has been said about her smile and gaze, but viewers still might wonder what all the fuss is about.",
              "Along with the mysteries of the sitter\u2019s identity and her enigmatic look, the reason for the work\u2019s popularity is one of its many conundrums. Although many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece\u2019s celebrity, the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.",
              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal.",
              "There is no doubt that the Mona Lisa is a very good painting.",
              "It was highly regarded even as Leonardo worked on it, and his contemporaries copied the then novel three-quarter pose.",
              "The writer Giorgio Vasari later extolled Leonardo\u2019s ability to closely imitate nature.",
              "Indeed, the Mona Lisa is a very realistic portrait.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato, an artistic technique that uses subtle gradations of light and shadow to model form, and shows his understanding of the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric reveal Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "And, although the sitter\u2019s steady gaze and restrained smile were not regarded as mysterious until the 19th century, viewers today can appreciate her equivocal expression.",
              "Leonardo painted a complex figure that is very much like a complicated human.",
              "Many scholars, however, point out that the excellent quality of the Mona Lisa was not enough by itself to make the painting a celebrity.",
              "There are, after all, many good paintings.",
              "External events also contributed to the artwork\u2019s fame.",

              "The identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter soon became more intriguing.",

              "Meanwhile, the 19th century also mythologized Leonardo as a genius.",
              "Throughout the centuries after his death, he was well regarded\u2014but no more so than his esteemed contemporaries Michelangelo and Raphael.",
              "Some scholars have noted, however, that, as interest in the Renaissance grew in the 19th century, Leonardo became more popularly seen not only as a very good painter but also as a great scientist and inventor whose designs prefigured contemporary inventions.",
              "Many of his so-called inventions were later debunked, and his contributions to science and architecture came to be seen as small, but the myth of Leonardo as a genius has continued well into the 21st century, contributing to the Mona Lisa\u2019s popularity.",
              "The writers of the 19th century aroused interest in the Mona Lisa, but the theft of the painting in 1911 and the ensuing media frenzy brought it worldwide attention.",

              "People flocked to the Louvre to gape at the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, accusations of a hoax splashed across newspapers, and Pablo Picasso was even arrested as a suspect!",
              "Two years later the painting was found in Italy after an art dealer in Florence alerted the local authorities that a man had contacted him about selling it.",

              "He was tried, convicted, and imprisoned for the theft while the painting toured Italy before it made its triumphant return to the Louvre.",
              "By then, many French people had come to regard the work as a national treasure that they had lost and recovered.",

          "And so it was that the Earlier version of the Mona Lisa was presented to Francesco del Giocondo in the first months of 1506, which would fully confirm the third and most controversial part of Vasari\u2019s testimonial: Leonardo undertook to execute, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Monna Lisa, his wife;",
          "and after toiling over it for four years, he left it unfinished.",
