    "query": "What is the impact of meditation on brain function and well-being, and how does this practice influence our ability to regulate emotions, reduce stress, and improve overall cognitive function?",
    "response": "Meditation is a practice of nonjudgmental, intentional awareness of the present moment[^2^]. It has been shown to have various benefits for brain function and well-being, such as:\n\n- **Increasing the ability to process information** by strengthening neural connections and enhancing sensory abilities[^2^] [^4^].\n- **Slowing the cognitive effects of aging** by preserving brain volume and preventing gray matter loss[^5^].\n- **Reducing inflammation** by modulating the immune system and lowering stress hormones[^6^].\n- **Supporting the immune system** by increasing the production of antibodies and enhancing natural killer cell activity[^6^].\n- **Reducing symptoms of menopause** by improving mood, sleep quality and hot flashes[^6^].\n- **Controlling the brain\u2019s response to pain** by activating brain regions associated with pain modulation and reducing emotional reactivity to pain[^6^].\n- **Improving sleep** by increasing melatonin levels and reducing insomnia symptoms[^6^].\n\nMeditation can also help to regulate emotions, reduce stress, and improve overall cognitive function by:\n\n- **Increasing self-awareness** by developing the regions of the brain responsible for memory, learning, attention and self-awareness[^2^].\n- **Decreasing emotional reactivity** by weakening the neural connections between the amygdala (the fear center) and the prefrontal cortex (the rational center), and strengthening the connections between the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions that help to regulate emotions[^4^].\n- **Reducing stress, anxiety and depression** by lowering cortisol levels, increasing serotonin levels, and enhancing brain activity in areas associated with positive emotions[^4^] [^5^].\n\nMeditation is a simple but not easy practice that can be done anywhere or anytime. It involves focusing on a specific thing, such as your breath, and bringing your attention back to that anchor whenever your mind wanders. By doing so, you can train your brain to be more mindful, resilient and healthy.",

              "Researchers have attempted to classify meditation techniques according to the focus of attention.",
              "For example, some have distinguished between focused-attention (FA) meditation, a method of concentrating attention on a particular stimulus, versus open monitoring (OM) where practitioners are instructed to focus on all incoming stimuli, internal sensations, and thoughts while maintaining a state of present and non-judgmental awareness [21].",
              "Somewhat similarly, Newberg and Iversen (2003) [22] distinguished between guided meditation, where the practitioner is led to focus on a particular object, image, or phrase or guided in visualization, versus volitional meditations, where individuals practice the meditation by their own will.",
              "Researchers have also distinguished between internally focused meditations, where the goal is for the practitioner to clear themselves of thoughts to reach a meditative state, versus externally focused meditations, where the practitioner\u2019s attention is placed on something outside of the self, such as a mantra.",

              "Self-selection bias poses yet another challenge as studies with experienced meditators may be investigating populations that have an affinity for meditative practices, and thus, results may partly be due to placebo effects associated with \u201cbelief\u201d that the practice is beneficial, one\u2019s own initiative, and \u201cliking\u201d of the practice.",
              "Beyond practical and individual differences, the field also faces the challenge of consolidating findings given the wide range of methodologies and research designs that have been used to examine yoga\u2019s effects on the human brain.",

              "In recent years, a number of systematic reviews have identified some overarching conceptual frameworks and neural networks that are useful for understanding how yoga works.",

              "This is associated with underactivity of the GABA system in the brain.",
              "Streeter hypothesized that yoga-based practices, and particularly practices that alter breathing patterns, increase activity of the PNS and GABA system in part via the afferent vagus nerves, which are the primary peripheral pathway of the PNS.",
              "Indeed, research suggests that yoga increases PNS activity [35] and GABA levels in the thalamus and that these increases are correlated with improved mood [36].",
              "Other research suggests that the benefits of mind\u2013body interventions are relayed via the downregulation of stress, mainly through the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis, known for its role in stress control, and the SNS [24].",
              "Studies have shown that yoga is associated with reductions in plasma cortisol, mainly in clinical samples with depression, those undergoing treatment for breast cancer, or those suffering from addiction to alcohol [25, 26].",
              "More broadly, a review of 81 studies found that yoga surpassed exercise regimens in numerous outcome measures of health such as salivary cortisol, blood glucose, fatigue, pain, and sleep in both healthy and clinical samples.",

              "Another review of research found that connectivity and network integrity of the DMN decrease in healthy aging, but at a much more rapid pace in AD [55].",
              "In combination with other research, results from the present review suggest that meditative practices commonly affect brain systems involved in attention, memory, conscious awareness, reward, and emotional regulation that are important and can be disrupted by cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative changes.",
              "Thus, as suggested by previous reviews, meditation may enhance cognitive and psychological health via neuroplastic effects on brain structures and circuits that influence attention, memory, and emotional regulation.",
              "Although these findings do not support stress buffering and relief models of meditation and yoga, it is likely that enhancement of these functions may indirectly alleviate stress.",

              "Yet, other studies have shown the MCC\u2019s involvement in environmental monitoring, response selection, and motor body orientation [58].",
              "Due to the MCC\u2019s role in integration of emotional information, movement, and behavior, some frameworks have suggested that it may play a key role in self-control [59\u201361].",
              "This is consistent with studies suggesting that meditation exerts many of its benefits via enhanced self-regulation of emotion, thoughts, behaviors, and decision-making [62\u201364].",

              "First, these low-impact practices are less strenuous compared to many other exercises that can be used in older adults with physical limitations without significant risk of adverse events.",
              "Many of the practices can be adapted to a sitting or lying down position.",
              "Second, meditation appears to improve mood, coping with chronic stress, and provides relief of chronic pain [97].",
              "Finally, meditation offers safe, non-pharmacologic alternative or adjunctive treatments, thus reducing polypharmacy.",
              "The emerging evidence points to the \u201cbrain fitness\u201d effects of meditative practices that can support cognitive abilities, memory, somatosensory, and motor functions [98\u2013100].",
              "This may be particularly beneficial in aging adults at-risk for cognitive decline.",
              "It is also interesting to note that many of the circuits affected by meditation are also implicated in social processes including empathy [101, 102].",
              "Recruitment of these processes may enhance well-being indirectly by facilitating high-quality social interactions [103, 104].",
              "They may also enhance caregiving and related behaviors, which play a critical role in attachment relationships where one individual is highly dependent on the other, such as parent\u2013infant relationships and those where one spouse may be ill and in need of care [105, 106].",
              "More broadly, social processes related to cooperation, empathy, and altruism are thought to be involved in the evolution and thriving of the species [107\u2013111].",
              "By parsing out the neural networks affected by these different meditation techniques, we propose to better understand how meditation works and, more importantly, to determine which meditation styles may be useful for specific functions.",
              "For example, a recent pilot study that compared resting-state brain activity among a group of individuals reporting mild cognitive issues (MCI) that were randomly assigned to a daily brief yogic meditation (Kirtan Kirya) with once-weekly KY class condition versus a rigorous \u201cmemory enhancement training\u201d control condition showed significant correlations between improvements in clinical measures of verbal memory and visual\u2013spatial memory performance in the yoga group with connectivity in the DMN and the language processing network, respectively [1\u2022].",
              "Thus, this study showed that an active meditation practice may be as effective as a \u201cgold standard\u201d memory enhancement training program for improving memory and brain connectivity, which may be particularly useful for older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and those experiencing acute or chronic stress deleterious for cognitive and physical functioning.",
              "Meditation has been used to improve awareness and well-being for thousands of years, but given recent technological advances and the growing popularity of these practices in the West, research studies are increasingly examining their efficacy and underlying mechanisms. Our review suggests that meditation influences brain systems involved in attention, awareness, memory, sensory integration, and the cognitive regulation of emotion.",
              "More nuanced results were also found showing unique recruitment for mindfulness practices, in brain regions that regulate body awareness and higher-order cognitive functions.",
              "Active-based meditative approaches showed unique effects too, in areas that mainly affect social processes (such as speech, language, empathy, and facial processing) and self-regulation.",
              "Collectively, these results suggest that meditation may be especially useful for brain fitness in aging adults as they provide enhancements of higher cognitive functions and social cognition, attention, memory, movement, and emotional regulation that can help in preventing mood, physical, and cognitive disorders of aging.",

              "Third, in the studies reviewed, immune biomarkers were often included as ancillary measures and, consequently, hypothesis tests were frequently underpowered.",
              "To truly advance this area of study, future projects will need to power studies and calibrate tests for changes in immune parameters as primary outcomes, a priori, to avoid false negative results.",
              "It will also be important to provide clearer rationales for the immune biomarkers chosen for inclusion and better descriptions of how those biomarkers relate to the pathophysiologic process being studied.",
              "Fourth, almost all of the RCTs examined (19/20 studies) employed peripheral blood as the main human specimen with which to quantify immune function.",

              "g., mucous, saliva, urine, hair) that could be validated against blood and potentially used as biomarkers of mindfulness meditation\u2013related changes in immune system dynamics.",
              "Finally, the specimen collection and processing procedure employed by several studies was not well described, thus highlighting an opportunity to improve the reporting of study procedures to enhance researchers\u2019 ability to replicate study protocols, especially with respect to the timing of specimen collection, steps taken for sample processing and storage, and procedures used for assay quantification.",
              "In conclusion, across 20 RCTs and more than 1600 participants, we found tentative evidence that mindfulness meditation modulates some select immune parameters in a manner that suggests a more salutogenic immune profile.",

              "In the study which reported changes in functional connectivity of insula with other brain regions between the BWV-training group and the meditation-nai\u0308ve control group, BWV training associates with functional changes in brain regions related with focused attention, executive control, emotional awareness and regulation.",
              "[22] Furthermore, compared to the control participants, BWV practitioners exhibited significantly thicker cortex and white matter structures in the medial prefrontal cortex which regulates emotions.",
              "[32] Above mentioned previous researches about the effects of BWV on brain function and structures support emotional changes in the meditation group, found in the current study.",

              "Among the postmenopausal participants, the mean value of HDL of the meditation group was even slightly lower than that of the control group (Table \u200b(Table3).",

              "[35] Furthermore, the measurements reported in yet another study support this finding by indicating a slight increase in the HDL subclasses in a population close to menopause.",
              "[36] Our finding indicating higher HDL levels in postmenopausal compared to in premenopausal participants in the control group is consistent with the previous findings described above.",
              "Carotid intima-media thickness can be an indication of subclinical arteriosclerosis.",
              "According to El Khoudary et al,[37] increased HDL levels during the premenopause stage relate to the prevention of the progression of carotid intima-media thickness, while increased HDL levels during the postmenopause stage relate to increments in the progression of carotid intima-media thickness.",
              "As the menopausal transition progresses, the levels of the potent antioxidant, estradiol, decrease, thereby leading to chronic inflammation being induced in the body.",
              "[9] Systemic inflammation converts HDL into its dysfunctional form, and therefore, potentially stops its function in arteriosclerosis prevention.",
              "[38] Among women over 52, a high HDL level is significantly related to high risks of non-fatal stroke and cerebral infarction.",
              "[39] In postmenopausal women, the HDL level positively correlates with carotid intima-media thickness.",
              "[40] These accumulated studies suggest that the function of HDL in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases during premenopause may not last after the menopause.",
              "Therefore, our current findings, that HDL levels are higher in the meditation group compared to in the control group among the premenopausal participants but not among the postmenopausal participants, suggest that the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases are lower in the meditation group than in the control group during the premenopause stage and are at least not higher during the postmenopause stage.",
              "Similar to HDL, only among the control participants, GLU increased significantly in the postmenopausal participants compared to the premenopausal participants (Table \u200b(Table3).",
              "3).",
              "As a result, the meditation group exhibited a significantly lower GLU level than the control group among postmenopausal participants (Table \u200b(Table3).",

              "Regulation disruption of GLU during menopause correlates with aging not with decline of ovarian function.",
              "[41] Therefore, the significant increment of GLU in the control group in the postmenopausal participants compared to the premenopausal participants seems to be induced by aging.",
              "On the other hand, the reason why such a change was not observed in the meditation group might be due to the association of meditation with delayed aging.",
              "[42,43] In both the meditation and control groups, postmenopausal participants showed a significant increase compared to premenopausal participants in several factors: joint and muscular discomfort among Menopausal Rating Scale (Table \u200b(Table2);",

              "BUN, LDH, AST, and ALT among blood chemistry components (Table \u200b(Table3).",
              "3).",
              "This suggests that these factors are especially sensitive to menopausal state or aging.",
              "The current study was designed as a pilot cross-sectional study to compare the menopausal symptoms and blood chemistry between the meditation group and the meditation-nai\u0308ve group comprised of healthy women.",
              "There was a trend of reduction in total Menopausal Rating Scale score in the meditation group compared to in the control group.",
              "In blood chemistry, there was a significant increase of HDL level in the meditation group compared to the control group among premenopausal participants, while there was a trend of increase of GLU in the control group compared to the meditation group among postmenopausal participants.",
              "There are limitations in the current study.",
              "As this study is a cross-sectional study, causal relationships between the meditation training and the indicated measurements cannot be discussed, therefore a longitudinal study is required to reveal the causal relationships.",
              "Moreover, as menopause is the natural phenomena along with aging of women, it is unclear whether the observations are related with aging or altered ovarian function by menopause.",
              "To answer this question, an experimental design with specific clinical setting is required.",
              "However, our current pilot study suggests the possibility of an association of meditation practice with the alleviation of menopausal symptoms as well as changes in HDL and GLU levels, warranting further studies with a longitudinal design and a larger study population to reveal the causal relationships involved.",

              "Chronic pain affects over 116 million Americans [1] and 1.",
              "5 billion people worldwide [2], impacting women disproportionately [3], and with an annually increasing prevalence [4].",
              "Many qualify chronic pain as having reached epidemic proportions [5].",
              "Under the mistaken belief that the risk for developing opioid use disorder was low when opioids are taken for the purpose of analgesia [6], the rate of opioid prescriptions markedly increased over the past two decades [7].",
              "In 2012 alone, 259 million opioid prescriptions were given in the USA [8].",
              "The repeated use of opioids produces physiological adaptations that lead to tolerance and physical dependence [7], driving a downward spiral of maladaptive cognitive-affective sequelae [9] that have led to an increased rate of opioid misuse and opioid use disorder among chronic pain patients [10].",
              "The use of opioids as frontline analgesics has been further called into question by a recent wave of evidence demonstrating that opioid-based treatments provide little benefit and actually exacerbate chronic pain.",
              "A recent randomized clinical trial (RCT) examined 12 months of opioid vs. non-opioid treatment for chronic back, hip, or knee pain and found that individuals taking opioids reported no pain-related improvements when compared with non-opioid therapies [11].",

              "The shortcomings of other chronic pain treatments like spinal cord stimulation [17], intrathecal pumps [18], and nerve ablations [19, 20] to produce long-term pain relief have inspired a wave of cognitive therapies that integrate components of contemplative practices to strengthen self-regulation of affective processes and target the etiological factors of chronic pain, rather than the physical source of injury.",
              "Yet, the degree to which complex psychosocial factors underlie many of these conditions has made the efficacious treatment of chronic pain a slow and difficult approach.",
              "Enhancing self-regulation of arising sensory and affective experiences is a potential mechanism in promoting long-lasting reductions in pain and corresponding comorbidities [21].",
              "To this end, self-regulatory practices such as mindfulness-based meditation reliably reduce affective pain when compared with sensory pain by targeting moment-to-moment appraisals of self and environment [22,23,24,25,26,27].",
              "Recent advances on the unique modulatory mechanisms supporting mindfulness-based analgesia have begun to shed light on how the affective-motivational and sensory-discriminative components of pain interact.",
              "Previous reviews have outlined the neuroimaging-based evidence of the distinct mechanisms supporting brief and long-term mindfulness training-induced pain relief discovered up to 2016 [28,29,30,31].",
              "The present review presents a short synopsis of such work and delineates recently discovered (> 2016) neuroscientific evidence that elucidates pain relief mechanisms and the manner in which interventions promote health across a broad range of disease points in greater detail.",
              "It is worth nothing that this review focuses on mindfulness meditation, one among thousands of distinct meditation techniques.",
              "Pain is constructed and modulated through a myriad of interactions between peripheral nociceptive sensory afferents (A-delta and C-fibers), ascending nociceptive signals in the spinal cord, and a distributed network of subcortical and cortical brain areas.",
              "Nociceptive information originates in sensory primary afferents that synapse in the dorsal horn before ascending contralaterally, largely through the spinothalamic pathway, to a feedback network of lower level sensory regions, including the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), thalamus, and primary somatosensory (SI) and secondary somatosensory (SII) cortices [32,33,34,35,36,37,38].",
              "The anterior and posterior insular cortices then fine-tune the ascending nociceptive signal before higher order brain regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), enrich it with contextual meaning [39,40,41,42].",
              "Cognitive techniques that manipulate mood [43], expectations [40, 44], and attention [45] reduce pain via a common descending inhibitory pathway.",
              "To this extent, the endogenous opioidergic system mediates cognitively modulated pain relief engaged by placebo [46,47,48,49,50,51], conditioned pain modulation [52], acupuncture [53], hypnosis [54], and attentional control [55].",
              "Specifically, the cognitive modulation of pain is associated with reductions of neural activity in pain-related brain regions and activation of the PAG to facilitate descending inhibition of pain at the level of the spinal cord [56,57,58,59].",
              "In contrast, growing evidence demonstrates that mindfulness meditation reduces pain through mechanisms that may bypass PAG-mediated descending inhibition [23, 31].",
              "Mindfulness meditation originated 4500 years ago in Southeast Asia and is, in its modern instantiation, a loose construct whose precise definition remains a matter of debate.",
              "In the secular scientific context within which mindfulness-based therapies are studied, it refers to a self-regulated attentional state based on non-judgmental awareness of the present moment [60].",
              "Mindfulness can be cultivated by a variety of meditation routines or can be practiced without formal training.",
              "Within the wide variety of mindfulness meditation techniques, two operationalized approaches stand out: focused attention [61] and choiceless awareness [62].",
              "Focused attention involves narrowing attention to the dynamic moment-to-moment quality of a sensory, emotional, or cognitive event, such as the breath, and re-orienting attention from distractors so as to sustain attention on the chosen object [31, 61].",
              "Choiceless awareness, on the other hand, involves the wide non-reactive monitoring of moment-by-moment sensory, cognitive, or affective states occurring in one\u2019s experience.",
              "The focused attention practitioner tends to naturally transition into a choiceless awareness state in which the internal sensory and cognitive milieu are monitored without evaluation [31, 61].",
              "As choiceless awareness practice further develops, awareness may reflect back upon itself, resulting in a profound reduction of self-referential processing during a state known as non-dual awareness that limits evaluation of object from the perspective of self [63].",
              "The large number of operational variations even within each of these techniques, however, requires that scientific studies reference the precise technique being evaluated.",
              "Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) [64] is one of the most promising mindfulness-based therapies to demonstrate clinical efficacy across a range of health outcomes.",
              "MBSR is an 8-week course that combines a range of sitting and moving meditation practices integrated with some behavioral therapy, daily \u201chomework,\u201d and a silent 2-day retreat.",
              "Other more-tailored mindfulness-based interventions evolved from MBSR to target different disease points: mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) to treat depression [65,66,67,68], mindfulness-oriented recovery enhancement (MORE) to target opioid misuse and chronic pain [69], and mindfulness-based relapse prevention, a therapy that reliably alleviates addiction and long-term recovery [70].",
              "Mindfulness-based therapies improve pain-related symptoms across a range of conditions including fibromyalgia, migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome [69, 71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82], with recent meta-analyses on chronic pain [83], rheumatoid arthritis [84], and cancer-related pain [85] confirming earlier findings.",
              "Of the different interventions, the 8-week MBSR program is the most studied.",
              "Multiple randomized control trials report post-MBSR improvements in pain-related symptoms and quality of life for patients with a spectrum of chronic pain conditions [86] including chronic low back pain [71, 87] and, in some one case, with sustained effects after 3 years [88].",
              "Mindfulness meditation\u2013based pain relief has also been studied in healthy, pain-free subjects via experimentally induced pain, with results showing that bouts of training briefer than 8 weeks are efficacious.",
              "One such study using noxious heat found that after a four-session (20 min/session) mindfulness meditation\u2013based intervention, meditation resulted in a significant 40% reduction in pain intensity and 57% reduction in pain unpleasantness ratings [22].",
              "Importantly, across studies, the most salient effects of mindfulness-based therapies are related to the significant improvements in affective factors that accompany and often complicate pain conditions, such as pain acceptance [89], stress [90, 91], depression [68, 92,93,94,95], and catastrophizing [96].",
              "Across most to all studies of mindfulness and pain, mindfulness practice leads to significant improvements in affective pain when compared with sensory pain [22,23,24,25,26,27].",
              "Mindfulness-based therapies thus appear particularly effective at targeting the affective component of pain and constitute a promising avenue toward better understanding and mitigating the psychosocial components of chronic pain.",
              "Until recently, however, the specific neural mechanisms responsible for mindfulness-based analgesia remained largely unknown.",
              "The advent of neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) opened the doors for researchers to investigate the neural mechanisms active in mindfulness meditation\u2013based pain relief and is associated with the surge in research on mindfulness [97].",
              "Up to 2016, a number of studies identified multiple unique neuromodulatory mechanisms for both brief and long-term mental training.",
              "In the context of brief mental training, two studies [22, 98] found mindfulness-based pain reductions in response to painful heat that were associated with activation in three cortical areas: the subgenual ACC (sgACC) (associated with cognitive and affective pain control), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (supporting contextual evaluation of sensory events), and the right anterior insula (associated with afferent nociceptive signal modulation and interoceptive awareness).",
              "In addition, they found that effortful cognitive processes mediated by executive attention downregulate ascending nociceptive signals in the thalamus through a mechanistically unique cortico-thalamic-cortical pathway that may have also facilitated lower SI corresponding to the stimulation site.",
              "Taken together, these mechanisms may relieve pain by recontextualizing pain as innocuous sensory information rather than an affectively laden threat to bodily integrity\u2014a type of \u201cmindful\u201d reappraisal of the meaning of nociceptive input.",
              "Researchers showed mindfulness-related pain relief to be mechanistically distinct from placebo-based pain relief by comparing experimentally induced pain during mindfulness meditation and sham mindfulness, an intervention identical to genuine mindfulness training except omitting mindfulness-based instructions (e.",
              "g., non-judgmental attention to the breath) [98].",
              "Instead, participants are instructed to \u201ctake deep breaths\u201d every 2\u20133 min \u201cas we sit here in mindfulness meditation.",
              "\u201d This novel pain modulatory pathway was found to be non-opioidergically mediated [23\u2022\u2022] and thus distinct from those of placebo-based pain relief [31, 98].",
              "On the other hand, long-term training elicits reductions in affective pain alongside greater activation in somatosensory regions and deactivation of appraisal-related regions like vmPFC [24, 25].",
              "This decoupling between frontal, appraisal-related areas and sensory areas may reflect a distinct non-appraisal mechanism, reflecting the ability of expert meditators to separate the sensory experience of pain from the corresponding contextualization, thereby removing the need for OFC-mediated top-down inhibitory control [24, 25, 31, 99].",
              "That is, experienced meditators have developed the capacity to sense noxious stimuli as frankly painful without the evaluation of unpleasantness/affect that traditionally accompanies painful experiences.",
              "Needless to say, there is great potential therapeutic value of both brief and long-term mindfulness practice to treat chronic pain patients for whom pharmacological analgesia has proven ineffective.",
              "Since 2016, evidence has continued to accumulate demonstrating that mindfulness-based pain relief is modulated through multiple unique neural mechanisms that are largely insensitive to opioidergic antagonism.",
              "As the role of pain\u2019s affective dimension in chronic disease etiology has grown in importance, so too has the accumulation of evidence demonstrating that mindfulness uniquely impacts affective pain to promote well-being.",
              "These new findings remarkably parallel recent findings suggesting that mindfulness meditation engages a novel modulatory pathway to reduce pain.",
              "Recent mechanistically focused clinical trials examining the effects of brief mindfulness-based mental training provide converging evidence that meditation bypasses the body\u2019s endogenous opioid system and operates via multiple unique neural pathways.",
              "The mechanisms supporting pain relief by mindfulness meditation are postulated to be disparate across training level and experience.",
              "Yet, recent evidence demonstrates that long-term meditation practitioners reliably reduce pain via non-opioidergic mechanisms. May and colleagues [100] recorded subjects\u2019 pain ratings in response to painful electrical stimulation, before and during choiceless awareness meditation during intravenous administration of saline or naloxone (the opioid antagonist) in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design.",
              "Naloxone infusion not only failed to antagonize meditation-induced pain relief but actually enhanced pain relief\u2014an unexpected result.",
              "It was suggested that the opioid blockage may have upregulated a non-opioid pathway.",
              "In order to disentangle the specific role of other underlying components of mindfulness for pain relief, Wells and colleagues [101] conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover naloxone and saline infusion study.",
              "Healthy subjects were randomized into mindfulness meditation, sham mindfulness meditation, and slow-paced breathing groups and administered noxious 49 \u00b0C heat to the back of the calf.",
              "As expected, naloxone did not reverse pain relief associated with mindfulness meditation.",
              "Surprisingly, slow-paced breathing significantly reduced pain during opioidergic antagonism.",
              "Importantly, naloxone infusion reversed analgesia produced by sham mindfulness meditation, providing supplementary evidence that mindfulness is mechanistically distinct from placebo.",
              "Since all techniques significantly lowered breathing rates, the independent pain-relieving role of slow breathing from endogenous opioids could not be ruled out.",
              "However, the authors found that self-reported \u201cattention to the breath\u201d was absent only from sham mindfulness practice.",
              "The shifting of executive attention between breath sensations, appraising distractions, and reorienting back to breath was hypothesized to modulate pain before nociceptive information can be elaborated into a subjective sensory experience, a phenomenon corroborated by post-hoc qualitative assessments in which greater pain relief was associated with self-reported attention to the breath [101].",
              "Thus, the authors postulated that attending to the breath, independently of mindfulness-based reappraisal, reduces pain by bypassing opioidergically mediated descending inhibition.",
              "Crucially, since slow-paced breathing is easier to perform than mindful attention to the breath, slow attentive breathing may be a critically valuable therapy for patients seeking a less cognitively demanding, non-opioidergic, self-administered pain therapy.",
              "Taken together, three separate studies now demonstrate that mindfulness reduces pain via non-opioidergic processes independent of meditation expertise.",
              "Mindfulness meditation involves a number of components such as choiceless awareness, attention to the breath, body awareness, and relaxation, which might underlie its effects on pain.",
              "A number of recent studies have begun to elucidate which specific components drive these effects, showing, for example, that the relaxation component alone is not the driver behind mindfulness-based pain relief [102] but that attention to breathing is a potential mechanism of action [101].",
              "Moreover, it has been shown that the autonomic nervous system plays a unique role in mindfulness-associated affective pain relief.",
              "There is an established relationship between increased activity in the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and pain relief.",
              "However, until recently, it was unknown to what extent mindfulness meditation-induced pain relief is associated with parasympathetic activity.",
              "A study examined high-frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), a robust marker of parasympathetic activation, during noxious heat and mindfulness and sham mindfulness meditation to determine the role of the parasympathetic system [103].",
              "Higher HF HRV was more strongly associated with lower pain unpleasantness (though not with pain intensity) ratings during genuine mindfulness than during sham mindfulness.",
              "Further mechanistic research is needed to characterize the precise role of the autonomic nervous system in mindfulness-based pain relief, but these results point toward a unique parasympathetic activation pattern engaged by mindfulness to relieve pain.",
              "The neuroscientific basis for affective pain relief associated with mindfulness meditation has benefited from randomized control studies combining different forms of experimentally induced pain and pain-eliciting stimuli.",
              "In one study, meditation-nai\u0308ve participants received 30 min of mindfulness training before either maintaining a mindset of mindful acceptance or reacting naturally to a series of aversive vs. neutral images and individually calibrated noxious vs. innocuous heat stimuli [104].",
              "After each trial, participants reported subjective pain and negative emotion levels.",
              "Mindful acceptance led to lower self-reported pain, less emotional reactivity to negative images as registered in the amygdala and PFC, and lower pain-related activity in the neurological pain signature (NPS)\u2014a machine learning\u2013based regression technique that can reliably predict self-reported pain [105].",
              "These findings provide novel evidence that a single mindfulness training session produces significant pain relief and engages modulatory brain mechanisms that support the evaluation of negative affect.",
              "Mindfulness meditation may also reduce social pain.",
              "In a study by Laneri et al.",
              "[106], long-term meditators and non-meditators were presented with images of people in neutral and in socially embarrassing situations after either a choiceless awareness mindfulness meditation or rest.",
              "All subjects exhibited greater ACC, anterior insula, and mPFC activation in response to embarrassing images, a typical pattern associated with the negative affect of experiencing another\u2019s distressing mental state [107].",
              "Compared with the subjects who did not meditate prior to the task, long-term meditation practitioners exhibited lower anterior insula activation during the presentation of embarrassing images, and these effects were associated with higher compassion scores.",
              "These data provide supplementary evidence that the anterior insula is strongly associated with cultivating interoceptive processes and compassion, an effect that may be developed after longer bouts of training.",
              "Previous studies had shown social pain from vicarious embarrassment to be significantly associated with anterior insula activation [107,108,109], while others had shown that mindfulness decreases reactivity to affective experiences, with associated lower anterior insula activation [110, 111].",
              "Therefore, these results suggest that meditation may reduce affective distress not only in response to one\u2019s own pain but also to someone else\u2019s.",
              "Moreover, this attenuation of empathic distress\u2014feeling of another\u2019s pain\u2014is in line with studies showing different brain activation patterns for empathic distress and empathic care [112], with the latter associated to compassion.",
              "Thus, converging lines of evidence suggest that mindfulness meditation may also attenuate social pain, an additional health benefit [113].",
              "Remarkably, the degree of decreased anterior insular activation was contingent on the frequency of daily practice, adding to growing evidence that compassion cultivation is a trainable skill.",
              "The studies reviewed above, conducted in healthy, pain-free individuals, have elucidated the specific pain-relieving mechanisms that may now allow for the design of more effective mindfulness-based therapies to target specific chronic pain conditions.",
              "The neural mechanisms supporting the direct alleviation of clinical pain have been brought into sharp focus by a seminal study by Seminowicz et al.",
              "[114\u2022\u2022], which assessed the behavioral efficacy and neural mechanisms supporting enhanced MBSR (MBSR+) on episodic migraine, a severe and disabling neurological pain disorder.",
              "The 98-participant randomized clinical trial compared a 12-session 4-month-long MBSR+ (doubling the duration of the original MBSR) intervention to a time-matched stress management for headache (SMH) program.",
              "Both groups showed reductions in the number of headache days per month from baseline to 20 weeks, with 23% of the SMH group responding to treatment compared with 52% of the MBSR+ group, a response rate comparable with that of first-line pharmacologic treatment.",
              "Moreover, fMRI data showed the MBSR+ group had weaker resting-state connectivity between dorsal anterior insula and both superior parietal lobule and cuneus, an effect the authors interpreted as evidence of increased cognitive efficiency from mindfulness-based training.",
              "Promising therapeutic results like these highlight the potential of mindfulness-based pain relief to reshape the chronic pain experience without the need for lengthy or cognitively demanding interventions.",
              "In the final section, the potential of mindfulness-based interventions to reduce the risk of opioid misuse among opioid-treated chronic pain patients will be discussed.",
              "So far, mindfulness-based interventions have been discussed in light of their therapeutic potential to modulate pain.",
              "Important recent research also suggests that these interventions may also mitigate the risk factors causing opioid-treated chronic pain patients to develop opioid use disorder, a valuable role in light of the current opioid crisis.",
              "Evidence suggests that prolonged opioid use may cause hedonic dysregulation, a sensitization to aversive experiences and concurrent reduction in responsiveness to natural rewards, which decreases positive affect and drives a downward spiral linking chronic pain to opioid misuse [9, 115].",
              "In order to counteract this negative spiral and promote hedonic well-being, MORE, an intervention based on Garland et al.",

              "In the first of these trials, in a sample of 115 chronic pain patients who had taken prescription opioids for more than 10 years, MORE reduced the occurrence of opioid misuse by 63% while decreasing opioid craving, pain severity, and pain interference [75].",
              "The effects of MORE on pain were statistically mediated by the capacity to reappraise pain as innocuous sensory information, again suggesting that mindfulness training modifies contextual evaluations of nociceptive information.",
              "In a second RCT, MORE was evaluated as a prophylactic intervention for long-term opioid-treated chronic pain patients at risk of developing opioid misuse [117\u2022].",
              "Ninety-five patients were randomized to 8 weeks of MORE or to a support group intervention, after which MORE-treated patients reported significantly greater improvements in an array of positive psychological functions and reductions in pain severity and opioid misuse risk than support group patients at 3-month follow-up.",
              "The effects of MORE on reducing pain severity were statistically mediated by increases in positive psychological functioning and, most notably, by mindfulness-induced mental states and enhanced capacity to savor positive experiences.",
              "These clinical effects parallel recent EEG data from a series of randomized controlled experiments demonstrating that MORE increases neurophysiological responsivity to naturally rewarding, positive stimuli and decreases neurophysiological reactivity to opioid-related cues [118].",
              "However, the underlying neural mechanisms supporting the effect of MORE on reducing pain and opioid misuse remain unknown.",
              "While more research is needed to confirm the precise neural mechanisms that modulate these processes, the ability of mindfulness meditation to not only target pain via multiple unique non-opioidergic modulatory pathways but to also mitigate the psychological risks of developing opioid use disease makes it an important candidate for further research.",
              "The neuroscience of mindfulness-based pain relief is in its infancy, and yet it has already proven capable of expanding the repertoire of known neural modulatory pain pathways and of shedding light on the complex affective and psychosocial components of chronic pain.",
              "The vast number of global chronic pain sufferers as well as the health and social risks of opioid use disorder underscores the potential value of developing validated self-administrable mind-body therapies that target pain multidimensionally via several unique neuromodulatory pathways.",
              "The great variability within mindfulness meditation techniques as well as the biopsychosocial complexity of chronic pain conditions, however, requires researchers to continue to apply the highest experimental standards to find and fine-tune the clinically relevant tools we need to produce long-lasting improvements in chronic pain management.",
              "By altering the meaning, interpretation, and appraisal of nociceptive information on its way to constructing the subjective experience of pain, mindfulness-based approaches may play an important role in the integrative therapeutic regimens capable of stemming the rising tide of chronic pain.",

              "According to this large body of research, meditation is associated with improvements in many important health conditions\u2014including depression, post-traumatic stress, and hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.",
              "It even appears to trigger favorable changes in biological processes such as inflammation, immune system functioning, and cellular aging.",

              "Although there is increasing debate among proponents about the \u201cbest\u201d form of meditation, current research does not support large differences in the health benefits of different meditation modalities.",
              "Instead, it appears that the regularity of meditation practice is more important than the type of meditation practiced and that meditation preferences are mostly subjective rather than reflecting substantive differences in quality.",

              "The sympathetic system regulates responses such as inflammation and arousal, whereas the parasympathetic system regulates the anti-inflammation process and promotes relaxation.",
              "Although the sympathetic system\u2014playing a more visible role in stress and illness\u2014receives considerable bad press, it is more accurate to consider the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems as the yin and yang of your autonomic nervous system, providing complementary functions that are all essential for life.",
              "In modern times, however, the yin-yang balance necessary for optimal health is too often replaced by a state of \u201csympathetic dominance,\u201d in which a person may become chronically stressed, poorly nourished or rested, and more vulnerable to illness.",
              "Recent neuroscience research assessing the effects of meditation on the nervous system suggest that regular meditation practice can\u2014at least partially\u2014reverse this harmful imbalance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems [2].",
              "This research shows, for instance, that meditation favorably alters heart rate variability (HRV).",
              "HRV is a measure of sympathetic and parasympathetic function assessed by carefully measuring beat-to-beat variations in the heart, with meditators showing that HRV changes over time are indicative of greater parasympathetic system activity and lower sympathetic system activity.",

              "These amygdala region reductions may explain why meditators show reduced reactivity to emotional stimuli and reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms. These same central nervous system changes improved by meditation are also important to physical health through their influence on blood pressure, inflammatory processes, stress hormones, and other biological processes linked to cardiovascular disease, as supported by a 2017 statement from the American Medical Association [5].",

              "In an earlier study of the same participants, the researchers had found that meditation practice reduced the concentration of gray matter in the amygdala, a region associated with fear, anxiety, and stress \u2014 and that this reduction was correlated with lower stress levels.",

              "Although this study was well designed, it's not likely to be the last word on the subject.",
              "It was small, and the significance of changes in grey matter concentration isn't entirely clear.",
              "Also, brain changes were not correlated with the amount of time a meditator spent practicing, so other factors may play a role.",

              "Of these practices, mindfulness meditation \u2014 often described as non-judgemental attention to present-moment experiences (Box 1) \u2014 has received most attention in neuroscience research over the past two decades2,3,4,5,6,7,8.",
              "Although meditation research is in its infancy, a number of studies have investigated changes in brain activation (at rest and during specific tasks) that are associated with the practice of, or that follow, training in mindfulness meditation.",
              "These studies have reported changes in multiple aspects of mental function in beginner and advanced meditators, healthy individuals and patient populations9,10,11,12,13,14.",

              "Within this framework, we describe research that has revealed changes in behaviour, brain activity and brain structure following mindfulness meditation training.",
              "We discuss what has been learned so far from this research and suggest new research strategies for the field.",
              "We focus here on mindfulness meditation practices and have excluded studies on other types of meditation.",
              "However, it is important to note that other styles of meditation may operate via distinct neural mechanisms15,16.",
              "Different styles and forms of meditation are found in almost all cultures and religions.",
              "Mindfulness meditation originally stems from Buddhist meditation traditions3.",
              "Since the 1990s, mindfulness meditation has been applied to multiple mental and physical health conditions, and has received much attention in psychological research2,4,5,6,7.",
              "In current clinical and research contexts, mindfulness meditation is typically described as non-judgemental attention to experiences in the present moment3,4,5,6,7,8.",
              "This definition encompasses the Buddhist concepts of mindfulness and equanimity158 and describes practices that require both the regulation of attention (in order to maintain the focus on immediate experiences, such as thoughts, emotions, body posture and sensations) and the ability to approach one's experiences with openness and acceptance2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,53,158,159,160,161.",
              "Mindfulness meditation can be subdivided into methods involving focused attention and those involving open monitoring of present-moment experience9.",
              "The mindfulness practices that have been the subject of neuroscientific research comprise a broad range of methods and techniques, including Buddhist meditation traditions, such as Vipassana meditation, Dzogchen and Zen, as well as mindfulness-based approaches such as integrative body\u2013mind training (IBMT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and clinical interventions based on MBSR4,5,6.",
              "Both MBSR and IBMT have adopted mindfulness practices from the Buddhist traditions and aim to develop moment-to-moment, non-judgemental awareness through various techniques8,9,10,11,53,73.",
              "IBMT has been categorized in the literature as open-monitoring mindfulness meditation9,10,161, whereas MBSR includes both focused attention and open-monitoring practices8.",
              "It has been suggested that mindfulness meditation includes at least three components that interact closely to constitute a process of enhanced self-regulation: enhanced attention control, improved emotion regulation and altered self-awareness (diminished self-referential processing and enhanced body awareness)10 (see the figure, part a).",
              "Mindfulness meditation can be roughly divided into three different stages of practice \u2014 early, middle (intermediate) and advanced \u2014 that involve different amounts of effort11 (see the figure, part b).",
              "Findings on the effects of meditation on the brain are often reported enthusiastically by the media and used by clinicians and educators to inform their work.",
              "However, most of the findings have not yet been replicated.",
              "Many researchers are enthusiastic meditators themselves.",
              "Although their insider perspective may be valuable for a deep understanding of meditation, these researchers must ensure that they take a critical view of study outcomes.",
              "In fact, for meditation studies there is a relatively strong bias towards the publication of positive or significant results, as was shown in a meta-analysis17.",
              "The methodological quality of many meditation research studies is still relatively low.",
              "Few are actively controlled longitudinal studies, and sample sizes are small.",
              "As is typical for a young research field, many experiments are not yet based on elaborated theories, and conclusions are often drawn from post-hoc interpretations.",
              "These conclusions therefore remain tentative, and studies must be carefully replicated.",
              "Meditation research also faces several specific methodological challenges.",
              "Cross-sectional versus longitudinal studies.",
              "Early meditation studies were mostly cross-sectional studies: that is, they compared data from a group of meditators with data from a control group at one point in time.",
              "These studies investigated practitioners with hundreds or thousands of hours of meditation experience (such as Buddhist monks) and compared them with control groups of non-meditators matched on various dimensions9,18.",
              "The rationale was that any effects of meditation would be most easily detectable in highly experienced practitioners.",
              "A number of cross-sectional studies revealed differences in brain structure and function associated with meditation (see below).",
              "Although these differences may constitute training-induced effects, a cross-sectional study design precludes causal attribution: it is possible that there are pre-existing differences in the brains of meditators, which might be linked to their interest in meditation, personality or temperament2,19.",
              "Although correlational studies have attempted to discover whether more meditation experience is related to larger changes in brain structure or function, such correlations still cannot prove that meditation practice has caused the changes because it is possible that individuals with these particular brain characteristics may be drawn to longer meditation practice.",
              "More recent research has used longitudinal designs, which compare data from one or more groups at several time points and ideally include a (preferably active) control condition and random assignment to conditions11,12,13,14,20,21,22,23,24,25.",
              "In meditation research, longitudinal studies are still relatively rare.",
              "Among those studies, some have investigated the effects of mindfulness training over just a few days, whereas others have investigated programmes of 1 to 3 months.",
              "Some of these studies have revealed changes in behaviour, brain structure and function11,12,13,14,20,21,22,23,24,25.",
              "A lack of similar changes in the control group suggests that meditation has caused the observed changes, especially when other potentially confounding variables are controlled for properly20,21,22.",
              "Novice meditators versus expert meditators.",
              "Although most cross-sectional studies included long-term meditators9,17, longitudinal studies are often conducted in beginners or naive subjects.",
              "Thus, differences in the results of cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses might be attributed to the different brain regions used during learning of meditation versus those used during the continued practice of an acquired skill.",
              "It would be interesting to follow subjects over a long-term period of practice to determine whether changes induced by meditation training persist in the absence of continued practice.",
              "However, such long-term longitudinal studies would be compromised by feasibility constraints, and it is likely that future longitudinal studies will remain restricted to relatively short training periods2.",
              "Control groups and interventions.",
              "It is important to control for variables that may be confounded with meditation training, such as changes in lifestyle and diet that might accompany the meditation practice or the expectancy and intention that meditation beginners bring to their practice.",
              "Researchers must carefully determine which variables are integral aspects of the meditation training and which can be controlled for.",
              "Some earlier studies only controlled for the length of time that the individual has practised meditation and the effects of repeated testing, but more recent studies have developed and included active interventions in control groups \u2014 such as stress management education26, relaxation training14,23,27 or health enhancement programmes20,21,22 \u2014 that can control for variables such as social interaction with the group and teachers, amount of home exercise, physical exercise and psychoeducation.",
              "These studies are therefore better able to extract and delineate the meditation-specific effects.",
              "For example, one study investigating short-term meditation training used a 'sham meditation' condition in which participants thought they were meditating, but did not receive proper meditation instructions, which allowed the researchers to control for factors such as expectancy, body posture and attention from the teacher28.",
              "Mechanistic studies ideally need to use interventions that are as effective as mindfulness meditation in producing the beneficial effects on target variables but that allow for assessment of the unique mechanism underlying the mindfulness practice23,29.",
              "Control conditions in functional imaging.",
              "Although all functional neuroimaging studies must use appropriate comparison conditions, this challenge is particularly important when imaging meditative states (Box 2).",
              "The comparison condition should be one in which a state of mindfulness meditation is not present.",
              "Many studies use resting comparison conditions, but a problem with this is that experienced practitioners are likely to enter into a state of meditation when at rest.",
              "However, other active tasks introduce additional brain activity that renders the comparison difficult to interpret.",
              "Using imaging protocols that do not rely on blood-oxygen-level-dependent contrasts (BOLD contrasts), such as arterial spin labelling, might be a possible solution for this problem30.",
              "A brain state can be defined as a reliable pattern of activity and/or connectivity in multiple large-scale brain networks11,73.",
              "Meditation training involves obtaining a meditative state, and measurements of behaviour and/or brain activity can be made while participants are thought to be in such a state15,76,162,163.",
              "These studies can elucidate how the state influences the brain and behaviour2,10,14,73.",
              "To identify brain regions activated during the state of meditation (compared to a baseline state) across multiple studies in experienced healthy meditators, an activation likelihood estimate meta-analysis of 10 studies with 91 subjects published before January 2011 was performed108.",
              "This revealed three areas in which there were clusters of activity: the caudate, which is thought (together with the putamen) to have a role in attentional disengagement from irrelevant information, allowing a meditative state to be achieved and maintained;",
              "the entorhinal cortex (parahippocampus), which is thought to control the mental stream of thoughts and possibly stop mind wandering;",
              "and the medial prefrontal cortex, which is thought to support the enhanced self-awareness during meditation108 (also see Ref.",
              "162).",
              "It was suggested that these regions of activity might represent a core cortical network for the meditative state, independent of the meditation technique.",
              "It is important to note, however, that this meta-analysis included mostly papers from traditions other than mindfulness.",
              "In the past decade, 21 studies have investigated alterations in brain morphometry related to mindfulness meditation17.",
              "These studies varied in regard to the exact mindfulness meditation tradition under investigation31,32,33,34,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52, and multiple measurements have been used to investigate effects on both grey and white matter.",
              "Studies have captured cortical thickness32,51, grey-matter volume and/or density33,40, fractional anisotropy and axial and radial diffusivity38,39.",
              "These studies have also used different research designs.",
              "Most have made cross-sectional comparisons between experienced meditators and controls32,33,34;",
              "however, a few recent studies have investigated longitudinal changes in novice practitioners38,39,40.",
              "Some further studies have investigated correlations between brain changes and other variables related to mindfulness practice, such as stress reduction40, emotion regulation39 or increased well-being47.",
              "Most studies include small sample sizes of between 10 and 34 subjects per group31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42.",
              "Because the studies vary in regard to study design, measurement and type of mindfulness meditation, it is not surprising that the locations of reported effects are diverse and cover multiple regions in the brain31,32,33,34,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52.",
              "Effects reported by individual studies have been found in multiple brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, subcortical grey and white matter, brain stem and cerebellum, suggesting that the effects of meditation might involve large-scale brain networks.",
              "This is not surprising because mindfulness practice involves multiple aspects of mental function that use multiple complex interactive networks in the brain.",
              "Table 1 summarizes the main findings of structural neuroimaging studies on mindfulness meditation (grey and white matter).",
              "An activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis, which also included studies from traditions other than mindfulness meditation, was conducted to investigate which regions were consistently altered in meditators across studies17.",
              "The findings demonstrated a global medium effect size, and eight brain regions were found to be consistently altered in meditators: the frontopolar cortex, which the authors suggest might be related to enhanced meta-awareness following meditation practice;",
              "the sensory cortices and insula, areas that have been related to body awareness;",
              "the hippocampus, a region that has been related to memory processes;",
              "the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), mid-cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, areas known to be related to self and emotion regulation;",
              "and the superior longitudinal fasciculus and corpus callosum, areas involved in intra- and inter-hemispherical communication17.",
              "Thus, some initial attempts have been undertaken to investigate the brain regions that are structurally altered by the practice of meditation.",
              "However, our knowledge of what these changes actually mean will remain trivial until we gain a better understanding of how such structural changes are related to the reported improvements in affective, cognitive and social function.",
              "Very few studies have begun to relate findings in the brain to self-reported variables and behavioural measures34,39,47,48,51.",
              "Future studies therefore need to replicate the reported findings and begin to unravel how changes in the neural structure relate to changes in well-being and behaviour.",
              "Growing evidence also demonstrates changes in the functional properties of the brain following meditation.",
              "Below, we summarize such findings in the context of the framework of core mechanisms of mindfulness meditation (Box 1;",
              "Fig.",
              "1).",
              "Schematic view of some of the brain regions involved in attention control (the anterior cingulate cortex and the striatum), emotion regulation (multiple prefrontal regions, limbic regions and the striatum) and self-awareness (the insula, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus).",
              "PowerPoint slide Many meditation traditions emphasize the necessity to cultivate attention regulation early in the practice9,53.",
              "A sufficient degree of attentional control is required to stay engaged in meditation, and meditators often report improved attention control as an effect of repeated practice10,14.",
              "Multiple studies have experimentally investigated such effects54.",
              "Components of attention.",
              "Attention is often subdivided into three different components: alerting (readiness in preparation for an impending stimulus, which includes tonic effects that result from spending time on a task (vigilance) and phasic effects that are due to brain changes induced by warning signals or targets);",
              "orienting (the selection of specific information from multiple sensory stimuli);",
              "and conflict monitoring (monitoring and resolution of conflict between computations in different neural areas, also referred to as executive attention)55,56.",
              "Other distinctions between types of attention refer to combinations of these three components.",
              "For example, sustained attention refers to the sense of vigilance during long continued tasks and may involve both tonic alerting and orienting, whereas selective attention may involve either orienting (when a stimulus is present) or executive function (when stored information is involved).",
              "Performance in these three basic domains can be measured with the attention network test (ANT)57.",
              "This test uses as a target an arrow pointing left or right.",
              "The target is surrounded by flankers, and subtracting reaction times to congruent stimuli (that is, those on the side of the screen indicated by the arrow) from reaction times to incongruent stimuli produces a measure of the time to resolve conflict.",
              "The inclusion of cues that indicate when or where the target will occur allows the measurement of alerting and orienting.",
              "These measures are used to quantify efficiency in each of the three networks that support the individual components of attention.",
              "Alerting involves the brain's noradrenaline system, which originates in the locus coeruleus.",
              "Orienting involves frontal and parietal areas, including the frontal eye fields and inferior and superior parietal lobe.",
              "The executive network involved in conflict resolution involves the ACC, anterior insula and basal ganglia58,59.",
              "Effects of mindfulness meditation on attention.",
              "The ANT and other experimental paradigms have been used to investigate the effects of meditation on attentional performance60.",
              "Improved conflict monitoring was reported in several studies14,61,62,63,64.",
              "For example, a longitudinal study showed that only 5 days (20 min per day) of integrative body\u2013mind training (IBMT) led to improved conflict monitoring14.",
              "In addition, cross-sectional studies of 3 months of mindfulness meditation showed a reduced attentional blink (a lapse in attention following a stimulus within a rapid stream of presented stimuli that has been related to executive function65,66) following training64 (also see Ref.",
              "67).",

              "More recently, it has received increasing attention by psychologists and neuroscientists.",
              "Although there is ongoing debate about the precise definition of mindfulness meditation, in current clinical and research contexts, mindfulness meditation is considered to be a state that is typically described as \u201cnonjudgmental attention to experiences in the present moment\u201d [1\u20135].",
              "Mindfulness meditation can be subdivided into methods involving focused attention and those involving open monitoring of present-moment experience [2, 9].",
              "Mindfulness meditation has been practiced widely, with the purpose of stress reduction and the promotion of health and well-being.",

              "Mindfulness research in the last two decades has supported the claim that it exerts beneficial effects on physical health, mental health, and cognitive performance [2, 4].",
              "However, the underlying neural mechanisms associated with positive outcomes are not fully understood [2, 4].",
              "We describe a translational prevention framework that integrates research in the fields of neuroscience and prevention science to help facilitate an understanding of the etiology of the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation and provide guidance to further the understanding and prevention of behavioral health disorders.",

              "In this paper, we focus on type 1 translational research, which includes the transfer of knowledge from basic science to development and testing of an intervention or program.",
              "A core foundation of type 1 translational prevention science is that the intervention must have an \u201caction theory\u201d that corresponds to how the intervention will affect the underlying biologically based mechanisms of change, or mediators, as well as a conceptual theory that describes how the mediators will predict the hypothesized outcome variables [10].",
              "The goal of this approach is to inform the development of personalized prevention approaches that are guided by basic science findings, using a theory-guided approach.",
              "This approach is not without its challenges, and in particular, basic scientists are trained in basic biological processes but not in the development of preventive interventions, whereas prevention researchers typically have not received training in the basic biological sciences.",
              "The education training and methods of each discipline are quite distinct.",
              "For example, basic scientists may receive training in biological mechanisms at the cellular or genetic level and conduct laboratory-based research involving microscopes, neuroimaging techniques, or gene assays, whereas prevention scientists typically receive training in health and human development and how to change behavior via effective psychosocial interventions, but not in the biology or processes occurring \u201cunder the skin.",
              "\u201d This poses structural and training barriers to the integration of findings and approaches across disciplines and reduces the likelihood that links between a biological finding and the application of a corresponding theory-guided intervention will occur.",
              "Further, often, the key basic science findings originate from animal studies, whereas the preventive intervention expertise is typically in human populations.",
              "Although some aspects of biology can be directly translated across species, others cannot (e.",
              "g., \u201cdevelopment\u201d varies by species, including at what age different brain structures mature).",
              "As such, successful type 1 translational research is most readily facilitated through collaborations between experts in neuroscience, biology, or other basic sciences and experts in prevention research.",
              "Such collaborations help to bridge differences in the scientific cultures and their corresponding languages and techniques and align them within a common framework and purpose.",
              "Our conceptual framework, shown in Fig.",
              "1 and described below, aims to integrate knowledge from the biological sciences (specifically, neuroscience) and prevention science to illustrate an action theory and a conceptual theory describing how mindfulness meditation can lead to activation of specific brain regions which are associated with specific domains of self-regulation, which then result in improved self-regulation and, ultimately, to improved mental health.",
              "The active ingredients of mindfulness meditation focus on increasing awareness of one\u2019s thoughts, emotions, and actions.",
              "The mechanisms hypothesized to be affected by mindfulness meditation practices include specific neurobiological structures that are associated with the self-regulation capacities of attention, emotion regulation, and self-awareness.",
              "These brain structure and behavioral mediators are then hypothesized to predict a set of longer-term outcomes associated with self-regulation, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, drug abuse, and antisocial behavior [11, 12].",
              "Integrated translational framework illustrating the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms whereby mindfulness meditation could affect self-regulation outcomes To illustrate support for this translational prevention model, in the sections below, we first review neuroscience evidence that indicates that attention, emotion regulation, and self-awareness are each associated with distinct brain structures and systems that are malleable via psychosocial interventions.",
              "Second, we provide a review of studies on mindfulness meditation research that have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and shown that mindfulness interventions are associated with changes in these brain systems and with changes in associated self-regulation outcomes.",
              "Third, we summarize evidence on the effects of mindfulness meditation on longer-term self-regulation mental health outcomes, such as ADHD, anxiety, depression, and substance use to illustrate support for out translational framework from the field of prevention science.",
              "Fourth, we conclude with implications and future directions for translational neuroscience prevention research related to mindfulness meditation.",
              "The work described in this paper is not intended to serve as a systematic review of the literature;",
              "rather, we describe key findings from both neuroscience and prevention science that serve as illustrative examples of our translational framework.",
              "It has been suggested that mindfulness meditation affects at least three components that interact closely to constitute a process of enhanced self-regulation: enhanced attention control, improved emotion regulation, and altered self-awareness (diminished self-referential processing and enhanced body awareness) (see Fig.",
              "1).",
              "Integrating knowledge from the field of prevention science with the field of neuroscience, we propose an integrated translational framework for mindfulness meditation in which we suggest that the underlying brain regions and networks affected by mindfulness meditation may be associated with observable changes at the behavioral level in specific mental processes, including attention control, emotion regulation, and self-awareness [2].",
              "For example, mindfulness meditation changes anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and striatum associated with attention control, PFC and limbic areas related to emotion regulation, and insula, medial PFC (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus involved in self-awareness.",
              "As such, mindfulness meditation may affect self-regulatory outcomes through its effects on specific brain systems. Figure 1 illustrates this framework, and below, we overview the three neurobiological mechanisms hypothesized to be affected by mindfulness meditation.",
              "Figure 2 draws on evidence from neuroscience to show the brain regions involved in the components of mindfulness meditation.",
              "Note that we illustrate the three brain systems and corresponding observable self-regulatory skills as separate constructs but recognize that they are correlated with one another and that changes in one system can affect changes in another system.",

              "Similarly, brain systems shown to be activated in the broad construct of self-regulation cover the same ACC/mPFC and striatum [7, 14, 15].",
              "Thus, the overlap of brain regions associated with attention control and self-regulation suggests a neurobiological pathway whereby mindfulness meditation could exert its influences [2, 15].",
              "A second component of self-regulation is emotion regulation.",
              "Emotion regulation refers to strategies that can influence which emotions arise and when, how long they occur, and how these emotions are experienced and expressed [16].",
              "Neuroimaging studies have shown that emotion regulation activates multiple PFC regions and limbic regions such as amygdala [17].",
              "Enhanced emotion regulation has been suggested to underlie many of the beneficial effects of mindfulness meditation [18].",
              "A range of implicit and explicit emotion regulation processes has been proposed [16, 19], and mindfulness-based emotion regulation may involve a mix of these processes, including attentional deployment (attending to mental processes, including emotions), cognitive change (altering typical patterns of appraisal regarding one\u2019s emotions), and response modulation (decreasing tonic levels of suppression) [2, 19].",
              "Self-awareness is the third component of self-regulation that is hypothesized to be affected by mindfulness meditation.",
              "Self-awareness often refers to meta-awareness (making awareness itself an object of attention) in mindfulness meditation.",
              "Self-referential processing is one major component of self-awareness which concerns stimuli that are experienced as strongly related to one\u2019s own person.",
              "Typical examples are the way that we perceive pictures of ourselves or close friends versus pictures of completely unknown people or pictures of our houses where we spent our childhood versus pictures of any unknown house, etc.",
              "A meta-analysis of imaging studies indicated that self-referential processing is mediated by cortical midline structures [20].",
              "In sum, self-awareness involves mPFC, the PCC, the precuneus, and insula [2].",
              "A key test of our translational framework is whether mindfulness meditation interventions produce changes in the putative brain and behavioral self-regulatory mechanisms described in the preceding section.",
              "Type I translational prevention research is a useful method to address the question of whether there is evidence that mindfulness meditation leads to changes in the following: (1) the brain systems of ACC/PFC and striatum and the behavioral system of attention control;",
              "(2) the brain systems of the PFC and limbic areas and behavioral systems related to emotion regulation;",
              "and (3) the brain systems of the insula, mPFC, and PCC/precuneus and the behavioral system of self-awareness.",

              "Changes in the core brain regions after mindfulness meditation Neuroscience research shows that the attention control network is heavily involved in mindfulness practice [2, 4, 6, 9] because attention control is required to stay engaged in the practice of mindfulness meditation.",
              "Studies examining the meditating role of attention control have reported that repeated practice leads to improvement [4, 6].",
              "For example, in a cross-sectional study using Vipassana meditators versus controls, enhanced ACC activation during breath awareness (focused attention) meditation was found [21].",
              "In a longitudinal mindfulness training versus active control, greater dorsolateral PFC activation during emotional Stroop executive processing was detected [22].",
              "Mindful emotion regulation works by strengthening PFC cognitive control mechanisms and thus downregulating activity in regions relevant to affect processing, such as the amygdala.",
              "Present-moment awareness and non-judgmental acceptance through mindfulness meditation [4, 5] are thought to be crucial in promoting cognitive control because they increase sensitivity to affective cues that help to signal the need for control [23].",
              "A frequently reported finding is that mindfulness practice is associated with a diminished activation of the amygdala in response to emotional stimuli during mindful states [24, 25].",
              "For instance, in a longitudinal and uncontrolled study, patients with social anxiety disorder before and after MBSR showed diminished right dorsal amygdala activity during reacting to negative self-belief statements [24].",
              "In a cross-sectional study, downregulation of the left amygdala was detected when viewing emotional pictures in a mindful state in beginner but not expert Zen meditators [25].",
              "Recent studies seem to suggest that brain structures such as insula, mPFC, and PCC/precuneus supporting self-referential processing might be affected by mindfulness meditation [26, 27].",
              "Mindfulness practitioners often report that the practice of attending to present-moment body sensations leads to an enhanced awareness of bodily states and greater perceptual clarity of subtle interoception.",
              "Thus, evaluative self-referential processing is assumed to decrease as an effect of mindfulness meditation, whereas awareness of present-moment experiences is thought to be enhanced [2, 4].",
              "Recent studies have shown that mindfulness meditation improves self-awareness that is deficit in substance use and addiction [28, 29].",
              "Functional imaging research has indicated that mindfulness meditation induces changes at resting and task implementation (attention, emotion, and self-referential tasks) that are associated with diverse brain networks such as ACC, PFC, PCC, striatum, amygdala, and insula [4].",
              "Studies also show structural alteration in the brain associated with mindfulness meditation or diverse meditation traditions [2, 4, 30].",
              "Across the functional and structural MRI studies that have been published to date, especially based on the longitudinal randomized controlled studies with active control groups and meta-analyses, the brain regions of ACC, PFC, PCC, insula, striatum (caudate, putamen), and amygdala seem to show relatively consistent changes associated with mindfulness meditation [2, 4].",
              "One form of mindfulness meditation, integrative body\u2013mind training (IBMT), has been shown in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to lead to improvements in self-regulation (attention control, emotion regulation, and self-awareness).",
              "We here take IBMT as an example to further discuss the relationships among self-regulation, brain areas involved, and mindfulness meditation.",
              "IBMT originates from ancient Eastern contemplative traditions, including traditional Chinese medicine and Zen.",
              "IBMT stresses no effort or less effort to control thoughts and the achievement of a state of restful alertness that allows a high degree of awareness and balance of the body, mind, and environment.",

              "IBMT has been categorized in the literature as open-monitoring mindfulness meditation [2, 6, 31, 32].",
              "In one study, Chinese undergraduates were randomly assigned to either an IBMT group (n = 40) or to a relaxation control group (n = 40) using a pre-study\u2013post-study RCT design [6].",
              "Analyses indicated that after 5 days of training, the IBMT group showed significantly greater improvement in attention control than did the control group.",
              "In addition, individuals in the IBMT condition had lower negative affect and fatigue and higher positive feelings on the emotion regulation [6].",
              "In a second study, we randomly assigned 46 undergraduates to IBMT or relaxation groups and conducted brain imaging assessments before, during, and after 5 days (about 2 h) of IBMT vs. relaxation training [7].",
              "Neuroimaging data demonstrated that individuals in the IBMT condition showed stronger subgenual and adjacent ventral ACC activity compared to individuals in the relaxation control condition.",
              "In a third study (n = 23 IBMT;",
              "n = 22 relaxation group), we acquired brain images from each participant at rest using MRI diffusion tensor imaging for analysis of white matter before and after training.",
              "Results showed that around 4 weeks (\u223c10 h) of IBMT increased fractional anisotropy connecting ACC to other regions, indicating the white matter structural change following longer IBMT [32].",
              "Because deficits in activation of the ACC have been associated with many disorders, including mood disorders and substance abuse, the ability to strengthen cingulate connectivity through training could provide a means for improving attention control and might serve as a possible therapy or prevention tool [2, 32].",
              "These brain areas before-mentioned may be the core regions involved in self-regulation of attention, emotion, and awareness following mindfulness training, as shown in Table 1.",
              "However, we acknowledge that many other brain areas are also involved in mindfulness practice and warrant further investigation using rigorous RCT designs.",
              "As illustrated in Fig.",
              "1, the distal outcome in our translational framework is the promotion of well-being and mental health.",
              "Improved mental health symptoms are hypothesized to be driven by changes in brain regulatory systems and structures that affect the self-regulation functions targeted by mindfulness meditation interventions.",
              "In this section, we draw from the field of prevention science to provide three examples of behavioral health outcomes that are hypothesized to be improved and avoided via mindfulness meditation interventions: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and drug use [33].",
              "Within each section, we propose next steps that neuroscience and prevention science researchers and practitioners can do moving forward to further the research rigor and expand dissemination efforts.",
              "ADHD is widely considered to comprise a deficit in self-regulation, which encompasses deficits in behavioral inhibitions, working memory, regulation of motivation, and motor control [34].",
              "As such, it is a primary long-term outcome hypothesized to be reduced or prevented by mindfulness meditation interventions.",
              "Extant research has identified brain systems and structures that are differentially affected in individuals with and without ADHD.",
              "Specifically, functional and structural neuroimaging has identified brain abnormalities involved in ADHD.",
              "Hypofunction of the brain regions including the cingulo-frontal-parietal cognitive attention network has been consistently observed across studies [35].",
              "A meta-analysis also showed a ventral-striatal hyporesponsiveness (decreased response) on reward anticipation in ADHD individuals compared to healthy individuals [36].",
              "These are major components of neural systems related to attention and self-control networks, motor systems, and reward/feedback-based processing systems. The ADHD neuroimaging research related to these network dysfunctions is also associated with the core symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.",
              "However, these network abnormalities are not the only factors responsible for ADHD;",
              "instead, they are only part of the pathophysiology of ADHD [36].",
              "In order to fully characterize the disorder, a next step for neuroscience researchers in this area is to expand their investigation beyond dysfunction of prefrontal-striatal circuitry, to consider the large-scale neural systems involved in ADHD including frontoparietal, dorsal attentional, motor, visual, and default networks [33, 37].",
              "As described earlier, mindfulness meditation includes at least three components that interact closely to constitute a process of enhanced self-regulation: enhanced attention control, improved emotion regulation, and altered self-awareness.",
              "As such, the core ADHD symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity are targeted [2, 33].",
              "Mindfulness meditation has been applied in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD and primarily targets strengthening attention, managing emotions, and achieving goals [33, 38].",
              "Overall, the results are promising and demonstrate feasibility of mindfulness meditation in ADHD populations and preliminary effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in the treatment of ADHD [39].",
              "However, prior research in this area has been plagued by methodological issues such as small samples, a lack of active comparison groups, and short follow-up periods limiting generalizability [39].",
              "We therefore recommend that neuroscientists and prevention scientists partner to conduct rigorous longitudinal studies using RCT designs, samples large enough to detect small effects, and type 1 method and measurement approaches [33].",
              "This would lay the groundwork for type 2 translational efforts.",
              "Although less studied than ADHD in the context of mindfulness meditation using RCT designs, there is some evidence that brain structures and emotional regulation processes related to depressive symptoms can also be improved through mindfulness meditation interventions.",
              "Emotion regulation activates multiple PFC and limbic regions such as the amygdala [2, 17, 18], and studies have reported various positive effects of mindfulness meditation on emotional processing, including a reduction in emotional interference by unpleasant stimuli [40], decreased physiological reactivity and facilitated return to emotional baseline after response to a stressor film [41], and decreased self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation [42].",
              "Consequently, lowered intensity and frequency of negative affect [43, 44] and improved positive mood states [6, 44, 45] are reported to be associated with mindfulness meditation.",
              "Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been used for treatment of depression, and a systematic review showed that some studies found that alterations in mindfulness, rumination, worry, compassion, or meta-awareness were associated with predicted or mediated MBCT\u2019s effect on treatment outcome [46\u201348].",
              "However, despite this preliminary type 1 translational work, researchers should conduct more rigorous designs that can assess the causal relationship among the brain, emotion, and depression.",
              "A meta-analysis of 39 studies conducted across ten countries indicated that mindfulness meditation interventions were superior to standard care (behavioral and psychopharmacological treatment) in reducing depressive symptoms and preventing relapse, with effect sizes ranging from 0.",
              "11 to 1.",
              "65 [49].",
              "A meta-analysis of cancer patients and survivors conducted during the same time found similarly sized effects on depressive symptoms [50].",
              "However, most studies in these meta-analyses used single-group pretest\u2013posttest quasi-experimental designs, convenience sampling, and self-reported questionnaires;",
              "therefore, more rigorous designs are needed that examine the effects of mindfulness meditation interventions on depressive symptoms. The hypothesis that drives many of the studies focused on depression is that mindfulness-based emotion regulation works by strengthening PFC cognitive control mechanisms and downregulating activity in regions relevant to affect processing, such as the amygdala, ultimately reducing depressive symptoms [2].",
              "However, to our knowledge, few studies have tested all aspects of the proposed translational framework related to depression outcomes simultaneously.",
              "Researchers should conduct additional type 1 work in this area in order to advance our understanding of the neurobiological mediators and pathways underlying mindfulness meditation changes in depression.",
              "Substance use and addiction are distal outcomes that are hypothesized to have connections to all three self-regulation domains in our translational model: attention control, emotion regulation, and self-awareness.",
              "For example, substance use can be seen as an addictive behavior in which impulses and behavior cannot be controlled, suggesting deficits in attention control.",
              "It can also be viewed as a method of \u201cself-medication\u201d to relieve symptoms of distress and change one\u2019s emotional state, suggestive of impairments in emotion regulation.",
              "Third, it is considered by some as intentional deception, and as such, \u201cdenial\u201d might instead reflect dysfunction of brain networks subserving insight and self-awareness [28].",
              "More than 80 % of addicted individuals fail to seek treatment, which might reflect impairments in recognition of severity of disorder [28, 29].",
              "There is preliminary evidence that mindfulness meditation can reduce substance use, perhaps through one or more of these hypothesized pathways [51, 52].",
              "For example, one study of mindfulness-naive smokers demonstrated reduced connectivity between craving-related brain regions during a mindfulness condition compared to passive viewing of smoking-related images during cigarette craving [53], suggesting a functional decoupling of involved regions.",
              "A meta-analysis of 24 studies focused on mindfulness and substance use suggested that mindfulness meditation interventions can reduce the consumption of several substances including alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, cigarettes, and opiates to a significantly greater extent than waitlist controls, non-specific educational support groups, and some specific control groups [54].",
              "This meta-analysis also provided preliminary evidence that mindfulness meditation interventions are associated with a reduction in craving as well as increased mindfulness.",
              "There is preliminary evidence of gender differences in mindfulness meditation interventions in relation to substance use outcomes, with a meta-analysis reporting that several quasi-experimental studies and case series found that women gravitated more toward mindfulness meditation interventions or benefitted more from mindfulness interventions [55].",
              "However, similar to the other studies linking mindfulness meditation interventions with clinical-level benefits in self-regulation, most of the studies were limited by small sample sizes, lack of methodological rigor, or lack of consistently replicated findings [56].",
              "Neuroscientists and prevention scientists should collaborate to conduct more rigorous and larger randomized controlled studies in this area, to increase the conclusions that can be drawn from type 1 translational studies and move the field closer to being able to conduct type II studies.",
              "Recently, a few rigorous and randomized studies started to test the effect of mindfulness meditation on addiction [51, 52].",
              "For example, compared to treatment as usual (12-step programming and psycho-education), eight weekly group sessions of mindfulness-based relapse prevention resulted in significantly lower risk of relapse to substance use and heavy drinking among participants [51].",
              "Similarly, a recent randomized study of IBMT tested whether this mindfulness intervention reduced smoking [52].",
              "Participant recruitment was for stress reduction and not specifically related to the intention to quit smoking.",
              "Before training, smokers demonstrated reduced activity in ACC, PFC, and other areas during rest compared to non-smokers, consistent with the association between impaired self-control and addiction.",
              "Two weeks of IBMT (5 h in total) produced a significant reduction in smoking (60 %) and craving, whereas no reduction was found in the relaxation training control group.",
              "Resting-state MRI showed increased activity for the IBMT group in the ACC and mPFC, key brain areas for self-control, which were associated with a reduction in smoking behavior [52].",
              "These results suggest that brief mindfulness meditation approaches can improve self-control capacity and reduce smoking, even without a conscious intention to do so [52, 57].",
              "Practitioners should review the findings from these more recent and more rigorous RCT trials and partner with the research team to investigate whether these interventions are sufficiently manualized and portable to be able to be delivered as part of routine clinical practice.",
              "Interest in the behavioral and neurobiological investigation of mindfulness meditation has rapidly increased over the past two decades.",
              "However, knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie the effects of mindfulness meditation is still in its infancy, suggesting the need for more type 1 translational research in this area.",
              "The emerging evidence indicates that mindfulness meditation might cause neuroplasticity in the structure and function of brain regions involved in control of attention, emotion regulation, and self-awareness.",
              "Further, there is a growing body of evidence that mindfulness meditation interventions can be effective in reducing ADHD symptoms, depression, and substance use and addiction.",
              "However, there is limited evidence linking all components of the proposed translational framework to illustrate which brain systems are affected, what specific self-regulation outcomes are improved, and, ultimately, which clinical symptoms are prevented.",
              "In this paper, we described a translational prevention framework that linked underlying neurobiological structures with observable self-regulatory behavior, united by change mechanisms associated with mindfulness meditation.",
              "Further, we hypothesized distal outcome improvements in clinical symptoms as a result of the intervention-driven changes in brain structure and observed self-regulatory skills.",
              "Neuroscientists and prevention scientists should partner to conduct additional type 1 research that employs longitudinal, randomized, and actively controlled research designs and larger sample sizes to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of mindfulness meditation in regard to the interactions of complex brain networks and to connect neurobiological findings with findings from behavioral studies.",
              "Simultaneous to these type 1 efforts, specific model components that have been verified via rigorous type 1 trials can advance into type 2 and type 3 translational research.",
              "Prevention scientists should leverage these findings to test the implementation and sustainability of mindfulness meditation interventions and examine the cost-benefits of such interventions.",
              "One significant barrier in this translation is the generation of a qualified work force of interventionists who are trained to deliver mindfulness meditation interventions with fidelity and model adherence.",
              "As such, researchers and practitioners should advocate to policy makers for the need for funding to help spur the translation from type I research to type 2 and 3 implementation work.",
              "Researchers and practitioners should also ensure that they have developed intervention manuals or instructions and fidelity systems so that effective interventions can be delivered by others.",
              "Relatedly, researchers and practitioners need to ensure that systems are in place for training and certifying new interventionists.",
              "Further, methods for quantifying the fiscal costs of delivering a specific mindfulness meditation intervention are needed.",

              "Going by these values, it won\u2019t be wrong to conclude that the reason why animals live in auto-mode and have little to no capacity to rationalize or think consciously is because of the relatively smaller prefrontal cortex.",
              "Similarly, another interesting fact is that the relative size of the prefrontal cortex is what separates us from our primitive ancestors.",
              "Scientists have found that over the course of evolution, the prefrontal cortex is what grows the most prominently in humans, than in any other species.",
