    "query": "What is the history and cultural significance behind the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, and how has it evolved over time to become a widely-practiced and revered aspect of Japanese culture and hospitality?",
    "response": "The traditional Japanese tea ceremony is a cultural tradition that involves preparing and serving green tea in a very particular way, with a sense of aesthetics, hospitality, and mindfulness. It is also known as chado or sado, meaning \"the way of tea\" [^2^] [^3^].\n\nThe history of the tea ceremony can be traced back to China, where tea drinking was a habit of Buddhist monks to aid their meditation and ward off sleep. It was introduced to Japan by Buddhist monks in the 8th century CE [^2^]. However, it was not until the 13th century CE that tea drinking became a refined activity among the aristocracy and the warrior elite, who adopted it as a means to display their culture and forge social ties [^2^] [^4^].\n\nThe tea ceremony as it is known today emerged in the 16th century CE, under the influence of Sen no Rikyu, a tea master who established the principles of wabi-cha, or \"tea of quiet taste\". Wabi-cha emphasizes simplicity, rusticity, and naturalness, as well as harmony, respect, purity, and tranquility. Sen no Rikyu also designed the tea house (chashitsu), a small structure with a low entrance and an alcove (tokonoma) for displaying a scroll and a flower arrangement. The tea house is usually surrounded by a landscaped garden with a stone path leading to it [^1^] [^2^] [^4^].\n\nThe tea ceremony consists of the host bringing the tea utensils into the room, offering the guests special sweets, and then preparing and serving them tea made of powdered green tea (matcha) whisked in hot water. The prepared tea is usually thin and frothy (usucha), but sometimes thick (koicha) on certain occasions. The serving of sweets and tea may be preceded by a light meal (kaiseki). After the tea is consumed, the guests are free to inquire about the various implements, which are afterward carried from the room and the ceremony concluded [^1^] [^2^].\n\nThe tea ceremony is considered one of the three classical arts of Japanese refinement, along with kodo (incense appreciation) and kado (flower arranging). It has evolved over time to become a widely-practiced and revered aspect of Japanese culture and hospitality, as well as a spiritual practice that cultivates awareness, harmony, and gratitude [^3^] [^5^].",

              "[1] While in Europe it is known as the \"tea ceremony\", it is seldom ceremonial in its practice.",
              "Most often tea is served to family, friends, and associates;",
              "religious and ceremonial connotations are overstated in European places.",
              "The English term \"Teaism\" was coined by Okakura Kakuzo\u0304 to describe the unique worldview associated with Japanese tea ceremony, as opposed to focusing just on the ceremonial aspect, a perspective that many practitioners frown upon.",
              "[2][3][4] Zen Buddhism was a primary influence in the development of the culture of Japanese tea.",
              "Much less commonly, Japanese tea practice uses leaf tea, primarily sencha, a practice known as senchado\u0304 (\u714e\u8336\u9053, 'the way of sencha').",
              "Tea gatherings are classified as either an informal tea gathering (chakai (\u8336\u4f1a, 'tea gathering')) or a formal tea gathering (chaji (\u8336\u4e8b, 'tea event')).",
              "A chakai is a relatively simple course of hospitality that includes confections, thin tea, and perhaps a light meal.",
              "A chaji is a much more formal gathering, usually including a full-course kaiseki meal followed by confections, thick tea, and thin tea.",
              "A chaji may last up to four hours.",
              "The first documented evidence of tea in Japan dates to the 9th century.",

              "Another feature is a stone, free-standing lantern, also outside.",

              "The desired greenery was evergreens rather than flowers, and moss or grass underfoot to begin the calming effect of the ceremony before even entering the tea room.",
              "The doorways of tea rooms were usually small, only around 90 cm (3 ft) high, which was meant to show that all were of equal status once inside.",

              "[35][36] The method of steeping loose tea leaves in hot water came to be known as \"boiled tea\" (\u714e\u8336, sencha), and it soon led to a new way of producing green tea that would work well with this technique.",
              "In 1737, an Uji-based tea grower named Nagatani So\u0304en developed what is now the standard process for making leaf teas in Japan: tea leaves are first steamed, then rolled into narrow needles and dried in an oven.",
              "[37][38] The process imparts a vivid emerald color to the leaf, along with a \"clean\", sometimes sweet flavor.",

              "[1] While in Europe it is known as the \"tea ceremony\", it is seldom ceremonial in its practice.",
              "Most often tea is served to family, friends, and associates;",
              "religious and ceremonial connotations are overstated in European places.",
              "The English term \"Teaism\" was coined by Okakura Kakuzo\u0304 to describe the unique worldview associated with Japanese tea ceremony, as opposed to focusing just on the ceremonial aspect, a perspective that many practitioners frown upon.",
              "[2][3][4] Zen Buddhism was a primary influence in the development of the culture of Japanese tea.",
              "Much less commonly, Japanese tea practice uses leaf tea, primarily sencha, a practice known as senchado\u0304 (\u714e\u8336\u9053, 'the way of sencha').",
              "Tea gatherings are classified as either an informal tea gathering (chakai (\u8336\u4f1a, 'tea gathering')) or a formal tea gathering (chaji (\u8336\u4e8b, 'tea event')).",
              "A chakai is a relatively simple course of hospitality that includes confections, thin tea, and perhaps a light meal.",
              "A chaji is a much more formal gathering, usually including a full-course kaiseki meal followed by confections, thick tea, and thin tea.",
              "A chaji may last up to four hours.",
              "The first documented evidence of tea in Japan dates to the 9th century.",
              "It is found in an entry in the Nihon Ko\u0304ki having to do with the Buddhist monk Eichu\u0304 (\u6c38\u5fe0), who had brought some tea back to Japan on his return from China.",
              "The entry states that Eichu\u0304 personally prepared and served sencha (tea beverage made by steeping tea leaves in hot water) to Emperor Saga, who was on an excursion in Karasaki (in present Shiga Prefecture) in 815.",
              "By imperial order in 816, tea plantations began to be cultivated in the Kinki region of Japan.",
              "[5] However, the interest in tea in Japan faded after this.",
              "[6] In China, tea had already been known, according to legend, for more than a thousand years.",
              "The form of tea popular in China in Eichu\u0304's time was dancha (\u56e3\u8336, \"cake tea\" or \"brick tea\")[7] \u2013 tea compressed into a nugget in the same manner as pu-er tea.",
              "This then would be ground in a mortar, and the resulting ground tea mixed together with various other herbs and flavourings.",
              "[8] The custom of drinking tea, first for medicinal, and then largely for pleasurable reasons, was already widespread throughout China.",
              "In the early 9th century, Chinese author Lu Yu wrote The Classic of Tea, a treatise on tea focusing on its cultivation and preparation.",
              "Lu Yu's life had been heavily influenced by Buddhism, particularly the Zen\u2013Cha\u0301n Buddhist school.",
              "His ideas would have a strong influence in the development of the Japanese tea.",
              "[9] Around the end of the 12th century, the style of tea preparation called tencha (\u70b9\u8336), in which powdered matcha was placed into a bowl, hot water added, and the tea and hot water whipped together, was introduced to Japan by Buddhist monk Eisai on his return from China.",
              "He also took tea seeds back with him, which eventually produced tea that was considered to be the most superb quality in all of Japan.",
              "[10] This powdered green tea was first used in religious rituals in Buddhist monasteries.",
              "By the 13th century, when the Kamakura shogunate ruled the nation and tea and the luxuries associated with it became a kind of status symbol among the warrior class, there arose to\u0304cha (\u95d8\u8336, \"tea tasting\") parties wherein contestants could win extravagant prizes for guessing the best quality tea \u2013 that was grown in Kyoto, deriving from the seeds that Eisai brought from China.",
              "The next major period in Japanese history was the Muromachi period, pointing to the rise of Kitayama Culture (ja:\u5317\u5c71\u6587\u5316, Kitayama bunka), centered around the cultural world of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and his villa in the northern hills of Kyoto (Kinkaku-ji), and later during this period, the rise of Higashiyama culture, centered around the elegant cultural world of Ashikaga Yoshimasa and his retirement villa in the eastern hills of Kyoto (Ginkaku-ji).",
              "This period, approximately 1336 to 1573, saw the budding of what is generally regarded as Japanese traditional culture as it is known today.",
              "The use of Japanese tea developed as a \"transformative practice\" and began to evolve its own aesthetic, in particular that of wabi-sabi principles.",
              "Wabi represents the inner, or spiritual, experiences of human lives.",
              "Its original meaning indicated quiet or sober refinement, or subdued taste \"characterized by humility, restraint, simplicity, naturalism, profundity, imperfection, and asymmetry\" and \"emphasizes simple, unadorned objects and architectural space, and celebrates the mellow beauty that time and care impart to materials.\"",
              "[11] Sabi, on the other hand, represents the outer, or material side of life.",
              "Originally, it meant \"worn\", \"weathered\", or \"decayed\".",
              "Particularly among the nobility, understanding emptiness was considered the most effective means to spiritual awakening, while embracing imperfection was honoured as a reminder to cherish one's unpolished and unfinished nature \u2013 considered to be the first step to satori, or enlightenment.",
              "[12] Central are the concepts of omotenashi, which revolves around hospitality.",
              "Murata Juko\u0304 is known in chanoyu history as an early developer of tea as a spiritual practice.",
              "He studied Zen under the monk Ikkyu\u0304, who revitalized Zen in the 15th century, and this is considered to have influenced his concept of chanoyu.",
              "[13] By the 16th century, tea drinking had spread to all levels of society in Japan.",
              "Sen no Rikyu\u0304 and his work Southern Record, perhaps the best-known \u2013 and still revered \u2013 historical figure in tea, followed his master Takeno Jo\u0304o\u0304's concept of ichi-go ichi-e, a philosophy that each meeting should be treasured, for it can never be reproduced.",
              "His teachings perfected many newly developed forms in architecture and gardens, art, and the full development of the \"way of tea\".",
              "The principles he set forward \u2013 harmony (\u548c, wa), respect (\u656c, kei), purity (\u6e05, sei), and tranquility (\u5bc2, jaku) \u2013 are still central to tea.",
              "[14] Sen no Rikyu\u0304 was the leading teamaster of the regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who greatly supported him in codifying and spreading the way of tea, also as a means of solidifying his own political power.",
              "Hideyoshi's tastes were influenced by his teamaster, but nevertheless he also had his own ideas to cement his power such as constructing the Golden Tea Room and hosting the Grand Kitano Tea Ceremony in 1587.",
              "The symbiotic relationship between politics and tea was at its height.",
              "However, it was increasingly at odds with the rustic and simple aesthetics continuously advertised by his tea master, which the regent increasingly saw as a threat to cementing his own power and position, and their once close relationship began to suffer.",
              "In 1590, one of the leading disciples of Rikyu, Yamanoue So\u0304ji, was brutally executed on orders of the regent.",
              "One year later the regent ordered his teamaster to commit ritual suicide.",
              "The way of tea was never so closely intertwined with politics before or after.",
              "After the death of Rikyu\u0304, essentially three schools descended from him to continue the tradition.",
              "The way of tea continued to spread throughout the country and later developed not only from the court and samurai class, but also towards the townspeople.",
              "Many schools of Japanese tea ceremony have evolved through the long history of chado\u0304 and are active today.",
              "Japanese tea ceremonies are typically conducted in specially constructed spaces or rooms designed for the purpose of tea ceremony.",
              "While a purpose-built tatami-floored room is considered the ideal venue, any place where the necessary implements for the making and serving of the tea can be set out and where the host can make the tea in the presence of the seated guest(s) can be used as a venue for tea.",
              "For instance, a tea gathering can be held picnic-style in the outdoors, known as nodate (\u91ce\u70b9).",
              "For this occasion a red parasol called nodatekasa (\u91ce\u70b9\u5098) is used.",
              "A purpose-built room designed for the wabi style of tea is called a chashitsu, and is ideally 4.",
              "5-tatami in floor area.",
              "A purpose-built chashitsu typically has a low ceiling, a hearth built into the floor, an alcove for hanging scrolls and placing other decorative objects, and separate entrances for host and guests.",
              "It also has an attached preparation area known as a mizuya.",
              "A 4.",
              "5-mat room is considered standard, but smaller and larger rooms are also used.",
              "Building materials and decorations are deliberately simple and rustic in wabi style tea rooms. Chashitsu can also refer to free-standing buildings for tea.",
              "Known in English as tea houses, such structures may contain several tea rooms of different sizes and styles, dressing and waiting rooms, and other amenities, and be surrounded by a tea garden called a roji.",
              "Seasonality and the changing of the seasons are considered important for enjoyment of tea and tea ceremony.",
              "Traditionally, the year is divided by tea practitioners into two main seasons: the sunken hearth (\u7089, ro) season, constituting the colder months (traditionally November to April), and the brazier (\u98a8\u7089, furo) season, constituting the warmer months (traditionally May to October).",
              "For each season, there are variations in the temae performed and utensils and other equipment used.",
              "Ideally, the configuration of the tatami in a 4.",
              "5 mat room changes with the season as well.",
              "There are two main ways of preparing matcha for tea consumption: thick (\u6fc3\u8336, koicha) and thin (\u8584\u8336, usucha), with the best quality tea leaves used in preparing thick tea.",
              "Historically, the tea leaves used as packing material for the koicha leaves in the tea urn (\u8336\u58fa, chatsubo) would be served as thin tea.",
              "Japanese historical documents about tea that differentiate between usucha and koicha first appear in the Tenmon era (1532\u20131555).",
              "[15] The first documented appearance of the term koicha is in 1575.",
              "[16] As the terms imply, koicha is a thick blend of matcha and hot water that requires about three times as much tea to the equivalent amount of water than usucha.",
              "To prepare usucha, matcha and hot water are whipped using the tea whisk (\u8336\u7b45, chasen), while koicha is kneaded with the whisk to smoothly blend the large amount of powdered tea with the water.",
              "Thin tea is served to each guest in an individual bowl, while one bowl of thick tea is shared among several guests.",
              "This style of sharing a bowl of koicha first appeared in historical documents in 1586, and is a method considered to have been invented by Sen no Rikyu\u0304.",
              "[16] The most important part of a chaji is the preparation and drinking of koicha, which is followed by usucha.",
              "A chakai may involve only the preparation and serving of thin tea (and accompanying confections), representing the more relaxed, finishing portion of a chaji.",
              "The equipment for tea ceremony is called chado\u0304gu (\u8336\u9053\u5177).",
              "A wide range of chado\u0304gu is available and different styles and motifs are used for different events and in different seasons.",
              "All the tools for tea are handled with exquisite care, being scrupulously cleaned before and after each use and before storing, with some handled only with gloved hands.",
              "Some items, such as the tea storage jar which has the name Chigusa, are so revered that, historically, they were given proper names like people, and were admired and documented by multiple diarists.",
              "[17] The honorary title Senke Jusshoku is given to the ten artisans that provide the utensils for the events held by the three primary iemoto Schools of Japanese tea known as the san-senke.",
              "[18] Some of the more essential components of tea ceremony are: Procedures vary from school to school, and with the time of year, time of day, venue, and other considerations.",
              "The noon tea gathering of one host and a maximum of five guests is considered the most formal chaji.",
              "The following is a general description of a noon chaji held in the cool weather season at a purpose-built tea house.",
              "The guests arrive a little before the appointed time and enter an interior waiting room, where they store unneeded items such as coats, and put on fresh tabi socks.",
              "Ideally, the waiting room has a tatami floor and an alcove (tokonoma), in which is displayed a hanging scroll which may allude to the season, the theme of the chaji, or some other appropriate theme.",
              "The guests are served a cup of the hot water, kombu tea, roasted barley tea, or sakurayu.",
              "When all the guests have arrived and finished their preparations, they proceed to the outdoor waiting bench in the roji, where they remain until summoned by the host.",
              "Following a silent bow between host and guests, the guests proceed in order to a tsukubai (stone basin) where they ritually purify themselves by washing their hands and rinsing their mouths with water, and then continue along the roji to the tea house.",
              "They remove their footwear and enter the tea room through a small \"crawling-in\" door (nijiri-guchi), and proceed to view the items placed in the tokonoma and any tea equipment placed ready in the room, and are then seated seiza-style on the tatami in order of prestige.",
              "When the last guest has taken their place, they close the door with an audible sound to alert the host, who enters the tea room and welcomes each guest, and then answers questions posed by the first guest about the scroll and other items. The chaji begins in the cool months with the laying of the charcoal fire which is used to heat the water.",
              "Following this, guests are served a meal in several courses accompanied by sake and followed by a small sweet (wagashi) eaten from special paper called kaishi (\u61d0\u7d19), which each guest carries, often in a decorative wallet or tucked into the breast of the kimono.",
              "[19] After the meal, there is a break called a nakadachi (\u4e2d\u7acb\u3061) during which the guests return to the waiting shelter until summoned again by the host, who uses the break to sweep the tea room, take down the scroll and replace it with a flower arrangement, open the tea room's shutters, and make preparations for serving the tea.",
              "Having been summoned back to the tea room by the sound of a bell or gong rung in prescribed ways, the guests again purify themselves and examine the items placed in the tea room.",
              "The host then enters, ritually cleanses each utensil \u2013 including the tea bowl, whisk, and tea scoop \u2013 in the presence of the guests in a precise order and using prescribed motions, and places them in an exact arrangement according to the particular temae procedure being performed.",
              "When the preparation of the utensils is complete, the host prepares thick tea.",
              "Bows are exchanged between the host and the guest receiving the tea.",
              "The guest then bows to the second guest, and raises the bowl in a gesture of respect to the host.",
              "The guest rotates the bowl to avoid drinking from its front, takes a sip, and compliments the host on the tea.",
              "After taking a few sips, the guest wipes clean the rim of the bowl and passes it to the second guest.",
              "The procedure is repeated until all guests have taken tea from the same bowl;",
              "each guest then has an opportunity to admire the bowl before it is returned to the host, who then cleanses the equipment and leaves the tea room.",
              "The host then rekindles the fire and adds more charcoal.",
              "This signifies a change from the more formal portion of the gathering to the more casual portion, and the host will return to the tea room to bring in a smoking set (\u30bf\u30cf\u3099\u30b3\u76c6, tabako-bon) and more confections, usually higashi, to accompany the thin tea, and possibly cushions for the guests' comfort.",
              "The host will then proceed with the preparation of an individual bowl of thin tea to be served to each guest.",
              "While in earlier portions of the gathering conversation is limited to a few formal comments exchanged between the first guest and the host, in the usucha portion, after a similar ritual exchange, the guests may engage in casual conversation.",
              "After all the guests have taken tea, the host cleans the utensils in preparation for putting them away.",
              "The guest of honour will request that the host allow the guests to examine some of the utensils, and each guest in turn examines each item, including the tea caddy and the tea scoop.",
              "(This examination is done to show respect and admiration for the host.)",
              "[20] The items are treated with extreme care and reverence as they may be priceless, irreplaceable, handmade antiques, and guests often use a special brocaded cloth to handle them.",
              "The host then collects the utensils, and the guests leave the tea house.",
              "The host bows from the door, and the gathering is over.",
              "A tea gathering can last up to four hours, depending on the type of occasion performed, the number of guests, and the types of meal and tea served.",
              "Every action in chado\u0304 \u2013 how a kettle is used, how a teacup is examined, how tea is scooped into a cup \u2013 is performed in a very specific way, and may be thought of as a procedure or technique.",
              "The procedures performed in chado\u0304 are known collectively as temae.",
              "The act of performing these procedures during a chaji is called \"doing temae\".",
              "There are many styles of temae, depending upon the school, occasion, season, setting, equipment, and countless other possible factors.",
              "The following is a short, general list of common types of temae.",
              "Chabako temae (\u8336\u7bb1\u624b\u524d) is so called because the equipment is removed from and then replaced into a special box known as a chabako (\u8336\u7bb1, lit.",
              "'tea box').",
              "Chabako developed as a convenient way to prepare the necessary equipment for making tea outdoors.",
              "The basic equipment contained in the chabako are the tea bowl, tea whisk (kept in a special container), tea scoop and tea caddy, and linen wiping cloth in a special container, as well as a container for little candy-like sweets.",
              "Many of the items are smaller than usual, to fit in the box.",
              "This gathering takes approximately 35\u201340 minutes.",
              "Hakobi temae (\u904b\u3072\u3099\u624b\u524d) is so called because, except for the hot water kettle (and brazier if a sunken hearth is not being used), the essential items for the tea-making, including even the fresh water container, are carried into the tea room by the host as a part of the temae.",
              "In other temae, the water jar and perhaps other items, depending upon the style of temae, are placed in the tea room before the guests enter.",

              "The tea bowl, tea whisk, tea scoop, chakin and tea caddy are placed on a tray, and the hot water is prepared in a kettle called a tetsubin, which is heated on a brazier.",
              "This is usually the first temae learned, and is the easiest to perform, requiring neither much specialized equipment nor a lot of time to complete.",
              "It may easily be done sitting at a table, or outdoors, using a thermos pot in place of the tetsubin and portable hearth.",
              "In the ryu\u0304rei (\u7acb\u793c) style, the tea is prepared with the host seated on a chair at a special table, and the guests also seated on chairs at tables.",

              "Shuffling forces one to slow down, to maintain erect posture, and to walk quietly, and helps one to maintain balance as the combination of tabi and tatami makes for a slippery surface;",

              "One must avoid walking on the joins between mats, one practical reason being that that would tend to damage the tatami.",
              "Therefore, tea students are taught to step over such joins when walking in the tea room.",
              "The placement of tatami in tea rooms differs slightly from the normal placement in regular Japanese-style rooms, and may also vary by season (where it is possible to rearrange the mats).",

              "In summer, the hearth is covered either with a small square of extra tatami, or, more commonly, the hearth tatami is replaced with a full mat, totally hiding the hearth.",
              "It is customary to avoid stepping on this centre mat whenever possible, as well as to avoid placing the hands palm-down on it, as it functions as a kind of table: tea utensils are placed on it for viewing, and prepared bowls of tea are placed on it for serving to the guests.",
              "To avoid stepping on it people may walk around it on the other mats, or shuffle on the hands and knees.",
              "Except when walking, when moving about on the tatami one places one's closed fists on the mats and uses them to pull oneself forward or push backwards while maintaining a seiza position.",

              "They are selected for their appropriateness for the occasion, including the season and the theme of the particular get-together.",
              "Calligraphic scrolls may feature well-known sayings, particularly those associated with Buddhism, poems, descriptions of famous places, or words or phrases associated with tea.",

              "Haga points out that Rikyu\u0304 preferred to hang bokuseki (\"ink traces\"), the calligraphy of Zen Buddhist priests, in the tea room.",
              "[22] A typical example of a hanging scroll in a tea room might have the kanji wa-kei-sei-jaku (\u548c\u656c\u6e05\u5bc2, \"harmony\", \"respect\", \"purity\" and \"tranquility\"), expressing the four key principles of the Way of Tea.",
              "Some contain only a single character;",

              "Hanging scrolls that feature a painting instead of calligraphy, or a combination of both, are also used.",
              "Scrolls are sometimes placed in the waiting room as well.",
              "Chabana (literally \"tea flower\") is the simple style of flower arrangement used in tea rooms. Chabana has its roots in ikebana, an older style of Japanese flower arranging, which itself has roots in Shinto and Buddhism.",
              "It evolved from the \"free-form\" style of ikebana called nageirebana (\u6295\u3051\u3099\u5165\u308c, \"throw-in flowers\"), which was used by early tea masters.",
              "Chabana is said, depending upon the source, to have been either developed or championed by Sen no Rikyu\u0304.",
              "He is said to have taught that chabana should give the viewer the same impression that those flowers naturally would give if they were still growing outdoors, in nature.",
              "Unnatural or out-of-season materials are never used, as well as props and other devices.",
              "The containers in which chabana are arranged are referred to generically as hanaire (\u82b1\u5165\u308c).",
              "Chabana arrangements typically comprise few items, and little or no filler material.",
              "In the summer, when many flowering grasses are in season in Japan, however, it is seasonally appropriate to arrange a number of such flowering grasses in an airy basket-type container.",
              "Unlike ikebana (which often uses shallow, wide dishes), tall, narrow hanaire are frequently used in chabana.",
              "The containers for the flowers used in tea rooms are typically made from natural materials such as bamboo, as well as metal or ceramic, but rarely glass as ikebana (another flower arrangement) uses short, glass vases.",
              "Chabana arrangements are so simple that frequently no more than a single blossom is used;",
              "this blossom will invariably lean towards or face the guests.",
              "[23] Kaiseki (\u61d0\u77f3) or cha-kaiseki (\u8336\u61d0\u77f3) is a meal served in the context of a formal tea function.",
              "In cha-kaiseki, only fresh seasonal ingredients are used, prepared in ways that aim to enhance their flavour.",
              "Great care is taken in selecting ingredients and types of food, and the finished dishes are carefully presented on serving ware that is chosen to enhance the appearance and seasonal theme of the meal.",
              "Dishes are intricately arranged and garnished, often with real edible leaves and flowers that are to help enhance the flavour of the food.",
              "Serving ware and garnishes are as much a part of the kaiseki experience as the food;",
              "some might argue that the aesthetic experience of seeing the food is even more important than the physical experience of eating it.",
              "Courses are served in small servings in individual dishes.",
              "Each diner has a small lacquered tray to themselves;",
              "very important people may be provided their own low, lacquered table or several small tables.",
              "Because cha-kaiseki generally follows traditional eating habits in Japan, meat dishes are rare.",
              "Many of the movements and components of tea ceremonies evolved from the wearing of kimono.",
              "For example, certain movements are designed to keep dangling sleeves out of the way or prevent them from becoming dirty.",
              "Other motions allow for the straightening of the kimono and the hakama.",
              "Some aspects of tea ceremony \u2013 such as the use of silk fukusa cloths \u2013 cannot be performed without wearing a kimono and obi, or a belt substitute, as the cloth is folded and tucked into the obi within the ceremony.",
              "Other items, such as kaishi, smaller cloths known as kobukusa (\u5c0f\u88b1\u7d17), and fans, require kimono collars, sleeves and the obi worn with them in order to be used throughout the ceremony;",
              "otherwise, a substitute for storing these items on the person must be found.",
              "For this reason, most tea ceremonies are conducted in kimono, and though students may practice wearing Western clothes, students of tea ceremony will need to wear kimono at some point.",
              "On formal occasions, the host of the tea ceremony will always wear kimono, and for guests, formal kimono or Western formal wear must be worn.",
              "No matter the style of clothing, the attire worn at a tea gathering is usually subdued and conservative, so as not to be distracting.",
              "For women, the type of kimono worn is usually an iromuji \u2013 a solid-colour, unpatterned kimono, worn with a nagoya obi in an appropriate tanmono fabric;",
              "slub-weave silks, shibori patterns and generally bright-coloured obi are not worn.",
              "Edo komon kimono may also be worn, as their patterns are small enough as to be unobtrusive.",
              "Men may wear kimono only, or (for more formal occasions) a combination of kimono and hakama (a long, divided or undivided skirt worn over the kimono).",
              "Those who have earned the right may wear a kimono with a jittoku (\u5341\u5fb3) or juttoku jacket instead of hakama.",
              "Women wear various styles of kimono depending on the season and the event;",
              "women generally do not wear hakama for tea occasions, and do not gain the right to wear a jittoku.",
              "Lined kimono are worn by both men and women in the winter months, and unlined kimono are worn in the summer.",
              "For formal occasions, montsuki kimono (\u7d0b\u4ed8\u7740\u7269) (kimono with three to five family crests on the sleeves and back) are worn.",
              "Both men and women wear white tabi (divided-toe socks).",
              "In Japan, those who wish to study tea ceremony typically join a \"circle\", a generic term for a group that meets regularly to participate in a given activity.",
              "There are also tea clubs at many junior and high schools, colleges and universities.",
              "Classes may be held at community centres, dedicated tea schools, or at private homes.",
              "Tea schools often teach a wide variety of pupils who may study at different times;",
              "for example, the school may have a group for women, a group for older students, and a group for younger students.",
              "Students normally pay a monthly fee which covers tuition and the use of the school's (or teacher's) bowls and other equipment, the tea itself, and the sweets that students serve and eat at every class.",
              "Students must be equipped with their own fukusa, fan, kaishi paper, and kobukusa, as well as their own wallet in which to place these items. Though some groups and practitioners of tea ceremony may wear Western clothing, for most occasions of tea ceremony \u2013 particularly if the teacher is highly ranked within the tradition \u2013 wearing kimono is mostly considered essential, in particular for women.",
              "In some cases, advanced students may be given permission to wear the school's mark in place of the usual family crests on formal kimono.",
              "This permission usually accompanies the granting of a chamei, or \"tea name\", to the student.",
              "New students typically begin by observing more advanced students as they practice.",
              "New students may be taught mostly by more advanced students;",
              "the most advanced students are taught exclusively by the teacher.",
              "The first things new students learn are how to correctly open and close sliding doors, how to walk on tatami, how to enter and exit the tea room, how to bow and to whom and when to do so, how to wash, store and care for the various equipment, how to fold the fukusa, how to ritually clean tea equipment, and how to wash and fold chakin.",
              "As they master these essential steps, students are also taught how to behave as a guest at tea ceremonies: the correct words to say, how to handle bowls, how to drink tea and eat sweets, how to use paper and sweet-picks, and myriad other details.",
              "As they master the basics, students will be instructed on how to prepare the powdered tea for use, how to fill the tea caddy, and finally, how to measure the tea and water and whisk it to the proper consistency.",
              "Once these basic steps have been mastered, students begin to practice the simplest temae, typically beginning with O-bon temae.",
              "Only when the first offering has been mastered will students move on.",
              "Study is through observation and hands on practice;",
              "students do not often take notes, and many teachers discourage the practice of note-taking.",
              "As they master each offering, some schools and teachers present students with certificates at a formal ceremony.",
              "According to the school, this certificate may warrant that the student has mastered a given temae, or may give the student permission to begin studying a given temae.",
              "Acquiring such certificates is often very costly;",
              "the student typically must not only pay for the preparation of the certificate itself and for participating in the gathering during which it is bestowed, but is also expected to thank the teacher by presenting him or her with a gift of money.",
              "The cost of acquiring certificates increases as the student's level increases.",
              "Typically, each class ends with the whole group being given brief instruction by the main teacher, usually concerning the contents of the tokonoma (the scroll alcove, which typically features a hanging scroll (usually with calligraphy), a flower arrangement, and occasionally other objects as well) and the sweets that have been served that day.",
              "Related topics include incense and kimono, or comments on seasonal variations in equipment or offerings.",

              "This offering, more Chinese in style, was introduced to Japan in the 17th century by Ingen, the founder of the O\u0304baku school of Zen Buddhism, also more Chinese in style than earlier schools.",
              "In the 18th century, it was popularized by the O\u0304baku monk Baisao, who sold tea in Kyoto, and later came to be regarded as the first sencha master.",

              "The first record found in historical text tells of how a Buddhist monk named Eichu, served tea to the ruler of Japan, Emperor Saga.",
              "This fateful meeting occurred on Emperor Saga\u2019s visit to the village of Karasaki, in the year 815 CE.",
              "The ceremony progressed during the 12th-century CE when a monk by the name of Eisai, has been thought to be the one who introduced a specific way of how to prepare tea and the usage of a powdered green tea we know today as Matcha.",
              "When he returned to Japan from a trip to China, he brought with him the technique of preparing Matcha.",
              "He started by placing the matcha in a bowl, then adding hot water, with the last step being to mix the two ingredients together.",
              "This process soon became common practice among the Buddhist monks of the area.",
              "As Japan came into the 13th-century CE, a feudal military government was in place.",
              "Tea and tea drinking went on to become a symbol of status for the high ranking military officials and warriors.",
              "So much so, that tea drinking competitions would be held and the contestants had to guess the best-quality teas to win a prize.",
              "Stepping into the 16th-century CE, tea drinking had become a popular pastime for the Japanese people.",
              "During this period, Sen no Rikyu was the Japanese expert on tea and he set the precedent of what we know today as the Way of Tea.",
              "Rikyu wrote a book titled, Southern Record, in which he explains his knowledge of tea, and promoted the idea that a meeting should always be treasured because it is a unique occasion, one that can never be reproduced.",
              "This book is where he also tells of the four principles taught to him by his master Takeno Joo, harmony, respect, purity, and tranquility.",
              "Rikyu also started three schools of tea preparation based off of his teachings and to continue the tradition of drinking tea.",
              "These schools are the Urasenke school, the Omotesenke school, and the Mushakojisenke School, all three are still in operation today.",
              "Before the ceremony can begin a formal invitation must be sent to the guests.",

              "A traditional tea ceremony location is surrounded by a garden.",
              "The garden is expected to be calm and relaxing to help maintain a calm spirit.",

              "Stones of all shapes and sizes will be used to make the path leading up to the teahouse.",
              "At the entrance you will find a stone lantern placed next to a stone basin where visitors must wash their hands before entering.",
              "Any utensils need to be selected beforehand as does the menu that will be served.",
              "Depending on the school some aspects of the ceremony may change such as the time, location, and season.",
              "The biggest difference is between the summer and winter ceremonies, largely the location of the kettle used to heat the water for the ceremony.",
              "In regards to dress code, avoid gaudy, bright clothing, jewelry that may damage the tea ceremony items, and strong perfume or cologne.",
              "If any of this is worn it can detract from the ceremony.",
              "The ceremony traditionally takes place in a Tatami room, with the entrance sometimes being so low that entering guests have to bend over, representing humility.",
              "After bowing the guest of honor takes their seat nearest to the alcove, the other guests then follow.",
              "Once all of the guests have been seated it is tradition to bow once more before taking in the decorations that have been carefully curated for the ceremony.",

              "Each piece is chosen for a specific reason and it also has a specific placement during the ceremony.",
              "Before the tea can be served or consumed a japanese sweet is supposed to be eaten.",
              "Then the tea bowl is placed on the tatami mat in front of the guest, with the front facing them.",
              "The guest then has to pick the tea up with their right hand and place it in their left palm.",
              "With their right hand, they then turn it clockwise by 90 degrees so that the front of their hand is not facing them.",
              "The guest is then expected to drink the tea in a few sips and place it back on the tatami, following this they bow their head to show thanks for receiving and finishing their tea.",
              "At the end of the ceremony the guests are then given time to inspect and appreciate the fine details of their tea bowl.",
              "Once they are done they must turn the bowl so that the front of the bowl faces the host.",
              "On some occasions the host may ask their guests if they would like another cup of tea, if not the ceremony is now over.",

              "The most famous exponent of the tea ceremony was Sen Rikyu\u0304, an aesthete at the 16th-century court of the military dictator Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who codified the ceremony into a style known as wabi-cha (meaning roughly \u201csimplicity,\u201d \u201cquietude,\u201d and \u201cabsence of ornament\u201d), which still enjoys popularity in Japan.",

              "However, doorways that can be considered prototypes of nijiriguchi appear on old drawings of the time of Joo TAKENO, and many similar designs such as a tiny door built in a large door in merchant houses existed previously, so it was not Rikyu's invention.",

              "Compared with this, Oribe FURUTA, Enshu KOBORI, Urakusai ODA, and Sowa KANAMORI, who were feudal lords and tea masters, created samurai class shoin-style Chashitsu, or comfortable Chashitsu with a small room as large as three mats.",
              "Each generation of the SEN family has preferred a new type of Chashitsu, but not to the extent of Wabi that Sotan sought.",

              "Following kaiseki (a light meal), the guests retire to the garden for a short break before returning to the Chashitsu to drink koicha (a strong green tea) and then usucha (a weak green tea), with each guest taking a drink from the bowl before it is passed on to the next guest;",
              "the guests then leave, quietly acknowledging each other one last time.",
              "Because guests have to lower their heads to go through the nijiriguchi, a kijinguchi (an ordinary walk-in paper sliding door) is often built in addition to the nijiriguchi to welcome high ranking people.",

              "As soon as the guests are seated in the seiza kneeling position, the tea master begins the ceremony by cleaning the utensils meticulously and in a precise order.",
              "The tea is prepared in a kettle over a charcoal fire with similar attention to detail, and the final brew is poured into a bowl that is handed to the first, most important guest.",
              "The recipient is expected to raise the bowl in a mark of respect to the tea master, rotate it slightly to avoid drinking from the front, take a sip and then compliment the master on the taste and the bowl in which it's served.",
              "The bowl is then passed to the next guest, who repeats the procedure until each guest has sampled the tea.",
              "The tea master will wear traditional dress to perform the ceremony Etiquette is a significant part of the entire experience, and the tea master will invariably wear a kimono for the ceremony.",
              "Guests attending formal occasions should follow suit, although rituals put on to demonstrate the procedures to visitors do not require formal attire.",
              "Anyone who has the opportunity to experience a tea ceremony should, however, endeavor to follow the appropriate moves, although minor faux pas are always overlooked.",

              "The emperors and religious rulers of the past had lost much of their power as the new feudal era began.",
              "These wealthy aristocrats of the prior age were replaced by Shoguns and Samurai who took control over small regions of land throughout Japan.",
              "During this time, there were also many advancements in Japan, particularly in the fields of Agriculture and trade.",
              "At the start of this era, Japan only had about 7 million people, but by the year 1600, their population had grown to approximately 25 million.",
              "All of this had a distinct impact upon the development of Japanese culture.",
              "Despite there being many negative aspects to feudal Japan, such as it\u2019s profession-based caste system and it\u2019s immense number of civil wars, the development of Japanese art and culture flourished during this time.",
              "Many of the practices which developed during this time are still practiced today, such as the Three Classical Japanese Arts of Refinement which include ko\u0304do\u0304 (The Way of Incense), kado\u0304 (Artistic Floral Arrangements) and chado\u0304 (The Famous Tea Ceremony).",
              "Together these arts serve as a key remembrance of Japan\u2019s old culture and way of life.",
              "Table of Contents In essence, Ko\u0304do\u0304 is the Japanese art of appreciating incense.",
              "It involves Monko\u0304, or \u2018listening\u2019 to the incense.",
              "The fragrance of the incense was used not only for simple pleasure, but to tell stories, or even play games.",
              "Incense sticks were not very common in feudal Japan.",
              "The traditional way to practice Ko\u0304do\u0304 is to burn pieces of fragrant wood or other materials in small censers.",
              "The censers were then passed around and the fragrance was inhaled.",
              "One of the most revered materials to burn was resinous agarwood, which was typically harvested in Vietnam, Indonesia, and other surrounding areas.",
              "Out of all the materials burned in feudal Japan, agarwood is probably the most fabled.",
              "It\u2019s bitter and musky aroma is often considered something of lore now that quality wild agarwood has become incredibly rare and relatively unaffordable.",
              "Although agarwood comes from the \u2018aquilaria\u2019 tree species, it\u2019s important to note that the ordinary wood does not normally contain the treasured resin or fragrance.",
              "The aromatic resin develops over a period of many years after the wood has been infected with a certain bacteria.",
              "The bacterial infection initiates a self-defense mechanism within the tree, causing it to exude a dark resin in an effort to protect itself.",
              "The resinous material used to be more widely available, but the material has been over-harvested due to its value, and since it takes so long for the resin to be produced in nature, the price has skyrocketed, while the quality of available material has diminished.",
              "This has caused speculators to invest considerable amounts of money into agarwood, hoping that it\u2019s value may increase over the years as it becomes increasingly rare.",
              "Although there have been significant efforts and attempts to cultivate agarwood on plantations, the quality typically isn\u2019t comparable to wild material.",

              "The Ten Virtues of Koh give us a glimpse into the sophistication of feudal Japan and shows us that the time period wasn\u2019t all bloodshed and tears.",

              "This custom developed in China during the 7th century and was borrowed alongside many other traditions, including Buddhism.",
              "Simply put, Kado\u0304 is the art floral arrangement.",
              "It was not done simply because of it\u2019s beauty, but because it was considered an introspective practice which could help teach one about oneself.",
              "This practice was not forgotten and is still widely practiced today.",
              "There are still many, many schools in Japan which you can take Kado\u0304 courses at.",
