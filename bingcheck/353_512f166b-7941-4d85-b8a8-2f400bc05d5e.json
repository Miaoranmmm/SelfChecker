    "query": "What is the most effective way to combat misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines, and how can individuals promote accurate information to encourage more people to get vaccinated?",
    "response": "That's a very important and timely question. Misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines can have serious consequences for public health and trust in science. According to some researchers[^1^], misinformation is tough to fight because it spreads for various reasons, such as emotional appeal, confirmation bias, social influence and cognitive shortcuts. However, there are some strategies that can help combat misinformation and promote accurate information.\n\nOne strategy is to **expose the rhetorical devices and fallacies** that are often used by conspiracy theorists, such as circular reasoning, cherry-picking evidence, shifting the burden of proof, appealing to authority or emotion, and creating false dilemmas[^2^]. By pointing out these flaws in logic, you can help people see the holes in their arguments and question their sources.\n\nAnother strategy is to **provide factual corrections** that are clear, concise, consistent and credible[^3^]. You can use reliable sources of information, such as scientific journals, official websites, or reputable news outlets, to counter the false claims and provide evidence for the benefits and safety of vaccines. You can also use visual aids, such as graphs or charts, to illustrate your points.\n\nA third strategy is to **appeal to people's values and goals**[^1^]. You can try to understand why people believe in misinformation and what motivates them. You can then frame your message in a way that aligns with their values and goals, such as protecting their health, their family, or their community. You can also acknowledge their emotions and concerns, and show empathy and respect.\n\nA fourth strategy is to **encourage critical thinking**[^1^]. You can ask people to reflect on how they evaluate information and sources, and whether they are open to alternative perspectives. You can also challenge them to think about the consequences of their beliefs and actions, and how they affect themselves and others. You can also suggest ways for them to verify information and seek more knowledge.\n\nA fifth strategy is to **lead by example**[^1^]. You can show people that you are willing to get vaccinated yourself, and share your positive experiences and outcomes. You can also share stories of other people who have been vaccinated and how it has improved their lives. You can also express your trust in science and experts, and explain how vaccines work and why they are important.\n\nThese are some of the ways that you can combat misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines, and promote accurate information to encourage more people to get vaccinated. I hope this helps you in your conversations with others. \ud83d\ude0a",

              "This supports the literature suggesting that social media \u201cpromote\u201d conspiracy theories and, thus, influence individuals\u2019 willingness to get vaccinated [54,57,58].",
              "Moreover, our study underlines the role of trust in science in vaccination decisiveness.",
              "The current results show that vaccinated individuals have higher trust in science than non-vaccinated individuals, which supports previous research findings [42,50,51,52,53,54,64].",
              "Additionally, we also found that high trust in science is associated with a lower level of conspiracy theory belief [54,55,56].",
              "It is clear that trusting science and scientists is vital for successfully overcoming critical periods.",
              "Not only because recommendations on how to combat the pandemic usually come from scientists, but also because trust in science can act as a protective factor against conspiracy theories.",
              "Lastly, this study shows that age influences vaccination decisiveness.",
              "We found that the number of non-vaccinated young adults was greater than that of vaccinated young adults.",
              "These results were reversed for early\u2013middle-aged adults, whereby vaccinated individuals were higher in numbers than non-vaccinated.",
              "For the current participants, we did not find any significant differences in gender and educational levels.",
              "This does not support the literature that suggests that gender and education are important for vaccination intention [64,70,71,72].",
              "The current study has several practical implications.",
              "First and foremost, it is clear from the current results that conspiracy theory beliefs predict vaccine decisiveness.",
              "This clearly supports the importance of finding ways to combat the increased misinformation/conspiracy theories available, especially during crises.",
              "From the early stages of the pandemic, the WHO established the Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) [76].",
              "EPI-WIN aims to give everyone access to accurate, timely, and easy-to-understand updated information about the development of the pandemic.",
              "The website provides information that comes from \u201ctrusted\u201d sources with the goal of debunking myths and misinformation about the pandemic [76].",
              "Additionally, the WHO and the CDC strive to help the public distinguish between valid information and conspiracy theories regarding the vaccine (see for example, vaccine safety by the WHO [77], and myths and facts about COVID-19 vaccines by CDC [34]).",
              "Despite these efforts by health agencies, the challenge remains.",
              "More campaigns are needed that will make people aware of the positive impacts of vaccinations and, at the same time, tackle conspiracy theories.",
              "These campaigns can also be utilized to increase the public\u2019s perceived risk of the pandemic.",
              "Our results suggest that raising awareness of the disease\u2019s dangerousness might improve vaccination uptake.",
              "Finding ways to build or restore the population\u2019s trust in science during health crises is equally important.",
              "Education that improves information literacy and knowledge of scientific facts versus conspiracy theories will help in improving trust in science and scientists.",
              "Lastly, since social media is a common way to gather information about the pandemic, interventions aimed specifically at people that use social media should be implemented.",
              "This can involve campaigns that increase people\u2019s awareness of the misinformation and conspiracy theories available on social media and highlight the vaccine\u2019s usefulness.",
              "The major social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, updated their policies in an attempt to increase awareness and reduce the misinformation available on their platforms [78,79,80].",
              "These policies are continuously updated to combat new misinformation that appears as the pandemic progresses.",
              "Whether this technique works is still open for discussion, as research findings suggest that misinformation is still readily available to the public [81,82,83,84].",
              "Similar strategies, such as fake news regulations, were also employed by governments around the world [85].",
              "It is imperative to continue these efforts.",
              "Though the current study provides useful information, it is not without its limitations.",
              "The generalizability of the findings is impeded due to the small sample size and the convenience sampling method implemented.",
              "Similarly, most of the participants were highly educated (tertiary education) and female, possibly introducing an overrepresentation of this population in the sample and thus resulting in bias.",
              "In addition, there was a disproportionate number of vaccinated (66.",
              "9%) versus non-vaccinated (33.",
              "1%) participants who might have affected our findings.",
              "Furthermore, other factors that may contribute to vaccine decisiveness were not explored in the current study.",
              "For instance, a recent study explored the role of religiosity on COVID-19 vaccination decisiveness in 90 countries [86].",
              "They examined four religions and non-believers and found that religiosity and vaccination decisiveness was only linked with Christianity, with Christians being less likely to get vaccinated.",
              "Cyprus is a highly religious country, with more than 70% of the population being Christians [87];",
              "however, the impact of religiosity on vaccine decisiveness was not explored in the current study.",
              "Future research could explore this for a better understanding of the interaction.",
              "Similarly, the current research did not explore sociodemographic and psychological determinants which also influence vaccine decisiveness.",
              "A study with a large sample of participants, which was conducted a few months after our data collection (November 2021 and January 2022), showed the interplay of sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychological factors influencing vaccine hesitancy in the general population and healthcare professionals in Cyprus [88] (see also [89]).",
              "The determinants found to influence higher vaccination rates in the general population included age (with older individuals being more likely to be vaccinated), higher trust in national healthcare authorities\u2019 guidelines, and increased vaccination knowledge scores.",
              "Future research should consider the current findings in light of these variables for a more thorough understanding of the interplay of reasons that influence vaccine decisiveness.",
              "Other limitations to our study include the collection of data at a single point in time while the pandemic continues to evolve, not tracking the response rate to determine the number of participants clicking the link to take part in the study, and the use of self-report measures, which should be considered with discretion.",
              "The current study contributes to a better understanding of the factors that influence COVID-19 vaccination decisiveness.",
              "Our results suggest that conspiracy theory belief is the critical factor that predicts vaccination decisiveness.",
              "Individuals who have high believability in conspiracy theories are more likely to be non-vaccinated.",
              "In addition, vaccinated individuals are more likely to believe that COVID-19 is a dangerous disease, indicating that the high perceived danger of COVID-19 positively affects vaccination uptake.",
              "Trust in science might increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines;",

              "however, they came to the fore during the first half of 2020 as many governments sought to harness technologies developed by the private sector, especially mobile phone data, to tackle the spread of COVID-19.",

              "for instance, in the scare around the diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccine during the late 1970s and early 1980s, which was fueled by mainstream newspaper and television coverage15.",
              "Moreover, although the information ecosystem is undoubtedly an important influence on vaccine decision-making, as our recent research on the impact of misinformation exposure demonstrates, focusing only on the information ecosystem can obscure the wider sociocultural, historic, institutional and political context.",
              "In many countries, a lack of trust in key institutions involved in the production, supply and distribution of vaccines is a crucial part of that context.",
              "Several studies have found evidence of a link between vaccine hesitancy and \u2018populist\u2019 distrust of political elites and medical experts.",
              "For example, a 2019 study of European Union member states found a marked positive association between electoral support for populist parties and low confidence in vaccine importance and effectiveness16.",

              "Trust can be conceptualized as \u201ca relationship that exists between individuals, as well as between individuals and a system, in which one party accepts a vulnerable position, assuming the best interests and competence of the other, in exchange for a reduction in decision complexity\u201d20.",
              "Trust becomes important whenever there is \u201can implicit imbalance of power due to a high level of information asymmetry, where trusting individuals accept a vulnerable position in relation to a trusted party\u201d20.",

              "There needs to be trust in the product (the vaccine itself), in the provider (those administering immunizations such as healthcare professionals) and in the policy-maker (health systems, government officials, public health researchers and others).",

              "Trust is often linked to past experiences, which is one reason why marginalized groups, such as religious and ethnic minorities, have been found to be less trusting of vaccines in general and less likely to vaccinate22.",
              "For example, vaccine hesitancy among Black communities today reflects historical distrust of public authorities and healthcare providers, among other factors23.",
              "This distrust is related to a long history of structural racism and medical abuses against Black populations, often compounded by negative personal experiences with healthcare systems and providers.",
              "Genuine concerns such as these are often susceptible to exploitation, for instance in the United States where figures connected with the Black Nationalist Nation of Islam have actively been promoting vaccine misinformation to African American audiences through a network of social media accounts7.",
              "While much has been said about vaccine hesitancy among minority groups, the institutional failures that have led to these attitudes often receive less attention.",
              "For example, conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines have found fertile ground in Nigeria, partly due to collective memories of a controversial 1996 drug trial conducted during a meningitis outbreak, in which 11 children died and many more developed life-changing disabilities24.",
              "Pfizer, the company responsible for the trial, insisted that it obtained approval from the authorities and verbal consent from participants before the study, and claimed that the symptoms and deaths were due to meningitis, not the drug itself.",
              "Following legal action by the Nigerian authorities, Pfizer reached an out-of-court settlement in 2009, without admitting liability.",
              "However, a widespread perception that the company had behaved unethically likely contributed to susceptibility to believing the vaccine rumors that led to a 2003 boycott of a polio vaccination campaign in three northern Nigerian states25.",
              "Given the historical context, it is perhaps unsurprising that 55% of Nigerians believe it is \u2018definitely\u2019 or \u2018probably\u2019 true that harmful side effects from vaccines are deliberately being concealed from the public, according to a YouGov poll conducted in mid-2020 (ref.",
              "26).",
              "In a context of widespread social uncertainty, sentiment can often be volatile27.",
              "While the broad picture is that vaccine willingness has been on the increase since late 2020, around the time Pfizer announced it had a highly effective COVID-19 vaccine, the global trend masks considerable geographical and temporal variation.",
              "In some countries, sentiments fell sharply in spring 2021 in the context of safety concerns around the AstraZeneca vaccine28.",
              "An extreme example is Thailand, where YouGov polling found that COVID-19 vaccine willingness declined from 83% at the start of 2021, to 60% in mid-March when a number of countries temporarily suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, before climbing to 95% by the end of that year29.",
              "\u2018Emotional epidemiology\u2019, a term coined by Danielle Ofri in the context of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, describes these sharp fluctuations of sentiment that often attend the discovery of new illnesses30.",
              "The term encapsulates how health decisions are not only determined through rational thinking, but are equally impacted by a variety of feelings31.",
              "Fears and anxieties related to COVID-19 are known to have impacted the pandemic response on a global scale, fueling vaccine hesitancy in different parts of the world32.",
              "Similarly during the outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa, fears and anxieties had negative effects on preventive behaviors such as isolation and also increased stigmatization of those who were sick33.",
              "Conversely, positive emotions, such as hope for a return to normality, may motivate people to comply with public health measures34,35.",
              "Altruism can drive individuals to participate in risky clinical trials, with highly uncertain outcomes, to help their communities36.",
              "Like misinformation, emotions are entangled with broader political and societal issues.",
              "Emotions can also be experienced collectively, driving larger group trust levels and action.",
              "These large-scale affective processes cannot be fully grasped in individual analyses35.",
              "Past collective experiences can drive groups to internalize shared emotions that might influence acceptance or rejection of health interventions or guidelines37.",
              "Given the scale at which COVID-19 is affecting the world, and the extent to which digital media have accelerated both informational and emotional flows since Ofri was writing in 2009, the emotional drivers of trust and confidence in different health interventions are becoming an increasingly important area of research36.",
              "Recognizing vaccine hesitancy as being primarily a trust issue rather than an informational problem, and one that has emotional as well as rational determinants, has several implications for health policy and communication.",
              "In the first place, politicians and medical experts need to be mindful of the distinction between vaccine hesitancy and being anti-vaccine27.",
              "Especially in a context of uncertainty, when sentiments are volatile, vaccine hesitancy is better conceived of as a decision-making process rather than a fixed set of beliefs, attitudes and behaviors38.",
              "Moreover, being indecisive in a situation of uncertainty is not the same thing as being \u2018anti-vaccination\u201927.",
              "As described above, hesitancy can have various causes, ranging from historic community experiences to safety concerns around COVID-19 vaccines.",
              "Hesitant individuals are often consumers of anti-vaccination content, but this does not mean that they are ideologically opposed to vaccination.",
              "Communication about vaccines should start from a position of empathy and aim to rebuild trust.",
              "This requires working through trusted messengers and established relationships.",
              "For instance, training community health workers from the local communities was an important part of the Ebola response.",
              "Such initiatives are arguably even more important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic when national political leadership has often been found wanting.",
              "One recent and particularly bold initiative is the New Zealand government\u2019s collaboration with gang leaders to promote COVID-19 vaccines to hard-to-reach communities, in an effort to overcome ethnic disparities in uptake39.",
              "Conversely, politicians and public health authorities should carefully weigh the risks when considering measures that could potentially be perceived as coercive or stigmatizing by hesitant communities and individuals.",
              "For example, recent research by the Vaccine Confidence Project on public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine passports in the United Kingdom found that, although in overall terms vaccine passports had a positive effect on vaccine intent, the effect was polarizing.",
              "Passports made those who already intended to get vaccinated even more positive toward it, but had the opposite effect on those who had concerns about the vaccine40.",
              "Notably, it was among groups with lower uptake, including Black communities, that the effects of domestic vaccine passports were most negative.",
              "This is likely linked to longstanding suspicions of medical interventions, derived from historical experience, as described above.",
              "Although the emphasis should be on building trust, measures to tackle misinformation still have an important part to play.",
              "There has been a recent and welcome shift in emphasis from reactive measures such as content removal and fact-checking by social media companies, to more proactive ones that seek to build resilience against potentially harmful ideas before people are exposed to them.",
              "This is backed up by research showing that it is possible to confer psychological resistance to misinformation through a combination of forewarning and pre-emptive refutation (\u2018pre-bunking\u2019)41.",

              "It is important to recognize that some of the factors fueling vaccine hesitancy, such as anxieties around the pace of technological change or feelings of political disempowerment, are not within the control of the medical community.",
              "As the example of health and media literacy initiatives in schools suggests, addressing such issues will require a long-term effort on the part of multiple stakeholders working across several sectors of society43.",
              "Like the virus that gave rise to them, it seems probable that myths and conspiracy theories around COVID-19 and vaccines will be things that we all need to learn to live with and manage for some time to come.",
              "In this new landscape, the best measure of progress toward building vaccine confidence for the longer term is perhaps not the number of doses administered so far, but public trust in the institutions responsible for delivering them.",

              "Second, the misinformation should be repeated to demonstrate how it is incorrect and to make the correction salient.",
              "However, the misinformation should be prefaced with a warning99,148 and repeated only once in order not to boost its familiarity unnecessarily104.",

              "The brain can deal with only a finite amount of information, and too many incoming stimuli can cause information overload.",

              "These methods are usually effective, but may also become biases when applied in the wrong contexts.",
              "One cognitive shortcut happens when a person is deciding whether to share a story that appears on their social media feed.",
              "People are very affected by the emotional connotations of a headline, even though that\u2019s not a good indicator of an article\u2019s accuracy.",
              "Much more important is who wrote the piece.",
              "To counter this bias, and help people pay more attention to the source of a claim before sharing it, we developed Fakey, a mobile news literacy game (free on Android and iOS) simulating a typical social media news feed, with a mix of news articles from mainstream and low-credibility sources.",
              "Players get more points for sharing news from reliable sources and flagging suspicious content for fact-checking.",
              "In the process, they learn to recognize signals of source credibility, such as hyperpartisan claims and emotionally charged headlines.",
              "Another source of bias comes from society.",
              "When people connect directly with their peers, the social biases that guide their selection of friends come to influence the information they see.",
              "In fact, in our research we have found that it is possible to determine the political leanings of a Twitter user by simply looking at the partisan preferences of their friends.",
              "Our analysis of the structure of these partisan communication networks found social networks are particularly efficient at disseminating information \u2013 accurate or not \u2013 when they are closely tied together and disconnected from other parts of society.",
              "The tendency to evaluate information more favorably if it comes from within their own social circles creates \u201cecho chambers\u201d that are ripe for manipulation, either consciously or unintentionally.",
              "This helps explain why so many online conversations devolve into \u201cus versus them\u201d confrontations.",
              "To study how the structure of online social networks makes users vulnerable to disinformation, we built Hoaxy, a system that tracks and visualizes the spread of content from low-credibility sources, and how it competes with fact-checking content.",

              "S.",
              "presidential elections shows that Twitter accounts that shared misinformation were almost completely cut offfrom the corrections made by the fact-checkers.",
              "When we drilled down on the misinformation-spreading accounts, we found a very dense core group of accounts retweeting each other almost exclusively \u2013 including several bots.",
              "The only times that fact-checking organizations were ever quoted or mentioned by the users in the misinformed group were when questioning their legitimacy or claiming the opposite of what they wrote.",
              "The third group of biases arises directly from the algorithms used to determine what people see online.",
              "Both social media platforms and search engines employ them.",
              "These personalization technologies are designed to select only the most engaging and relevant content for each individual user.",
              "But in doing so, it may end up reinforcing the cognitive and social biases of users, thus making them even more vulnerable to manipulation.",
              "For instance, the detailed advertising tools built into many social media platforms let disinformation campaigners exploit confirmation bias by tailoring messages to people who are already inclined to believe them.",
              "Also, if a user often clicks on Facebook links from a particular news source, Facebook will tend to show that person more of that site\u2019s content.",
              "This so-called \u201cfilter bubble\u201d effect may isolate people from diverse perspectives, strengthening confirmation bias.",
              "Our own research shows that social media platforms expose users to a less diverse set of sources than do non-social media sites like Wikipedia.",
              "Because this is at the level of a whole platform, not of a single user, we call this the homogeneity bias.",
              "Another important ingredient of social media is information that is trending on the platform, according to what is getting the most clicks.",
              "We call this popularity bias, because we have found that an algorithm designed to promote popular content may negatively affect the overall quality of information on the platform.",
              "This also feeds into existing cognitive bias, reinforcing what appears to be popular irrespective of its quality.",
              "All these algorithmic biases can be manipulated by social bots, computer programs that interact with humans through social media accounts.",
              "Most social bots, like Twitter\u2019s Big Ben, are harmless.",

              "In recent years, \u201cfake news\u201d has been a dominant theme in our society, and indeed we can observe a constant flow of misinformation being disseminated through different forms of media.",
              "In the last decade, research conducted in our lab has estimated the impact of misinformation presented in the news as well as the best ways to fight this type of misinformation.",

              "One current project involves developing methods to have communities correct misinformation, whereas another seeks to understand how conspiracy beliefs are created.",
              "In a meta-analysis of all the available data on the impact of misinformation in news programs, as well as the efforts to correct it, we found that misinformation works much more easily than the efforts to undo it.",

              "6% of the time \u2014 whereas attempts to correct it succeed only in only 83% of cases.",
              "That leaves roughly 17% of the population still believing in misinformation, even when shown evidence to the contrary.",
              "Given that people are almost universally susceptible to misinformation \u2014 by far the strongest effect our lab has ever estimated \u2014 we can see that correctives do work on the majority of people, but leave a sizable minority misinformed.",
              "Our research has found that detailed corrections, often seen as potentially effective, have less impact than succinct ones.",

              "Note that the two situations are not mutually exclusive: avoiding continued influence might require both successful integration and retrieval of the corrective information.",
              "One school of thought \u2014 the integration account \u2014 suggests that the CIE arises when a correction is not sufficiently encoded and integrated with the misinformation in the memory network (Fig.",

              "There is robust evidence that integration of the correction and misinformation is a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition for memory updating and knowledge revision100.",
              "This view implies that a successful revision requires detecting a conflict between the misinformation and the correction, the co-activation of both representations in memory, and their subsequent integration102.",
              "Evidence for this account comes from the success of interventions that bolster conflict detection, co-activation, and integration of misinformation and correction103,104.",
              "Assuming that information integration relies on processing in working memory (the short-term store used to briefly hold and manipulate information in the service of thinking and reasoning), the finding that lower working memory capacity predicts greater susceptibility to the CIE is also in line with this account105 (although it has not been replicated106).",
              "This theory further assumes that as the amount of integrated correct information increases, memory for the correction becomes stronger, at the expense of memory for the misinformation102.",
              "Thus, both the interconnectedness and the amount of correct information can influence the success of memory revision.",

              "For example, it has been proposed that a retraction causes the misinformation representation to be tagged as false107.",
              "The misinformation can be retrieved without the false tag, but the false tag cannot be retrieved without concurrent retrieval of the misinformation.",
              "One instantiation of this selective-retrieval view appeals to a dual-process mechanism, which assumes that retrieval can occur based on an automatic, effortless process signalling information familiarity (\u2018I think I have heard this before\u2019) or a more strategic, effortful process of recollection that includes contextual detail (\u2018I read about this in yesterday\u2019s newspaper\u2019)108.",
              "According to this account of continued influence, the CIE can arise if there is automatic, familiarity-driven retrieval of the misinformation (for example, in response to a cue), without explicit recollection of the corrective information and associated post-retrieval suppression of the misinformation107,109.",

              "For example, misinformation damaging the reputation of a political candidate might spark outrage or contempt, which might promote continued influence of this misinformation (in particular among non-supporters)134.",
              "However, there seems to be little continued influence of negative misinformation on impression formation when the person subjected to the false allegation is not a disliked politician, perhaps because reliance on corrected misinformation might be seen as biased or judgemental (that is, it might be frowned upon to judge another person even though allegations have been proven false)136.",
              "Other studies have compared emotive and non-emotive events \u2014 for example, a plane crash falsely assumed to have been caused by a terror attack, resulting in many fatalities, versus a technical fault, resulting in zero fatalities \u2014 and found no impact of misinformation emotiveness on the magnitude of the CIE137.",
              "Moreover, just as a sad mood can protect against initial misinformation belief80, it also seems to facilitate knowledge revision when a correction is encountered138.",
              "People who exhibit both subclinical depression and rumination tendencies have even been shown to exhibit particularly efficient correction of negative misinformation relative to control individuals, presumably because the salience of negative misinformation to this group facilitates revision139.",

              "Another tool in the policymaker\u2019s arsenal is interventions targeted more directly at behaviour, such as nudging policies and public pledges to honour the truth (also known as self-nudging) for policymakers and consumers alike12,244,245.",
              "Overall, solutions to misinformation spread must be multipronged and target both the supply (for example, more efficient fact-checking and changes to platform algorithms and policies) and the consumption (for example, accuracy nudges and enhanced media literacy) of misinformation.",
              "Individually, each intervention might only incrementally reduce the spread of misinformation, but one preprint that has not been peer-reviewed suggests that combinations of interventions can have a substantial impact246.",

              "Such interventions might include enhancing transparency in science249,250 and journalism251, more rigorous fact-checking of political advertisements252, and reducing the social inequality that breeds distrust in experts and contributes to vulnerability to misinformation253,254.",

              "However, much work remains to fully understand the psychology of misinformation.",
              "First, in line with general trends in psychology and elsewhere, research methods in the field of misinformation should be improved.",

              "Researchers should also avoid relying on one-item questions with relatively low reliability256.",
              "Given the well-known attitude\u2013behaviour gap \u2014 that attitude change does not readily translate into behavioural effects \u2014 researchers should also attempt to use more behavioural measures, such as information-sharing measures, rather than relying exclusively on self-report questionnaires93,94,95.",
              "Although existing research has yielded valuable insights into how people generally process misinformation (many of which will translate across different contexts and cultures), an increased focus on diversification of samples and more robust methods is likely to provide a better appreciation of important contextual factors and nuanced cultural differences7,82,205,257,258,259,260,261,262,263.",
              "Second, most existing work has focused on explicit misinformation and text-based materials.",
              "Thus, the cognitive impacts of other types of misinformation, including subtler types of misdirection such as paltering (misleading while technically saying the truth)95,264,265,266, doctored images267, deepfake videos268 and extreme patterns of misinformation bombardment223, are currently not well understood.",
              "Non-text-based corrections, such as videos or cartoons, also deserve more exploration269,270.",
              "Third, additional translational research is needed to explore questions about causality, including the causal impacts of misinformation and corrections on beliefs and behaviours.",
              "This research should also employ non-experimental methods230,231,271, such as observational causal inference (research aiming to establish causality in observed real-world data)272, and test the impact of interventions in the real world145,174,181,207.",
              "These studies are especially needed over the long term \u2014 weeks to months, or even years \u2014 and should test a range of outcome measures, for example those that relate to health and political behaviours, in a range of contexts.",
              "Ultimately, the success of psychological research into misinformation should be linked not only to theoretical progress but also to societal impact273.",
              "Finally, even though the field has a reasonable understanding of the cognitive mechanisms and social determinants of misinformation processing, knowledge of the complex interplay between cognitive and social dynamics is still limited, as is insight into the role of emotion.",

              "In order to maintain an open, democratic system, it is important that government, business, and consumers work together to solve these problems. Governments should promote news literacy and strong professional journalism in their societies.",

              "\u201d17 This information can distort election campaigns, affect public perceptions, or shape human emotions.",
              "Recent research has found that \u201celusive bots could easily infiltrate a population of unaware humans and manipulate them to affect their perception of reality, with unpredictable results.",
              "\u201d18 In some cases, they can \u201cengage in more complex types of interactions, such as entertaining conversations with other people, commenting on their posts, and answering their questions.",

              "19 An analysis after the 2016 election found that automated bots played a major role in disseminating false information on Twitter.",
              "According to Jonathan Albright, an assistant professor of media analytics at Elon University, \u201cwhat bots are doing is really getting this thing trending on Twitter.",

              "\u201d20 With digital content, the more posts that are shared or liked, the more traffic they generate.",
              "Through these means, it becomes relatively easy to spread fake information over the internet.",

              "Everyone has a responsibility to combat the scourge of fake news.",
              "This ranges from supporting investigative journalism, reducing financial incentives for fake news, and improving digital literacy among the general public.",
              "False information is dangerous because of its ability to affect public opinion and electoral discourse.",
              "According to David Lazer, \u201csuch situations can enable discriminatory and inflammatory ideas to enter public discourse and be treated as fact.",
              "Once embedded, such ideas can in turn be used to create scapegoats, to normalize prejudices, to harden us-versus-them mentalities and even, in extreme cases, to catalyze and justify violence.",
              "\u201d21 As he points out, factors such as source credibility, repetition, and social pressure affect information flows and the extent to which misinformation is taken seriously.",
              "When viewers see trusted sources repeat certain points, they are more likely to be influenced by that material.",
              "Recent polling data demonstrate how harmful these practices have become to the reputations of reputable platforms. According to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, only 24 percent of Americans today believe social media sites \u201cdo a good job separating fact from fiction, compared to 40 percent for the news media.",

              "United Nations Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur David Kaye notes that \u201call too many leaders see journalism as the enemy, reporters as rogue actors, tweeps as terrorists, and bloggers as blasphemers.",
              "\u201d23 In Freedom House\u2019s most recent report on global press freedoms, researchers found that media freedom was at its lowest point in 13 years and there were \u201cunprecedented threats to journalists and media outlets in major democracies and new moves by authoritarian states to control the media, including beyond their borders.",
              "\u201d24 Journalists can often be accused of generating fake news and there have been numerous cases of legitimate journalists being arrested or their work being subject to official scrutiny.",
              "In Egypt, an Al-Jazeera producer was arrested on charges of \u201cincitement against state institutions and broadcasting fake news with the aim of spreading chaos.",
              "\u201d25 This was after the network broadcast a documentary criticizing Egyptian military conscription.",
              "Some governments have also moved to create government regulations to control information flows and censor content on social media platforms. Indonesia has established a government agency to \u201cmonitor news circulating online\u201d and \u201ctackle fake news.",
              "\u201d26 In the Philippines, Senator Joel Villanueva has introduced a bill that would impose up to a five-year prison term for those who publish or distribute \u201cfake news,\u201d which the legislation defined as activities that \u201ccause panic, division, chaos, violence, and hate, or those which exhibit a propaganda to blacken or discredit one\u2019s reputation.",
              "\u201d27 Critics have condemned the bill\u2019s definition of social networks, misinformation, hate speech, and illegal speech as too broad, and believe that it risks criminalizing investigative journalism and limiting freedom of expression.",
              "Newspaper columnist Jarius Bondoc noted \u201cthe bill is prone to abuse.",
              "A bigot administration can apply it to suppress the opposition.",

              "Investigative journalists would cram the jails.",
              "\u201d28 In a situation of false information, it is tempting for legal authorities to deal with offensive content and false news by forbidding or regulating it.",
              "For example, in Germany, legislation was passed in June 2017 that forces digital platforms to delete hate speech and misinformation.",
              "It requires large social media companies to \u201cdelete illegal, racist or slanderous comments and posts within 24 hours.",
              "\u201d Companies can be fined up to $57 million for content that is not deleted from the platform, such as Nazi symbols, Holocaust denials, or language classified as hate speech.",
              "29 The German legislation\u2019s critics have complained that its definition of \u201cobviously\u201d illegal speech risks censorship and a loss of freedom of speech.",
              "As an illustration, the law applies the rules to social media platforms in the country with more than 2 million users.",
              "Commentators have noted that is not a reasonable way to define relevant social networks.",
              "There could be much smaller networks that inflict greater social damage.",
              "Overly restrictive regulation of internet platforms in open societies sets a dangerous precedent and can encourage authoritarian regimes to continue and/or expand censorship.",
              "In addition, it is not always clear how to identify objectionable content.",
              "30 While it is pretty clear how to define speech advocating violence or harm to other people, it is less apparent when talking about hate speech or \u201cdefamation of the state.",

              "Does it include mistakes in reporting, opinion piece commentary, political satire, leader misstatements, or outright fabrications?",
              "Watchdog organizations complained that \u201coverly broad language could affect a range of platforms and services and put decisions about what is illegal content into the hands of private companies that may be inclined to over-censor in order to avoid potential fines.",
              "\u201d31 Overly restrictive regulation of internet platforms in open societies sets a dangerous precedent and can encourage authoritarian regimes to continue and/or expand censorship.",
              "This will restrict global freedom of expression and generate hostility to democratic governance.",
              "Democracies that place undue limits on speech risk legitimizing authoritarian leaders and their efforts to crackdown basic human rights.",

              "Many of these ideas represent solutions that combat fake news and disinformation without endangering freedom of expression and investigative journalism.",
              "1) One of the most important thing governments around the world can do is to encourage independent, professional journalism.",
              "The general public needs reporters who help them make sense of complicated developments and deal with the ever-changing nature of social, economic, and political events.",
              "Many areas are going through transformation that I elsewhere have called \u201cmegachanges,\u201d and these shifts have created enormous anger, anxiety, and confusion.",
              "32 In a time of considerable turmoil, it is vital to have a healthy Fourth Estate that is independent of public authorities.",
              "2) Governments should avoid crackdowns on the news media\u2019s ability to cover the news.",

              "The United States should set a good example with other countries.",
              "If American leaders censor or restrict the news media, it encourages other countries to do the same thing.",
              "3) Governments should avoid censoring content and making online platforms liable for misinformation.",
              "This could curb free expression, making people hesitant to share their political opinions for fear it could be censored as fake news.",
