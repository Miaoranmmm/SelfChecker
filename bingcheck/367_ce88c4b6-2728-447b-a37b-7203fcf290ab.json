    "query": "What is the most innovative and impactful method for enhancing environmental sustainability within urban architecture and design, and what cities around the world have successfully implemented these strategies?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. There is no definitive answer to what is the most innovative and impactful method for enhancing environmental sustainability within urban architecture and design, as different contexts may require different solutions. However, some of the common approaches that have been proposed or implemented are:\n\n- **Adaptive reuse**: This is the strategy of transforming existing buildings or structures into new functions, rather than demolishing them and building anew. This can save energy, materials, and land, as well as preserve the historical and cultural value of the built environment[^2^]. Some examples of adaptive reuse projects are the Tate Modern in London, which was converted from a former power station, or the High Line in New York, which was transformed from an abandoned railway into a linear park.\n- **Nature-based solutions**: These are solutions that use natural processes and elements to address environmental challenges, such as climate change, air pollution, water management, or biodiversity loss. They can also provide social and economic benefits, such as improving health, well-being, recreation, and education[^1^]. Some examples of nature-based solutions are the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park in Singapore, which restored a natural riverbed and floodplain from a concrete canal[^1^], or the Sponge City initiative in China, which aims to create urban landscapes that can absorb and reuse rainwater[^1^].\n- **Urban ecological architecture**: This is an integrated approach that considers the unification of ecological systems and human-made systems in an urban environment. It aims to create symbiotic relationships between nature and culture, where both can benefit from each other's ecosystem services[^3^]. Some examples of urban ecological architecture are the BedZED eco-village in London, which incorporates renewable energy sources, water recycling, and passive design strategies[^3^], or the Bosco Verticale in Milan, which features vertical forests that host hundreds of plant species and animals[^3^].\n\nSome of the cities around the world that have successfully implemented these strategies are:\n\n- Singapore: The city-state has been recognized as a leader in sustainable urban development, with initiatives such as the Garden City vision, the Active Mobility Plan, the Zero Waste Masterplan, and the Green Mark Scheme. Singapore has also invested in research and innovation to enhance its environmental performance and resilience[^1^].\n- Copenhagen: The Danish capital has set ambitious goals to become carbon neutral by 2025 and to be the world's first climate-resilient city by 2030. Copenhagen has implemented various measures to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change impacts, such as expanding its cycling network, promoting green roofs and walls, enhancing its stormwater management system, and developing renewable energy sources[^4^].\n- Curitiba: The Brazilian city is widely regarded as a model of sustainable urban planning, especially for developing countries. Curitiba has pioneered initiatives such as the Bus Rapid Transit system, the Integrated Garbage Program, the Green Exchange Program, and the Linear Parks Program. Curitiba has also fostered a culture of environmental awareness and participation among its citizens[^4^].\n\nI hope this answer gives you some insights into the topic of environmental sustainability within urban architecture and design.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "Adaptive reuse is a term that refers to the process of taking an existing structure and updating or adapting it for a new use or purpose.",
              "This type of construction often occurs when a building\u2019s previous purpose becomes outdated or even obsolete \u2013 for instance, a specific type of business or industry has moved out of a region due to economic or technological reasons.",
              "The unique design of each structure for its original purpose may require a knowledgeable project team to retrofit the existing structure for the new life.",
              "The concept of an adaptive reuse is related to, yet different from a historic preservation or restoration project.",
              "Many times, a historic restoration or preservation involves restoring a building component or feature to its original condition.",
              "Certain agencies and municipalities may provide tax credits and other incentives to historic preservation projects, and there are also some limits and potentially, additional costs involved in a historic restoration due to the regulations governing that a certain design aesthetic, feature or building material be retained.",
              "On the other hand, a retrofit or adaptive reuse project means to update a structure not to a previous iteration, but to a new design that will enable the structure to be used in an entirely new way.",
              "One common way to transform an outdated structure is to retrofit it into multi-family housing or mixed-use spaces.",
              "Adaptive reuse brings challenges and benefits.",
              "Challenges could be physical adaptations that require special design flexibility and creative problem-solving by project teams;",
              "dealing with regulatory permits and rezoning requirements for a new use;",
              "or remediating environmental hazards in \u201cbrownfield\u201d projects.",
              "Simply occupying every floor of every existing building would absorb years of demand for growth and revitalize countless neighborhoods.",
              "-Carl Elefante, 2018 AIA President The advantages are vast.",
              "Restoring or retrofitting an existing building signals a perception of value in not only a city or town, but in a neighborhood and its inhabitants.",
              "An investment to improve the performance and appearance of one building can create a domino effect as it increases market value, enhances the quality of community and related activity, and attracts more interest and investment.",
              "Compared to new construction, adaptive reuse carries with it enormous environmental benefits.",
              "As Carl Elefante, the 2018 president of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), famously said, \u201cThe greenest building is one that is already built.",
              "\u201d It\u2019s not that it doesn\u2019t take energy and resources to restore an existing building -- but that it takes far less of both compared to constructing a new building.",
              "Restoration has a smaller profile of embodied carbon, a calculation of all emissions that occur in association with the big-picture, full-life-cycle view of a building.",
              "That includes the emissions involved in extracting raw materials, manufacturing, transporting, constructing, maintaining, renovating and extinguishing a building and the materials it comprises.",
              "Not only does an adaptive reuse project use fewer resources, but Elefante counts these buildings as resources themselves.",
              "\"Sensible retrofits and renovations (are) an extremely impactful strategy in reducing global carbon emissions from the building sector.\"",

              "Photo by Dror Baldinger If you\u2019ve ever seen or been inside a building that serves a different function than it once did\u2014say a former aviation hangar turned office space or shopping mall turned community college, you\u2019ve experienced the long-standing architectural practice of adaptive reuse.",
              "Adaptive reuse is the sustainable idea that old buildings can and should be renovated rather than demolished once they\u2019ve outlived their original purpose.",
              "But is it really that simple?",

              "The adaptive reuse project was originally a shopping mall.",
              "Photo by Dror Baldinger While the term may have only originated in the mid-1970s, adaptive reuse as a practice is nothing new\u2014it simply refers to the process of refurbishing a building for purposes other than those that it was originally built for.",
              "Adaptive reuse projects serve as a means of extending buildings\u2019 operational lifespans by updating them to better address the economic and social needs of their respective communities.",
              "Now that we\u2019ve familiarized ourselves with the basics of adaptive reuse, let\u2019s talk broadly about why adaptive reuse is such an important practice within the field of sustainable architecture.",
              "In the fundamental sense adaptive reuse prolongs the lifespan of existing buildings in an attempt to limit further resource and energy consumption, which in turn helps reduce the amount of waste and harmful emissions produced by the world\u2019s built environment.",
              "This is important due to the fact that buildings account for approximately 40% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions, while the construction industry is responsible for extracting over 30% of the world\u2019s natural resources and producing 25% of the world\u2019s solid waste.",
              "WXY and Edward Tucker Architects are designing a major adaptive reuse project along with SB Friedman for the community-based group Coalfield Development.",
              "Rendering courtesy of WXY architecture + urban design For as long as buildings have existed they have been repurposed and reused to fulfill roles other than those they were originally intended for;",
              "in that sense adaptive reuse isn\u2019t a particularly modern concept.",
              "Cities like Rome, Athens, Venice, and London are all famous for their preservation and reuse of historic structures.",
              "Adaptive reuse as part of the sustainable building design movement, however, is a much more recent notion\u2014one born out of a concerted effort to maximize development space and reduce the consumption of natural resources.",
              "One of the first well-known examples of modern adaptive reuse\u2014in the United States, that is\u2014took place during the early 1970s when Boston\u2019s Old City Hall was converted into offices and gourmet restaurants, a move that ultimately helped bolster the local economy.",
              "Following this success adaptive reuse projects began to crop up all throughout the US to help revitalize dying urban centers and bring in revenue.",
              "By the late 2010s concerns surrounding global warming and increasing carbon pollution led the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to declare adaptive reuse as necessary in reducing construction emissions and mitigating the effects of anthropogenic climate change.",
              "Today real estate agents estimate that within the next 10 years approximately 90% of new real estate development will involve some manner of adaptive reuse.",
              "FCA designed this Virtua Samson Cancer Center project from a former supermarket.",
              "Photo courtesy of FCA It should be noted, however, that not all adaptive reuse projects operate in the same manner, nor do they always have the same design goals.",
              "In fact, there are five core types of adaptive reuse projects to be aware of: renovation, integration, preservation, facadism, and infrastructural.",
              "As probably the most well-known type of adaptive reuse, renovation in this context describes the practice of making minimal changes to a building\u2019s exterior while rebuilding and refurbishing the interior for a completely new purpose.",
              "One such example of renovative adaptive reuse is the Virtua Samson Cancer Center, a health care facility designed by Francis Cauffman Architects (FCA) in Moorestown, New Jersey that used to be a grocery store.",
              "\u201cChoosing to repurpose an existing building is a socially responsible and sustainable way to bring care closer to the communities that need it,\u201d Aran McCarthy, FCA\u2019s principal of health care, previously told gb&d.",
              "Integrative adaptive reuse, on the other hand, is something you don\u2019t see too often.",
              "Instead of leaving the exterior untouched while making renovations to the interior, integrative adaptive reuse projects build an entirely new structure around or attached to an existing structure.",
              "Adaptive reuse can also take the form of preservation, in which a historic building\u2019s exterior and interior aesthetics are left largely unchanged aside from building code and efficiency upgrades.",
              "These projects help preserve and restore a building\u2019s historic significance while still adapting the structure\u2019s overall function to better serve the community.",
              "In this sense preservation can be an incredibly meaningful form of adaptive reuse.",
              "The Robert Frost Stone House Museum in Bennington, Vermont, for example, has preserved the home of one of America\u2019s most influential poets by turning it into a museum that honors his life and legacy.",
              "The house\u2019s materials, interior features, and furnishings are all original, but it no longer serves as a private residence.",
              "Alternatively, buildings with minimal historical significance or significant interior dilapidation may be adapted via facadism\u2014an approach that leaves the front-facing exterior largely unchanged but demolishes and rebuilds the majority of the structure behind it.",
              "Facadism as a means of adaptive reuse is incredibly popular in Australia, as exemplified by Melbourne\u2019s Collins Street.",
              "Finally, adaptive reuse as a concept applies to more than just buildings themselves.",
              "Infrastructural works like railways, highways, and industrial plants can also be adapted to serve new functions.",
              "An inspiring example of infrastructural adaptive reuse is London\u2019s renovation of the Bankside Power Station into the Tate Modern, one of the largest modern and contemporary art museums in the world.",
              "Formerly a department store, Uptown Station in Oakland, CA is now a mixed-use development designed by MBH Architects.",
              "Photo by Tyler Chartier Adaptive reuse can be implemented in a variety of ways, but what are the actual advantages of reusing an old building?",
              "What benefits does adaptive reuse offer to make it a better option than constructing an entirely new building from the ground up?",
              "For starters, building projects that require an existing structure be demolished typically end up producing a significant amount of waste\u2014waste that, more often than not, ends up in a landfill.",
              "Adaptive reuse projects, on the other hand, seek to recycle and reclaim as much of the original building stock as possible, which in turn helps conserve energy and resources.",
              "Many older buildings were also built to regulate temperature naturally and often make ample use of natural sunlight\u2014both of which help reduce the energy needed to heat/cool and illuminate the finished project.",
              "Since adaptive reuse projects try to reuse rather than buy new materials, the overall construction costs are reduced\u2014sometimes by as much as 16%.",
              "Adaptive reuse projects also save money by eliminating demolition costs, which can account for 5 to10% of new construction expenses.",
              "What\u2019s more, renovating an existing building typically takes less time than constructing a new one from scratch.",
              "Aside from the fact that the framework is already there, buildings that are adapted do not need to be completed before occupancy;",
              "as soon as one section is done, businesses can move in.",
              "All in all this helps minimize potential economic losses.",
              "Lastly, adaptive reuse projects can help revitalize impoverished and run-down communities by bringing in new businesses, schools, low-income housing, or social centers and facilitating the growth of economic and social capital\u2014a process known as urban regeneration.",
              "In this regard adaptive reuse also helps combat urban sprawl by making the most out of land that has already been developed.",
              "Furthermore, the renovation of existing buildings helps preserve their historic value in a way that actually benefits the community.",
              "\u201cThe architectural landscape of a place is often shaped by the geography, community, and culture that is unique to each city and town,\u201d Tom Pflueger, studio director of MBH Architects, previously told gb&d.",
              "\u201cHistoric renovation projects aim to preserve these special places that are unique to a city and relevant to visually telling the city\u2019s history.",
              "\u201d Repurposing these structures allows for sustainable development that gives back rather than takes from the surrounding community.",
              "Of course, no adaptive reuse project is without its challenges.",
              "And while the exact difficulties will vary from project to project, they typically fall into one of the following categories: regulatory, economical, or practical.",
              "One of the biggest barriers to adaptive reuse is the limitations imposed by certain building codes and regulations, which can vary widely between county and state lines.",
              "Whenever a structure\u2019s purpose changes, it must be updated to comply with any codes and licensing requirements applicable to its new classification.",
              "Many older buildings, for example, do not meet today\u2019s accessibility, safety, and energy requirements, which means more money will need to be spent at the outset to bring the building up to code.",
              "What\u2019s more, modern zoning stipulations can limit a building\u2019s adapted reuse options, which can make it difficult to find a suitable location for the desired project.",
              "To mitigate these challenges, consult with professionals who have experience dealing with your area\u2019s local building laws.",
              "Despite typically having lower construction costs, adaptive reuse projects may face a range of economic challenges that reduce the viability of renovating a property, including: Fortunately, there are tax incentives and government programs that can help supply funding to adaptive reuse projects that meet certain criteria.",
              "The Inflation Reduction Act, for example, offers a tax deduction for projects that reduce an existing building\u2019s energy usage.",
              "Projects that qualify for federal historic tax credits are eligible to have up to 20% of their construction costs paid for.",
              "Finally, there are a few practical challenges that plague adaptive reuse projects, including constraints imposed by a building\u2019s existing layout.",
              "Heavily compartmentalized structures, for example, are harder and more expensive to modify than buildings with an open interior.",
              "What\u2019s more, older buildings typically require more complex refurbishing solutions that may be beyond the scope of many industry professionals.",
              "It can also be difficult to find accurate blueprints and other important information\u2014such as material or dimensional inconsistencies\u2014on older buildings slated for redevelopment, which can hinder and lengthen the redesign process.",
              "That said, adaptive reuse places a lot of emphasis on finding creative solutions to practical design barriers\u2014if you have the time and budget, your architect should be able to help figure out ways around them.",
              "Despite these challenges, there are plenty of successful adaptive reuse projects to draw inspiration from.",

              "[2] Adaptive reuse of buildings can be an attractive alternative to new construction in terms of sustainability and a circular economy.",
              "[3] It has prevented thousands of buildings' demolition and has allowed them to become critical components of urban regeneration.",
              "[1] Not every old building can qualify for adaptive reuse.",
              "Architects, developers, builders and entrepreneurs who wish to become involved in rejuvenating and reconstructing a building must first make sure that the finished product will serve the need of the market, that it will be completely useful for its new purpose, and that it will be competitively priced.",
              "[4] Adaptive Reuse is defined as the aesthetic process that adapts buildings for new uses while retaining their historic features.",
              "Using an adaptive reuse model can prolong a building's life, from cradle-to-grave, by retaining all or most of the building system, including the structure, the shell and even the interior materials.",

              "[5] Revitalizing the existing built fabric by finding a new use or purpose for obsolete buildings can be a wonderful resource to a community by \"keeping neighborhoods occupied and vital\".",
              "[6] According to Yung and Chan, \"adaptive reuse is a new kind of maintainable rebirth of city, as it covers the building\u2019s lifetime and evades destruction waste, encourages recycles of the embodied dynamism and also delivers substantial social and economic profits to the world\".",
              "[7] Benefits: Typically categorised under economic, social, cultural and historical, and environmental benefits.",
              "[8] The most significant benefits of adaptive reuse of existing buildings include increased economic opportunities, urban regeneration, preserved cultural and historical heritage values, reduced landfill demolition waste, increased energy efficiency, extended building usefulness, and cost-effectiveness, enhanced property value, improved life quality, reduced carbon emissions, and lesser energy consumption.",
              "[8] Challenges: Typically categorised under building regulatory requirements and governance, financial, management, and complexities and uncertainties challenges.",
              "[8] The most significant challenges of adaptive reuse of existing buildings include structural integrity issues, compliance with building code regulations, government anti-adaptive reuse policies, lack of awareness, high maintenance cost, uncertainties surrounding existing building information, lack of incentives, and lack of decision-making tools and stakeholder participation.",

              "Transforming Tate Modern: A New Museum for 21st Century Britain",
              "Press Release 25 July 2006 Tate Modern Today, Tate\u2019s Trustees unveiled bold plans to transform Tate Modern into a new museum for 21st Century Britain.",
              "An iconic new building will be created on the south side of the existing gallery, to form one of the most exciting new cultural centres in Europe \u2013 a symbol of creative Britain.",
              "The building has been designed to show the full breadth of modern and contemporary art, with learning and visitor engagement at its heart.",
              "The project will create a new landmark for London, helping to maintain its position as the leading cultural and creative capital of the world.",
              "Mayor Ken Livingstone today announced major investment of \u00a37 million from the London Development Agency to kick-start the development and help fast-track the scheme so that it might be completed in time for the Olympic Games in 2012.",
              "The success of Tate Modern has made it necessary to bring forward the transformation of the Bankside site in order to accommodate the 4 million-plus visitors a year that come to the present building.",
              "The project will act as a catalyst for the further regeneration of the South Bank, encouraging its impact to spread further southwards into Southwark.",
              "It was always Tate\u2019s intention to \u2018complete\u2019 Tate Modern by bringing the derelict areas of the building into use at some point in the future.",
              "Now, EDF Energy Networks, which owns and operates the electricity substation located in Tate Modern\u2019s Switch House, needs to modernise the station\u2019s equipment.",
              "This creates a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to move the plant into a smaller area of the building, freeing up space for Tate Modern to expand to the south.",
              "At present there is no public access to Tate Modern from the south, which effectively cuts the gallery off from its surrounding community.",
              "A new south entrance will open up a north-south route or \u201cstreet\u201d right through the building, creating a new pedestrian walk from the City across the Millennium Bridge through the Turbine Hall to Southwark and the Elephant and Castle.",
              "This will be open for at least 12 hours a day.",
              "The spectacular new building is designed by Herzog & de Meuron, the award-winning architects who converted Bankside Power Station into Tate Modern.",
              "The existing and new building will become one, with the Turbine Hall acting as its spine, creating approximately 23,000m2 of new space.",
              "The new building will increase Tate Modern\u2019s overall size by 60%.",
              "The development will provide more space for contemporary art and enable Tate to further explore new areas of contemporary visual culture involving photography, film, video and performance, enriching its current programme.",
              "There will be space for cutting-edge contemporary work and work from across the world including Africa, Asia and Latin America, widening the geographical spread of the collection.",
              "7,000 m2 of exhibition and display space will be added to the existing 9,000 m2 (excluding Turbine Hall).",
              "The scheme will also enable more of Tate\u2019s Collection to be brought out of storage and shown on a more permanent basis and provide new space for major loan exhibitions, complementing the exhibition spaces in the existing building.",
              "Two new performance areas will be created in the oil tanks of the former power station.",
              "One will be a flexible auditorium to accommodate 400 people and the other will draw upon the qualities of the oil tanks to create an informal performance space, unique to Tate.",
              "These spaces will enable artists to explore the connections between the visual arts and other art forms. The new development will provide a sequence of exceptional new education spaces designed to meet the developing expectations of Tate\u2019s visitors.",
              "These will provide room for both formal and informal learning and will facilitate a wide-ranging programme.",
              "Tate Modern\u2019s outstanding and pioneering education programme will at last have the space to meet its potential and serve new and broader audiences.",
              "1,567m2 of learning space will be added to the existing 1,000 m2.",
              "A new public roof terrace will give spectacular views across London.",
              "Cafe\u0301s, restaurants, shops and offices, a new enlarged Members\u2019 room and a Patrons\u2019 lounge will be among the many new facilities.",
              "New public squares are being developed to unify and integrate the new public realm surrounding Tate Modern and distinguish the different types of spaces and their functions.",
              "Over 1,000 new trees will be planted and new seating provided.",
              "Two new, high-quality public squares will be created for London.",
              "The new development of Tate Modern will be much more than just a building;",
              "it will be the anchor for a dynamic new quarter of London \u2013 a new creative campus stretching southwards.",
              "Bankside Urban Park, involving the improvement of the urban realm through the creation of pocket parks and other small-scale developments, is a major project being led by Better Bankside with the support of Tate and other landowners.",
              "The Urban Park will connect newly landscaped areas around the gallery to open spaces across Southwark.",
              "Tate Modern\u2019s new development lies at the heart of London\u2019s Cultural Quarter, running from the London Eye to the Design Museum, constituting a newly formed group of 20 cultural organisations who are committed to working together, in partnership with local government, the business sector and the creative industries.",
              "The designs for the new development will be submitted for planning approval in Autumn 2006, with a decision expected in Spring 2007.",
              "It is hoped that the new building might be finished in time for Olympic Games in 2012.",
              "The total costs of the project are comparable to the costs of the original Tate Modern: \u00a3165 million at today\u2019s prices, \u00a3215 million at outturn in 2012.",

              "A key feature of nature\u2013based health interventions is that a single intervention can affect people in multiple ways and, therefore, potentially improve wellbeing across a range of domains [15,17,176].",
              "For example, nature prescriptions can both promote physical activity leading to many positive health outcomes, while also providing patients with the mentally restorative effects of natural spaces [32,98,99,177].",
              "Thus, investment in interventions can achieve significant outcomes across multiple domains [17] and, when scaled up, could have significant and cost\u2013effective implications for population health.",
              "Furthermore, nature can be pro\u2013actively planned into city development activities to provide a protective factor against many health conditions [15,177].",
              "Research into the extent and magnitude of these outcomes is critical to assist decision\u2013makers (such as hospital or care\u2013home managers and urban planners) in weighing up the costs and benefits of investing in the various options, identifying ways to coordinate efforts (e.",
              "g., with regard to the siting of health care facilities) and ultimately supporting \u2018prevent\u2013to\u2013save\u2019 initiatives [178].",
              "As with other public health interventions, there are many factors that influence both the effectiveness and the success of NBIs.",
              "For example, the accessibility of public parks will inevitably influence their use by communities, and a number of studies have found people are more likely to exercise in neighborhoods with greater levels of park availability [11,59,179,180,181,182,183,184,185].",
              "There are also social equity issues at play.",
              "For example, disadvantaged neighborhoods have been repeatedly found to have less vegetation cover, fewer public parks and fewer street trees;",
              "additionally, organised user\u2013pays programmes may be inaccessible for some disadvantaged sectors of society [186,187,188,189].",
              "Furthermore, the physical and mental capability of participants is a potential barrier to accessing some intervention types, as identified in this expert elicitation study.",
              "Social factors, such as acceptability of the intervention to local communities, are also likely to have an important influence on the uptake of nature\u2013based health interventions;",
              "for example, several studies have now found that cultural differences have a critical influence on the use of public green spaces [190,191,192].",
              "Finally, an individual\u2019s age, gender and other factors will play a role, as will perceptions of nature and the appropriateness of the nature setting in its wider context (e.",
              "g., ecological characteristics of the nature setting, facilities and infrastructure, programmed activities and experiences of social inclusion in the setting) [193,194,195].",
              "As NBIs are not yet mainstream within the health care community, practitioner buy\u2013in and knowledge was identified as a particular challenge in this study.",
              "Further knowledge and communication about the effectiveness of interventions gained from rigorous research is therefore likely to be an important precursor for their use, including understanding the limitations or barriers to success and accounting for local contexts.",
              "Active evaluation and communication of findings from relevant studies is needed to build more solid foundations for decision\u2013making that will help improve health and narrow health inequities.",
              "This said, much is already known about the potential benefits and how they are realised, and public appreciation for parks and other NBIs has such long\u2013standing support that many generations of urban residents have already been able to benefit from their availability.",
              "In this study, we used an expert elicitation process to compile a list of the nature\u2013based health interventions that have received some research attention.",
              "This process is not without its limitations.",
              "Most notably, some interventions may have been overlooked, and the list was subject to a consensus on grouping and categorisation that others may have done in a different way.",
              "Furthermore, this study has thus not systematically addressed issues of intervention efficacy, effectiveness, and efficiency.",

              "Just a few years after Stamford Raffles landed on Singaporea\u0302\u0080\u0099s shores in 1819, the British took steps to set up a botanic garden.",

              "According to Wallich, the garden was set up for the a\u0302\u0080\u009cexperimental cultivation of the indigenous plants of Singaporea\u0302\u0080\u009d.",
              "This effort followed the long-established British tradition of setting up botanic gardens in its colonies to experiment with growing commercially valuable crops and for the study of native plants.",
              "2 Within a year of its establishment in 1822, the botanic garden in Singapore had grown to occupy the 19 hectares of land that Raffles had allocated, cultivating crops such as nutmeg, cocoa and cloves.",
              "However, the garden a\u0302\u0080\u0093 under the supervision of Scottish surgeon William Montgomerie a\u0302\u0080\u0093 was shut down in 1829 because of its high cost of upkeep, coupled with a lack of funding and government support, particularly after Rafflesa\u0302\u0080\u0099 permanent departure from Singapore in June 1823.",
              "3 In 1836, another botanic garden was created on a much smaller plot on Fort Canning.",

              "8-hectare garden was primarily used to grow nutmeg.",
              "A decade later, however, this garden was also abandoned after the price of nutmeg declined.",
              "4 About two decades later, in 1859, the Agricultural and Horticultural Society set up a landscaped ornamental and leisure garden on a 23-hectare tract in Tanglin.",
              "This took root and eventually became the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG).",
              "In 2015, it was declared a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage Site.",
              "Its first superintendent, Lawrence Niven, organised flower shows and horticultural fairs in the gardens to attract more visitors.",
              "He also added many features such as the Swan Lake, Bandstand Hill and the interconnecting curving pathways.",
              "5 After the Straits Settlements government took over the management of the gardens in 1874, it continued to grow under the stewardship of directors such as Henry James Murton (1875a\u0302\u0080\u009380), Nathaniel Cantley (1880a\u0302\u0080\u009388) and Henry Nicholas Ridley (1888a\u0302\u0080\u00931912).",
              "Murton expanded the gardens with a 41-hectare northern extension in 1879.",
              "He also established the Economic Garden the same year for the research and conservation of plants with economic potential, such as coffee, sugarcane and parA\u0303\u00a1 rubber.",
              "In addition, Murton set up a zoo within the gardensa\u0302\u0080\u0099 compound, which at its peak between 1875 and 1878, housed around 150 animals, including leopards and a tiger.",
              "6 Cantley established nurseries and launched a tree-planting programme to reforest parts of the land that had previously been cleared by plantation owners (Cantley had authored an 1883 report on deforestation that led to the demarcation of Singaporea\u0302\u0080\u0099s first forest reserves and the creation of a Forest Department).",
              "For the tree planting programme, he picked trees like teak, American rain tree and mahogany for their ability to produce quality timber to support construction work and other commercial activities such as furniture making.",
              "7 It should be mentioned that Cantley was more concerned about safeguarding Singaporea\u0302\u0080\u0099s timber supply rather than environmental protection and conservation.",
              "8 Ridley continued efforts to reforest the reserves.",
              "By the time the Forest Department was transferred to the Collector of Land Revenue in 1895, the amount of land designated as forest reserves (forest land set aside for timber reserves) had increased from 8,000 acres in 1884 to nearly 12,000 acres.",
              "9 Ridley also helped develop the botanical and horticultural research arm of the gardens by turning it into a centre for rubber distribution and enlarging its herbarium collection with plants that he had gathered from his expeditions around the island.",
              "One of his most important additions to the gardens was the orchid hybrid known as Vanda Miss Joaquim, later designated as Singaporea\u0302\u0080\u0099s national flower in 1981.",
              "10 The orchid had been cultivated by Agnes Joaquim, who crossed the Vanda hookeriana with the Vanda teres to produce the orchid that Ridley subsequently named Vanda Miss Joaquim.",

              "12 The Botanic Gardens also worked with the Singapore Municipality (succeeded by the Singapore Municipal Commission in 1887) to plant roadside trees in the 1860s.",
              "Some of the trees planted include the cotton tree, angsana tree, flame of the forest and rain tree.",
              "These were planted along major thoroughfares such as Orchard Road, Scotts Road, Anderson Road, Jalan Besar and Balestier Road.",
              "13 The Municipal Commission was also responsible for the upkeep and planning of recreational spaces for the public.",
              "Prior to the 1920s, there were only a handful of such spaces like the Padang, the sea-front garden at Connaught Drive (todaya\u0302\u0080\u0099s Esplanade Park), Dhoby Green (a grassy strip near Dhoby Ghaut), Peoplea\u0302\u0080\u0099s Park, Finlayson Green and the area around Dalhousie Obelisk.",

              "Whampoa Gardens, owned by prominent Chinese businessman and community leader Hoo Ah Kay (better known as Whampoa), was located on the grounds of his lavish mansion on Serangoon Road.",
              "The garden was described as beautifully landscaped and contained many exotic tropical flowers and plants.",
              "It was opened to the public during the Lunar New Year.",
              "Another private garden was the Alkaff Lake Gardens off MacPherson Road, which was opened to the public in 1929.",
              "Owned by the wealthy Arab merchant Syed Shaik Alkaff, it was a Japanese-style garden that had a lake for rowing boats, neatly landscaped paths and tea houses.",
              "15 Following the release of the 1918 Housing Commission report, which called for the creation of more recreational spaces for residents who were otherwise largely confined to their a\u0302\u0080\u009cdark airless housesa\u0302\u0080\u009d, the Municipal Commission began to create more parks, starting with Katong Park, which was completed in 1927.",
              "16 In the 1930s, the commission also built Farrer Park and King George V Park in Fort Canning.",
              "17 After the Japanese Occupation (1942a\u0302\u0080\u009345), the Municipal Commission, which was renamed City Council in 1951, continued to increase green recreational spaces and enhance existing parks.",
              "Between 1955 and 1961, the City Council added more amenities and landscaping to King George V Park, Katong Park and Esplanade Park.",
              "18 Despite these efforts, the city area was mostly a concrete jungle.",
              "Singaporea\u0302\u0080\u0099s first Master Plan, released in 1958, sought to address this problem by almost quadrupling the land set aside for recreation from 274 hectares in 1953 to 1,050 hectares by 1972.",
              "These were to be located along the coasts of Bedok, Changi and Pasir Ris as well as the fringes of the built-up central area.",
              "19 In 1959, the newly elected government formed by the Peoplea\u0302\u0080\u0099s Action Party embarked on efforts to beautify Singapore.",
              "Between 1959 and 1966, several new green spaces such as the Duxton Plain Parkway, Crawford Park, Model Traffic Playground, Mount Faber Scenic Park and the garden above Raffles Square underground carpark were built.",
              "20 The government also launched a tree planting campaign in 1963.",
              "However, Singapore would not have an official greening policy until the a\u0302\u0080\u009cGarden Citya\u0302\u0080\u009d vision articulated by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967.",

              "a\u0302\u0080\u009d22 The plan was carried out in two phases.",
              "The first saw the large-scale planting of roadside trees and shrubs by the Parks and Trees Unit of the Public Works Department, which became the Parks and Recreation Department (PRD) in 1975.",
              "The trees included species that could grow fast and endowed with shady crowns, such as the angsana tree, rain tree, flame of the forest and the frangipani.",
              "Shrubs like the bougainvillea, the red Ixora, the bamboo orchid and the Cassandra were also grown.",
              "23 By 1970, over 55,000 new trees had been planted, increasing to some 158,600 in 1974 and 1.",
              "4 million by June 2014.",
              "Today, tree planting efforts are headed by the National Parks Board (NParks), which was formed in 1990 to manage Singaporea\u0302\u0080\u0099s national parks.",
              "It was expanded in 1996 to incorporate the roles of the PRD, including planting roadside trees and developing recreational spaces and parks.",
              "24 The second phase of the a\u0302\u0080\u009cGarden Citya\u0302\u0080\u009d plan, from the mid-1970s onwards, involved the creation of parks throughout the island.",
              "These new parks were larger and equipped with a wide range of facilities to meet the diverse recreational needs of different population groups.",
              "The largest of such parks are known as regional parks and they range from 10 hectares to 200 hectares.",
              "These parks include East Coast Park, Mount Faber Park, and MacRitchie Reservoir Park.",
              "25 Then there are the community parks like Toa Payoh Town Park, Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park and Yishun Neighbourhood Park located near housing estates.",

              "27 The efforts to plant roadside trees and build parks were supplemented by laws to protect the greenery.",
              "In 1971, the Trees and Plants Act was enacted to protect existing and newly planted trees.",
              "The legislation was expanded in 1975 to mandate that developers had to set aside green spaces around buildings, roads and open-air car parks.",
              "Today, the laws that protect nature include the Parks and Trees Act (2005), the Animals and Birds Act (2002), and the Wildlife Act (2000).",
              "These are administered by NParks.",
              "28 From the 1990s, the a\u0302\u0080\u009cGarden Citya\u0302\u0080\u009d vision went beyond planting trees and building parks to include ways to bring the community closer to nature.",
              "This shift was sketched out in the 1991 Concept Plan by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) which aimed to transform Singapore into an island city where nature, waterbodies and urban development are woven seamlessly together.",
              "One of the first initiatives taken by NParks was the introduction of the Park Connector Network (PCN) in 1991.",
              "These are green corridors that allow park users to walk, skate, jog, or cycle from one park or nature site to another for leisure.",
              "29 The first park connector, completed in 1992, was the 7-kilometre stretch linking Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park to Kallang Riverside Park.",

              "The programme aims to create beautiful and clean streams, rivers and lakes with picturesque community spaces for all to enjoy.",
              "30 As Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted when he launched the programme: a\u0302\u0080\u009cBy linking up our water bodies and waterways, we will create new community spaces that are clean, pleasant, and bustling with life and activities.",
              "a\u0302\u0080\u009d31 A prime example is the transformation of a stretch of the Kallang River that was once a concrete canal by the edge of the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park into a naturalised and meandering river in 2012.",
              "The river is now home to different species of water birds and dragonflies.",

              "This early failure in the global race to net zero emissions (a balance between CO2 emitted and absorbed) may foreshadow backtracking by other target-setters, indicating that pledges to cease contributing to climate change demand greater scrutiny.",
              "Since 2012, when Copenhagen launched its plan to become the first carbon-neutral city in the world by 2025, the city has enjoyed international recognition and a significant branding boost.",

              "Instead, in 2012 Copenhagen\u2019s net zero plan relied on the expectation of reducing the energy-to-waste plant\u2019s emissions by recycling more plastic waste and increasing the ratio of organic waste (since it would count as carbon neutral).",
              "But when the third and final road map for Copenhagen\u2019s transition was presented in 2021, it included a shortfall of 430,000 tonnes of CO2.",
              "Alongside other measures, CCS was \u2013 in line with new national policy \u2013 supposed to be installed at the plant to bridge the gap by cutting 390,000 tonnes of CO2.",
              "The utility managing the plant suggested the technology could capture up to 500,000 tonnes.",

              "These and other issues were reported to municipal leaders in Copenhagen as substantial risks to the 2025 goal.",
              "The second problem concerns the question of accountability.",

              "When the utility ARC first announced its plan to deploy CCS at its waste-to-energy plant in 2021, it counted on external funding and a supportive policy framework to do so.",
              "Now, the head of the city\u2019s technology and environment committee criticises national politicians for knowingly setting financial criteria which the utility cannot meet, hindering the city\u2019s road to climate neutrality.",

              "Rail systems, including heavy rail, metro rail, and light rail transit, have usually been offered as popular options to achieve the goal of developing good public transit (Hensher & Golob, 2008);",
              "however, creating a road-based public transit and making better use of bus systems are considered more affordable and achievable options, especially in developing countries and cities (Hensher & Golob, 2008;",
              "Pojani & Stead, 2015).",
              "Moreover, in many cases and for most residents, road-based public transit is the only way to access jobs, education, health care, and other public services (Pojani & Stead, 2015).",
              "However, the literature discusses that in many cities worldwide, the conditions of the road-based public transit services are inadequate to serve their populations\u2019 mobility needs.",
              "Especially regarding bus services are often considered unreliable, uncomfortable, inconvenient, and even dangerous (Pojani & Stead, 2015).",
              "Therefore, in recent decades, policymakers and planners have introduced some achievable and low-cost strategies, such as painting specific lines on roads allocated for bus use, to enhance the quality of bus services.",
              "These low-cost strategies can be combined with technological advances, such as lights automatically turning red for other vehicles and green for buses to give priority to buses and improve the quality of the bus services.",
              "Overall, governments have enhanced and expanded BRT systems. However, some BRT systems have not improved transit efficiency, partly because they lack separated or dedicated lanes (Pojani & Stead, 2015).",
              "Therefore, a more practical and effective intervention regarding the bus system has been introduced, which offers the construction of bus lanes separated from other lanes by ng barriers, cones, or different physical features.",
              "These separated lanes are either located on the curbside or in the middle of a roadway and are exclusively for the use of public transit (Pojani & Stead, 2015).",
              "This system is called bus rapid transit (BRT).",
              "This bus-based mass transit is an attractive alternative to rail transit that has been progressively emerging in the last couple of decades in both loping and developed countries (Hensher & Golob, 2008;",

              "Full BRT is considered a more suitable option for larger cities since it can move up to 45,000 passengers per hour per direction, even more than many rail services deliver (Pojani & Stead, 2015).",
              "The following image (Table 8.",

              "Thus, considering that the BRT system in Bogota has been known for its success, it is unfortunate to recognize that it has failed to serve the poor and underserved population in Bogota specifically.",
