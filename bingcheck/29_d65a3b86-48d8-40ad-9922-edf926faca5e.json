    "query": "What was the inspiration behind the iconic song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by the band Queen?",
    "response": "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, released as the lead single from their fourth album, A Night at the Opera (1975). It was written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, who referred to it as a \"mock opera\" that resulted from the combination of three songs he had written[^2^]. The song is a six-minute suite that consists of several sections: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda[^2^]. It is one of the few progressive rock songs of the 1970s to achieve widespread commercial success and appeal to a mainstream audience[^2^].\n\nThe inspiration behind the song is not very clear, as Mercury was reluctant to explain the meaning behind the lyrics and simply claimed it was about relationships[^4^]. Some have speculated that the song was Mercury's way of expressing his psychological warfare with his bisexuality[^3^], while others have suggested that it was influenced by his personal life, his love of opera, or his fascination with literature and mythology[^5^]. The song parodies elements of opera with bombastic choruses, sarcastic recitative, and distorted Italian operatic phrases. Lyrical references include Scaramouche, the fandango, Galileo Galilei, Figaro, and Beelzebub, with cries of \"Bismillah!\"[^2^].\n\nThe song was recorded by Queen and co-producer Roy Thomas Baker at five studios between August and September 1975[^2^]. Due to recording logistics of the era, the band had to bounce the tracks across eight generations of 24-track tape, meaning that they required nearly 200 tracks for overdubs[^2^]. The song became regarded as one of the greatest rock songs of all time and is often regarded as the band's signature song[^2^]. The promotional video is credited with furthering the development of the music video medium[^2^]. It has appeared in numerous polls of the greatest songs in popular music[^2^], including a ranking at number 17 on Rolling Stone's list of \"the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".",

              "There's no denying that it's devilishly clever, encompassing everything from bits of operatic harmonies to snatches that sound like Sparks and David Cassidy, but, in the end the whole adds up to less than the sum of its parts.\"",
              "He did, however, say that it was \"unthinkable\" that it wouldn't be a hit.",
              "[65] The most positive review came from Sounds, which called it \"impossibly disjointed and complex, but a dazzlingly clever epic from the fevered mind of Freddie Mercury\".",
              "[66] Cash Box called it \"a softly sung ode to the prospect of moving on from staid ways\" with \"good singing\" and \"good production.\"",
              "[67] Record World called it \"a majestic vocal performance that takes on operatic proportions.\"",
              "[68] In 1976, when asked for his opinion on \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson praised the song as \"the most competitive thing that's come along in ages\" and \"a fulfillment and an answer to a teenage prayer\u2014of artistic music\".",
              "[69] Producer Steve Levine said the track broke \"all sonic production barriers\" in a fashion similar to the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" (1966), which also consisted of disparate music sections recorded separately,[70] Phil Spector's \"Be My Baby\" (1963), and 10cc's \"I'm Not in Love\" (1975).",
              "[71] Greg Lake, whose song \"I Believe in Father Christmas\" was kept from number one in the UK by \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" when it was released in 1975, acknowledged that he was \"beaten by one of the greatest records ever made\", describing it as \"a once-in-a-lifetime recording\".",
              "[72] Addressing the song's enduring popularity, author and music lecturer Jochen Eisentraut wrote in 2012: \"A year before punk made it unfashionable, progressive rock had an astounding success with the theoretically over-length (nearly 6-minute) single 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which bore many of the hallmarks of the 'prog' genre\".",
              "He said it was \"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\", it was \"more accessible than other music of the genre\" and was \"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\".",
              "[6] Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \"remarkable\" single and said it \"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\", suggesting the song \"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\".",
              "[62] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide described it as \"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted novelty song ever recorded\".",
              "[73] Writing for the BBC in 2015, the Chicago Tribune's music critic Greg Kot called it a \"prog-rock pocket operetta\" and said the song's \"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude\u2014one that has resonated across generations\".",
              "[26] In 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\": The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975.",
              "That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense.",
              "It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart.",
              "And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.",
              "[5] A comparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist.",
              "They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\".",
              "They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".",
              "[28] In 2015, The Economist described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".",
              "It wrote \"though Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and the Beatles' Paul McCartney had experimented with symphonic elements, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Pete Townshend of the Who had created narrative albums with distinct 'movements', none had had the audacity to import a miniature opera into rock music.\"",
              "[29] In 1992, the song enjoyed renewed popularity in the United States after being featured in a scene in the film Wayne's World, in which the titular character and his friends headbang in a car to the rock part near the end of the song.",
              "[74] The film's director, Penelope Spheeris, was hesitant to use the song, as it did not entirely fit with the lead characters, who were fans of less flamboyant hard rock and heavy metal.",
              "Mike Myers insisted that the song fit the scene.",
              "[75] According to music scholar Theodore Gracyk, by 1992, when the film was released, even \"classic rock\" stations had stopped playing the almost six-minute song.",

              "[76] Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.",
              "[77] In connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band.",
              "Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from Wayne's World with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band.",
              "He said, \"they've just whizzed on a Picasso.\"",
              "He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea and that he apologised to them.",
              "The band, though, sent a reply simply saying, \"Thank you for using our song.\"",
              "This astonished Myers, who responded, \"Thank you for even letting me touch the hem of your garments!\"",
              "[78] The Wayne's World video version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" won Queen its only MTV Video Music Award for \"Best Video from a Film\".",
              "[79] When remaining members Brian May and Roger Taylor took the stage to accept the award, Brian May was overcome with emotion and said that \"Freddie would be tickled.\"",

              "In the 2018 Queen biopic feature film Bohemian Rhapsody, Myers makes a cameo as a fictional record executive who pans the song and refuses to release it as a single, proclaiming that it is too long for radio and that it is not a song that \"teenagers can crank up the volume in their car and bang their heads to\", a reference to the aforementioned scene in Wayne's World.",

              "We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in.",

              "A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 21 November 1975 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States.",
              "Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was reportedly the most expensive album ever recorded at the time of its release.",
              "[1] Named after the Marx Brothers' film of the same name, A Night at the Opera was recorded at various studios across a four-month period in 1975.",
              "Due to management issues, Queen had received almost none of the money they earned for their previous albums. Subsequently, they ended their contract with Trident Studios and did not use their studios for the album (the sole exception being \"God Save the Queen\", which had been recorded the previous year).",
              "They employed a complex production that extensively used multitrack recording, and the songs incorporated a wide range of styles, such as ballads, music hall, dixieland, hard rock and progressive rock influences.",
              "Aside from their usual equipment, Queen also utilised a diverse range of instruments such as a double bass, harp, ukulele and more.",
              "Upon release, A Night at the Opera topped the UK Albums Chart for four non-consecutive weeks.",
              "It peaked at number four on the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart and became the band's first platinum-certified album in the US.",
              "It also produced the band's most successful single in the UK, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which became their first UK number one.",
              "Despite being twice as long as the average length of singles during the 1970s, the song became immensely popular worldwide.",
              "Contemporary reviews for A Night at the Opera were mixed, with praise for its production and the diverse musical themes, and recognition as the album that established Queen as worldwide superstars.",
              "At the 19th Grammy Awards, its first single \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" received Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus and Best Arrangement for Voices.",
              "[2] It has been hailed as Queen's best album, and one of the greatest albums of all time.",
              "In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked it at number 128 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.",
              "[3] In 2018, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
              "\"We had made hit records but we hadn't had any of the money back and if A Night at the Opera hadn't been a huge success I think we would have just disappeared under the ocean someplace.",
              "So we were making this album knowing it was live or die.\"",
              "-Brian May, 1990[4] Queen's previous album, Sheer Heart Attack (1974), had obtained commercial success and brought the band mainstream attention, with the single \"Killer Queen\" reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart.",
              "[5] The album was a minor hit in the US, reaching number twelve, while \"Killer Queen\" hit the top 20.",
              "[6] Despite this success, the band was broke at the time, largely due to a contract they had signed which meant that they would produce albums for a production company, who would then sell the album to a record label.",
              "[7] This meant that Queen saw almost none of the money they earned, as Trident Studios paid them \u00a360 weekly.",
              "[8][9] Guitarist Brian May was living in a bedsit in Earls Court, West London while frontman Freddie Mercury lived in a flat in Kensington that suffered from rising damp.",
              "[10] The matter eventually reached a turning point when bassist John Deacon, who had recently married, was denied a cash advance of \u00a34,000 by manager Norman Sheffield to put a deposit on a house.",
              "[8][11][12] This increasing frustration led to Mercury writing the song \"Death on Two Legs\", which would serve as the opening track to A Night at the Opera.",
              "[13] In December 1974, the band hired Jim Beach as their lawyer and began negotiating their way out of Trident.",
              "[14][nb 1] While Beach studied the group's contracts, the group continued touring.",
              "They began their first tour of Japan in April 1975, where thousands of fans met them at Haneda Airport and they played two sold out shows at the Nippon Budokan, Tokyo.",
              "[15] After a nine-month dispute, Queen were finally free of Trident and signed directly with EMI Records in the UK and Elektra Records in North America.",
              "They regained control of their back catalogue, while their former publishing company, Feldman, was taken over by EMI.",
              "[8] Because Trident had invested over \u00a3200,000 in promoting Queen, the group were required to pay half that to buy out their contracts, and they had to give Trident 1% royalties from their next six albums.[8][16] Additionally, a tour of America scheduled for September 1975 had to be cancelled as it had been organised by Jack Nelson, who was associated with Trident, despite the already booked venues and sold tickets.",
              "This tour was necessary for regaining funds, and its cancellation was a major setback.",
              "[14][17][nb 2] With funds running low, Queen immediately began searching for new management.",
              "Three names were shortlisted: Peter Rudge, Peter Grant, who was then Led Zeppelin's manager, and John Reid, who was Elton John's manager at the time.",
              "Rudge was on tour with the Rolling Stones and could not be reached, so they contacted Grant.",
              "[14] Grant, who was eager to manage Queen, had intended the band would sign with Swan Song, Led Zeppelin's label, and suggested Queen go on tour while he sorted out their finances.",
              "[14] The group feared Grant would prioritise Led Zeppelin over them, and were reluctant to sign with Swan Song, so they contacted Reid.",
              "[18] Reid was initially doubtful about managing another band;",
              "however, he accepted after learning it was Queen, and advised the group to \"go into the studio and make the best record you can\".",
              "[14][19] \"I do enjoy the studio, yes.",
              "It's the most strenuous part of my career.",
              "It's so exhausting, mentally and physically.",
              "It drains you dry.",
              "I sometimes ask myself why I do it.",
              "After Sheer Heart Attack we were insane and said never again.",
              "And then look what happens!\"",
              "-Freddie Mercury[20] Queen worked with producer Roy Thomas Baker, who had also split from Trident, and engineer Mike Stone.",
              "It was the last time they would work with Baker until 1978's Jazz.",
              "[21][22] Gary Langan, then 19 years old and who had been a tape operator on two of Sheer Heart Attack's songs, was promoted to an assistant engineer on the album.",
              "[22][23] It was reportedly the most expensive album ever made at the time, with the estimated cost being \u00a340,000 (equivalent to \u00a3357,000 in 2023).",
              "[24][25][26] The album was recorded at seven different studios over a period of four months.",
              "Queen spent a month during the summer of 1975 rehearsing in a barn at what would become Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey.",
              "[27] The group then had a three-week writing and rehearsing session in a rented house near Kington, Herefordshire before recording began.",
              "[28][nb 3] From August to September 1975, the group worked at Rockfield in Monmouthshire.",
              "For the remainder of recording sessions, which lasted until November, the group recorded at Lansdowne, Sarm Studios, Roundhouse, Scorpio Sound and Olympic Sound Studios.",
              "As their deal with Trident had ended, Trident Studios was not used during recording.",
              "The only song on the album recorded at Trident was \"God Save the Queen\", which had been recorded on 27 October the previous year, shortly before the band embarked on their Sheer Heart Attack Tour.",
              "[30][31] The group required multi-tracking for their complex vocal harmonies which typically consisted of May singing lower registers, Mercury singing middle registers and Taylor performing the higher parts (Deacon did not sing).",
              "Unlike their first three albums, which had used 16-track tape, A Night at the Opera was recorded using 24-track tape.",
              "[22] Their vocal harmonies are particularly notable on the song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which features an elaborate opera sequence dominated by multitracked vocals.",
              "[32] Similarly, \"The Prophet's Song\" has an a capella middle section that utilises delay on Mercury's vocals.",
              "For their self-titled \"guitar orchestrations\", May overdubbed his homemade Red Special guitar through an amplifier built by Deacon, known as the Deacy Amp, later released commercially as the \"Brian May\" amplifier by Vox.",
              "Guitar layering is one of May's distinctive techniques as a rock guitarist.",
              "He has said that the technique was developed whilst looking for a violin sound.",
              "[citation needed] Aside from their usual equipment, the group used various instruments on the album.",
              "Mercury used a grand piano for most of the songs, contributing a jangle piano on \"Seaside Rendezvous\", while Taylor used a timpani and gong on \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".",
              "Deacon played double bass on \"'39\"[31] and Wurlitzer Electric Piano on \"You're My Best Friend\".",
              "[33] In the album liner notes, May was credited to \"orchestral backdrops\" \u2013 a reference to the fact that he played a number of instruments not typically found in Queen songs.",
              "[30] He played an acoustic guitar on \"Love of My Life\" and \"'39\", as well a harp on \"Love of My Life\", and a toy koto on \"The Prophet's Song\".",
              "The song \"Good Company\" also features May recreating a Dixieland jazz band, which was done on his Red Special.",
              "[31][34] The album has been affiliated with progressive rock,[35][36] pop,[36] heavy metal,[36] hard rock[35] and avant-pop.",
              "[37] It contains a diverse range of influences including folk, skiffle, British camp and music hall, jazz and opera.",
              "[35][38] Each member wrote at least one song: Mercury wrote five of the songs, May wrote four, and Taylor and Deacon wrote one song each.",
              "[39] The closing track was an instrumental cover of \"God Save the Queen\", the British national anthem, for which May was credited as the arranger.",
              "For their first two albums, much of Queen's songwriting combined contemporary progressive rock and heavy metal, which led to a \"Led Zeppelin meets Yes\" description of the band.",
              "[40][41] However, starting with Sheer Heart Attack, Queen began drawing inspiration from their everyday lives, and embraced more mainstream musical styles,[42] a trend which A Night at the Opera would continue.",
              "Lyrical themes ranged from science fiction and fantasy to heartbreak and romance,[43] often with a tongue in cheek sense of humour.",
              "[35][43] The Winnipeg Free Press noted that the group blended \"clever, often poignant lyrics with attractively-arranged melodies\".",
              "[44] \"Death on Two Legs\" is considered to be Mercury's hate letter to Queen's first manager, Norman Sheffield, who for some years was reputed to have mistreated the band and abused his role as their manager from 1972 to 1975.",
              "The lyrics refer to \"blood-sucking leeches\" and \"decaying sewer rats\".",
              "[33] Though the song never makes direct reference to him, after listening to a playback of the song at Trident Studios around the time of the album's release, Sheffield sued the band and the record label for defamation, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement, but also confirmed his connection to the song.",
              "[45] Executives at EMI were unsure that the song was a good idea, May was unsure about the lyrics and felt bad that Mercury was singing it, but ultimately realised it was the songwriter's final choice as to what should be sung.",
              "[33] As with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", most of the guitar parts on this song were initially played on piano by Mercury, to demonstrate to May how they needed to be played on guitar.",
              "[citation needed] During live performances, Mercury would usually rededicate the song to \"a real motherfucker of a gentleman\", although this line was censored on the version that appeared on their Live Killers album in 1979.",
              "Other than on the live album, he said it was dedicated to a \"motherfucker I used to know\".",
              "\"Death on Two Legs\" remained on the setlist until, and well into, The Game Tour in 1981, and was then dropped.",
              "However, the piano introduction was played occasionally during the Hot Space and Works tours.",
              "[citation needed] \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\" is another song by Mercury.",
              "He played piano and performed all of the vocals.",
              "The lead vocal was sung in the studio and reproduced through headphones in a tin bucket elsewhere in the studio.",
              "A microphone picked up the sound from the bucket, which gives it a hollow \"megaphone\" sound.",
              "The guitar solo is also reported to have been recorded on the vocal track, as there were no more tracks to record on, as explained by producer Roy Thomas Baker during the Classic Albums documentary.",
              "\"I'm in Love with My Car\" was written and sung by Taylor.",
              "[46] The song was initially taken as a joke by May, who thought that Taylor was not serious when he heard a demo recording.",
              "Taylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later re-recorded by May on his Red Special.",
              "The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio version, and all released live versions.",
              "[47] The revving sounds at the conclusion of the song were recorded by Taylor's then current car, an Alfa Romeo.",
              "[46] The lyrics were inspired by one of the band's roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose Triumph TR4 was evidently the \"love of his life\".",
              "The song is dedicated to him, with the album saying: \"Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy racer to the end\".",
              "[46] When it came down to releasing the album's first single, Taylor was so fond of his song that he urged Mercury, the writer of the first single, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", to allow it to be the B-side.",
              "[48] This decision would later become the cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the B-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the A-side did for Mercury.",
              "[46] The song was often played live during the 1977\u20131981 period.",
              "Taylor sang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals.",
              "It was played in the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005 and the Rock the Cosmos Tour in 2008.",
              "Taylor would again play the song for his concerts with The Cross and solo tours, where instead of drums he played rhythm guitar.",
              "\"You're My Best Friend\" was the second song and first Queen single to be written by John Deacon.",
              "[33] He composed it while he was learning to play piano, and played the Wurlitzer electric piano (which Mercury disliked) on the recording and overdubbed the bass guitar afterwards.",
              "The song was written for his wife, Veronica.",
              "[49][50] It was released as the album's second single after \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and was also a top 10 hit in the UK, reaching number 7.",
              "[51] \"'39\" was May's attempt to do \"sci-fi skiffle\", inspired by the poet and novelist Hermann Hesse.",
              "It relates the tale of a group of space explorers who embark on what is, from their perspective, a year-long voyage.",
              "Upon their return, however, they realise that a hundred years have passed, because of the time dilation effect in Einstein's theory of relativity, and the loved ones they left behind are now all dead or aged.",
              "[46] May sings the song on the album, with backing vocals by Mercury and Taylor.",
              "During live performances, Mercury sang the lead vocal.",
              "[52] May had asked Deacon to play double bass as a joke but a couple of days later he found Deacon in the studio with the instrument, and he had already learned to play it.",
              "[53] George Michael performed \"'39\" at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert on 20 April 1992.",
              "[54] Michael cited this song as his favourite Queen song, claiming he used to busk it on the London Underground.",
              "[55] Recently, Queen have included the song on the setlists of their recent tours with Adam Lambert[56] and before Lambert with Paul Rodgers;",
              "[57] for all these tours since 2005 it is sung, as it is on the album, by May.",
              "\"Sweet Lady\" is a fast rocker written by May.",
              "[46] The song is an unusual rock style in 34 meter (which gives way to 44 at the bridge).",
              "\"Seaside Rendezvous\", written by Mercury, has a mock-instrumental bridge section which begins at around 0:51 into the song.",
              "The section is performed entirely by Mercury and Taylor using their voices alone.",
              "Mercury imitates woodwind instruments including a clarinet and Taylor mostly brass instruments, including tubas and trumpets, and even a kazoo;",
              "during this section Taylor hits the highest note on the album, C6.",
              "The \"tap dance\" segment is performed by Mercury and Taylor on the mixing desk with thimbles on their fingers.",
              "Mercury plays both grand piano and jangle honky-tonk.",
              "\"The Prophet's Song\" was composed by May.",
              "He explained that he wrote the song after a dream he had had about The Great Flood and his fears about the human race and its general lack of empathy.",
              "[46] He spent several days assembling the song, and it includes a vocal canon sung by Mercury.",
              "The vocal, and later instrumental canon was produced by early tape delay devices.",
              "[citation needed] Over eight minutes long, it is also Queen's longest studio song.",
              "[46] The speed-up effect that happens in the middle of the guitar solo was achieved by starting a reel-to-reel player with the tape on it, as the original tape player was stopped.",
              "\"Love of My Life\" is one of Queen's most covered songs (there have been versions by many acts like Extreme featuring May, Scorpions and Elaine Paige).",
              "Mercury played piano (including a classical solo) and sang all vocals, including multi-tracked harmonies.",
              "May played harp (doing it chord by chord and pasting the takes to form the entire part), Gibson Hummingbird acoustic guitar (which he had bought in Japan) and his Red Special.",
              "May eventually arranged the song so it could be played on an acoustic 12 string for live performances.",
              "\"Love of My Life\" was such a concert favourite that Mercury frequently stopped singing and allowed the audience to take over.",
              "It was especially well received during concerts in South America, and the band released the song as a single there.",
              "When Queen and Paul Rodgers performed the song (specifically Brian solo) he sang almost none of the words and let the audience sing it all, continuing the tradition.",
              "When Queen and Adam Lambert performed it, Brian would play along to a projection of Freddie singing.",
              "When they performed with Paul Rodgers during 2004\u20132008, Mercury was also projected during the show, but not in a round display as they use with Adam Lambert.",
              "\"Good Company\" was written and sung by May, who sings all vocals and plays ukulele.",
              "The recording features a recreation of a Dixieland-style jazz band using May's Red Special guitar and Deacy Amp.",
              "May composed the song on his father's banjo ukulele, but recorded the song with a regular ukulele.",
              "[58] Mercury was not involved with the song's recording, making it one of the few Queen songs not to feature their lead singer.",
              "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was written by Mercury with the first guitar solo composed by May.",
              "All piano, bass and drum parts, as well as the vocal arrangements, were thought up by Mercury on a daily basis and written down \"in blocks\" (using note names instead of sheets) on a phonebook.",
              "During the recording, the song became affectionately known as \"Fred's Thing\" to the band, and the title only emerged during the final sessions.",
              "The other members recorded their respective instruments with no concept of how their tracks would be utilised in the final mix.",
              "The operatic section was originally intended to be only a short interlude of \"Galileos\" that connected the ballad and hard rock portions of the song.",
              "The interlude is full of \"obscure classical characters: Scaramouche, a clown from the Commedia dell'arte;",

              "[59] Despite being twice as long as the average single in 1975 and garnering mixed critical reviews initially, the song became immensely popular, topping charts worldwide (where it remained for a then unprecedented nine weeks in the UK) and is widely regarded as one of the greatest songs in music history.",
              "[60] The song was rereleased as a double A-side to \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" on 5 September 1991, Mercury's 45th birthday, in the US and on 9 December 1991, after Mercury's death, in the UK.",

              "He played a guide piano which was edited out later and added several layers of guitars.",

              "The intensity continues to build, but once the bass line completes its descent establishing modulation to the new key (A major), the entire band cuts out abruptly at 3:03 except for quiet, staccato A major quaver (eighth-note) chords on the piano, marking the start of the \"Opera\" section.",
              "A rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell.",

              "The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs.",
              "These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes.",

              "[26] In 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\": The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975.",
              "That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense.",

              "They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\".",

              "[26] In 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\": The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975.",
              "That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense.",
              "It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart.",
              "And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.",
              "[5] A comparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist.",
              "They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\".",
              "They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".",
              "[28] In 2015, The Economist described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".",
              "It wrote \"though Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and the Beatles' Paul McCartney had experimented with symphonic elements, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Pete Townshend of the Who had created narrative albums with distinct 'movements', none had had the audacity to import a miniature opera into rock music.\"",
              "[29] In 1992, the song enjoyed renewed popularity in the United States after being featured in a scene in the film Wayne's World, in which the titular character and his friends headbang in a car to the rock part near the end of the song.",
              "[74] The film's director, Penelope Spheeris, was hesitant to use the song, as it did not entirely fit with the lead characters, who were fans of less flamboyant hard rock and heavy metal.",
              "Mike Myers insisted that the song fit the scene.",
              "[75] According to music scholar Theodore Gracyk, by 1992, when the film was released, even \"classic rock\" stations had stopped playing the almost six-minute song.",

              "[76] Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.",
              "[77] In connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band.",
              "Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from Wayne's World with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band.",
              "He said, \"they've just whizzed on a Picasso.\"",
              "He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea and that he apologised to them.",
              "The band, though, sent a reply simply saying, \"Thank you for using our song.\"",
              "This astonished Myers, who responded, \"Thank you for even letting me touch the hem of your garments!\"",
              "[78] The Wayne's World video version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" won Queen its only MTV Video Music Award for \"Best Video from a Film\".",
              "[79] When remaining members Brian May and Roger Taylor took the stage to accept the award, Brian May was overcome with emotion and said that \"Freddie would be tickled.\"",
              "In the final scene of the video, a pose of the band from the video from the original \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" clip morphs into an identically posed 1985 photo, first featured in the \"One Vision\" video.",
              "In the 2018 Queen biopic feature film Bohemian Rhapsody, Myers makes a cameo as a fictional record executive who pans the song and refuses to release it as a single, proclaiming that it is too long for radio and that it is not a song that \"teenagers can crank up the volume in their car and bang their heads to\", a reference to the aforementioned scene in Wayne's World.",

              "[17] Although the song has become one of the most revered in popular music history,[62] the initial critical reaction was mixed.",
              "The UK music papers reacted with bemusement, recognising that the song was original and technically accomplished, but they mostly remained indifferent.",
              "Pete Erskine of NME observed that, \"It'll be interesting to see whether it'll be played in its entirety on the radio.",

              "there's scarcely a shred of a tune and certainly no one line to latch onto.",
              "There's no denying that it's devilishly clever, encompassing everything from bits of operatic harmonies to snatches that sound like Sparks and David Cassidy, but, in the end the whole adds up to less than the sum of its parts.\"",
              "He did, however, say that it was \"unthinkable\" that it wouldn't be a hit.",
              "[65] The most positive review came from Sounds, which called it \"impossibly disjointed and complex, but a dazzlingly clever epic from the fevered mind of Freddie Mercury\".",
              "[66] Cash Box called it \"a softly sung ode to the prospect of moving on from staid ways\" with \"good singing\" and \"good production.\"",
              "[67] Record World called it \"a majestic vocal performance that takes on operatic proportions.\"",
              "[68] In 1976, when asked for his opinion on \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson praised the song as \"the most competitive thing that's come along in ages\" and \"a fulfillment and an answer to a teenage prayer\u2014of artistic music\".",
              "[69] Producer Steve Levine said the track broke \"all sonic production barriers\" in a fashion similar to the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" (1966), which also consisted of disparate music sections recorded separately,[70] Phil Spector's \"Be My Baby\" (1963), and 10cc's \"I'm Not in Love\" (1975).",
              "[71] Greg Lake, whose song \"I Believe in Father Christmas\" was kept from number one in the UK by \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" when it was released in 1975, acknowledged that he was \"beaten by one of the greatest records ever made\", describing it as \"a once-in-a-lifetime recording\".",
              "[72] Addressing the song's enduring popularity, author and music lecturer Jochen Eisentraut wrote in 2012: \"A year before punk made it unfashionable, progressive rock had an astounding success with the theoretically over-length (nearly 6-minute) single 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which bore many of the hallmarks of the 'prog' genre\".",
              "He said it was \"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\", it was \"more accessible than other music of the genre\" and was \"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\".",
              "[6] Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \"remarkable\" single and said it \"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\", suggesting the song \"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\".",
              "[62] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide described it as \"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted novelty song ever recorded\".",
              "[73] Writing for the BBC in 2015, the Chicago Tribune's music critic Greg Kot called it a \"prog-rock pocket operetta\" and said the song's \"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude\u2014one that has resonated across generations\".",
              "[26] In 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\": The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975.",
              "That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense.",
              "It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart.",
              "And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.",
              "[5] A comparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist.",
              "They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\".",
              "They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".",
              "[28] In 2015, The Economist described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".",
              "It wrote \"though Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and the Beatles' Paul McCartney had experimented with symphonic elements, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Pete Townshend of the Who had created narrative albums with distinct 'movements', none had had the audacity to import a miniature opera into rock music.\"",
              "[29] In 1992, the song enjoyed renewed popularity in the United States after being featured in a scene in the film Wayne's World, in which the titular character and his friends headbang in a car to the rock part near the end of the song.",
              "[74] The film's director, Penelope Spheeris, was hesitant to use the song, as it did not entirely fit with the lead characters, who were fans of less flamboyant hard rock and heavy metal.",
              "Mike Myers insisted that the song fit the scene.",
              "[75] According to music scholar Theodore Gracyk, by 1992, when the film was released, even \"classic rock\" stations had stopped playing the almost six-minute song.",
              "Gracyk suggests that beginning the tape in the middle of the song after \"the lyrics which provide the song's narrative .",

              "forces the film's audience to respond to its presence in the scene without the 'commentary' of the lyrics\".",
              "[76] Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.",
              "[77] In connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band.",
              "Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from Wayne's World with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band.",
              "He said, \"they've just whizzed on a Picasso.\"",
              "He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea and that he apologised to them.",
              "The band, though, sent a reply simply saying, \"Thank you for using our song.\"",
              "This astonished Myers, who responded, \"Thank you for even letting me touch the hem of your garments!\"",
              "[78] The Wayne's World video version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" won Queen its only MTV Video Music Award for \"Best Video from a Film\".",
              "[79] When remaining members Brian May and Roger Taylor took the stage to accept the award, Brian May was overcome with emotion and said that \"Freddie would be tickled.\"",
              "In the final scene of the video, a pose of the band from the video from the original \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" clip morphs into an identically posed 1985 photo, first featured in the \"One Vision\" video.",
              "In the 2018 Queen biopic feature film Bohemian Rhapsody, Myers makes a cameo as a fictional record executive who pans the song and refuses to release it as a single, proclaiming that it is too long for radio and that it is not a song that \"teenagers can crank up the volume in their car and bang their heads to\", a reference to the aforementioned scene in Wayne's World.",
              "[80] The song has won numerous awards and has been covered and parodied by many artists.",

              "[109] The band did not have enough of a break between the Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night.",

              "It's likely to be a hit of enormous proportions despite its length.\"",
              "[64] Ray Fox-Cumming of Record Mirror was also left unmoved, saying, \"It has no immediate selling point whatsoever: among its many parts.",
              "there's scarcely a shred of a tune and certainly no one line to latch onto.",
              "There's no denying that it's devilishly clever, encompassing everything from bits of operatic harmonies to snatches that sound like Sparks and David Cassidy, but, in the end the whole adds up to less than the sum of its parts.\"",
              "He did, however, say that it was \"unthinkable\" that it wouldn't be a hit.",
              "[65] The most positive review came from Sounds, which called it \"impossibly disjointed and complex, but a dazzlingly clever epic from the fevered mind of Freddie Mercury\".",
              "[66] Cash Box called it \"a softly sung ode to the prospect of moving on from staid ways\" with \"good singing\" and \"good production.\"",
              "[67] Record World called it \"a majestic vocal performance that takes on operatic proportions.\"",
              "[68] In 1976, when asked for his opinion on \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson praised the song as \"the most competitive thing that's come along in ages\" and \"a fulfillment and an answer to a teenage prayer\u2014of artistic music\".",
              "[69] Producer Steve Levine said the track broke \"all sonic production barriers\" in a fashion similar to the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" (1966), which also consisted of disparate music sections recorded separately,[70] Phil Spector's \"Be My Baby\" (1963), and 10cc's \"I'm Not in Love\" (1975).",
              "[71] Greg Lake, whose song \"I Believe in Father Christmas\" was kept from number one in the UK by \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" when it was released in 1975, acknowledged that he was \"beaten by one of the greatest records ever made\", describing it as \"a once-in-a-lifetime recording\".",
              "[72] Addressing the song's enduring popularity, author and music lecturer Jochen Eisentraut wrote in 2012: \"A year before punk made it unfashionable, progressive rock had an astounding success with the theoretically over-length (nearly 6-minute) single 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which bore many of the hallmarks of the 'prog' genre\".",
              "He said it was \"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\", it was \"more accessible than other music of the genre\" and was \"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\".",
              "[6] Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \"remarkable\" single and said it \"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\", suggesting the song \"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\".",
              "[62] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide described it as \"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted novelty song ever recorded\".",
              "[73] Writing for the BBC in 2015, the Chicago Tribune's music critic Greg Kot called it a \"prog-rock pocket operetta\" and said the song's \"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude\u2014one that has resonated across generations\".",
              "[26] In 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\": The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975.",
              "That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense.",
              "It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart.",
              "And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.",
              "[5] A comparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist.",
              "They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\".",
              "They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".",
              "[28] In 2015, The Economist described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".",
              "It wrote \"though Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and the Beatles' Paul McCartney had experimented with symphonic elements, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Pete Townshend of the Who had created narrative albums with distinct 'movements', none had had the audacity to import a miniature opera into rock music.\"",
              "[29] In 1992, the song enjoyed renewed popularity in the United States after being featured in a scene in the film Wayne's World, in which the titular character and his friends headbang in a car to the rock part near the end of the song.",
              "[74] The film's director, Penelope Spheeris, was hesitant to use the song, as it did not entirely fit with the lead characters, who were fans of less flamboyant hard rock and heavy metal.",
              "Mike Myers insisted that the song fit the scene.",
              "[75] According to music scholar Theodore Gracyk, by 1992, when the film was released, even \"classic rock\" stations had stopped playing the almost six-minute song.",
              "Gracyk suggests that beginning the tape in the middle of the song after \"the lyrics which provide the song's narrative .",

              "[76] Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.",
              "[77] In connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band.",
              "Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from Wayne's World with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band.",
              "He said, \"they've just whizzed on a Picasso.\"",
              "He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea and that he apologised to them.",
              "The band, though, sent a reply simply saying, \"Thank you for using our song.\"",
              "This astonished Myers, who responded, \"Thank you for even letting me touch the hem of your garments!\"",
              "[78] The Wayne's World video version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" won Queen its only MTV Video Music Award for \"Best Video from a Film\".",
              "[79] When remaining members Brian May and Roger Taylor took the stage to accept the award, Brian May was overcome with emotion and said that \"Freddie would be tickled.\"",
              "In the final scene of the video, a pose of the band from the video from the original \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" clip morphs into an identically posed 1985 photo, first featured in the \"One Vision\" video.",
              "In the 2018 Queen biopic feature film Bohemian Rhapsody, Myers makes a cameo as a fictional record executive who pans the song and refuses to release it as a single, proclaiming that it is too long for radio and that it is not a song that \"teenagers can crank up the volume in their car and bang their heads to\", a reference to the aforementioned scene in Wayne's World.",
              "[80] The song has won numerous awards and has been covered and parodied by many artists.",
              "At the 19th Annual Grammy Awards in February 1977, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus and Best Arrangement for Voices.",
              "[81][82] In October 1977, only two years after its release, the British Phonographic Industry named \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as the best British single of the period 1952\u201377.",

              "[108] Initially following the song's release, the operatic middle section proved a problem for the band.",
              "Because of extensive multi-tracking, it could not be performed on stage.",
              "[109] The band did not have enough of a break between the Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night.",
              "The opening and closing ballads were played as part of a medley, with \"Killer Queen\" and \"March of the Black Queen\" taking the place of the operatic and hard rock sections.",
              "In 1976 concerts where the same medley was played, the operatic section from the album would be played from tape as the introduction to the setlist.",
              "During this playback, Mercury would appear briefly to sing live for the line, \"I see a little sillhouetto of a man\".",
              "[110] As the song segued into the hard rock section, the band would emerge on the smoke-filled stage\u2014the playback would end at this point, and the hard rock section would be performed live (without the final ballad section, which appeared later in the set).",
              "Starting with the A Day at the Races Tour in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live.",
              "The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section.",
              "[109] Most playings of the opera section from the tape would often be accompanied by a portion of the song's music video containing the footage used for the operatic portion of the song.",

              "Recording began at Rockfield Studio 1 near Monmouth on August 24, 1975, after a 3\u2010week rehearsal period in Herefordshire.",

              "Vital to Queen's palette of sound was producer Roy Thomas Baker who, while at Decca and Trident Studios, had gained vast experience in rock, opera, and classical music.",
              "Baker had already produced Queen's first three albums (Queen, Queen II and Sheer Heart Attack) by the time Mercury casually previewed a new song called 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.",
              "Little did the producer realise that every ounce of his acquired expertise would be called upon in moulding this epic.",
              "Baker recalls his first hearing of the song: \"We were going out to dinner one night and I met Freddie at his apartment in Kensington.",
              "He sat down at his piano and said, 'I'd like to play you a song that I'm working on at the moment.'",
              "So he played the first part and said, 'This is the chord sequence', followed by the interim part, and although he didn't have all the lyrics together yet, I could tell it was going to be a ballady number.",
              "He played a bit further through the song and then stopped suddenly, saying, 'This is where the opera section comes in.'",
              "We both just burst out laughing.",
              "I had worked with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at Decca where I learned a lot about vocals and the way vocals are stressed, so I was probably one of the few people in the whole world who knew exactly what he was talking about.",
              "\"It was the first time that an opera section had been incorporated into a pop record, let alone a Number One.",
              "It was obviously very unusual and we originally planned to have just a couple of 'Galileos'.",
              "But things often have a habit of evolving differently once you're inside the studio, and it did get longer and bigger.",
              "The beginning section was pretty spot on and the end section was fairly similar, although we obviously embellished it with guitars and lots of overdubs.",
              "But the opera section ended up nothing like the original concept, because we kept changing it and adding things to it.\"",
              "Baker and Queen recorded the basic backing track in three sections at Kingsley Ward's Rockfield Studios, later transferring to Scorpion Studios in North London and SARM for work on the guitar overdubs and extensive vocals.",
              "\"The first half or ballad section was done with piano, drums and bass \u2014 the normal routine.",
              "We never really started the opera section at that point.",
              "We just left a 30\u2010second strip of tape on the reel for later use, not knowing that we would even overrun it.",
              "Then the end rock section was recorded as a separate song, in the way that we would normally record a loud rock number of that period.",
              "The thing that made it difficult was that even the end had lots of vocals on it (the 'Ooh yeah, ooh yeah' part), so we had to record the basic backing track of drums, bass, guitar and piano, then do the background vocals without having the lead vocal on first.",
              "That wasn't the regular way of doing things, because the lead vocal would normally dictate the phrasing of the background vocals.",
              "But we wouldn't have had enough tracks left for the rich backing vocals if we hadn't gone down this route.",
              "\"The opera bit was getting longer, and so we kept splicing huge lengths of tape on to the reel.",
              "Every time Freddie came up with another 'Galileo', I would add another piece of tape to the reel, which was beginning to look like a zebra crossing whizzing by!",
              "This went on over a three or four day period, while we decided on the length of the section.",
              "That section alone took about three weeks to record, which in 1975 was the average time spent on a whole album.",
              "\"We formed a 3\u2010part harmony by recording one harmony at a time and bouncing.",
              "So we did three tracks of the first part and bounced it to one track, three of the second, and three of the third.",
              "We would then double bounce to one section, so that particular phrase would have a 3\u2010part harmony just on one track.",
              "We would do this to each background vocal part across the song and ended up with fourth generation dupes on just one of the parts.",
              "By the time we mixed two of the other parts together, the first part was up to eight generations.",
              "This was before we wore out the master and began making 24\u2010track to 24\u2010track tape transfers.",
              "Once that had happened, the distortion factor on those vocals was very, very high.\"",
              "Although a project of this magnitude would understandably cause anxiety among many in Baker's position, the technical restraints of the era did not alarm him.",
              "\"If something had to be longer, we would just add extra tape.",
              "If we needed more tracks, we would track bounce to free some more room on the tape.",
              "The making of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was basically one continuous track bounce!\"",
              "Due to the complex nature of the recording, it is not surprising that the occasional vocal faux\u2010pas was noted by Baker's keen ears.",
              "He was not militaristic, however.",
              "\"There were a few harmonies that were a little dissident, such as two notes next to each other which weren't quite spot on in passing phrases.",
              "We left those there, because they weren't classed as mistakes.",
              "In classical music they are allowable, whereas in rock music they normally are not.",
              "But in passing phrases it seems to work OK.",
              "If there was anything we heard at the time which we thought we wouldn't get away with, we would just wipe it and re\u2010record it.",

              "\"We weren't into multiple snare miking back then, so there was just a single mic on the snare.",

              "The transformation between U67s or U87s was going on at that point and studios usually had one or the other.",

              "people would make them with a transformer sticking out of the end with wires going all over the place.",
              "There was always a slight sound loss when you plugged them into the amp, so we had to compensate for that.",
              "We also used an Electro\u2010Voice 666 and sometimes a Neumann U67 condenser on John's cabinet to pick up a bit of air.",

              "But, as ever, much experimentation was undertaken before Brian May's guitar sound was perfected.",
              "\"We used to have a few different types of mics set up, from which we would choose or blend signals for any one given sound, and it's a technique that I still use today.",
              "Brian's Vox AC30 amps were backless, so we also set up some mics behind them and near the wall, to capture some ambience and the full spectrum of the guitar sound.",
              "There was always a lot of experimentation going on during our sessions.",
              "Brian generally used AC30s but John Deacon had also thrown together something like a Tandy Radio Shack speaker with a 3 Watt amplifier, and we tried that with a treble booster.",
              "We tried putting microphones down metal and concrete tubes to get more of a honky sound, and it all seemed to work.",

              "While the first three Queen albums had been recorded on 16\u2010track equipment, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' benefitted from 24\u2010track technology, although not without a few problems. \"We found that the different 24\u2010track machines we used had different formats, but we managed to compensate for that.",

              "So he played the first part and said, 'This is the chord sequence', followed by the interim part, and although he didn't have all the lyrics together yet, I could tell it was going to be a ballady number.",
              "He played a bit further through the song and then stopped suddenly, saying, 'This is where the opera section comes in.'",
              "We both just burst out laughing.",
              "I had worked with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at Decca where I learned a lot about vocals and the way vocals are stressed, so I was probably one of the few people in the whole world who knew exactly what he was talking about.",
              "\"It was the first time that an opera section had been incorporated into a pop record, let alone a Number One.",
              "It was obviously very unusual and we originally planned to have just a couple of 'Galileos'.",
              "But things often have a habit of evolving differently once you're inside the studio, and it did get longer and bigger.",
              "The beginning section was pretty spot on and the end section was fairly similar, although we obviously embellished it with guitars and lots of overdubs.",
              "But the opera section ended up nothing like the original concept, because we kept changing it and adding things to it.\"",
              "Baker and Queen recorded the basic backing track in three sections at Kingsley Ward's Rockfield Studios, later transferring to Scorpion Studios in North London and SARM for work on the guitar overdubs and extensive vocals.",
              "\"The first half or ballad section was done with piano, drums and bass \u2014 the normal routine.",
              "We never really started the opera section at that point.",
              "We just left a 30\u2010second strip of tape on the reel for later use, not knowing that we would even overrun it.",
              "Then the end rock section was recorded as a separate song, in the way that we would normally record a loud rock number of that period.",
              "The thing that made it difficult was that even the end had lots of vocals on it (the 'Ooh yeah, ooh yeah' part), so we had to record the basic backing track of drums, bass, guitar and piano, then do the background vocals without having the lead vocal on first.",
              "That wasn't the regular way of doing things, because the lead vocal would normally dictate the phrasing of the background vocals.",
              "But we wouldn't have had enough tracks left for the rich backing vocals if we hadn't gone down this route.",
              "\"The opera bit was getting longer, and so we kept splicing huge lengths of tape on to the reel.",
              "Every time Freddie came up with another 'Galileo', I would add another piece of tape to the reel, which was beginning to look like a zebra crossing whizzing by!",
              "This went on over a three or four day period, while we decided on the length of the section.",
              "That section alone took about three weeks to record, which in 1975 was the average time spent on a whole album.",
              "\"We formed a 3\u2010part harmony by recording one harmony at a time and bouncing.",
              "So we did three tracks of the first part and bounced it to one track, three of the second, and three of the third.",
              "We would then double bounce to one section, so that particular phrase would have a 3\u2010part harmony just on one track.",
              "We would do this to each background vocal part across the song and ended up with fourth generation dupes on just one of the parts.",
              "By the time we mixed two of the other parts together, the first part was up to eight generations.",
              "This was before we wore out the master and began making 24\u2010track to 24\u2010track tape transfers.",
              "Once that had happened, the distortion factor on those vocals was very, very high.\"",
              "Although a project of this magnitude would understandably cause anxiety among many in Baker's position, the technical restraints of the era did not alarm him.",
              "\"If something had to be longer, we would just add extra tape.",
              "If we needed more tracks, we would track bounce to free some more room on the tape.",
              "The making of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was basically one continuous track bounce!\"",
              "Due to the complex nature of the recording, it is not surprising that the occasional vocal faux\u2010pas was noted by Baker's keen ears.",
              "He was not militaristic, however.",
              "\"There were a few harmonies that were a little dissident, such as two notes next to each other which weren't quite spot on in passing phrases.",
              "We left those there, because they weren't classed as mistakes.",
              "In classical music they are allowable, whereas in rock music they normally are not.",
              "But in passing phrases it seems to work OK.",
              "If there was anything we heard at the time which we thought we wouldn't get away with, we would just wipe it and re\u2010record it.",

              "\"We weren't into multiple snare miking back then, so there was just a single mic on the snare.",

              "The transformation between U67s or U87s was going on at that point and studios usually had one or the other.",
              "An AKG D12 was used on the bass drum.",
              "They were the days before the D112, which seems to be the standard now.",
              "John's bass was DI'd.",

              "people would make them with a transformer sticking out of the end with wires going all over the place.",
              "There was always a slight sound loss when you plugged them into the amp, so we had to compensate for that.",
              "We also used an Electro\u2010Voice 666 and sometimes a Neumann U67 condenser on John's cabinet to pick up a bit of air.",
              "\"Freddie's piano was miked with two Neumann U67s and we also set up a Shure mic for his guide vocal.",
              "He didn't sing all the way through the backing track takes, just the first couple of words of each line as a reference for the band.\"",
              "But, as ever, much experimentation was undertaken before Brian May's guitar sound was perfected.",
              "\"We used to have a few different types of mics set up, from which we would choose or blend signals for any one given sound, and it's a technique that I still use today.",
              "Brian's Vox AC30 amps were backless, so we also set up some mics behind them and near the wall, to capture some ambience and the full spectrum of the guitar sound.",
              "There was always a lot of experimentation going on during our sessions.",
              "Brian generally used AC30s but John Deacon had also thrown together something like a Tandy Radio Shack speaker with a 3 Watt amplifier, and we tried that with a treble booster.",
              "We tried putting microphones down metal and concrete tubes to get more of a honky sound, and it all seemed to work.",

              "While the first three Queen albums had been recorded on 16\u2010track equipment, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' benefitted from 24\u2010track technology, although not without a few problems. \"We found that the different 24\u2010track machines we used had different formats, but we managed to compensate for that.",

              "Unfortunately, there are no rough mixes around to audibly demonstrate how 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was created in stages.",
              "This can be attributed to Queen's paranoia of having unfinished recordings lying around the studio.",

              "If we hadn't produced certain effects by hand, nobody would have bothered to invent the box that did it automatically, and I'd like to think that a lot of the stuff we were doing in the '70s started trends and got copied later by machines.\"",

              "Due to recording logistics of the era, the band had to bounce the tracks across eight generations of 24-track tape, meaning that they required nearly 200 tracks for overdubs.",

              "[26] In 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\": The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975.",
              "That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense.",
              "It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart.",
              "And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.",
              "[5] A comparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist.",
              "They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\".",
              "They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".",
              "[28] In 2015, The Economist described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".",
              "It wrote \"though Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and the Beatles' Paul McCartney had experimented with symphonic elements, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Pete Townshend of the Who had created narrative albums with distinct 'movements', none had had the audacity to import a miniature opera into rock music.\"",
              "[29] In 1992, the song enjoyed renewed popularity in the United States after being featured in a scene in the film Wayne's World, in which the titular character and his friends headbang in a car to the rock part near the end of the song.",
              "[74] The film's director, Penelope Spheeris, was hesitant to use the song, as it did not entirely fit with the lead characters, who were fans of less flamboyant hard rock and heavy metal.",
              "Mike Myers insisted that the song fit the scene.",
              "[75] According to music scholar Theodore Gracyk, by 1992, when the film was released, even \"classic rock\" stations had stopped playing the almost six-minute song.",

              "Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from Wayne's World with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band.",

              "[109] The band did not have enough of a break between the Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night.",

              "Starting with the A Day at the Races Tour in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live.",
              "The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section.",

              "The answer to that was yes, and better still, we also already had pre-mixed stems from some of these masters, because we had reverse-engineered these original mixes in the past for other projects.",
              "To his surprise and delight, we then told him that we also have the multitracks of many live recordings, which meant that they also didn't have to re-record these.",

              "As we spoke, John became happier and happier, realising how much original Queen material could be used.",
              "He then asked us whether we could make stems of tracks where there weren't any, and again we said we could.",

              "Years ago, we started with the important stuff, the stereo quarter-inch masters of the albums, and copied them to other analogue formats, and then later we copied them to digital when we had that, and in 2002, when we got 192kHz, we also started copying the multitrack masters.\"",
              "Allerton Hill Studio is home to one of the last Studer A827 machines ever made.",

              "We bake analogue tapes as a matter of course, four days at 50 degrees C, and these tapes always play back without any problems on our Studer A827 24-track, which is one of the last ever made.",
              "I think it's called a Gold Edition.\"",
              "Fredriksson: \"The later Queen albums were recorded on two 24-tracks, so we're dealing with 48 tracks of audio.",
              "If you also copy all the out-take reels, you end up with a lot of material!",
              "Over the course of the '00s there was an initiative to create 5.",
              "1 mixes for every Queen song that has a promo video, and we also delivered Queen songs for several movies \u2014 for example, Blades Of Glory [2007] used the song 'Flash'.",
              "In all those cases we had to create digital stems of the songs, and this meant that we had to reverse-engineer the mixes.",
              "This involved first of all carefully going through everything to make sure that we used the correct takes and edits.\"",
              "Shirley-Smith: \"The guitar, and especially the vocals, might take up six or seven tracks, and sometimes the comps were done on the desk, so there wasn't a single track on the multitrack where you could say: 'This is the lead vocal comp.'",
              "In some of the cases where there was such a track, we would unpick it, creating the same comp again from earlier generations of tape, because on some songs they had been forced to bounce from one multitrack to another.",
              "So we'd go back one or two generations, and once we had the correct performances, re-comp them, and often also apply CEDAR audio restoration.\"",
              "Reverse-engineering the mixes didn't only involve retracing the often very complex overdubbing and editing steps taken by Roy Thomas Baker \u2014 and other Queen producers such as Reinhold Mack and David Richards \u2014 before compiling everything in a tidy Pro Tools session and restoring the audio.",
              "Macrae, Fredriksson and Shirley-Smith also had to remix these sessions, making their new in-the-box mixes sound exactly the same as the original analogue mixes.",
              "Fredriksson: \"Queen obviously put a lot of time into writing the songs, and then they arranged and rehearsed them before they went into the studio, after which they would record and overdub in incredible detail.",
              "Finally, there was the mixing process, which was a whole other performance in itself!",
              "They were all hands-on on the desk, and used every single trick in the book, vari-speeding things and just generally messing around with things in the mix.",
              "If you compare the naked tracks on the multitrack to the final mixes there often is a phenomenal difference.",
              "Plus a lot of these mixes were done in sections and then edited together.\"",
              "Shirley-Smith: \"In approximating their mixes, we had to look at where the song was mixed, what board was used, what outboard they had used, and so on, and this would give us a good starting point.",
              "We have the original stereo mix in the session and we then A/B that against the mix we are doing.",
              "It's a very painstaking process to achieve exactly the same mix, and then to print that in stem format.",
              "With later sessions there would be recall notes, but in the '70s and early '80s people were not doing that, although there would sometimes be an occasional EQ knob drawing on the back of some track sheets to give a bit of a clue.\"",
              "Macrae: \"Welcome to our world!",
              "Occasionally we would ask Brian or Roger if they remembered what went on, but of course, we've worked with them for such a long time that some of us were there at the original mixes.",

              "[67] Record World called it \"a majestic vocal performance that takes on operatic proportions.\"",
              "[68] In 1976, when asked for his opinion on \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson praised the song as \"the most competitive thing that's come along in ages\" and \"a fulfillment and an answer to a teenage prayer\u2014of artistic music\".",
              "[69] Producer Steve Levine said the track broke \"all sonic production barriers\" in a fashion similar to the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" (1966), which also consisted of disparate music sections recorded separately,[70] Phil Spector's \"Be My Baby\" (1963), and 10cc's \"I'm Not in Love\" (1975).",
              "[71] Greg Lake, whose song \"I Believe in Father Christmas\" was kept from number one in the UK by \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" when it was released in 1975, acknowledged that he was \"beaten by one of the greatest records ever made\", describing it as \"a once-in-a-lifetime recording\".",
              "[72] Addressing the song's enduring popularity, author and music lecturer Jochen Eisentraut wrote in 2012: \"A year before punk made it unfashionable, progressive rock had an astounding success with the theoretically over-length (nearly 6-minute) single 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which bore many of the hallmarks of the 'prog' genre\".",
              "He said it was \"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\", it was \"more accessible than other music of the genre\" and was \"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\".",
              "[6] Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \"remarkable\" single and said it \"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\", suggesting the song \"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\".",
              "[62] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide described it as \"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted novelty song ever recorded\".",
              "[73] Writing for the BBC in 2015, the Chicago Tribune's music critic Greg Kot called it a \"prog-rock pocket operetta\" and said the song's \"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude\u2014one that has resonated across generations\".",
              "[26] In 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\": The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975.",
              "That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense.",
              "It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart.",
              "And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.",
              "[5] A comparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist.",
              "They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\".",
              "They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".",
              "[28] In 2015, The Economist described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".",
              "It wrote \"though Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and the Beatles' Paul McCartney had experimented with symphonic elements, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Pete Townshend of the Who had created narrative albums with distinct 'movements', none had had the audacity to import a miniature opera into rock music.\"",
              "[29] In 1992, the song enjoyed renewed popularity in the United States after being featured in a scene in the film Wayne's World, in which the titular character and his friends headbang in a car to the rock part near the end of the song.",
              "[74] The film's director, Penelope Spheeris, was hesitant to use the song, as it did not entirely fit with the lead characters, who were fans of less flamboyant hard rock and heavy metal.",
              "Mike Myers insisted that the song fit the scene.",
              "[75] According to music scholar Theodore Gracyk, by 1992, when the film was released, even \"classic rock\" stations had stopped playing the almost six-minute song.",

              "[76] Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.",
              "[77] In connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band.",
              "Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from Wayne's World with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band.",
              "He said, \"they've just whizzed on a Picasso.\"",
              "He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea and that he apologised to them.",
              "The band, though, sent a reply simply saying, \"Thank you for using our song.\"",
              "This astonished Myers, who responded, \"Thank you for even letting me touch the hem of your garments!\"",

              "[69] Producer Steve Levine said the track broke \"all sonic production barriers\" in a fashion similar to the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" (1966), which also consisted of disparate music sections recorded separately,[70] Phil Spector's \"Be My Baby\" (1963), and 10cc's \"I'm Not in Love\" (1975).",
              "[71] Greg Lake, whose song \"I Believe in Father Christmas\" was kept from number one in the UK by \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" when it was released in 1975, acknowledged that he was \"beaten by one of the greatest records ever made\", describing it as \"a once-in-a-lifetime recording\".",
              "[72] Addressing the song's enduring popularity, author and music lecturer Jochen Eisentraut wrote in 2012: \"A year before punk made it unfashionable, progressive rock had an astounding success with the theoretically over-length (nearly 6-minute) single 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which bore many of the hallmarks of the 'prog' genre\".",
              "He said it was \"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\", it was \"more accessible than other music of the genre\" and was \"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\".",
              "[6] Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \"remarkable\" single and said it \"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\", suggesting the song \"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\".",
              "[62] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide described it as \"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted novelty song ever recorded\".",
              "[73] Writing for the BBC in 2015, the Chicago Tribune's music critic Greg Kot called it a \"prog-rock pocket operetta\" and said the song's \"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude\u2014one that has resonated across generations\".",
              "[26] In 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\": The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975.",
              "That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense.",
              "It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart.",
              "And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.",
              "[5] A comparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist.",
              "They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\".",
              "They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".",
              "[28] In 2015, The Economist described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".",
              "It wrote \"though Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and the Beatles' Paul McCartney had experimented with symphonic elements, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Pete Townshend of the Who had created narrative albums with distinct 'movements', none had had the audacity to import a miniature opera into rock music.\"",
              "[29] In 1992, the song enjoyed renewed popularity in the United States after being featured in a scene in the film Wayne's World, in which the titular character and his friends headbang in a car to the rock part near the end of the song.",
              "[74] The film's director, Penelope Spheeris, was hesitant to use the song, as it did not entirely fit with the lead characters, who were fans of less flamboyant hard rock and heavy metal.",
              "Mike Myers insisted that the song fit the scene.",
              "[75] According to music scholar Theodore Gracyk, by 1992, when the film was released, even \"classic rock\" stations had stopped playing the almost six-minute song.",
              "Gracyk suggests that beginning the tape in the middle of the song after \"the lyrics which provide the song's narrative .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "forces the film's audience to respond to its presence in the scene without the 'commentary' of the lyrics\".",
              "[76] Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.",
              "[77] In connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band.",
              "Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from Wayne's World with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band.",
              "He said, \"they've just whizzed on a Picasso.\"",
              "He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea and that he apologised to them.",
              "The band, though, sent a reply simply saying, \"Thank you for using our song.\"",
              "This astonished Myers, who responded, \"Thank you for even letting me touch the hem of your garments!\"",
              "[78] The Wayne's World video version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" won Queen its only MTV Video Music Award for \"Best Video from a Film\".",
              "[79] When remaining members Brian May and Roger Taylor took the stage to accept the award, Brian May was overcome with emotion and said that \"Freddie would be tickled.\"",
              "In the final scene of the video, a pose of the band from the video from the original \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" clip morphs into an identically posed 1985 photo, first featured in the \"One Vision\" video.",
              "In the 2018 Queen biopic feature film Bohemian Rhapsody, Myers makes a cameo as a fictional record executive who pans the song and refuses to release it as a single, proclaiming that it is too long for radio and that it is not a song that \"teenagers can crank up the volume in their car and bang their heads to\", a reference to the aforementioned scene in Wayne's World.",
              "[80] The song has won numerous awards and has been covered and parodied by many artists.",
              "At the 19th Annual Grammy Awards in February 1977, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus and Best Arrangement for Voices.",
              "[81][82] In October 1977, only two years after its release, the British Phonographic Industry named \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as the best British single of the period 1952\u201377.",
              "[76] It is a regular entry in greatest-songs polls, and it was named by the Guinness Book of Records in 2002 as the top British single of all time.",

              "[107] During their 1982 Hot Space Tour, and occasionally at other times, Mercury would do a piano improvisation (generally the introduction to \"Death on Two Legs\") that ended with the first notes of the song.",
              "Often, the preceding song would end, and Mercury would sit at the piano, say a quick word, and start playing the ballad section.",

              "[108] Initially following the song's release, the operatic middle section proved a problem for the band.",
              "Because of extensive multi-tracking, it could not be performed on stage.",
              "[109] The band did not have enough of a break between the Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night.",
              "The opening and closing ballads were played as part of a medley, with \"Killer Queen\" and \"March of the Black Queen\" taking the place of the operatic and hard rock sections.",
              "In 1976 concerts where the same medley was played, the operatic section from the album would be played from tape as the introduction to the setlist.",
              "During this playback, Mercury would appear briefly to sing live for the line, \"I see a little sillhouetto of a man\".",
              "[110] As the song segued into the hard rock section, the band would emerge on the smoke-filled stage\u2014the playback would end at this point, and the hard rock section would be performed live (without the final ballad section, which appeared later in the set).",
              "Starting with the A Day at the Races Tour in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live.",
              "The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section.",
              "[109] Most playings of the opera section from the tape would often be accompanied by a portion of the song's music video containing the footage used for the operatic portion of the song.",
