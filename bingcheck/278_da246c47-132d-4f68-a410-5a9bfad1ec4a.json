    "query": "What are the most effective strategies for mitigating the negative impact of social media use on mental health, and how can individuals incorporate these practices into their daily routines to promote their overall well-being?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Social media use can have both positive and negative effects on mental health and well-being, depending on how it's used and how much time is spent online. Some of the positive aspects of social media are that it can help you communicate and stay connected with family and friends, find new friends and communities, join or promote worthwhile causes, and learn new things[^1^]. However, some of the negative aspects of social media are that it can fuel feelings of addiction, anxiety, depression, isolation, and FOMO (fear of missing out)[^2^]. It can also lead to low quality sleep, low self-esteem, and even suicidal thoughts[^3^] [^4^].\n\nSome of the most effective strategies for mitigating the negative impact of social media use on mental health are[^2^]:\n\n- Reduce time online. Set a limit on how much time you spend on social media each day and stick to it. Turn off notifications, use apps that track your usage, or schedule phone-free periods during the day.\n- Change your focus. Instead of passively scrolling through your feed or comparing yourself to others, use social media actively and intentionally. Engage with people who inspire you, share positive content, or learn something new.\n- Spend more time with offline friends. Nothing beats face-to-face interaction for boosting your mood and well-being. Make an effort to meet up with your friends in person or join a club or group that interests you.\n- Express gratitude. Rather than focusing on what you lack or envy, practice gratitude for what you have and appreciate. You can write down three things you're grateful for each day, thank someone who helped you, or volunteer for a cause you care about.\n\nBy incorporating these practices into your daily routine, you can enjoy the benefits of social media without letting it harm your mental health and well-being.",

              "One study found that participation in chat rooms may contribute to worsening symptoms in young people with psychotic disorders (Mittal, Tessner, & Walker, 2007), while another study of patients with psychosis found that social media use appeared to predict low mood (Berry, Emsley, Lobban, & Bucci, 2018).",
              "These studies highlight a clear relationship between social media use and mental health that may not be present in general population studies (Orben & Przybylski, 2019), and emphasize the need to explore how social media may contribute to symptom severity and whether protective factors may be identified to mitigate these risks.",
              "Popular social media platforms can create potential situations where individuals may be victimized by negative comments or posts.",
              "Cyberbullying represents a form of online aggression directed towards specific individuals, such as peers or acquaintances, which is perceived to be most harmful when compared to random hostile comments posted online (Hamm et al.",
              ", 2015).",
              "Importantly, cyberbullying on social media consistently shows harmful impact on mental health in the form of increased depressive symptoms as well as worsening of anxiety symptoms, as evidenced in a review of 36 studies among children and young people (Hamm et al.",
              ", 2015).",
              "Furthermore, cyberbullying disproportionately impacts females as reflected in a national survey of adolescents in the United States, where females were twice as likely to be victims of cyberbullying compared to males (Alhajji, Bass, & Dai, 2019).",
              "Most studies report cross-sectional associations between cyberbullying and symptoms of depression or anxiety (Hamm et al.",
              ", 2015), though one longitudinal study in Switzerland found that cyberbullying contributed to significantly greater depression over time (Machmutow, Perren, Sticca, & Alsaker, 2012).",
              "For youth ages 10 to 17 who reported major depressive symptomatology, there was over 3 times greater odds of facing online harassment in the last year compared to youth who reported mild or no depressive symptoms (Ybarra, 2004).",
              "Similarly, in a 2018 national survey of young people, respondents ages 14 to 22 with moderate to severe depressive symptoms were more likely to have had negative experiences when using social media, and in particular, were more likely to report having faced hostile comments, or being \u201ctrolled\u201d, from others when compared to respondents without depressive symptoms (31% vs. 14%) (Rideout & Fox, 2018).",
              "As these studies depict risks for victimization on social media and the correlation with poor mental health, it is possible that individuals living with mental illness may also experience greater hostility online compared to individuals without mental illness.",
              "This would be consistent with research showing greater risk of hostility, including increased violence and discrimination, directed towards individuals living with mental illness in in-person contexts, especially targeted at those with severe mental illnesses (Goodman et al.",
              ", 1999).",
              "A computational study of mental health awareness campaigns on Twitter reported that while stigmatizing content was rare, it was actually the most spread (re-tweeted) demonstrating that harmful content can travel quickly on social media (Saha et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "Another study was able to map the spread of social media posts about the Blue Whale Challenge, an alleged game promoting suicide, over Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Tumblr and other forums across 127 countries (Sumner et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "These findings show that it is critical to monitor the actual content of social media posts, such as determining whether content is hostile or promotes harm to self or others.",
              "This is pertinent because existing research looking at duration of exposure cannot account for the impact of specific types of content on mental health and is insufficient to fully understand the effects of using these platforms on mental health.",
              "The ways in which individuals use social media can also impact their offline relationships and everyday activities.",
              "To date, reports have described risks of social media use pertaining to privacy, confidentiality, and unintended consequences of disclosing personal health information online (Torous & Keshavan, 2016).",
              "Additionally, concerns have been raised about poor quality or misleading health information shared on social media, and that social media users may not be aware of misleading information or conflicts of interest especially when the platforms promote popular content regardless of whether it is from a trustworthy source (Moorhead et al.",
              ", 2013;",
              "Ventola, 2014).",
              "For persons living with mental illness there may be additional risks from using social media.",
              "A recent study that specifically explored the perspectives of social media users with serious mental illnesses, including participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, or major depression, found that over one third of participants expressed concerns about privacy when using social media (Naslund & Aschbrenner, 2019).",
              "The reported risks of social media use were directly related to many aspects of everyday life, including concerns about threats to employment, fear of stigma and being judged, impact on personal relationships, and facing hostility or being hurt (Naslund & Aschbrenner, 2019).",
              "While few studies have specifically explored the dangers of social media use from the perspectives of individuals living with mental illness, it is important to recognize that use of these platforms may contribute to risks that extend beyond worsening symptoms and that can affect different aspects of daily life.",
              "In this commentary we considered ways in which social media may yield benefits for individuals living with mental illness, while contrasting these with the possible harms. Studies reporting on the threats of social media for individuals with mental illness are mostly cross-sectional, making it difficult to draw conclusions about direction of causation.",
              "However, the risks are potentially serious.",
              "These risks should be carefully considered in discussions pertaining to use of social media and the broader use of digital mental health technologies, as avenues for mental health promotion, or for supporting access to evidence-based programs or mental health services.",
              "At this point, it would be premature to view the benefits of social media as outweighing the possible harms, when it is clear from the studies summarized here that social media use can have negative effects on mental health symptoms, can potentially expose individuals to hurtful content and hostile interactions, and can result in serious consequences for daily life, including threats to employment and personal relationships.",
              "Despite these risks, it is also necessary to recognize that individuals with mental illness will continue to use social media given the ease of accessing these platforms and the immense popularity of online social networking.",
              "With this in mind, it may be ideal to raise awareness about these possible risks so that individuals can implement necessary safeguards, while also highlighting that there could also be benefits.",
              "For individuals with mental illness who use social media, being aware of the risks is an essential first step, and then highlighting ways that use of these popular platforms could also contribute to some benefits, ranging from finding meaningful interactions with others, engaging with peer support networks, and accessing information and services.",
              "To capitalize on the widespread use of social media, and to achieve the promise that these platforms may hold for supporting the delivery of targeted mental health interventions, there is need for continued research to better understand how individuals living with mental illness use social media.",
              "Such efforts could inform safety measures and also encourage use of social media in ways that maximize potential benefits while minimizing risk of harm.",
              "It will be important to recognize how gender and race contribute to differences in use of social media for seeking mental health information or accessing interventions, as well as differences in how social media might impact mental wellbeing.",
              "For example, a national survey of 14- to 22-year olds in the United States found that female respondents were more likely to search online for information about depression or anxiety, and to try to connect with other people online who share similar mental health concerns, when compared to male respondents (Rideout & Fox, 2018).",
              "In the same survey, there did not appear to be any differences between racial or ethnic groups in social media use for seeking mental health information (Rideout & Fox, 2018).",
              "Social media use also appears to have a differential impact on mental health and emotional wellbeing between females and males (Booker, Kelly, & Sacker, 2018), highlighting the need to explore unique experiences between gender groups to inform tailored programs and services.",
              "Research shows that lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender individuals frequently use social media for searching for health information and may be more likely compared to heterosexual individuals to share their own personal health experiences with others online (Rideout & Fox, 2018).",
              "Less is known about use of social media for seeking support for mental health concerns among gender minorities, though this is an important area for further investigation as these individuals are more likely to experience mental health problems and more likely to experience online victimization when compared to heterosexual individuals (Mereish, Sheskier, Hawthorne, & Goldbach, 2019).",
              "Similarly, efforts are needed to explore the relationship between social media use and mental health among ethnic and racial minorities.",
              "A recent study found that exposure to traumatic online content on social media showing violence or hateful posts directed at racial minorities contributed to increases in psychological distress, PTSD symptoms, and depression among African American and Latinx adolescents in the United States (Tynes, Willis, Stewart, & Hamilton, 2019).",
              "These concerns are contrasted by growing interest in the potential for new technologies including social media to expand the reach of services to underrepresented minority groups (Schueller, Hunter, Figueroa, & Aguilera, 2019).",
              "Therefore, greater attention is needed to understanding the perspectives of ethnic and racial minorities to inform effective and safe use of social media for mental health promotion efforts.",
              "Research has found that individuals living with mental illness have expressed interest in accessing mental health services through social media platforms. A survey of social media users with mental illness found that most respondents were interested in accessing programs for mental health on social media targeting symptom management, health promotion, and support for communicating with health care providers and interacting with the health system (Naslund et al.",
              ", 2017).",
              "Importantly, individuals with serious mental illness have also emphasized that any mental health intervention on social media would need to be moderated by someone with adequate training and credentials, would need to have ground rules and ways to promote safety and minimize risks, and importantly, would need to be free and easy to access.",
              "An important strength with this commentary is that it combines a range of studies broadly covering the topic of social media and mental health.",
              "We have provided a summary of recent evidence in a rapidly advancing field with the goal of presenting unique ways that social media could offer benefits for individuals with mental illness, while also acknowledging the potentially serious risks and the need for further investigation.",
              "There are also several limitations with this commentary that warrant consideration.",
              "Importantly, as we aimed to address this broad objective, we did not conduct a systematic review of the literature.",
              "Therefore, the studies reported here are not exhaustive, and there may be additional relevant studies that were not included.",
              "Additionally, we only summarized published studies, and as a result, any reports from the private sector or websites from different organizations using social media or other apps containing social media-like features would have been omitted.",
              "Though it is difficult to rigorously summarize work from the private sector, sometimes referred to as \u201cgray literature\u201d, because many of these projects are unpublished and are likely selective in their reporting of findings given the target audience may be shareholders or consumers.",
              "Another notable limitation is that we did not assess risk of bias in the studies summarized in this commentary.",
              "We found many studies that highlighted risks associated with social media use for individuals living with mental illness;",
              "however, few studies of programs or interventions reported negative findings, suggesting the possibility that negative findings may go unpublished.",
              "This concern highlights the need for a future more rigorous review of the literature with careful consideration of bias and an accompanying quality assessment.",
              "Most of the studies that we described were from the United States, as well as from other higher income settings such as Australia or the United Kingdom.",
              "Despite the global reach of social media platforms, there is a dearth of research on the impact of these platforms on the mental health of individuals in diverse settings, as well as the ways in which social media could support mental health services in lower income countries where there is virtually no access to mental health providers.",
              "Future research is necessary to explore the opportunities and risks for social media to support mental health promotion in low-income and middle-income countries, especially as these countries face a disproportionate share of the global burden of mental disorders, yet account for the majority of social media users worldwide (Naslund et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "As we consider future research directions, the near ubiquitous social media use also yields new opportunities to study the onset and manifestation of mental health symptoms and illness severity earlier than traditional clinical assessments.",
              "There is an emerging field of research referred to as \u2018digital phenotyping\u2019 aimed at capturing how individuals interact with their digital devices, including social media platforms, in order to study patterns of illness and identify optimal time points for intervention (Jain, Powers, Hawkins, & Brownstein, 2015;",
              "Onnela & Rauch, 2016).",
              "Given that most people access social media via mobile devices, digital phenotyping and social media are closely related (Torous et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "To date, the emergence of machine learning, a powerful computational method involving statistical and mathematical algorithms (Shatte, Hutchinson, & Teague, 2019), has made it possible to study large quantities of data captured from popular social media platforms such as Twitter or Instagram to illuminate various features of mental health (Manikonda & De Choudhury, 2017;",
              "Reece et al.",
              ", 2017).",
              "Specifically, conversations on Twitter have been analyzed to characterize the onset of depression (De Choudhury, Gamon, Counts, & Horvitz, 2013) as well as detecting users\u2019 mood and affective states (De Choudhury, Gamon, & Counts, 2012), while photos posted to Instagram can yield insights for predicting depression (Reece & Danforth, 2017).",
              "The intersection of social media and digital phenotyping will likely add new levels of context to social media use in the near future.",
              "Several studies have also demonstrated that when compared to a control group, Twitter users with a self-disclosed diagnosis of schizophrenia show unique online communication patterns (Michael L Birnbaum, Ernala, Rizvi, De Choudhury, & Kane, 2017), including more frequent discussion of tobacco use (Hswen et al.",
              ", 2017), symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hswen, Naslund, Brownstein, & Hawkins, 2018b), and suicide (Hswen, Naslund, Brownstein, & Hawkins, 2018a).",
              "Another study found that online disclosures about mental illness appeared beneficial as reflected by fewer posts about symptoms following self-disclosure (Ernala, Rizvi, Birnbaum, Kane, & De Choudhury, 2017).",
              "Each of these examples offers early insights into the potential to leverage widely available online data for better understanding the onset and course of mental illness.",
              "It is possible that social media data could be used to supplement additional digital data, such as continuous monitoring using smartphone apps or smart watches, to generate a more comprehensive \u2018digital phenotype\u2019 to predict relapse and identify high-risk health behaviors among individuals living with mental illness (Torous et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "With research increasingly showing the valuable insights that social media data can yield about mental health states, greater attention to the ethical concerns with using individual data in this way is necessary (Chancellor, Birnbaum, Caine, Silenzio, & De Choudhury, 2019).",
              "For instance, data is typically captured from social media platforms without the consent or awareness of users (Bidargaddi et al.",
              ", 2017), which is especially crucial when the data relates to a socially stigmatizing health condition such as mental illness (Guntuku, Yaden, Kern, Ungar, & Eichstaedt, 2017).",
              "Precautions are needed to ensure that data is not made identifiable in ways that were not originally intended by the user who posted the content, as this could place an individual at risk of harm or divulge sensitive health information (Webb et al.",
              ", 2017;",
              "Williams, Burnap, & Sloan, 2017).",
              "Promising approaches for minimizing these risks include supporting the participation of individuals with expertise in privacy, clinicians, as well as the target individuals with mental illness throughout the collection of data, development of predictive algorithms, and interpretation of findings (Chancellor et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "In recognizing that many individuals living with mental illness use social media to search for information about their mental health, it is possible that they may also want to ask their clinicians about what they find online to check if the information is reliable and trustworthy.",
              "Alternatively, many individuals may feel embarrassed or reluctant to talk to their clinicians about using social media to find mental health information out of concerns of being judged or dismissed.",
              "Therefore, mental health clinicians may be ideally positioned to talk with their patients about using social media, and offer recommendations to promote safe use of these sites, while also respecting their patients\u2019 autonomy and personal motivations for using these popular platforms. Given the gap in clinical knowledge about the impact of social media on mental health, clinicians should be aware of the many potential risks so that they can inform their patients, while remaining open to the possibility that their patients may also experience benefits through use of these platforms. As awareness of these risks grows, it may be possible that new protections will be put in place by industry or through new policies that will make the social media environment safer.",
              "It is hard to estimate a number needed to treat or harm today given the nascent state of research, which means the patient and clinician need to weigh the choice on a personal level.",
              "Thus offering education and information is an important first step in that process.",
              "As patients increasingly show interest in accessing mental health information or services through social media, it will be necessary for health systems to recognize social media as a potential avenue for reaching or offering support to patients.",
              "This aligns with growing emphasis on the need for greater integration of digital psychiatry, including apps, smartphones, or wearable devices, into patient care and clinical services through institution-wide initiatives and training clinical providers (Hilty, Chan, Torous, Luo, & Boland, 2019).",
              "Within a learning healthcare environment where research and care are tightly intertwined and feedback between both is rapid, the integration of digital technologies into services may create new opportunities for advancing use of social media for mental health.",
              "As highlighted in this commentary, social media has become an important part of the lives of many individuals living with mental disorders.",
              "Many of these individuals use social media to share their lived experiences with mental illness, to seek support from others, and to search for information about treatment recommendations, accessing mental health services, and coping with symptoms (Bucci et al.",

              "The need for a systematic review Systematic studies can quantitatively and qualitatively identify, aggregate, and evaluate all accessible data to generate a warm and accurate response to the research questions involved [4].",
              "In addition, many existing systematic studies related to mental health studies have been conducted worldwide.",
              "However, only a limited number of studies are integrated with social media and conducted in the context of social science because the available literature heavily focused on medical science [6].",
              "Because social media is a relatively new phenomenon, the potential links between their use and mental health have not been widely investigated.",
              "This paper attempt to systematically review all the relevant literature with the aim of filling the gap by examining social media impact on mental health, which is sedentary behavior, which, if in excess, raises the risk of health problems [7,9,12].",
              "This study is important because it provides information on the extent of the focus of peer review literature, which can assist the researchers in delivering a prospect with the aim of understanding the future attention related to climate change strategies that require scholarly attention.",
              "This study is very useful because it provides information on the extent to which peer review literature can assist researchers in presenting prospects with a view to understanding future concerns related to mental health strategies that require scientific attention.",
              "The development of the current systematic review is based on the main research question: how does social media affect mental health?",
              "Research strategy The research was conducted to identify studies analyzing the role of social media on mental health.",
              "Google Scholar was used as our main database to find the relevant articles.",

              "Result Of the 16 selected research papers, there were a research focus on adults, gender, and preadolescents [10-19].",
              "In the design, there were qualitative and quantitative studies [15,16].",
              "There were three systematic reviews and one thematic analysis that explored the better or worse of using social media among adolescents [20-23].",
              "In addition, eight were cross-sectional studies and only three were longitudinal studies [24-29].",

              "Although the results of the study were not completely consistent, this review found a general association between social media use and mental health issues.",
              "Although there is positive evidence for a link between social media and mental health, the opposite has been reported.",
              "For example, a previous study found no relationship between the amount of time spent on social media and depression or between social media-related activities, such as the number of online friends and the number of \u201cselfies\u201d, and depression [29].",
              "Similarly, Neira and Barber found that while higher investment in social media (e.",
              "g. active social media use) predicted adolescents\u2019 depressive symptoms, no relationship was found between the frequency of social media use and depressed mood [28].",
              "In the 16 studies, anxiety and depression were the most commonly measured outcome.",
              "The prominent risk factors for anxiety and depression emerging from this study comprised time spent, activity, and addiction to social media.",
              "In today's world, anxiety is one of the basic mental health problems. People liked and commented on their uploaded photos and videos.",
              "In today's age, everyone is immune to the social media context.",
              "Some teens experience anxiety from social media related to fear of loss, which causes teens to try to respond and check all their friends' messages and messages on a regular basis.",
              "On the contrary, depression is one of the unintended significances of unnecessary use of social media.",
              "In detail, depression is limited not only to Facebooks but also to other social networking sites, which causes psychological problems. A new study found that individuals who are involved in social media, games, texts, mobile phones, etc.",
              "are more likely to experience depression.",
              "The previous study found a 70% increase in self-reported depressive symptoms among the group using social media.",
              "The other social media influence that causes depression is sexual fun [12].",
              "The intimacy fun happens when social media promotes putting on a facade that highlights the fun and excitement but does not tell us much about where we are struggling in our daily lives at a deeper level [28].",
              "Another study revealed that depression and time spent on Facebook by adolescents are positively correlated [22].",
              "More importantly, symptoms of major depression have been found among the individuals who spent most of their time in online activities and performing image management on social networking sites [14].",
              "Another study assessed gender differences in associations between social media use and mental health.",
              "Females were found to be more addicted to social media as compared with males [26].",
              "Passive activity in social media use such as reading posts is more strongly associated with depression than doing active use like making posts [23].",
              "Other important findings of this review suggest that other factors such as interpersonal trust and family functioning may have a greater influence on the symptoms of depression than the frequency of social media use [28,29].",
              "Limitation and suggestion The limitations and suggestions were identified by the evidence involved in the study and review process.",
              "Previously, 7 of the 16 studies were cross-sectional and slightly failed to determine the causal relationship between the variables of interest.",
              "Given the evidence from cross-sectional studies, it is not possible to conclude that the use of social networks causes mental health problems. Only three longitudinal studies examined the causal relationship between social media and mental health, which is hard to examine if the mental health problem appeared more pronounced in those who use social media more compared with those who use it less or do not use at all [19,20,24].",
              "Next, despite the fact that the proposed relationship between social media and mental health is complex, a few studies investigated mediating factors that may contribute or exacerbate this relationship.",
              "Further investigations are required to clarify the underlying factors that help examine why social media has a negative impact on some peoples\u2019 mental health, whereas it has no or positive effect on others\u2019 mental health.",
              "Social media is a new study that is rapidly growing and gaining popularity.",
              "Thus, there are many unexplored and unexpected constructive answers associated with it.",
              "Lately, studies have found that using social media platforms can have a detrimental effect on the psychological health of its users.",
              "However, the extent to which the use of social media impacts the public is yet to be determined.",
              "This systematic review has found that social media envy can affect the level of anxiety and depression in individuals.",

              "The importance of such findings is to facilitate further research on social media and mental health.",
              "In addition, the information obtained from this study can be helpful not only to medical professionals but also to social science research.",
              "The findings of this study suggest that potential causal factors from social media can be considered when cooperating with patients who have been diagnosed with anxiety or depression.",
              "Also, if the results from this study were used to explore more relationships with another construct, this could potentially enhance the findings to reduce anxiety and depression rates and prevent suicide rates from occurring.",

              "Moreover, ICTs and social media use could increasingly ensure what Castells [37] defined as autonomy in security conditions, as they help parents in communicating with their children at any time, checking their movements in physical and online spaces [35,38,39,40].",

              "specifically, the leading hypothesis referred to the mediator role of these perceptions, whether positive or negative, in the above-mentioned relationship.",
              "The results confirm the hypothesis, showing that parents\u2019 perceptions represent a partial mediator of the relationship between their perceptions about collective family efficacy and openness of communications;",
              "nevertheless, the indirect effect of collective family efficacy on openness of family communications via parents\u2019 perceptions about the impact of social media on family systems was small, showing that all the direct effects in the model were still bigger.",
              "It has already been widely acknowledged that social media and ICTs make human social interactions and relationships more complex;",
              "however, scientific results still showed conflicting results about whether such complexity can have a positive, enriching, role or rather than a negative, detrimental, one with reference to family interactions, even more when the family system includes adolescent children [36]\u2014due to the evolutionary tasks they have to face up to, which can impact on family relationships and interactions temporarily or permanently [10,11,12,13].",
              "These results provide further hints about social media role within family relationships and functioning.",
              "Indeed, while it is well established that family collective efficacy can have a boosting role with reference to healthy interactions and open communications within the family system [5,10], what emerged here suggests that it is not only the real impact of social media on family systems [36] that matters but also how family members perceive it and how much they feel confident about their family managing daily challenges to achieve positive relationships, healthy interactions, and open communications.",
              "Indeed, the results show that that being confident in one\u2019s family capabilities to handle daily tasks, stress, and challenges associates with a more positive perception about the impact social media can have on family system and the relationships within it, as feeling able to manage family daily tasks and challenges could foster the feeling about being able to manage the adaptation to the increasing social media use among family members too.",
              "This could make family members perceive, at last, these new technologies as opportunities for increased family cohesion, adaptability, interactions, planning, and open communications [3,34,36], rather than as threats to positive family functioning and relationships.",
              "In addition to family collective efficacy, also such positive perception can further promote open communications among family members, maybe because if social media are perceived as opportunities and useful tools they can offer further ways to maintain and improve relationships among family members (e.",
              "g., to keep in touch, make plans in real-time, promote and facilitate discussions, and encourage parent\u2013child interactions, [35,36]).",
              "When parents are aware of their family\u2019s ability to manage social media-related changes in family functioning and habits (e.",
              "g., redefinition of roles and boundaries, new kinds of intimacy, communications, rituals, [29,31]), this can foster their perception about potentialities and new opportunities coming from social media use to keep in touch with their children, most of all when they are adolescents and are facing up their individualization process: if parents are able not to make their children feel they are invading their privacy or being oppressive and hyper-controlling, and to discuss with them how social media should be used to reduce the risks, social media can at last strengthen family ties, promote and facilitate discussions, and foster more secure conditions for adolescents to obtain greater autonomy from their parents and for parents to let them face up to these situations [35,36,38,39].",
              "Indeed, when used in a responsible and aware way, social media can represent a resource and an educational added value within family relationships, helping parents to exploit a new educational and participative space that could strengthen the relationships with their children.",
              "This seems also consistent with previous results about how social media use can enhance the opportunities for a more open dialogue between parents and children, allowing the latter to get closer to the language and lifestyles of the first ones and to share with them important, sensitive and/or educational discussion topics functional to their growth [36].",
              "Thus, social media may foster open communications among family members and a supportive family environment wherein adolescents can grow up and face up to their evolutionary tasks and subsequent stressful events, getting positive outcomes [36].",
              "The study shows the relevance that parents\u2019 positive perceptions about the impact of social media on social interactions and relationships within their family system can have in fostering a good family functioning and open communications among family members.",
              "Moreover, with reference to the role that collective family efficacy exerts, it also suggests that relying on family abilities to manage daily life tasks and face daily challenges could represent a strategy to promote the acknowledgment that challenges related to social media uses, their consequences, and the potential subsequent risks could be managed with adequate information and negotiation of the changes they bring in terms of family communications, habits, interactions, and rituals among parents.",
              "Taking into consideration the results from this study, an emergent issue seems related to the need to promote a wider acknowledgment that social media can be positively and functionally used among modern parents [36], showing them different ways in which social media can represent educational and participative spaces aimed at promoting a wider and more open communication between them and their children and a critical and responsible awareness for their children at the same time, fostering, at last, their positive perceptions about social media impact on family systems. Indeed, social media accessibility, acceptability, and accommodation require the redefinition of rules and roles, producing new processes and dynamics within family systems [31] parents have to deal with if they want to get a positive perception about their use: if adequately managed, these processes can allow the creation of further spaces wherein the relational dynamics between parents and adolescent children can happen and be successfully managed.",
              "Consistently, the aspects that emerged from this study invite to set up further studies aimed at deepening the meaning that social media tools can assume in the construction of transition spaces, allowing the expression and mediation of the divergences and conflicts that can show up in families with adolescent children.",
              "It is important to also acknowledge some limitations of this study.",
              "First, it takes into consideration only the parents\u2019 perspective, but a major comprehension of family relationships should take into consideration the children\u2019s perspective also, or even a dyadic one.",
              "Moreover, the findings are based on self-reported data, which can become distorted due to problems related to memory bias and response fatigue.",
              "Lastly, another issue refers to the cross-sectional design of the study;",
              "thus, the relationships described should be considered carefully, and no causal inference is possible.",
              "It would also be useful to extend the analyses to samples from other countries, to verify whether and how the cultural and community [65,66,67,68] dimensions modify the perceptions about social media impact within family systems and their effect on family communications.",

              "Other SMU experiences are also captured including social comparison on social media and negative experiences such as bullying, FOMO, and extensive negative feedback [32\u2022].",

              "A total of 17 cross-sectional studies observed an association between SMU and various sleep parameters in youth.",
              "Of these studies, a total of 16 reported a significant association between different dimensions of SMU (internet addition, duration of screen use, inappropriate time use (near bedtime), with one additionally measure parent control of technology) and poor sleep outcomes (both subjectively and objectively measured sleep parameters, such as bedtime, sleep-onset latency, sleep duration, and sleep quality) [31, 32\u2022, 35, 36, 40, 42\u201344, 45\u2022, 47\u201353].",

              "Among the three cohort studies, two indicated that higher levels of SMU predicted later bedtime and shorter sleep duration in youth after 1\u20132 years of follow-up [37, 54].",
              "These studies revealed that both frequent and problematic use of SMU could result in later bedtime [37, 54].",
              "In addition, Richardson and colleagues further found that SMU predicted greater daytime sleepiness in adolescence [54].",
              "In addition, adolescents with evening chronotype preference and shorter sleep duration were found to have longer usage of social media, suggesting a potential bidirectional relationship between SMU and sleep duration [54].",
              "Another cohort study conducted by Maksniemi and colleagues did not find a significant association between SMU and bedtime among 426 youth aged between 13 and 19 [25\u2022].",
              "Interestingly, subgroup analyses indicated that significant associations were only observed in early adolescence (at age 13 and 14), but not in middle (at age 14 and 15) nor late adolescence (at age 17 and 18) [25\u2022].",

              "A total of 9 cross-sectional studies examined the relationship between SMU and mental health [33\u2022, 34, 38\u2022, 39\u2022, 56\u2022, 57\u201360].",
              "A greater amount of time spent on social media was associated with an increased risk of depression, self-harm, and lower self-esteem.",
              "On the other hand, adolescents who exhibited mental health issues tended to spend more time on social media platforms, suggesting a potential bidirectional relationship between SMU and mental health.",
              "However, it is important to point out that despite appealing hypotheses, actual effect size estimates of SMU on various mental health outcomes (e.",
              "g., self-esteem, life satisfaction, depression, and loneliness) were of small-to-medium magnitude as reported in previous meta-analytic studies, ranging from \u2212 0.",
              "11 to \u2212 0.",
              "32 [61\u2022, 62].",
              "Four longitudinal cohort studies reported mixed findings between SMU and mental health [41, 63, 64\u2022, 65].",
              "Two cohort studies conducted in the USA and China reported that frequent and problematic SMU were significantly associated subsequent mental health issues [64\u2022, 65].",
              "Interestingly, the authors identified substantial sex differences in the mental health trajectories, with only girls showing a deteriorating linear trend (\u03b2 = 0.",
              "23, p < 0.",
              "05) [64\u2022].",
              "On the contrary, the other two longitudinal studies conducted in Sweden and UK reported that although frequent SMU was associated with increased levels of mental problems at a single timepoint, there was no longitudinal association [41, 63], which suggests that SMU may be only an indicator for mental health instead of a risk factor.",
              "A total of 7 studies measured both sleep and mental health outcomes [31, 45\u2022, 46\u201348, 50, 59].",
              "Five of these studies reported significant associations among SMU, sleep, and mental health outcome [31, 45\u2022, 46, 50, 59].",
              "It was reported that SMU was significantly associated with poor sleep quality and increased mental health issues [31, 45\u2022, 46, 50, 59], and sleep was found to mediate the negative impacts of SMU on mental health and emotional symptoms in adolescents [45\u2022].",
              "Poor sleep was also shown to be significantly associated with mental health outcomes [31, 50, 59].",
              "Furthermore, adolescents with higher level of depressive symptoms were at higher risk of experiencing negative impacts of bedtime SMU on sleep outcomes [46].",
              "Indeed, these findings preliminarily unveiled the complex interplay among SMU, sleep, and mental health.",
              "Nevertheless, it is essential to highlight that recent research has also recognized the positive impacts of SMU on mental health, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, at which physical social interactions were significantly disrupted [56\u2022, 58].",
              "Adolescents in Australia and UK were found to use social media as an active coping strategy to relieve external stressors (e.",
              "g., exam pressure), to seek support for suicidal ideation or self-harm behavior, and to support others via social media [56\u2022, 58].",
              "This scoping review synthesized recent publications from the past 3 years that investigated the impact of SMU on sleep and/or mental health outcomes in youth.",
              "The majority of the studies provide supporting evidence for an association between SMU, poor sleep quality, and adverse mental health outcomes.",
              "Problematic SMU or addiction, as well as the duration of SMU, were identified as the most prevalent aspects of social media examined in the included studies.",
              "Sleep duration, bedtime, and insomnia emerged as the most commonly assessed sleep problems, while depression and anxiety were the most frequently measured mental health outcomes.",
              "However, it is important to note that despite the significant associations identified among these variables, the directionality of the relationship remains unclear in view of inconsistent findings across studies.",
              "Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to elucidate the relationship between social/digital media usage and sleep quantity and quality [66].",
              "Hyperarousal, a core mechanism in explaining insomnia [67], plays a role in explaining how night-time SMU disrupts sleep.",
              "Active engagement in media activities can directly induce physiological and psychological arousal, leading to longer sleep onset latency [68].",
              "This effect is particularly noticeable when individuals actively engage in interactive digital media, such as social messaging and social media, as opposed to passive media consumption like television viewing [69\u2022], likely due to the heightened arousal associated with interactive activities [70].",
              "Interestingly, a study found that engaging in phone conversations near bedtime was associated with longer sleep duration, while the use of social media and texting displayed a negative association [71].",
              "It has been hypothesized that conversing with a friend may positively influence emotional well-being, thereby promoting sleep [72].",
              "However, social networking, despite its potential for fostering friendships, may also trigger FOMO and social media stress.",
              "In addition to the psychological arousal induced by electronic media usage, the light emitted from device screens is another hypothesis explaining the detrimental effects of digital media on sleep.",
              "Specifically, the light emitted by electronic devices, especially blue light (at a wavelength of 480 nm), has a significant impact on the suppression of melatonin, a hormone that promotes sleep [73].",
              "Moreover, a recent study indicated that high-risk adolescents whose parents with bipolar affective disorder have lower level of nocturnal melatonin secretion.",
              "It might be possible that adolescents with certain risk factors (even without psychopathologies) may be particularly hypersensitive and vulnerable to light suppression of melatonin secretion [74], which are considered as high-risk group that require early intervention.",
              "Furthermore, it is plausible that an interaction or interplay might exist between arousal and light exposure, and the combination of these conditions could potentially heighten the risk of sleep disturbances.",
              "Additionally, the direct displacement of sleep resulting from engagement in social media activities may also lead to shorter sleep duration.",
              "Although initial evidence suggests a negative impact of both content and light emitted by electronic devices on sleep, the precise underlying mechanism remains poorly established.",
              "Last but not least, some preliminary studies have also investigated other sleep- and circadian-related factors such as chronotype preference and daytime sleepiness in mediating and/or moderating the relationship between SMU and sleep [32\u2022, 44, 54], albeit the findings have been inconclusive.",
              "Future studies are warranted to thoroughly explore the role of these factors in the interplay between SMU and sleep.",
              "It has been suggested both behavioral and cognitive factors mediate the impact of SMU on mental health.",
              "Among the behavioral factors, sleep has been identified as one of the notable mediators of the association [31, 44, 45\u2022, 46, 50, 59, 75].",
              "Physiologically, prolonged SMU before bedtime delays sleep onset, reduces sleep duration, and mediates the association between eveningness and sleep as well as daytime sleepiness [44], which have been identified as risk factors for mental illness [76\u201378].",
              "This complex interplay between sleep and mental health has also been documented in interventional studies.",
              "Our previous clinical trial demonstrated that a brief insomnia prevention program, adapted from cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, significantly decreased the severity of depressive symptoms in adolescents at 12-month follow-up [79], suggesting the potential mediating role of sleep in mental health.",
              "While for the cognitive factors, FOMO has been recognized as a possible mediator.",
              "In particular, Elhai et al.",
              "reported that FOMO mediated relationship between anxiety and smartphone use frequency, as well as problematic SMU [80].",
              "Besides FOMO, recent literatures have also identified several other cognitive factors that mediate the relationship between SMU and mental health, such as self-esteem [38\u2022], body satisfaction [57], and emotional investment [59].",
              "In addition to these behavioral and cognitive factors, cyberbullying is also one of the important mediators of SMU and mental health in youth [81].",
              "Cyberbullying has become a prevalent phenomenon worldwide, with victimization rates in children and adolescents ranging from 14 to 57.",
              "5%, and lifetime perpetration rates ranging from 6.",
              "0 to 46.",
              "3% [82, 83].",
              "Previous meta-analytical study demonstrated that cyberbullying significantly increased the risks of developing depression, self-harm, suicidal attempts, and ideation [84].",
              "Moreover, over the COVID-19 pandemic, stressors associated with disasters have also been reported to potentially exacerbate the negative effects of SMU on mental health, thereby increasing the risk for mental health issues [85, 86].",
              "In summary, there have been significant developments in recent years in understanding the magnitude and mechanisms that underlie the association between SMU and mental health.",
              "However, most of the studies employed a cross-sectional design, which prevented from a thorough understanding of the causality.",
              "Experimental and interventional studies are warranted to better comprehend the underlying mechanisms, establish causality, and improve the negative outcomes.",
              "There are several potential avenues for future investigation.",
              "Firstly, prospective cohort studies using representative samples are needed to elucidate the magnitude and directionality of relationships among SMU, sleep, and mental health, which is of clinical practice implication for precision intervention.",
              "To capture the varying dynamics among SMU, sleep, and mental health across different age groups of adolescents (early and late adolescents), it is recommended that prospective studies may need to have a follow-up period that will better cover the entirety of adolescence period [41].",
              "Secondly, the lack of consistency in the methodologies employed by different studies measuring SMU has been a major contributing factor to the conflicting findings found in the current literature.",
              "It is imperative to use validated questionnaires to measure the SMU.",
              "More importantly, objective measurements (e.",
              "g., screen time monitors on smartphones [87], ecological momentary assessments [88], and wearable devices [89]) should also be incorporated.",
              "Apart from timing, it is equally important to capture the content, and number of devices that subjects engage with.",
              "Thirdly, future research should consider conducting randomized controlled trials at different levels (e.",
              "g., individual, school, and family) to reduce overall and problematic SMU and to ultimately improve sleep and mental health outcomes in youth.",
              "The design of the intervention may benchmark to existing guidelines such as the American Academy of Paediatrics recommendations 2016 on media use [90], and the WHO guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behavior [91], in which both guidelines recommend limiting the amount of recreational screen time, and avoiding SMU 1 h before bedtime.",
              "Intervention formats may consider psychoeducation, cognitive and behavioral techniques, and motivational interviewing.",
              "Finally, priority may be given to conduct observational and interventional studies on SMU in vulnerable populations, such as youth experiencing mood or sleep problems, as well as those who are high-risk offspring of parents with sleep and mood disorders, as these populations are more susceptible to experience significant negative impacts from inappropriate and excessive SMU [92].",
              "Despite the heterogeneity observed in the recent studies, both cross-sectional and cohort studies highlight the impact of SMU on poor sleep and mental health, albeit there are some inconsistent findings.",
              "Research has progressed from focusing solely on \u201cscreen time\u201d to exploring the social, emotional, and cognitive dimensions of SMU.",
              "When measuring sleep outcomes, researchers have investigated the sleep duration and quality and also consider factors such as chronotype and pre-sleep arousal, which will enable a better understanding of how social media impacts sleep in a broader context.",
              "Similar advancements have also been made in the field of SMU-related mental health research.",
              "Recognizing the interconnections among SMU, sleep, and mental health is crucial for public health and will contribute to improving sleep and mental health outcomes while promoting rational SMU.",
              "Future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on reducing SMU, with ultimate goal to improve sleep and mental health.",

              "The sleep and mental health research literatures have made recent advances towards a more nuanced understanding of social media use: moving beyond a focus on simply duration of use, towards new insights into the role of content, context and experience of these online interactions.",
              "As this research area moves forward, a focus on high-quality measurement\u2014combined with collaborative multidisciplinary approaches that triangulate insight from different methodologies and perspectives\u2014can inform a more holistic understanding of sleep and mental health in today\u2019s connected world.",
              "Avoid common mistakes on your manuscript.",
              "Over recent decades, sleep and mental health researchers have followed changes in the media landscape, examining associated outcomes for prevalent forms of electronic media use: from TV viewing to video gaming to smartphone use [1\u2022, 2\u2022, 3,4,5,6].",
              "Currently, the increasing connectivity offered by devices and platforms has facilitated not only increased time devoted to these media activities, but also important shifts in social norms and expectations around availability and etiquette for online interactions [7,8,9].",
              "Therefore, social media use is receiving increasing attention independent from other forms of electronic media use, with researchers calling for improved understanding of its unique social, emotional and cognitive aspects in relation to sleep and mental health outcomes [10, 11\u2022\u2022, 12, 13\u2022\u2022, 14].",
              "At this juncture, it is important to step back and survey the current state of this research field, acknowledging developments to date and identifying priorities as we move forward.",
              "In this review, we highlight some key developments in this research literature in the last 5 years, discuss ongoing challenges facing researchers in this field and offer recommendations for future steps.",
              "Concerns about the well-being implications of media use are not a new phenomenon [15\u2022].",
              "However, we must ensure that\u2014as media devices and habits continue to evolve\u2014we too continually update our approaches as researchers and practitioners to understanding their implications for sleep and mental health.",
              "Compared with other forms of technology or traditional media, social media platforms facilitate unique changes not only in how we spend our time but also crucially in how we interact with each other.",
              "Platforms are easily accessible via smartphone apps (facilitating engagement throughout the day and alongside other activities) and specifically designed to keep users engaged, with continual notifications and no clearly defined end point [10, 16].",
              "Importantly, platforms provide richly varied opportunities for social interactions, allowing individuals to curate a careful self-presentation through public profiles, quantify peer approval through number of likes and retweets and extend daytime face-to-face peer interactions with 24/7 availability for individual and group messages [7, 17].",
              "Together, these features and user experiences contribute not only to increased time devoted to social media use [18], but also importantly to evolving social norms around expected availability and the urgency of online interactions [7, 8, 19], presenting unique implications for mental health and sleep.",
              "Alongside this evolution of social media habits and norms, we have seen concurrent developments in our understanding of\u2014and approach to treating\u2014sleep problems. As of 2013, the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disorders, Fifth Edition) classification of sleep-wake disorders has moved towards recognising the \u201cbidirectional and interactive effects between sleep disorders and coexisting medical and psychiatric illnesses\u201d [20, 21].",
              "For example, insomnia is now classified as comorbid with\u2014rather than secondary to\u2014a mental health diagnosis.",
              "Researchers and practitioners are therefore updating their approaches to understanding and treating sleep and mental health as two inextricably linked aspects of health, which together present a significant and well-recognised social, economic and health burden internationally [22,23,24].",
              "It is therefore timely to consider current progress and next steps in ensuring that this developing area of research and practice also incorporates an up-to-date approach to understanding the role of social media: one which encompasses the relevant social, emotional and cognitive aspects of social media use, rather than simply considering it as just another hour of total daily \u201cscreen time\u201d [15\u2022].",
              "In this section, we briefly consider how the sleep and mental health literatures have each tended to approach social media use to date, before considering current developments in each of these areas in the following section.",
              "In the sleep literature, current understanding of social media use has been strongly informed by previous research on traditional media and technology use generally.",
              "This approach tends to examine social media use as a technology-based activity, often measuring the frequency, duration and timing of use [25].",
              "Existing reviews of this evidence indicate that social media use\u2014alongside other technology activities like TV viewing, video gaming and computer and smartphone use\u2014is generally associated with poorer sleep outcomes, particularly shorter sleep duration and also delayed bedtimes and poorer sleep quality [1\u2022, 2\u2022, 26].",
              "This body of work has provided a useful framework for understanding the mechanisms by which technology use (including social media use) can impact sleep [1\u2022, 27\u2022\u2022].",
              "These mechanisms include technology use delaying bedtimes and/or interrupting nighttime sleep [28,29,30], plus screen light potentially delaying circadian rhythms and sleep [31] (for a discussion on integrating evidence on online social interactions and screen light exposure, see Woods and Scott, this issue).",
              "It has also been proposed that technology use may impact on sleep by increasing cognitive arousal at bedtime [1\u2022, 27\u2022\u2022, 32].",
              "Whilst all proposed pathways are relevant for various screen-based technologies (including more passive media consumption), this cognitive arousal mechanism is particularly salient for social media, which offers opportunities for rich social interactions in real time.",
              "This highlights the potential added value for sleep literature to further examine social media independently of other technologies, focusing on building a more nuanced understanding of the arousal and sleep-wake implications of its unique social, emotional and cognitive user experiences specifically.",
              "Interestingly, more of the mental health literature has taken a social interaction perspective\u2014compared with a technology perspective\u2014to understanding social media use.",
              "This may explain why the overall evidence on mental health associations is more mixed, supporting both positive and negative outcomes depending on how social media use is operationalised [13\u2022\u2022].",
              "Studies that measure how often and how much individuals use social media have reported a mix of significant and non-significant associations with mental health problems [13\u2022\u2022, 33], with a large-scale analysis indicating that this digital screen time accounts for very little variance in adolescent well-being [34].",
              "This reinforces the argument that examining only frequency and duration of use is not sufficient to understand the complex links between individuals\u2019 social media practices and mental health.",
              "Instead, in their 2016 systematic review of available evidence, Seabrook and colleagues stressed that associated (positive or negative) mental health outcomes depended strongly on a range of protective and risk factors around how users engaged with social media [13\u2022\u2022].",
              "These include perceived and actual levels of online social support [35,36,37], and the valence of individuals\u2019 social media content, interactions and social comparisons [38,39,40].",
              "In the following section, we discuss key insights that have been gained in recent years from this approach to examining relevant social and emotional aspects of social media engagement and their implications for both sleep and mental health.",
              "Building on a perspective of social media within a technology use framework, much sleep research has examined how the duration, frequency and timing of individuals\u2019 social media activity relate to sleep outcomes.",
              "These findings have supported links between higher overall social media use and poorer sleep outcomes, including shorter sleep duration, later bedtimes and poorer sleep quality [17, 26].",
              "The timing of use is highly relevant for sleep, as social media use at bedtime is a strong predictor of poorer sleep outcomes, independent of overall use [14, 16, 17, 41, 42].",
              "These findings are consistent with a sleep displacement mechanism [1\u2022, 27\u2022\u2022, 28], as there are only 24 h in a day, and an hour devoted to any activity (including using social media) is an hour that is spent awake.",
              "It is important to note, however, that studies are primarily cross-sectional, and the question of causality remains (we discuss this further under \u201cCurrent Issues and Challenges Facing Researchers\u201d below).",
              "This insight gained from studying frequency, duration and timing is informative for understanding social media use as an activity that may displace sleep.",
              "However, to meaningfully inform clinical practice and wider policy, it is crucial to remember that conceptualising social media use in minutes and hours only gives one part of the picture.",
              "It is important to consider the wider context around this time spent using social media, to avoid oversimplification in policy and practice that reduces \u201csocial media use\u201d from a complex range of experiences and social interactions to a single number (represented only in hours per day).",
              "This has been one area of development in the sleep literature over the last 5 years, with more studies examining not only the time that participants spend using social media, but also their experiences of\u2014and motivations for\u2014these interactions [8, 12, 17, 38].",
              "Therefore, alongside the behavioural component (actual social media activity), current understanding of mechanisms linking social media use to sleep has been improved by considering social, emotional and cognitive components of users\u2019 experiences.",
              "For example, individuals who spend the same time using social media each day (or night) can differ in the level of emotional connection that they feel towards this activity [25].",
              "Young people in particular often report feelings of disconnectedness and missing out without access to social media and prefer to keep their phones within close reach during the night [43].",
              "This has implications for sleep outcomes, as highly invested users report poorer sleep quality and may find it more difficult to disengage from social media at night [17].",
              "This reinforces the need to consider social media use within the broader context of an individual\u2019s online and offline social interactions, as a strong connection to social media platforms can stem from a more pervasive anxiety about potentially missing out [8, 44].",
              "This underlying fear of missing out has been linked to shorter sleep duration via both a behavioural pathway (by driving late night social media use, which delays bedtimes) and a cognitive pathway (by increasing pre-sleep cognitive arousal, thus further delaying sleep onset) [12].",
              "Therefore, individuals who are concerned about possibly missing out may struggle at bedtime to stop not only using social media, but also thinking about possible social media interactions [8].",
              "This is further fuelled by concerns over meeting perceived social expectations for 24/7 online availability and prompt responses [7,8,9], which may similarly extend social media activity at bedtime and also increase cognitive arousal even once disconnected.",
              "Building on likely mechanisms that are relevant for all forms of technology use\u2014such as increased cognitive arousal from bedtime use [1\u2022, 27\u2022\u2022]\u2014these insights are developing a more nuanced understanding of the sleep implications of this inherently social and interactive experience.",
              "For example, this cognitive-behavioural perspective can inform practical approaches to supporting a healthy balance between social media use and sleep, which should consider underlying concerns in addition to observable behaviours.",
              "For clinicians, educators and parents of adolescents, this indicates that focusing exclusively on reducing nighttime social media activity (e.",
              "g. by limiting access) is not only challenging to implement [45, 46], but also fails to address other relevant factors, such as underlying concerns and arousal, that persist independent of actual social media activity.",
              "This broader perspective on social media use (including its cognitive, social and emotional aspects) is increasingly represented in mental health literature.",
              "However, this shift is relatively recent, and there is still a considerable body of work being cited that considers only the duration and frequency of social media use, which has produced mixed findings for mental health outcomes [11\u2022\u2022, 13\u2022\u2022].",
              "Although some studies have linked more time on social media to increased depressive or anxious symptoms [10, 47], some do not find significant associations [48, 49], and others have found positive associated outcomes, such as reduced loneliness [50].",
              "This reinforces the argument that knowing only how much time an individual spends using social media (without further information on context and experiences) is not particularly informative for understanding its implications for any aspect of health and well-being.",
              "Therefore, as in the sleep field, similar calls have been made in the mental health literature to examine the content, context and interactivity of social media use, rather than limiting discussions to simply total \u201cscreen time\u201d [10, 11\u2022\u2022, 13\u2022\u2022, 15\u2022].",
              "In recent years, this line of research has made considerable steps towards a more nuanced understanding, which is now highlighting the crucial role of how individuals engage with social media in determining positive versus negative mental health outcomes [11\u2022\u2022, 13\u2022\u2022].",
              "Firstly, associations between social media use and mental health and well-being vary in their direction and strength depending on the following: which platforms individuals use, for what purpose and with whom they interact.",
              "For example, time spent using image-based platforms like Instagram and Snapchat (but not text-based platforms like Twitter) is associated with decreased loneliness, possibly due to an enhanced sense of intimacy [50].",
              "This benefit applies to individuals who use these image-sharing platforms for the purpose of interacting with other people, whereas those who simply broadcast content actually report increased loneliness [51].",
              "Specifically, it seems that those who use image-based platforms to interact with people they know personally are not at risk for negative consequences, whilst those who view and interact with image-based content from strangers are more likely to engage in negative social comparisons and have depressive symptoms [52].",
              "Furthermore, in addition to knowing who an individual is interacting with, crucially it is the quality of these online interactions that distinguishes positive and negative mental health outcomes [11\u2022\u2022].",
              "For example, cyberbullying represents an obvious case whereby interactions with known peers can have a negative impact on a wide range of adolescent well-being outcomes: from lower self-esteem and mood to increased behavioural and emotional problems [53, 54].",
              "Whilst this is an important area of research linking users\u2019 experiences of social media to mental health outcomes, it should be noted that very few young people experience bullying exclusively via social media platforms, and effect sizes for poor mental health associations are similar for cyberbullying and offline physical and relational bullying [53, 55].",
              "In contrast, positive online social interactions are associated with increased self-esteem and positive mental well-being, as well as decreased anxiety and depression, by providing social support and positive feedback [13\u2022\u2022, 56].",
              "Clark and colleagues stress the importance of understanding this quality of social connection in their proposed interpersonal-connection-behaviours framework [11\u2022\u2022], arguing that negative well-being outcomes are not inevitable, but depend on whether specific social media practices promote meaningful social connection.",
              "Social media practices that do focus on facilitating positive social connections can in fact offer a range of benefits to well-being.",
              "This perspective can help make sense of apparently contradictory findings based on frequency and duration of use.",
              "It can also accommodate new insight into individual differences, with recent evidence highlighting benefits for certain groups, whereby social media platforms can provide opportunities for positive social connection for individuals with a range of needs, including autism spectrum disorder and cerebral palsy [57, 58].",
              "Taking this broader perspective on social media use (moving beyond simply hours per day, to examine a range of relevant social and emotional aspects) has therefore brought valuable new insight to links with mental health, and we argue that this can offer similar benefits to sleep research and practice.",
              "For example, sleep researchers can build on existing evidence (which shows poorer sleep outcomes for those who use social media most, particularly at bedtime [59]), by further exploring the context and quality of this social media activity and seeking to better understand individuals\u2019 motivations and experiences of engaging with (and disengaging from) social media at night [8, 12].",
              "We now consider some of the challenges currently facing researchers working to better understand links between social media use, sleep and mental health.",
              "One common issue facing this field as a whole is the question of causality, as available research primarily uses cross-sectional self-report data.",
              "A causal pathway from social media use to sleep is supported by evidence that implementing changes to bedtime media habits can improve sleep outcomes [45], highlighting the valuable contribution of experimental work.",
              "However, it is likely that this relationship is bidirectional, with some poor sleepers and those who have naturally later circadian preferences also turning to social media as a sleep aid or to pass time until they fall asleep [60, 61].",
              "Similarly, whilst depressed individuals tend to interpret their social media interactions more negatively, certain online experiences (negative social comparison, seeking but not receiving support) can further negatively impact on mood, exacerbating symptoms for those with existing mental health problems [35, 36, 39, 62].",
              "Existing studies consistently voice the need for future longitudinal work to examine temporal directionality and causality [10, 17, 63].",
              "However, examining social media habits over time can present particular challenges when platforms, features and associated norms are continually shifting.",
              "An inevitable challenge in this fast-moving field is that technological developments outpace research, with continually evolving social media platforms, functionalities and associated norms. For example, the most popular platform to be studied in relation to anxiety and depression (as of June 2016) was Facebook [13\u2022\u2022], which is now facing competition from other much more rapidly growing platforms, particularly among young people [18].",
              "Even when a platform remains prevalent, its specific features evolve over time, facilitating shifts in the social expectations and norms for how people engage with social media.",
              "For example, with the introduction of \u201cread receipts\u201d, users can now see when a message has been viewed, which contributes to perceived obligation to respond quickly [8, 9].",
              "Therefore, in this rapidly evolving social media landscape, research measures can quickly become outdated and even relatively recent findings may not generalise beyond the specific platforms and devices in vogue at the time of data collection [2\u2022, 64], as users\u2019 experiences are constantly changing.",
              "This presents a particular challenge for researchers responding to calls for longitudinal analysis in this area, since platform- or feature-specific measures can become outmoded during the course of the study.",
              "Much of the research in this area has focused on adolescents and young people.",
              "This is partly driven by concerns being voiced by policymakers, health professionals, educators and parents around the possible negative impact of social media on young people\u2019s health and well-being [65, 66].",
              "These concerns are understandable, since adolescents and emerging adults must navigate an intense developmental stage, whilst managing high academic demands, during a period of increased risk for developing lifelong poor mental health [67, 68].",
              "Adolescence has been described as bringing about a \u201cPerfect Storm\u201d of biological, psychosocial and societal factors that work together to produce short and ill-timed sleep for a majority of this population, where sleep need remains high [22, 69, 70].",
              "Therefore, it is particularly relevant to understand how social media use, sleep and mental health interact in this adolescent population [17].",
              "However, it is also important to ensure that available evidence does not neglect other age groups, as social media use is increasingly prevalent across all age groups [71], and its potentially changing implications for health and well-being across the lifespan remain a gap in current understanding [16].",
              "Furthermore, as researchers and practitioners who are working with adolescent populations, it is important to be mindful of the language we use\u2014and assumptions we make\u2014concerning young people\u2019s social media habits.",
              "As a topic of current interest to a wide audience, research findings in this area are also being widely discussed in a public forum and as socially responsible researchers, we must consider the impact of our words.",
              "For example, research literature often approaches media use as a potential threat or harmful activity, using language around social media \u201caddiction\u201d and \u201cproblematic use\u201d [10, 72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79], which can pathologise social media use despite insufficient evidence for considering it an addiction [80].",
              "From our experience through research and engagement with adolescents and their teachers and parents, we have found that this type of language from adults is not constructive and often shuts down the potential for meaningful dialogue that can build shared inter-generational understanding.",
              "Therefore, making the adolescent voice heard in research literature, practice and decision-making is crucial.",
              "This ensures that we are best placed to support those young people who do perceive their experiences on social media as problematic, whilst avoiding applying unhelpful labels to those young people who devote considerable time to online social interactions, but who have positive experiences [81, 82].",
              "From our experience, we have come to consider the role of measurement in these various challenges facing researchers and practitioners, and now view it as a crucial issue to address as the field moves forward.",
              "Measurement is of critical importance to the research process and yet is often overlooked: poor quality measurement is surprisingly prevalent in published literature and can seriously undermine the conclusions of a study [83\u2022].",
              "We are heartened to see recent advances in exploring the context and experience of social media interactions in relation to sleep and mental health.",
              "However, we note that researchers across these fields have nonetheless been limited by the research measures available to them [25].",
              "Across this research area, use of single-item non-validated measures (often of duration or frequency of use) is common [13\u2022\u2022, 25].",
              "Furthermore, available multi-item validated measures are often specific to one platform [84, 85] and/or pathologise social media use [86,87,88].",
              "It is crucial to remember that the measurement tools available to researchers and clinicians limit the questions we can ask participants and patients, the conclusions we can draw and the recommendations we can make.",
              "Therefore, if we only ask about participants\u2019 and patients\u2019 daily duration of social media use or experience of \u201caddictive\u201d symptoms, then, we are limiting our understanding and discussions (as well as wider public dialogue), by missing insight into other relevant and more positive aspects of social media interactions.",
              "Furthermore, measurement is a key issue to address when aiming to maximise the relevance and longevity of current research in a rapidly evolving social media landscape (which can become particularly problematic in longitudinal work).",
              "The following section further discusses the issue of measurement as one of several recommendations that we offer as the field moves forward.",
              "Having considered these challenges currently facing researchers, we now briefly highlight some selected recommendations as this field moves forward.",
              "High-quality measures that move beyond quantifying and pathologising observable behaviours are crucial to allow balanced and constructive dialogue in research and practice as we move forward.",
              "Having tools available to capture underlying issues (e.",
              "g. motivations for and experiences of online social interactions) allows us to build a more nuanced understanding and also improves the longevity of measures, as specific platforms and features rise and fall over time [11\u2022\u2022].",
              "In our current work, we have developed and validated a measure of difficulty disengaging from social media at night, whose content and wording is built from an adolescent perspective [8].",
              "Moving forward, we urge others to consider the role of measurement in the research they produce and consume [83\u2022], and to question how the tools they use guide (and constrain) the conclusions and recommendations they can make.",
              "This applies to longitudinal and large cohort studies, where planning for the inclusion of a high-quality measure (that captures specifically relevant experiences of social media engagement for sleep or mental health) is crucial to maximise meaningful and useful conclusions from considerable investment of resources.",
              "Open datasets offer valuable potential for secondary analysis, particularly when applying powerful new analysis techniques to data from large representative cohorts [34].",
              "However, the conclusions we can make are only as good as the questions asked of these samples, and with survey space often limiting large cohort surveys to single-item measures of \u201cscreen time\u201d or daily social media use, it is important to interpret findings within the limits of what they can and cannot tell us.",
              "Here, a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach can maximise different expertise and perspectives to ensure appropriate survey coverage that fully captures components of social media use that are specifically relevant for different aspects of health and well-being.",
              "Of course, no single methodological or theoretical approach can ever provide the full story, and we stress the value of triangulating insight from multiple methodologies, theoretical perspectives and disciplines.",
              "This can help build a holistic understanding of how individuals\u2019 social media experiences fit within their overall health and well-being, considering interactive effects between positive and negative aspects of social media use, sleep and mental health.",
              "Recent work has started to consider these simultaneously, often positioning sleep as a mediator linking social media use to mental health outcomes [63, 89], with the potential for future work to consider alternative plausible models (including likely interactive effects) by examining temporal relationships.",
              "Future work can benefit by combining insights from multiple methods, including validated self-report measures;",
              "data-scraping techniques to gather objective social media activity data [90];",
              "and rich in-depth insight from qualitative methods that can explore users\u2019 motivations and experiences as well as differing generational perspectives [7, 8, 19].",
              "Furthermore, a collaborative approach can maximise expertise of researchers and clinicians in different disciplines, and support ongoing efforts to improve understanding of sleep and mental health as two inextricably linked aspects of overall health and well-being [20].",
              "Rapid developments in technological and social trends mean that even the very latest published research findings can quickly become outdated, as social media platforms (and norms for how people engage with them) continue to evolve during the time between data collection and publication [64].",
              "One practical step that researchers can take to minimise this delay is posting preprints.",
              "This involves depositing a freely available manuscript in a dedicated online server (e.",

              "These concerns are contrasted by growing interest in the potential for new technologies including social media to expand the reach of services to underrepresented minority groups (Schueller, Hunter, Figueroa, & Aguilera, 2019).",
              "Therefore, greater attention is needed to understanding the perspectives of ethnic and racial minorities to inform effective and safe use of social media for mental health promotion efforts.",
              "Research has found that individuals living with mental illness have expressed interest in accessing mental health services through social media platforms. A survey of social media users with mental illness found that most respondents were interested in accessing programs for mental health on social media targeting symptom management, health promotion, and support for communicating with health care providers and interacting with the health system (Naslund et al.",
              ", 2017).",
              "Importantly, individuals with serious mental illness have also emphasized that any mental health intervention on social media would need to be moderated by someone with adequate training and credentials, would need to have ground rules and ways to promote safety and minimize risks, and importantly, would need to be free and easy to access.",
              "An important strength with this commentary is that it combines a range of studies broadly covering the topic of social media and mental health.",
              "We have provided a summary of recent evidence in a rapidly advancing field with the goal of presenting unique ways that social media could offer benefits for individuals with mental illness, while also acknowledging the potentially serious risks and the need for further investigation.",
              "There are also several limitations with this commentary that warrant consideration.",
              "Importantly, as we aimed to address this broad objective, we did not conduct a systematic review of the literature.",
              "Therefore, the studies reported here are not exhaustive, and there may be additional relevant studies that were not included.",
              "Additionally, we only summarized published studies, and as a result, any reports from the private sector or websites from different organizations using social media or other apps containing social media-like features would have been omitted.",
              "Though it is difficult to rigorously summarize work from the private sector, sometimes referred to as \u201cgray literature\u201d, because many of these projects are unpublished and are likely selective in their reporting of findings given the target audience may be shareholders or consumers.",
              "Another notable limitation is that we did not assess risk of bias in the studies summarized in this commentary.",
              "We found many studies that highlighted risks associated with social media use for individuals living with mental illness;",
              "however, few studies of programs or interventions reported negative findings, suggesting the possibility that negative findings may go unpublished.",
              "This concern highlights the need for a future more rigorous review of the literature with careful consideration of bias and an accompanying quality assessment.",
              "Most of the studies that we described were from the United States, as well as from other higher income settings such as Australia or the United Kingdom.",
              "Despite the global reach of social media platforms, there is a dearth of research on the impact of these platforms on the mental health of individuals in diverse settings, as well as the ways in which social media could support mental health services in lower income countries where there is virtually no access to mental health providers.",
              "Future research is necessary to explore the opportunities and risks for social media to support mental health promotion in low-income and middle-income countries, especially as these countries face a disproportionate share of the global burden of mental disorders, yet account for the majority of social media users worldwide (Naslund et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "As we consider future research directions, the near ubiquitous social media use also yields new opportunities to study the onset and manifestation of mental health symptoms and illness severity earlier than traditional clinical assessments.",
              "There is an emerging field of research referred to as \u2018digital phenotyping\u2019 aimed at capturing how individuals interact with their digital devices, including social media platforms, in order to study patterns of illness and identify optimal time points for intervention (Jain, Powers, Hawkins, & Brownstein, 2015;",
              "Onnela & Rauch, 2016).",
              "Given that most people access social media via mobile devices, digital phenotyping and social media are closely related (Torous et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "To date, the emergence of machine learning, a powerful computational method involving statistical and mathematical algorithms (Shatte, Hutchinson, & Teague, 2019), has made it possible to study large quantities of data captured from popular social media platforms such as Twitter or Instagram to illuminate various features of mental health (Manikonda & De Choudhury, 2017;",
              "Reece et al.",
              ", 2017).",
              "Specifically, conversations on Twitter have been analyzed to characterize the onset of depression (De Choudhury, Gamon, Counts, & Horvitz, 2013) as well as detecting users\u2019 mood and affective states (De Choudhury, Gamon, & Counts, 2012), while photos posted to Instagram can yield insights for predicting depression (Reece & Danforth, 2017).",
              "The intersection of social media and digital phenotyping will likely add new levels of context to social media use in the near future.",
              "Several studies have also demonstrated that when compared to a control group, Twitter users with a self-disclosed diagnosis of schizophrenia show unique online communication patterns (Michael L Birnbaum, Ernala, Rizvi, De Choudhury, & Kane, 2017), including more frequent discussion of tobacco use (Hswen et al.",
              ", 2017), symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hswen, Naslund, Brownstein, & Hawkins, 2018b), and suicide (Hswen, Naslund, Brownstein, & Hawkins, 2018a).",
              "Another study found that online disclosures about mental illness appeared beneficial as reflected by fewer posts about symptoms following self-disclosure (Ernala, Rizvi, Birnbaum, Kane, & De Choudhury, 2017).",
              "Each of these examples offers early insights into the potential to leverage widely available online data for better understanding the onset and course of mental illness.",
              "It is possible that social media data could be used to supplement additional digital data, such as continuous monitoring using smartphone apps or smart watches, to generate a more comprehensive \u2018digital phenotype\u2019 to predict relapse and identify high-risk health behaviors among individuals living with mental illness (Torous et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "With research increasingly showing the valuable insights that social media data can yield about mental health states, greater attention to the ethical concerns with using individual data in this way is necessary (Chancellor, Birnbaum, Caine, Silenzio, & De Choudhury, 2019).",
              "For instance, data is typically captured from social media platforms without the consent or awareness of users (Bidargaddi et al.",
              ", 2017), which is especially crucial when the data relates to a socially stigmatizing health condition such as mental illness (Guntuku, Yaden, Kern, Ungar, & Eichstaedt, 2017).",
              "Precautions are needed to ensure that data is not made identifiable in ways that were not originally intended by the user who posted the content, as this could place an individual at risk of harm or divulge sensitive health information (Webb et al.",
              ", 2017;",
              "Williams, Burnap, & Sloan, 2017).",
              "Promising approaches for minimizing these risks include supporting the participation of individuals with expertise in privacy, clinicians, as well as the target individuals with mental illness throughout the collection of data, development of predictive algorithms, and interpretation of findings (Chancellor et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "In recognizing that many individuals living with mental illness use social media to search for information about their mental health, it is possible that they may also want to ask their clinicians about what they find online to check if the information is reliable and trustworthy.",
              "Alternatively, many individuals may feel embarrassed or reluctant to talk to their clinicians about using social media to find mental health information out of concerns of being judged or dismissed.",
              "Therefore, mental health clinicians may be ideally positioned to talk with their patients about using social media, and offer recommendations to promote safe use of these sites, while also respecting their patients\u2019 autonomy and personal motivations for using these popular platforms. Given the gap in clinical knowledge about the impact of social media on mental health, clinicians should be aware of the many potential risks so that they can inform their patients, while remaining open to the possibility that their patients may also experience benefits through use of these platforms. As awareness of these risks grows, it may be possible that new protections will be put in place by industry or through new policies that will make the social media environment safer.",
              "It is hard to estimate a number needed to treat or harm today given the nascent state of research, which means the patient and clinician need to weigh the choice on a personal level.",
              "Thus offering education and information is an important first step in that process.",
              "As patients increasingly show interest in accessing mental health information or services through social media, it will be necessary for health systems to recognize social media as a potential avenue for reaching or offering support to patients.",
              "This aligns with growing emphasis on the need for greater integration of digital psychiatry, including apps, smartphones, or wearable devices, into patient care and clinical services through institution-wide initiatives and training clinical providers (Hilty, Chan, Torous, Luo, & Boland, 2019).",
              "Within a learning healthcare environment where research and care are tightly intertwined and feedback between both is rapid, the integration of digital technologies into services may create new opportunities for advancing use of social media for mental health.",
              "As highlighted in this commentary, social media has become an important part of the lives of many individuals living with mental disorders.",
              "Many of these individuals use social media to share their lived experiences with mental illness, to seek support from others, and to search for information about treatment recommendations, accessing mental health services, and coping with symptoms (Bucci et al.",

              "As the field of digital mental health advances, the wide reach, ease of access, and popularity of social media platforms could be used to allow individuals in need of mental health services or facing challenges of mental illness to access evidence-based treatment and support.",
              "To achieve this end and to explore whether social media platforms can advance efforts to close the gap in available mental health services in the United States and globally, it will be essential for researchers to work closely with clinicians and with those affected by mental illness to ensure that possible benefits of using social media are carefully weighed against anticipated risks.",

              "Thus, while being socially linked with others helps alleviate stress, worry, and melancholy, a lack of social connection can pose major threats to one's mental health [1].",
              "Over the past 10 years, the rapid emergence of social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others has led to some significant changes in how people connect and communicate (Table 1).",

              "Social media use and mental health may be related, and the displaced behavior theory could assist in clarifying why.",
              "The displaced behavior hypothesis is a psychology theory that suggests people have limited self-control and, when confronted with a challenging or stressful situation, may engage in behaviors that bring instant gratification but are not in accordance with their long-term objectives [6].",
              "In addition, when people are unable to deal with stress in a healthy way, they may act out in ways that temporarily make them feel better but ultimately harm their long-term goals and wellness [7,8].",
              "In the 1990s, social psychologist Roy Baumeister initially suggested the displaced behavior theory [9].",
              "Baumeister suggested that self-control is a limited resource that can be drained over time and that when self-control resources are low, people are more likely to engage in impulsive or self-destructive conduct [9].",
              "This can lead to a cycle of bad behaviors and outcomes, as individuals may engage in behaviors that bring short respite but eventually add to their stress and difficulties [9].",
              "According to the hypothetical terms, those who participate in sedentary behaviors, including social media, engage in fewer opportunities for in-person social interaction, both of which have been demonstrated to be protective against mental illnesses [10].",
              "Social theories, on the other hand, discovered that social media use influences mental health by affecting how people interpret, maintain, and interact with their social network [4].",
              "Numerous studies on social media's effects have been conducted, and it has been proposed that prolonged use of social media sites like Facebook may be linked to negative manifestations and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress [11].",

              "Adolescents are drawn to social networking sites because they allow them to publish pictures, images, and videos on their platforms. It also allows teens to establish friends, discuss ideas, discover new interests, and try out new kinds of self-expression.",
              "Users of these platforms can freely like and comment on posts as well as share them without any restrictions.",
              "Teenagers now frequently post insulting remarks on social media platforms. Adolescents frequently engage in trolling for amusement without recognizing the potentially harmful consequences.",

              "On the other hand, teens can also use social media in a passive manner by \"lurking\" and focusing entirely on the content that is posted by others.",
              "The difference between active and passive social media usage is sometimes criticized as a false dichotomy because it does not necessarily reveal whether a certain activity is goal-oriented or indicative of procrastination [15].",
              "However, the text provides no justification for why this distinction is wrong [16].",
              "For instance, one definition of procrastination is engaging in conversation with other people to put off working on a task that is more important.",
              "The goal of seeing the information created by other people, as opposed to participating with those same individuals, may be to keep up with the lives of friends.",
              "One of the most important distinctions that can be made between the various sorts is whether the usage is social.",

              "Because of this, the impact of social media on the quality of sleep continues to be a substantial risk factor for subsequent mental health disorders in young people, making it an essential topic for the continuation of research in this area [44].",

Given the gap in clinical knowledge about the impact of social media on mental health, clinicians should be aware of the many potential risks so that they can inform their patients, while remaining open to the possibility that their patients may also experience benefits through use of these platforms. As awareness of these risks grows, it may be possible that new protections will be put in place by industry or through new policies that will make the social media environment safer.",

              "These effects are all pretty small, because well-being is relatively stable month-to-month, and a lot of things influence your well-being more than your experiences online, such as whether you have a good job, how much you exercise, and how much sleep you get.",
              "To understand how these effects compare to major events like getting married, having a baby, or losing a loved one, we asked people whether they\u2019d experienced major events in the month between surveys, and measured how much their well-being changed from those events.",
              "The effects of one-on-one communication from strong ties was roughly comparable (though in the opposite direction) to the effect of an illness, and half to a third of the size of divorce or losing a job.",

              "Many studies are cross-sectional, but cross-sectional studies don\u2019t allow you to determine causation.",
              "For example, in a cross-sectional 2010 study, we found that people who spent a lot of time \u201cpassively consuming\u201d feed stories and photos on Facebook were lonelier.",
              "We couldn\u2019t tell if reading stories makes you lonely, or if lonely people spent more time reading online.",
              "Later studies have shown that people sometimes choose to go to Facebook when they\u2019re feeling blue, and that reflecting on close relationships on the site helps them feel better [3,4].",

              "A better approach uses a longitudinal design, where you take into account how lonely someone feels at the start of the study, and how much their loneliness *changes* over time.",
              "The present study uses that technique and finds that loneliness decreases about 3% over time when people have interactions with close friends.",
              "Challenge #2: It\u2019s difficult to report how much time you spend online.",
              "Many studies are survey-based, asking participants how much time they spend on Facebook.",
              "But that\u2019s very difficult to answer.",
              "Figure 3 shows that there\u2019s only a modest correlation between self-reported time spent on Facebook and actual time spent (see also [5]).",
              "And the common perception that the Internet causes loneliness may also jointly bias self-reports of time online and loneliness [6].",
              "Instead, look for studies that collect data from multiple sources, such as a combination of surveys, server logs, a lab study, nanny software, and/or heart-rate monitors (all of which have been used by technology researchers).",
              "Our studies combine surveys with server data to get more accurate measurements of time online.",
              "Figure 3: Surveys measuring how much time people spend on Facebook bear little relationship to how much time they actually spend on Facebook.",
              "Challenge #3: Facebook isn\u2019t a monolith and not all people are the same.",
              "As the present study shows, the effects depend on how you\u2019re using the site, and whom you\u2019re talking to.",
              "Furthermore, people vary in extraversion, optimism, social skills, and technology access.",

              "In a 2013 study [7], we found that for most people, talking with close friends was linked to reductions in stress, but people who said they\u2019d recently lost a job felt *more* stress among close friends.",
              "In a 2011 study, we found that well-being didn\u2019t change after reading feed stories about others.",
              "But for people who said they were uncomfortable communicating face-to-face, their feelings of social capital increased the more they read.",
              "It\u2019s worth taking into account differences in people, differences in how people use the site, and differences in whom they\u2019re talking to.",
              "It is becoming clearer: a great prescription for dealing with life\u2019s travails is social interaction with family and close friends.",
              "Facebook is one way \u2013 given the distance that often separates us from our friends and family \u2013 for people to engage in interactions with people they care about.",

              " When someone sets out to improve their health, they usually take a familiar path: starting a healthy diet, adopting a new workout regimen, getting better sleep, drinking more water.",
              "Each of these behaviors is important, of course, but they all focus on physical health\u2014and a growing body of research suggests that social health is just as, if not more, important to overall well-being.",
              "One 2019 study published in the journal PLOS ONE, for example, found that the strength of a person\u2019s social circle\u2014as measured by inbound and outbound cell phone activity\u2014was a better predictor of self-reported stress, happiness and well-being levels than fitness tracker data on physical activity, heart rate and sleep.",
              "That finding suggests that the \u201cquantified self\u201d portrayed by endless amounts of health data doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, says study co-author Nitesh Chawla, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Notre Dame.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s also a qualified self, which is who I am, what are my activities, my social network, and all of these aspects that are not reflected in any of these measurements,\u201d Chawla says.",

              "Social isolation, meanwhile, is linked to higher rates of chronic diseases and mental health conditions, and may even catalyze cellular-level changes that promote chronic inflammation and suppress immunity.",
              "The detrimental health effects of loneliness have been likened to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.",

              "Unsurprisingly, it found that social media, when used so much that it infringes on face-to-face quality time, was tied to greater loneliness, while having meaningful in-person interactions, reporting high levels of social support and being in a committed relationship were associated with less loneliness.",
              "Gender and income didn\u2019t seem to have a strong effect, but loneliness tended to decrease with age, perhaps because of the wisdom and perspective afforded by years of life lived, says Dr.",

              "Reviving a dormant social life may be best and most easily done by finding partners for enjoyable activities like exercising, volunteering, or sharing a meal, he says.",
              "\u201cReal, face-to-face time with people [is important], and the activity part of it makes it fun and enjoyable and gives people an excuse to get together,\u201d Lustig says.",
              "Lustig emphasizes that social media should be used judiciously and strategically, and not as a replacement for in-person relationships.",
              "Instead, he says, we should use technology \u201cto seek out meaningful connections and people that you are going to be able to keep in your social sphere.",
              "It\u2019s easy enough to find groups such as Meetups, or to find places to go where you\u2019ll find folks doing what you want to do.",
              "\u201d That advice is particularly important for young people, he says, for whom heavy social media use is common.",
              "Finally, Lustig stresses that even small social changes can have a large impact.",
              "Striking up post-meeting conversations with co-workers, or even engaging in micro-interactions with strangers, can make your social life feel more rewarding.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to grow those kinds of quick exchanges into conversations and into more meaningful friendships over time,\u201d Lustig says.",
              "\u201cPeople should take those opportunities wherever they possibly can, because all of us, innately, are wired from birth to connect\u201d\u2014and because doing so may pay dividends for your health.",
