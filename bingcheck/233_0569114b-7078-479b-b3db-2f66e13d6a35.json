    "query": "What is the most effective method for reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale events, such as music festivals or sporting events, and what efforts have been made in recent years to implement sustainable practices in these settings?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. According to the web sources I found, the most effective method for reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale events depends on the type and scale of the event, but some common strategies are:\n\n- Reducing travel emissions by encouraging public transportation, carpooling, biking or walking to the event. Travel is often the single biggest contributor to an event's carbon footprint, accounting for about 90% of the emissions from an average event[^3^]. For example, a study estimated that the 2019 NCAA March Madness basketball tournament generated 463 million pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, mostly from air travel[^6^].\n- Reducing digital emissions by optimizing data transfers, using renewable energy sources, and choosing energy-efficient devices and servers. Digital technologies can also have a significant environmental impact, especially for large-scale computing projects that require a lot of computer power. For instance, an astrophysicist estimated that running a supercomputer for his research takes as much energy as 10,000 households[^2^].\n- Reducing waste emissions by minimizing packaging, using reusable or biodegradable materials, recycling and composting. Waste generation can also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, especially if it ends up in landfills where it produces methane. For example, a study found that waste disposal accounted for 4% of the emissions from the 2012 London Olympics[^4^].\n\nSome efforts have been made in recent years to implement sustainable practices in large-scale events, such as:\n\n- Shifting meetings and conventions online or to a hybrid model, which can reduce their carbon footprint by 94% or 67%, respectively[^8^]. This has become more feasible and popular due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the availability of online platforms.\n- Using carbon offsetting schemes, which involve investing in projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere. For example, some music festivals and sporting events offer their attendees the option to purchase carbon offsets when they buy their tickets or travel arrangements[^3^].\n- Adopting green certification standards, which provide guidelines and recognition for events that meet certain environmental criteria. For example, some events follow the ISO 20121 standard for sustainable event management or the APEX/ASTM standard for green meetings[^3^].\n\nI hope this answer helps you learn more about the carbon footprint of large-scale events and how to reduce it. \ud83d\ude0a",

              "Indeed, most algorithms are run multiple times \u2013 sometimes even many hundreds of times with different parameters \u2013 and the number can vary greatly depending on the task and the research field (figure 3).",

              "Kotera cautions that their figures are not precise as there are many unknowns, while van der Tak is unsure how much data storage and transfer is covered by the carbon footprint analysis of Dutch astronomy, adding that it might be something they need to look at.",
              "Particle physicists need to do their bit too.",
              "CERN, for example, produces around 100 petabytes of data every year.",

              "This is a good project-finance practice, but it also provides an opportunity to locate projects where they have the biggest impact by replacing high-carbon generation.",
              "Curiously, this flexibility has not always been used to its full extent.",
              "Despite the global reach of these companies, their renewable purchases and investments have tended to be concentrated in the countries where their servers are located \u2013 the United States and Northwestern Europe.",
              "However this raises the important question of additionality: would the increase in renewables have taken place in the absence of the tech companies\u2019 commitments?",
              "There are even examples of a big tech company contracting from committed projects, when it was already almost certain that the project would be completed anyway.",
              "In the United States, wind and solar projects benefit from federal tax credits, so arguably it is US taxpayers who should be thanked for them.",
              "In Europe, the main target countries happen to be ones where a combination of strong policies and successful grid integration lead to an exceptionally strong investor appetite for renewable projects.",
              "In an environment ultra low interest rates, renewables in these countries already enjoy a very low cost of capital.",
              "In other words, if a big tech company does not finance a particular wind farm, someone else probably will.",
              "These companies could make even greater use of their financial strength to underwrite renewable investments where they are needed most: in developing and emerging economies where coal is still seen as essential for energy security and renewable investments are hindered by capital scarcity.",
              "Data demand will grow rapidly in emerging economies over the coming decades, requiring new data centres in these regions to serve growing demand.",
              "This is an opportunity that could be built into new climate pledges by companies.",
              "Yet the biggest opportunity for tech companies is to leverage their power to bring fundamental changes throughout the energy system, beyond just their own supply.",
              "There are five areas where the combination of their skills, scale and commitment could become transformative.",
              "Wind and solar PV are driving the growth of low-carbon electricity supply, even if the large majority of energy consumption remains the direct use of fossil fuels in vehicles or factories.",
              "Hence, there is a general consensus that shifting to greater use of electricity across the economy coupled with the scaling up of wind and solar is a key pillar of transitioning to clean energy.",
              "But there is a problem: wind and solar power vary with the weather.",
              "Societies rely on uninterrupted electricity supplies \u2013 the digital economy even more than its \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d counterpart.",

              "As things stand, big tech companies are increasingly seeking to advance their zero-carbon commitments by investing in hydrogen and battery storage on top of wind and solar to ensure their data centres are supplied 24/7 by clean electricity.",
              "This is useful, but system operators need to balance interconnected systems, not individual corporate users.",
              "Big tech companies could play an even bigger role in decarbonising the grid by adopting more flexible operations such as shifting workloads to match renewable generation or acting as a demand response resource.",
              "In addition, advanced digital technologies could help decarbonise the broader grid in a few ways: Advanced digitalisation is essential to optimise asset utilisation and enhance flexibility, and the big tech companies are already active in this field.",
              "Some of them have conducted in-house research on renewable forecasting and made acquisitions and invested venture capital into demand response and other smart energy technologies.",
              "However, unrealised opportunities remain: compared with the resources and commitment that these companies have dedicated to the expansion of their core activities, their smart energy investments have remained small and often lack strategic focus.",
              "Most of the innovation in the digital-energy nexus is driven either by start-ups or by the digital activities of conventional electricity network operators.",
              "Given the widespread policy concerns about the impact of big tech companies on competition, it is good that the digital energy field is so open to new entrants.",
              "Nevertheless, a more proactive stance by the tech giants would be welcome.",
              "In the case of flexible, co\u2010ordinated electric car charging, the technology itself is already there, but implementation is being held up by transaction costs and a lack of co\u2010ordination among key stakeholders.",
              "The ability of the big tech companies to apply smart solutions at scale, promote harmonised standards, and reduce transaction costs could play a major role.",
              "Electricity was the transformative technology of the second industrial revolution a century ago, and it can be a transformative field for today\u2019s tech giants as well.",
              "Wind and solar PV will no doubt do a lot of the heavy lifting, but they will need help from other clean energy technologies for a successful net zero transition.",
              "It is simply not possible to replace every joule of fossil energy with the equivalent joule of a low\u2010carbon source in a copy-paste fashion.",
              "The energy transition will have to involve speeding up energy efficiency across the board.",
              "Some of this is not high tech: old-school building insulation projects are still very relevant.",

              "Big tech companies have important experience and skills to build upon.",
              "As part of the effort to reduce their direct carbon footprint, they have taken a hard look at their own operations.",
              "Recent years have witnessed a remarkable decoupling between data use, internet traffic and electricity use, thanks to efficiency improvements in computing and infrastructure as well as a shift to greater shares of cloud and hyperscale data centres.",
              "However, with hyperscale data centre energy use by big tech companies growing rapidly, even stronger efficiency improvements are needed to limit energy demand growth over the next decade.",
              "This experience can be leveraged outside data centres as well.",
              "A major challenge for building energy efficiency is that retrofitting old buildings is time-consuming and difficult to scale up.",
              "There are promising examples of using machine learning to overcome this.",
              "Examples ranging from a 200-year-old European opera house to a luxury resort in California show that connected devices, use of sensors, real-time measurements, and fine-tuned controls can deliver major energy savings.",
              "In the transport sector, digital solutions to optimise truck operations and logistics could reduce energy use and emissions from road freight by a quarter.",
              "Given that heavy duty, long-distance trucking still relies on the diesel engine, this is an important contribution.",
              "Major e-business operations have pioneered the use of optimised logistics, which can be provided as a third party service as well.",
              "While electrification and raising the share of wind and solar generation is going to be the overarching theme of transitioning to net zero, the overall energy system remains complex, with substantial emissions in hard-to-decarbonise, non-electrified sectors.",
              "The big tech companies can play a major role there as well.",
              "First of all, while their technology is digital, they can have surprisingly large physical operations: the carbon footprint of a smartphone starts with heavy machinery in a copper mine.",
              "In the summer of 2020, while the passenger aviation industry was collapsing due to the Covid shock, e-business maintained a robust flow of cargo airplanes from Chinese producers to European and American consumers.",
              "Big tech companies have only recently started to seek out low-carbon alternatives for their products.",
              "The development of materials made using innovative low carbon technologies suffered a decade of under-investment as both the energy industry and venture capital firms struggled to create viable business models for scaling up.",
              "The big tech companies are well positioned to step in: low-carbon plastics might be prohibitively expensive as undifferentiated commodity products, but their cost is a rounding error in the value of a tablet.",
              "Big tech companies can play a leading role in bridging the \u201cvalley of death\u201d for such products by drawing on their high value\u2010added applications, their balance sheets and their risk-taking abilities.",
              "The most promising examples have a two-pronged approach: the company provides venture capital funding for the R&D and scale up, and also acts as the anchor consumer for the new low\u2010carbon product.",
              "This has been applied for low\u2010carbon aluminium processes for smartphone manufacturing and electric trucks to be used for e-business deliveries.",
              "Some of the tech giants are now extending their climate commitments to their past emissions.",
              "In addition to carbon offsets, attention is shifting towards direct air capture technology, which has seen recent examples of venture capital investments by Big Tech.",
              "Given the emissions locked into existing energy infrastructure and the inertia of the energy system, it is highly likely that large-scale use of direct air capture will be needed.",
              "Big tech companies can play an instrumental role in helping the development and early deployment of direct air capture and other carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies.",
              "They can also catalyse the scaling up of other key clean energy technologies including green hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, advanced nuclear and geothermal.",

              "The first practical solar panels didn\u2019t appear until the 1960s in space exploration, and only now is solar PV starting to transform the electricity sector.",
              "Unfortunately, the technologies on the market now can take us only halfway to a net zero energy system, and we don\u2019t have a century to wait to bridge the technological gaps.",
              "The development and mass deployment of new energy technologies will have to accelerate at an unprecedented speed to reach net-zero emissions globally by 2050.",
              "One of the most transformative roles Big Tech could play is to accelerate the innovation process itself.",

              "People are unlikely to give up on their modern comforts.",
              "Still, IEA analysis for a pathway towards reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 in the World Energy Outlook 2020 suggests that around 2 billion tonnes of emission reductions can be achieved in 2030 by simple social and behavioural changes such as flying less, setting air conditioners to slightly higher temperatures or leaving the car in the garage and walking or cycling short distances.",
              "Big tech consumer products could greatly facilitate these behavioural changes by making them comfortable and even cool.",

              "Indeed, most algorithms are run multiple times \u2013 sometimes even many hundreds of times with different parameters \u2013 and the number can vary greatly depending on the task and the research field (figure 3).",
              "The research also found that the emissions of computing in South Africa, as well as some states in the US, are similar to Australia.",
              "On the other hand, the carbon intensity of electricity in Iceland, Norway and Sweden is particularly low.",
              "With cloud computing it is now much easier for researchers to choose which supercomputer they use.",
              "But if they are unable to switch to a different machine, there are still other ways they can reduce their emissions.",

              "He says that none of the codes were particularly optimized, and each took a similar amount of time to write.",
              "But Python, the most popular coding language among physicists, takes a lot longer to run and so produces more emissions than other languages, such as C++ or Fortran.",
              "The issue, according to Portegies Zwart, is that Python is extremely easy to use, but hard to optimize, while other languages are harder to code, but easier to optimize.",

              "In response to Portegies Zwart\u2019s paper, CNRS researcher Pierre Augier argued that better education and the use of Python compilers could be just as effective.",

              "Kotera and her colleagues found that data storage and transfer will account for roughly half of total annual emissions in the prototype stage of the experiment, a quarter in the mid-stage and more than a third during the full-scale experiment (Astroparticle Phys.",

              "The carbon footprint of data storage and transfer comes from the energy demands of data centres.",
              "As with supercomputers, data storage can be tackled to an extent by using data centres with lower emissions.",
              "Kotera says that the GRAND project will also be looking at strategies to reduce the volume of data.",

              "By working with the site's caterers, packaging suppliers and waste-management providers, Stubbs and his colleagues are confident that they have an \"end-to-end process\" that will give them a precise idea of what comes into the park and what goes out of it.",
              "The key to the Olympic disposal and recycling lies in the 4,000 or so colour-coded bins that dot the park \u2013 and, later in the Barking waste-sorting site where it will all be processed.",
              "\"The bins are very striking and are hard to miss,\" he says.",
              "\"We're hoping that people will just take half a second to read the labels on them and realise that the orange mark on their cup or plate actually represents the orange of the compostable stream and that goes in there with the food waste and then the bottles and any dry paper go in the recycling bin.\"",
              "Once the bins are full, the colour-coded sacks are taken to a \"materials recovery facility\" in Barking which is the dedicated destination for all London 2012's Games-time waste.",
              "Equally pressing given the gargantuan amount of human waste that the Games will produce has been the need to sit down and think about how the park's 362 toilet blocks work and how much water they will use.",
              "According to Stubbs, a variety of technologies old and new have been deployed to save water and honour London 2012's long-term commitment to reduce the amount of potable water consumed.",
              "He points to the Velodrome's low-flow appliances and waterless urinals, and to the rainwater-harvesting apparatus installed in some venues.",
              "But perhaps the park's biggest water-saving device is the new treatment plant that opened earlier this year, and which helps cut water use in the first place.",
              "The plant, which mines raw sewage direct from the Northern Outfall sewer that runs along the southern end of the site, uses biomembranes to clean the sewage to a non-potable standard.",
              "Thanks to a dual pipe network, the resultant water \u2013 \"it's clear but you wouldn't want to drink it,\" says Stubbs \u2013 is then used to flush loos in the park and to irrigate the four, continentally-themed flower gardens.",
              "Although he concedes that no two host cities are the same, Stubbs hopes that many of the technological approaches and sustainable philosophies that have underpinned London 2012 will help the organisers of future Games.",
              "That may explain why he is so oddly enthusiastic about what happens when the Games finally end.",
              "\"It's almost like washing up after a party,\" he says.",
              "\"It's not the most pleasant thing but in a perverse way, I'm actually quite looking forward to that because I think we've got a great story to tell and I really want to get some of the detail to flesh it out and then to do that transfer of knowledge because there are so many valuable tricks of the trade that we don't just want to wither away and then let others have to rediscover from zero.\""

              "9 Examples of Carbon Offset Projects | Aspiration",
              "No matter where your organization is on your journey to net zero, awareness of your carbon footprint is a crucial step towards mitigating your own environmental impacts.",
              "Once you understand your carbon footprint and take actions to reduce your scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, you can then consider mitigating your unavoidable emissions by investing in high-quality carbon credits.",
              "Carbon credits equal one ton of CO2 emissions (that\u2019s about the equivalent of 2,482 miles driven by an average gasoline-powered passenger vehicle) avoided or captured by a carbon project.",
              "Carbon projects goes through a rigorous verification process by an international carbon standard, and in Aspiration\u2019s case, through our own rigorous vetting process as well.",
              "However, there are many types of carbon projects that produce these credits.",
              "Broadly speaking, there are two major types of carbon offset projects;",
              "nature-based projects, and non-nature based projects.",
              "In this guide, we\u2019ll explore 9 different carbon offset examples and take a deep dive into the different types of carbon offset projects that support decarbonization, but also have additional environmental or social co-benefits that are in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.",
              "Nature-based solutions (NbS) projects produce credits based on either the carbon captured by new trees or by the carbon not released through the protection of forests.",
              "These projects exist all around the world, from growing forests right here in the US to replanting mangroves in Nigeria or rewilding the rainforests of Brazil.",
              "Nature-based projects protect and restore the Earth\u2019s largest carbon sinks in our forests and soils.",
              "Nature based projects have several advantages, such as the many benefits they offer outside of carbon.",
              "Protecting ecosystems, wildlife, and social heritage is significant for companies offsetting their carbon emissions for the corporate social responsibility element.",
              "NbS projects that get certified by VCM carbon standards (and generate carbon credits) generally fall into three main categories: Forestry projects are the reigning champs \u2014 they provide the vast majority of NbS credits in the VCM, and are generally considered to have the greatest potential to deliver climate change mitigation along with other benefits.",
              "They can include: Agricultural projects are another major NbS category, which includes: Wetlands projects \u2014 including coastal wetlands and peatlands \u2014 get extra points for holding the greatest amount of carbon stocks per unit area of any ecosystem.",
              "Often referred to as Blue Carbon, these types of projects include: Let\u2019s dive deeper into these project types.",
              "These are the most well-known nature-based carbon capture projects in the market.",
              "These carbon offset projects aim to restore degraded or barren land by planting trees.",
              "They create forests on land that may have been unforested or regenerate forests that have been deforested either by human activities or natural disasters.",
              "Reforestation and afforestation projects provide important co-benefits outside of carbon capture, including supporting biodiversity, improving water filtration in the soil, and providing jobs to the local communities.",
              "The lifetime of a reforestation or afforestation project typically ranges from 20-100 years, with a ramp-up period of carbon capture in the first years of the projects as trees mature and begin absorbing carbon in biomass.",
              "This project type also has a sub-category: agroforestry.",
              "Agroforestry projects combine trees that can produce fruits and nuts and crops on the same plot of land, enabling mostly small shareholder farmers to make the most out of their land while also capturing carbon in the plants and soil.",
              "These practices can store significantly more carbon than conventional agriculture[1].",
              "Co-benefits of this type of project vary from increased income for farmers and overall economic growth in the involved communities, food security and biodiversity support.",
              "When forests are degraded, they can become a source of greenhouse gas emissions by releasing the carbon that has been stored in their organic matter and soil.",
              "It is estimated that deforestation accounts for around 10% of global CO2 emissions[2].",
              "Forest conservation projects avoid these emissions by ensuring forests are protected from deforestation.",
              "Forest conservation projects \u2013 such as REDD+ (Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation PLUS the sustainable management of forests and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) projects \u2013 prevent the loss of existing forests by protecting or enhancing forest cover.",
              "These projects protect forests from unplanned deforestation \u2013 deforestation caused by local communities through agriculture or illegal logging;",
              "or from planned deforestation \u2013 from commercial activities that deforest the area such as crop plantation or cattle ranches.",
              "Forest conservation projects provide co-benefits that positively impact biodiversity and local communities by providing protection to local species, including endangered species and additional income streams to local communities and employment.",
              "Blue carbon projects follow similar practices as the project types described above but with a focus on carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems. These projects can include mangroves restoration and conservation as well as other wetlands ecosystems such as seagrass or most recently kelp.",
              "These projects have the capacity of capturing large amounts of carbon not only in the aerial biomass but also in the soils, this is particularly true for mangroves.",
              "Blue carbon projects have recently received a lot of attention mostly due to the vast benefits they provide.",
              "These projects offer climate change mitigation benefits preventing erosion, and absorbing storm surge impacts during extreme weather events.",
              "Mangroves are ideal breeding grounds for fish and shellfish as they provide shelter for young species before they move to open waters.",
              "Not only do they support marine biodiversity but are also an important ecosystem for birds and reptiles.",
              "Agricultural land takes up approximately 38% of the global land surface and is a large contributor to GHG emissions at 11.",
              "2% of total emissions in the US[3][4].",
              "To combat this problem, regenerative agriculture projects implement soil-enhancing practices that capture carbon in the soil creating carbon sinks in agricultural land.",
              "These projects not only help in capturing carbon through practices such as crop rotation, no tilling, or reducing synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, but they also increase yields and help farmers have more productive land, also helping create more sustainable food security.",
              "Grassland management projects support land managers and pastoralists around the world to implement practices that increase the potential for the soil to capture additional soil organic carbon.",
              "The practices include strategic rotational grazing systems, reduce days grazed on all pastures and prioritize rest on grasslands.",
              "The result is healthier grass, greater root depth and increased soil carbon resulting in increased infiltration and retention of precipitation.",
              "There are also non-nature-based projects that support decarbonization efforts, though they currently are not a major source of carbon credits in the VCM due to pricing and scale challenges.",
              "Nonetheless, these projects capture or avoid carbon dioxide emissions through manmade technologies and many expect them to play an increasingly important role n creating a net zero world.",
              "Let\u2019s dive into the main types of non-nature projects.",
              "These projects generate energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar, decarbonizing the grid and reducing the dependency on fossil fuels such as coal and oil.",
              "The carbon credits are calculated by the number of emissions avoided by replacing energy produced by fossil fuels.",
              "These projects have additional benefits such as providing energy efficiency, improving air quality, creating job opportunities, and sharing knowledge with locals to develop new technical skills.",
              "In rural or underdeveloped communities, the use of open fires for cooking is common.",
              "This not only is a danger to community members but also is a large contributor to GHG emissions and local deforestation.",
              "Household devices such as efficient cookstoves and water filters provide equipment that either reduces the amount of fuel used or completely eliminates it.",
              "These projects offer many benefits to rural communities such as health benefits from the smoke reduction in homes, reduce deforestation in the local forests, and families, specifically women, spend less time and money on wood and charcoal for fuel.",
              "A waste management project often involves capturing methane and converting it into a reliable energy source.",
              "Sometimes this means capturing methane emitted through the decomposition of waste in landfills, or in smaller villages, human or agricultural waste.",
              "In this way, waste management projects can impact local communities by reducing air pollution and bad smells, reducing contact with waste, and reducing potential safety hazards such as landfill gas explosions.",
              "These projects include technologies that capture CO2 emissions from the air (direct air capture, or DAC) and either store it geologically or use it for different purposes.",
              "These carbon removal projects are currently costly to scale and as such, have not been tested at scale.",
              "These credits exist today but have not been certified by an international standard, like all the previous carbon reduction project types, and are in very short supply.",
              "There also exists a number of up and coming carbon removal technologies, such as biochar (a cross between a NBS and technological project) and carbonated cement, to name a few.",
              "These projects are still at a very early stage and have yet to scale.",

              "To opponents, carbon credits and carbon trading are a distraction while we dither over the systemic reforms. To supporters, offsetting and the sale of carbon credits produce a flow of money to developing countries to help them preserve carbon sinks and develop their economies along low-carbon lines.",
              "Can\u2019t we just plant more trees?",
              "Planting more trees is one answer, and there are plans in many countries to do so.",

              "So the same people who cut down the forest get money for leaving some bits standing.",

              "At least certification schemes require monitoring and frequent evaluation, so that companies can more easily be held to account.",

              "But in the absence of a global system that rewards forested nations for preserving their forests, and monitors their success in doing so, offsetting does provide a source of income and protection to some areas, and at least some form of monitoring and accountability to ensure that companies are sticking to their commitments.",
              "What are the long-term solutions?",
              "Carbon offsets can only ever be a sticking plaster, not a cure.",

              "Sustainability Eileen Wennekers January 25th, 2022 at 7:00 AM EST While increased demand for eco-conscious products can sometimes push down costs by allowing economies of scale to develop, it can also inflate prices when that demand outpaces the growth in supply.",
              "For example, event planners might be able to purchase biodegradable tableware more affordably now as compared to ten years ago, but rocketing demand for carbon offsets is currently pushing their costs through the roof.",
              "Is there a way to bring prices down, or can event profs develop their own investment strategy for reducing event carbon emissions?",
              "The carbon offset system depends on projects that help to reduce atmospheric carbon levels, such as tree-planting initiatives.",
              "These programs are given credits that they can then trade to organizations looking to compensate for their own additions to the world\u2019s carbon balance sheet.",
              "Although there\u2019s theoretically no limit to the number of carbon credits that can be assigned, the global supply of worthy programs is currently struggling to keep up with demand.",
              "Last November\u2019s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) helped to push more and more organizations to commit to \u201cnet zero\u201d emissions \u2014 including a significant segment of the event industry with the Net Zero Carbon Events Pledge.",
              "An unintended consequence, however, has been the tripling of carbon offset prices in the span of roughly six months.",
              "Given that many industries worldwide rely on carbon offsets to meet their sustainability goals, the jump in offset pricing has serious significance for both event planners and their clients.",
              "What\u2019s the solution?",
              "In a LinkedIn post published earlier this January, sustainability consultant Shawna McKinley suggested an alternative model for the event industry: The price of nature-based carbon offsets has increased more than threefold in the last six months.",
              "In walking a path to \u201cnet zero\u201d business events, does it make sense to pay ~$15 per event participant to offset somewhere else?",
              "Or set an internal price on carbon at a similar amount that invests in solutions that directly reduce an event\u2019s actual emissions?",
              "And what would those solutions be?",
              "\u2013 Shawna McKinley, principal, Clear Current Consulting In a sense, McKinley is proposing that event planners look for ways to bring the \u201csupply\u201d of carbon-reducing programs in house.",
              "Can they create their own systems for reducing emissions that are more cost-effective than relying on the global trade in carbon offsets?",
              "As McKinley points out, redirecting revenue from registration fees and ticket sales towards offsetting carbon somewhere else is not the only way to achieve net-zero events.",
              "We reached out to McKinley to hear more about the ideas behind her LinkedIn post, what implementing a more nuanced net-zero strategy might look like for event profs, and how \u201ccarbon pricing\u201d might work in place of or in tandem with purchasing carbon offsets.",
              "Essentially, carbon pricing is a mechanism where a company assigns an internal cost to activities that produce emissions.",
              "By thinking of their carbon production through the lens of a dollar figure, companies can perform a cost-benefit analysis that truly accounts for the consequences of neglecting more sustainable choices in everyday decision making.",
              "\u201c[A]n event supplier or planner would adopt an internal monetary value for carbon, and factor that into budgeting in order to support climate-smart decision making in their day-to-day operations,\u201d explains McKinley.",
              "McKinley points to Microsoft\u2019s plan to become carbon negative by 2030 as an example of where carbon pricing is being used to drive operations towards net zero.",
              "While Microsoft has committed $1 billion USD over the next four years to taking carbon out of the atmosphere \u2014 funding technological solutions like Direct Air Capture alongside more established nature-based offsets \u2014 they have also committed to using carbon math and internal pricing to track and manage their plan to eliminate their own carbon footprint.",
              "Microsoft believes that it\u2019s entirely possible to reach its goal of net-zero by 2030, and carbon pricing is a key part of its plan.",
              "This means: It\u2019s also important for this internal pricing to reflect the real-world cost of these emissions.",
              "One strategy is to figure out the level of emissions, calculate what it would cost to buy compensating carbon offsets, and then set an internal \u201ctax\u201d that matches the carbon-offset price.",
              "As Microsoft reported last year, it\u2019s already achieved an emissions reduction of 6 percent across the board, and based on this progress, the company believes it will meet or exceed its 2030 goal.",
              "McKinley suggests that this method can also be adopted by both vendors and event planners to achieve their net-zero commitments.",
              "Most typically, \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d approaches calculate an event\u2019s carbon footprint, and then either purchase offset credits (e.",
              "g. renewable energy certificates) or invest in supporting local projects that will remove carbon from the atmosphere (restoring forests, peatlands and other ecosystems, for example).",
              "While these actions are significant, McKinley points out that they don\u2019t result in long-term changes in a company\u2019s behavior that actively reduce emissions: \u201cWhen we only tally carbon and pay for it through offsets for an event as a public relations exercise, event-related businesses miss out on using that capital to innovate in ways that drive down their own direct emissions and reduce costs long-term.",
              "\u201d Though the principle stays the same, implementing carbon pricing will look different in different scenarios.",
              "In the case of a hotel, McKinley describes calculating the total carbon footprint per room and extrapolating that to a monthly carbon price for the hotel\u2019s operations.",
              "That price could be built into the cost of a room, and then charged by the hotel internally against itself.",
              "In turn, the resulting funds could be invested in retrofitting rooms or providing bikes or electric shuttle buses for guest use.",
              "This approach would bring down overall emissions in a way that is reliably trackable and straightforward for clients to understand.",
              "Further, it will be cost-effective in the long run: It will not only reduce the need for purchasing carbon offsets but in many cases will also lower energy bills.",
              "Event-related travel Noting that it\u2019s likely air travel that produces the most significant carbon impact for event planning agencies and their staffing, McKinley suggests that agencies require employees to provide information about the carbon footprint for each of their travel options.",
              "Their travel manager can then factor sustainability directly into cost considerations.",
              "For example, direct flights are often more expensive than those with multiple stops, but they are also more fuel-efficient.",
              "With the extra carbon pricing factored in, the seemingly pricier flight may actually be cheaper.",
              "Similarly, travel managers could sometimes offer a bonus for itineraries that reduce carbon (for instance, by taking a train instead of a short-haul flight).",
              "While event profs are not usually directly involved in the travel decisions of their attendees, they can encourage these kinds of best practices.",
              "Event suppliers, venues, and price hikes Further, event planners can work with clients to source amenities and vendors that are carbon-budget friendly.",
              "McKinley offers the example of providing plant-based event catering as a default, with the option to add on meat dishes at an extra price that makes it possible to \u201caccount for the higher emissions associated with that decision.",
              "\u201d Challenges to fair and transparent carbon pricing The example above, however, points towards a difficulty associated with net-zero event planning.",
              "In the absence of an established and standardized system for carbon pricing of emissions, it can be difficult to achieve the sort of transparency around climate action that shareholders, employees, and customers increasingly require.",
              "The calculations can feel a bit ad-hoc.",
              "Nonetheless, McKinley believes \u201cthere is merit to looking at carbon pricing as a tool for setting registration and ticket prices for new events\u201d, not least because \u201cit forces us to quantify and figure out how to roll out lower-carbon business practices that better respond to the true cost of doing business.",
              "\u201d The need for a reliable \u201ccarbon calculator\u201d is something that several firms are moving to meet.",
              "Microsoft, for example, has developed a calculator to help its clients understand the emissions associated with using Microsoft products.",
              "Through these kinds of accessible tools and a new standard for transparency, Microsoft is positioning itself as a more attractive vendor for a large range of partners and clients working towards the same goals.",
              "In another interesting development, British Petroleum (BP) has put out a tookit for event planners designed to help calculate an event\u2019s emissions, reduce them as much as possible, and purchase offsets from BP once carbon-budget calculations have been finalized.",
              "Of course, British Petroleum is arguably an unexpected ally in the fight for net-zero carbon emissions.",
              "In terms of public-facing perception of climate action (and regardless of whether the impression is accurate), BP\u2019s toolkit for event profs points towards a significant concern: allegations of greenwashing.",
              "Both the perception and the reality of greenwashing will remain significant hazards for event planners until there is a recognized global standard that makes it easy to communicate transparently about how event planning decisions are making a tangible difference.",
              "While there are promising developments on the horizon for the regulation of both carbon pricing and the carbon offset market, event profs can\u2019t afford to wait on those.",
              "The carbon pricing model, while not without its challenges, allows planners to engage in observable changes locally, rather than through abstract carbon offsets that clients and attendees can\u2019t see.",
              "The precise dollar value assigned to carbon pricing initiatives may be up for debate, but at least the resulting sustainability programs have a clear and immediate impact on events themselves.",
              "This in-house approach may go a long way towards helping event attendees feel like they \u2014 and the companies hosting or exhibiting at the event \u2014 are doing what they can to do their part.",
              "\u201cFor a long time,\u201d McKinley notes, \u201cevents have not been pressed to make carbon disclosures and have flown under the radar.",
              "Now, however, meetings and travel are under a microscope and organizations are re-assessing how both contribute and detract from emissions reduction goals.",
              "\u201d When faced with all the challenges that come with any net-zero initiative, some event planners might be tempted to question whether it\u2019s all worth it.",
              "As we noted last month, however, 2022 will see a continuing trend towards clients prioritizing sustainability at their events.",
              "This trend is driven by multiple factors.",
              "For one, shareholders are getting involved in corporate governance to push environmental and social responsibility.",
              "Environmental proposals and demands for emissions transparency and climate action plans have become a common feature at AGMs, with broad (and broadening) shareholder support.",
              "Corporate boards ignore this movement at their peril.",
              "We can look to the recent shakeup at Exxon to see that failing to take action on climate change is not an option.",

              "It is also commonly understood that the standards were championed by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Green Meeting Industry Council (GMIC).",

              "Additionally, within each standard, there are 2 separate sets of specifications: one pertaining to event planners and another to event suppliers.",
              "Finally, there are 4 degrees of performance or \u201clevels\u201d that a company can achieve, each with very clear qualifying metrics.",
              "Finally, like other standards, the APEX/ASTM standards allow companies to claim 1st party, 2nd party, or 3rd party certification.",
              "Depending on the scope of your operations, you choose the standards that apply to your company or event.",
              "For instance, a supplier, such as a venue, may use the Food and Beverage standard in addition to the Meeting Venue one, if they have an in-house catering service.",
              "On the other hand, a planner organizing a small event like a speakers series may choose to use a few more of the standards like Audio-Visual, Communications and Marketing Material, and Transportation.",
              "They simply proceed through the standards, checking off whichever specifications they have met and making note of the ones that need attention.",
              "The APEX/ASTM standards represent a considerable achievement for the sustainable events industry.",
              "Not only is this evident from the 200+ volunteers listed on the CIC website, who were involved in the development of the standard, but in the very fact that they could even come to define such specific performance metrics for environmental sustainability.",
              "Events, by their very nature, are complex and unique from one another.",
              "Despite this, the APEX/ASTM standards do a great job of identifying the environmental impacts of events and prescribing industry best practice for improvement.",
