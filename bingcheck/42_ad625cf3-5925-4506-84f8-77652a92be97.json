              "\"We don't want to be one of those single planet species, we want to be a multi-planet species,\" Musk said on Friday, speaking after the company launched its Crew-2 mission to orbit.",
              "\"It's been now almost half a century since humans were last on the moon.",
              "That's too long, we need to get back there and have a permanent base on the moon \u2014 again, like a big permanently occupied base on the moon.",
              "And then build a city on Mars to become a spacefaring civilization, a multi-planet species,\" Musk also said.",
              "Starship is the enormous stainless steel rocket that SpaceX has been building and testing at its development facility in Boca Chica, Texas.",
              "Starship's goal is to launch cargo and people on missions to the moon and Mars.",
              "Current Starship prototypes stand at about 150 feet tall, or about the size of a 15-story building, and each one is powered by three Raptor rocket engines.",
              "Musk has previously estimated that it will cost about $5 billion to fully develop Starship, although SpaceX has not disclosed how much it has spent on the program to date.",
              "The company has steadily raised funds in the past few years, to fund both Starship and its similarly ambitious Starlink project, with SpaceX's valuation soaring to about $74 billion \u2014 making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world.",
              "Additionally, SpaceX last week won a $2.",
              "9 billion contract from NASA, to help the space agency land astronauts on the moon's surface with the first crewed mission targeting 2024.",
              "\"[Starship has] mostly been funded internally thus far and it's pretty expensive.",
              "As you can tell, if you've been watching videos, we've blown up a few of them,\" Musk said.",
              "The company has performed multiple successful test flights of Starship, although landing attempts after the last four high-altitude flights ended in fiery explosions.",
              "Despite the the prototypes' destruction, SpaceX sees the test flights as progress toward creating a rocket that is fully reusable.",
              "SpaceX's current Falcon fleet of rockets is partially reusable, as the company can land and reuse the rocket's boosters.",
              "But Musk hopes Starship transforms space travel into something more akin to commercial air travel.",
              "The rocket's enormous size would also make it capable of launching several times as much cargo at once \u2014 for comparison, while SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets can send as many as 60 Starlink satellites at a time, SpaceX says Starship will be able to launch 400 Starlink satellites at a time.",
              "Musk remains \"highly confident\" that SpaceX will land humans on Mars by 2026, saying last December that it's an achievable goal \"about six years from now.\"",
              "He added that SpaceX plans to send a Starship rocket without crew \"in two years.\"",
              "In the meantime, SpaceX has many milestones to go before Starship can carry passengers.",
              "The rocket has yet to reach orbit.",
              "Musk last year said that the company will fly \"hundreds of missions with satellites before we put people on board.\"",
              "Musk may be focused on Mars, but the hurdles of Starship's development are not lost on the space billionaire.",

              "He also didn\u2019t pretend that it was going to be easy and that they were going to do it in ten years,\u201d says Bobby Braun, NASA\u2019s former chief technologist who\u2019s now at Georgia Tech University.",
              "\u201cI mean, who\u2019s to say what\u2019s possible in a hundred years?",
              "\u201d And for those wondering whether we should go at all, the reason for Musk making Mars an imperative is simple.",
              "\u201cThe future of humanity is fundamentally going to bifurcate along one of two directions: Either we\u2019re going to become a multiplanet species and a spacefaring civilization, or we\u2019re going be stuck on one planet until some eventual extinction event,\u201d Musk told Ron Howard during an interview for National Geographic Channel\u2019s MARS, a global event series that premieres worldwide on November 14.",
              "\u201cFor me to be excited and inspired about the future, it\u2019s got to be the first option.",
              "It\u2019s got to be: We\u2019re going to be a spacefaring civilization.",
              "\u201d Though he admitted his exact timeline is fuzzy, Musk thinks it\u2019s possible humans could begin flying to Mars by the mid-2020s.",
              "And he thinks the plan for getting there will go something like this: SpaceX Interplanetary Transport System It starts with a really big rocket, something at least 200 feet tall when fully assembled.",
              "In a simulation of what SpaceX calls its Interplanetary Transport System, a spacecraft loaded with astronauts will launch on top of a 39-foot-wide booster that produces a whopping 28 million pounds of thrust.",
              "Using 42 Raptor engines, the booster will accelerate the assemblage to 5,374 miles an hour.",
              "Overall, the whole thing is 3.",
              "5 times more powerful than NASA\u2019s Saturn V, the biggest rocket built to date, which carried the Apollo missions to the moon.",
              "Perhaps not coincidentally, the SpaceX rocket would launch from the same pad, 39A, at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.",
              "The rocket would deliver the crew capsule to orbit around Earth, then the booster would steer itself toward a soft landing back at the launch pad, a feat that SpaceX rocket boosters have been doing for almost a year now.",
              "Next, the booster would pick up a fuel tanker and carry that into orbit, where it would fuel the spaceship for its journey to Mars.",
              "Once en route, that spaceship would deploy solar panels to harvest energy from the sun and conserve valuable propellant for what promises to be an exciting landing on the Red Planet.",
              "As Musk envisions it, fleets of these crew-carrying capsules will remain in Earth orbit until a favorable planetary alignment brings the two planets close together\u2014something that happens every 26 months.",
              "\u201cWe\u2019d ultimately have upward of a thousand or more spaceships waiting in orbit.",
              "And so the Mars colonial fleet would depart en masse,\u201d Musk says.",
              "The key to his plan is reusing the various spaceships as much as possible.",
              "\u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to have a self-sustaining Mars base without reusability.",
              "I think this is really fundamental,\u201d Musk says.",
              "\u201cIf wooden sailing ships in the old days were not reusable, I don\u2019t think the United States would exist.",
              "\u201d Musk anticipates being able to use each rocket booster a thousand times, each tanker a hundred times, and each spaceship 12 times.",
              "At the beginning, he imagines that maybe a hundred humans would be hitching a ride on each ship, with that number gradually increasing to more than 200.",
              "By his calculations, then, putting a million people on Mars could take anywhere from 40 to a hundred years after the first ship launches.",
              "And, no, it would not necessarily be a one-way trip: \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to give people the option of returning,\u201d Musk says.",
              "After landing a few cargo-carrying spacecraft without people on Mars, starting with the Red Dragon capsule in 2018, Musk says the human phase of colonization could begin.",
              "For sure, landing a heavy craft on a planet with a thin atmosphere will be difficult.",
              "It was tough enough to gently lower NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover to the surface, and at 2,000 pounds, that payload weighed just a fraction of Musk\u2019s proposed vessels.",
              "For now, Musk plans to continue developing supersonic retrorockets that can gradually and gently lower a much heavier spacecraft to the Martian surface, using his reusable Falcon 9 boosters as a model.",
              "And that\u2019s not all these spacecraft will need: Hurtling through the Martian atmosphere at supersonic speeds will test even the most heat-tolerant materials on Earth, so it\u2019s no small task to design a spacecraft that can withstand a heated entry and propulsive landing\u2014and then be refueled and sent back to Earth so it can start over again.",
              "The first journeys would primarily serve the purpose of delivering supplies and establishing a propellant depot on the Martian surface, a fuel reservoir that could be tapped into for return trips to Earth.",
              "After that depot is set up and cargo delivered to the surface, the fun can (sort of) begin.",
              "Early human settlers will need to be good at digging beneath the surface and dredging up buried ice, which will supply precious water and be used to make the cryo-methane propellant that will power the whole enterprise.",
              "As such, the earliest interplanetary spaceships would probably stay on Mars, and they would be carrying mostly cargo, fuel, and a small crew: \u201cbuilders and fixers\u201d who are \u201cthe hearty explorer type,\u201d Musk said to Howard.",
              "\u201cAre you prepared to die?",
              "If that\u2019s OK, then you\u2019re a candidate for going.",
              "\u201d While there will undoubtedly be intense competition and lots of fanfare over the first few seats on a Mars-bound mission, Musk worries that too much emphasis will be placed on those early bootprints.",
              "\u201cIn the sort of grander historical context, what really matters is being able to send a large number of people, like tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people, and ultimately millions of tons of cargo,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cI actually care much more about that than, say, the first few trips.",
              "\u201d In short, his vision for establishing a settlement on Mars is more an endurance sport than a sprint.",
              "But Musk is used to that.",
              "In 2001, he founded SpaceX with one goal in mind: put humans on Mars.",
              "At the time, he recalls, he found himself thinking about why, after the successful Apollo missions to the moon, humans hadn\u2019t visited Mars\u2014or reached very far into space at all.",
              "\u201cIt always seemed like we should have gone there by now, and we should have had a base on the moon, and we should have had space hotels and all these things,\u201d he said to Howard.",

              "\"The alternative is to become a spacefaring civilisation and a multi-planet species, which I hope you would agree is the right way to go.\"",
              "The SpaceX founder has often spoken about his dream of building cities on Mars.",
              "He believes that settlements would need large numbers of people in order to become self-sustaining.",
              "Realising this dream requires a vehicle that's up to the task.",
              "Starship is a rocket and spacecraft combination that could ferry more than 100 people a time to the Red Planet.",
              "The system is designed to be fully and rapidly reusable.",
              "Being fully reusable means the principal hardware elements are not discarded in the sea or allowed to burn up, as happens with some other launch systems, but return to the ground so they can be flown again.",
              "Rapid reusability means that after coming back from space, Starship can be re-filled with propellant and be ready to launch again in a short period of time - like an aircraft.",
              "This reduces the cost of the whole enterprise.",
              "At launch, the spacecraft, called Starship, will sit atop a rocket called Super Heavy.",
              "The combined system will stand 120m (394ft) -tall and is also referred to as Starship.",
              "Let's take the spacecraft first.",
              "With its nosecone and landing fins, the stainless-steel vehicle resembles the rocket-ships from the golden age of science fiction.",
              "At the rear of the 50m (160ft) -long craft are six highly efficient Raptor engines, developed over the course of a decade by SpaceX.",
              "The combustion takes place in stages, and the engine's design cuts the amount of propellant that's wasted.",
              "Towards the middle of the vehicle are the propellant tanks.",
              "These feed liquid methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen (O2) to the Raptors.",
              "Methane is the fuel and oxygen acts as an oxidiser - a chemical that makes the fuel burn.",
              "The combination is dubbed methalox.",
              "The choice of fuel is unusual for rocket engines, but methane can generate plenty of thrust.",
              "It's also a prudent choice in light of Musk's designs on Mars.",
              "The SpaceX founder says that CH4 could be synthesised from Martian subsurface water and from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), using a chemical process known as the Sabatier reaction.",
              "Re-fuelling Starship for the return trip to Earth using Martian resources would confer a level of self-sufficiency, making journeys both more feasible and cost-effective.",
              "Towards the front of the spacecraft - which is sometimes referred to as the upper stage - is a huge payload compartment that will be able to haul large cargo or people to destinations in deep space.",
              "Now, let's turn to the rocket.",
              "Measuring 70m (230ft) -long, Super Heavy will be filled with cryogenic (chilled) methalox.",
              "It will be powered by around 33 Raptor engines (this specification has changed several times) and should achieve more than 70 Meganewtons (16 million lbs) of maximum thrust.",
              "It should be able to lift at least 100 tonnes of payload, and possibly as much as 150 tonnes, to low-Earth orbit.",
              "This will make Super Heavy more powerful than the immense Saturn V launcher used for the Apollo Moon missions in the 1960s and 70s.",
              "As it ascends from the launch pad, the combined Starship system will begin to pitch over towards the intended orbit.",
              "When the upper stage separates in space, Super Heavy flips over while falling back towards Earth.",
              "Steel structures called \"grid fins\" attached to the sides of the booster, will help steer the rocket stage back towards its launch pad so it can be flown again.",
              "SpaceX has an ambitious plan to then catch the falling booster using its launch tower.",
              "This tower provides engineers and crew members with access to the spacecraft and rocket while they are sitting on the pad before launch.",
              "A pair of steel arms will extend out from the launch tower.",
              "The spent booster falls onto these arms. The tower has been dubbed \"Mechazilla\" because of its resemblance to a creature from the Godzilla movies.",
              "Meanwhile, the Starship upper stage could be inserted into a \"parking orbit\" after separation, allowing it to be re-filled with propellant.",
              "\"If you just fly [Starship] to orbit and don't do any refilling, it's pretty good a\u0302\u0080\u0094 you'll get 150 tonnes to low-Earth orbit, and have no fuel to go anywhere else,\" Musk explained in 2017.",
              "\"If you send up tankers and re-fill in orbit, you could re-fill the tanks up all the way to the top, and get 150 tonnes [of payload] all the way to Mars.\"",
              "To re-fuel, the spacecraft would dock with another Starship - already circling the Earth - that acts solely as a propellant depot.",
              "For long-haul trips to Mars and back - which could take up to nine months each way - Musk is looking to install around 40 cabins in the payload area near the front of the upper stage.",
              "\"You could conceivably have five or six people per cabin, if you really wanted to crowd people in.",
              "But I think mostly we would expect to see two or three people per cabin, and so nominally about 100 people per flight to Mars,\" Musk said.",
              "The payload bay would also host common areas, storage space, a galley and a shelter where people could gather to shield from solar storms, where the Sun belches out harmful charged particles into space.",
              "Starship will also play a key role in Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon.",
              "In April 2021, the US space agency awarded SpaceX with a $2.",
              "89bn contract to develop Starship into a lander capable of delivering astronauts to the lunar surface this decade.",
              "The version tailored for Artemis flights would not possess the heat shield or flaps that are necessary for a return journey to Earth.",
              "Instead, the Starship Human Landing System would remain in space after its initial launch from Earth, so that it could eventually be used for multiple trips between lunar orbit and the Moon's surface.",
              "The uncrewed, or cargo, version of Starship features a payload bay that opens up like the mouth of a crocodile.",
              "This would allow it to be used for launching satellites.",
              "SpaceX says the huge payload capacity opens up possibilities for new types of robotic science mission, including telescopes larger than the James Webb observatory - the successor to Hubble which launched in December 2021.",
              "The system could also be used for space tourism: Elon Musk has promised a trip around the Moon in 2023 to the Japanese online retail billionaire Yusaku Maezawa.",
              "It could also carry out high-speed journeys between different destinations on Earth.",
              "Musk says that Starship could eventually carry people to destinations in the \"greater Solar System\", including gas giants such as Jupiter.",
              "But this remains a long-term objective.",
              "In order to bring other spacecraft back to the ground, engineers have relied on parachutes, or designed the vehicle so that it can land on a runway.",
              "But the Starship upper stage takes a different approach.",
              "When it is ready to land on Earth, the ship initially re-enters the atmosphere at a 60-degree angle and then \"belly-flops\" to the ground in the horizontal position.",
              "This mode of return relies entirely on the atmosphere to slow the vehicle's descent.",
              "The downside is that, in this configuration, Starship is inherently unstable.",
              "The vehicle therefore uses four steel landing flaps, positioned near the front and rear of the vehicle, to control its descent.",
              "This is much like a skydiver uses their arms and legs to control a free-fall.",
              "\"It's quite different from anything elsea\u0302\u0080\u00a6 we're doing a controlled fall,\" Elon Musk says.",
              "\"You're trying to create drag rather than lift - it's really the opposite of an aircraft.\"",
              "As Starship approaches the ground, it should be slow enough to execute an engine burn that flips the vehicle into a vertical position.",
              "It then uses the Raptors as retro-rockets to guide the vehicle down to a safe touchdown on its landing legs.",
              "Musk says this general approach could be used to bring Starship down safely on any planetary surface in the Solar System.",
              "Eventually, however, Starships returning to Earth - and perhaps other destinations - might not have to do the flip manoeuvre.",
              "The ships could instead be captured as they approach the ground by the launch tower's steel arms - just like the Super Heavy booster.",
              "Musk explained on Twitter: \"Ship will be caught by Mechazilla too.",
              "As with booster, no landing legs.",
              "Those are only needed for Moon and Mars until there is local infrastructure.\"",
              "In the last few years, SpaceX has tested various prototypes of the upper stage at its Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.",
              "The company started off in 2019 with a 39m-tall \"test article\" called Starhopper - which bore a passing resemblance to a water tower - and flew it to 150m above ground.",
              "This video can not be played SN15 launched with improvements in its structures, avionics, software, and engines The first prototype to feature a nosecone and flaps - Starship serial number (SN8) - flew to an altitude of 12.",
              "5km in December 2020.",
              "It belly flopped back to Earth, giving SpaceX valuable engineering data about the final part of the vehicle's return from space.",
              "However, SN8 approached the landing pad a little too fast and hard, causing it to crumple and explode.",
              "Three more test articles exploded before Starship SN15 achieved success with a soft landing in May 2021.",
              "In February, SpaceX engineersconducted a key test on the rocket system, what's called a \"static fire\", simultaneously igniting 31 out of 33 of the engines at the base of the vehicle's lower-segment.",
              "The firing lasted only a few seconds, with everything clamped in place to prevent any movement.",
              "Mr Musk tweeted that the team had turned off one engine before the test and that another engine stopped itself, leaving 31 engines firing overall.",
              "But, he added, it was \"still enough engines to reach orbit\" The FAA granted a license that would allow SpaceX to perform a test flight for the rocket, which is scheduled for 17 April.",
              "\"After a comprehensive license evaluation process, the FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy, payload, airspace integration and financial responsibility requirements,\" the FAA said in a statement on Friday, adding that the license was valid for five years.",
