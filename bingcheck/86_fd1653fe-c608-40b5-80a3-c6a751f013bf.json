    "query": "What was the inspiration behind Albert Einstein's theory of relativity and how did it change our understanding of the universe?",
    "response": "Albert Einstein's theory of relativity is a revolutionary scientific achievement that changed our understanding of space, time, gravity and the universe. It consists of two parts: the special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity.\n\nThe special theory of relativity, published in 1905, arose from Einstein's recognition that **light always travels at a constant speed**[^1^], regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. This led him to propose that the laws of physics are the same for all observers moving at a constant speed relative to each other, and that space and time are not absolute but relative to the observer. He also derived his famous equation E=mc^2^, which shows that matter and energy are interchangeable[^5^].\n\nThe general theory of relativity, published in 1915, extended the special theory to include gravity and acceleration. Einstein realized that gravity and acceleration are equivalent, meaning that an observer in a closed room cannot tell whether they are feeling the gravitational pull of a massive object or being accelerated by a force[^2^]. He also realized that gravity is not a force but a consequence of the curvature of space and time caused by the presence of mass[^4^]. He used this idea to explain the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, which could not be accounted for by Newton's law of gravity[^2^]. He also predicted that light would bend in a gravitational field, which was later confirmed by observing starlight during a solar eclipse[^4^].\n\nEinstein's theory of relativity has many implications and applications for modern physics and cosmology. It explains phenomena such as gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, black holes, time dilation, length contraction, and gravitational redshift. It also provides the foundation for the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe and the expansion of space. It is one of the most tested and verified theories in science history.",

              "The revolution experienced by modern physics began to be reflected in the 12th edition (1922) of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica with Sir James Jeans\u2019s article \u201cRelativity.",
              "\u201d In the 13th edition (1926) a wholly new topic, \u201cSpace-Time,\u201d was discussed by the person most qualified in all the world to do so, Albert Einstein.",
              "The article is challenging but rewarding.",
              "All our thoughts and concepts are called up by sense-experiences and have a meaning only in reference to these sense-experiences.",
              "On the other hand, however, they are products of the spontaneous activity of our minds;",
              "they are thus in no wise logical consequences of the contents of these sense-experiences.",
              "If, therefore, we wish to grasp the essence of a complex of abstract notions we must for the one part investigate the mutual relationships between the concepts and the assertions made about them;",
              "for the other, we must investigate how they are related to the experiences.",
              "So far as the way is concerned in which concepts are connected with one another and with the experiences there is no difference of principle between the concept-systems of science and those of daily life.",
              "The concept-systems of science have grown out of those of daily life and have been modified and completed according to the objects and purposes of the science in question.",
              "The more universal a concept is the more frequently it enters into our thinking;",
              "and the more indirect its relation to sense-experience, the more difficult it is for us to comprehend its meaning;",
              "this is particularly the case with pre-scientific concepts that we have been accustomed to use since childhood.",
              "Consider the concepts referred to in the words \u201cwhere,\u201d \u201cwhen,\u201d \u201cwhy,\u201d \u201cbeing,\u201d to the elucidation of which innumerable volumes of philosophy have been devoted.",
              "We fare no better in our speculations than a fish which should strive to become clear as to what is water.",
              "In the present article we are concerned with the meaning of \u201cwhere,\u201d that is, of space.",
              "It appears that there is no quality contained in our individual primitive sense-experiences that may be designated as spatial.",
              "Rather, what is spatial appears to be a sort of order of the material objects of experience.",
              "The concept \u201cmaterial object\u201d must therefore be available if concepts concerning space are to be possible.",
              "It is the logically primary concept.",
              "This is easily seen if we analyse the spatial concepts for example, \u201cnext to,\u201d \u201ctouch,\u201d and so forth, that is, if we strive to become aware of their equivalents in experience.",
              "The concept \u201cobject\u201d is a means of taking into account the persistence in time or the continuity, respectively, of certain groups of experience-complexes.",
              "The existence of objects is thus of a conceptual nature, and the meaning of the concepts of objects depends wholly on their being connected (intuitively) with groups of elementary sense-experiences.",
              "This connection is the basis of the illusion which makes primitive experience appear to inform us directly about the relation of material bodies (which exist, after all, only in so far as they are thought).",
              "In the sense thus indicated we have (the indirect) experience of the contact of two bodies.",
              "We need do no more than call attention to this, as we gain nothing for our present purpose by singling out the individual experiences to which this assertion alludes.",
              "Many bodies can be brought into permanent contact with one another in manifold ways.",
              "We speak in this sense of the position-relationships of bodies (Lagenbeziehungen).",
              "The general laws of such position-relationships are essentially the concern of geometry.",
              "This holds, at least, if we do not wish to restrict ourselves to regarding the propositions that occur in this branch of knowledge merely as relationships between empty words that have been set up according to certain principles.",
              "Now, what is the meaning of the concept \u201cspace\u201d which we also encounter in pre-scientific thought?",
              "The concept of space in pre-scientific thought is characterised by the sentence: \u201cwe can think away things but not the space which they occupy.",
              "\u201d It is as if, without having had experience of any sort, we had a concept, nay even a presentation, of space and as if we ordered our sense-experiences with the help of this concept, present a priori.",
              "On the other hand, space appears as a physical reality, as a thing which exists independently of our thought, like material objects.",
              "Under the influence of this view of space the fundamental concepts of geometry: the point, the straight line, the plane, were even regarded as having a self-evident character.",
              "The fundamental principles that deal with these configurations were regarded as being necessarily valid and as having at the same time an objective content.",
              "No scruples were felt about ascribing an objective meaning to such statements as \u201cthree empirically given bodies (practically infinitely small) lie on one straight line,\u201d without demanding a physical definition for such an assertion.",
              "This blind faith in evidence and in the immediately real meaning of the concepts and propositions of geometry became uncertain only after non-Euclidean geometry had been introduced.",
              "If we start from the view that all spatial concepts are related to contact-experiences of solid bodies, it is easy to understand how the concept \u201cspace\u201d originated, namely, how a thing independent of bodies and yet embodying their position-possibilities (Lagerungsmo\u0308glichkeiten) was posited.",
              "If we have a system of bodies in contact and at rest relatively to one another, some can be replaced by others.",
              "This property of allowing substitution is interpreted as \u201cavailable space.",
              "\u201d Space denotes the property in virtue of which rigid bodies can occupy different positions.",
              "The view that space is something with a unity of its own is perhaps due to the circumstance that in pre-scientific thought all positions of bodies were referred to one body (reference body), namely the earth.",
              "In scientific thought the earth is represented by the co-ordinate system.",
              "The assertion that it would be possible to place an unlimited number of bodies next to one another denotes that space is infinite.",

              "Einstein's science, and general views on humanity, have profoundly changed the way we see ourselves and the world we live in.",
              "He was not faultless, as no human is.",
              "He was an absent father and unfaithful husband.",

              "To shake the foundations of knowledge one needs at least two things: to believe deeply in his ideas and to have the courage to go against the established order.",
              "In the sciences, to be successful in shaking the foundations of knowledge so as to promote change, one also needs to be right.",
              "When Einstein came into the science scene at the turn of the 20th century, physics was in crisis.",
              "The physics developed from Galileo up to 1899 had three pillars: mechanics, electromagnetism and thermodynamics, the study of heat.",
              "And the three pillars were on shaky ground, as physicists couldn't use them to explain a series of phenomena that had been recently discovered in the lab and in the skies.",
              "New ideas were badly needed, but not much was coming forth.",
              "It was the perfect moment for a trailblazer.",
              "First, there was trouble with light and its propagation.",
              "After a debate that lasted for centuries, people were convinced that light was a wave.",
              "(The other option, defended by Issac Newton, was that light was made of little bulletlike particles.)",
              "That being the case, and as with any other wave, light had to propagate in a material medium.",
              "Water waves, for example, travel in water;",
              "sound waves in air.",
              "Light?",
              "Well, for us to see light from distant stars, the medium had to be transparent.",
              "It also had to be very light so as not to slow down the orbits of planets.",
              "Finally, it had to be very rigid, so as to allow for the propagation of very fast waves: It was well-known by then that light traveled at about 186,000 miles per second in empty space.",
              "What kind of medium could this be?",
              "Stumped, the greatest physicists of the 19th century came up with a wild idea: Imagine that all of space is filled with an imponderable medium called the ether.",
              "What it was, no one knew.",
              "Its sole purpose was to allow light to propagate.",
              "With hindsight, we could call it magical stuff.",
              "Even as attempts to find it failed, physicists would not let go.",
              "The alternative, having light propagating in empty space, sounded even crazier.",
              "Enter Einstein.",
              "In 1905, he proposes his special theory of relativity, whereby he singlehandedly destroyed the notions of absolute space and time, and the need for an ether.",
              "According to the theory, now one of the greatest success stories in the history of thought, the notions of space as a rigid stage at which things just happen and of time as a steadily flowing river, are just an illusion caused by our myopic view of reality.",
              "And it's all light's fault.",
              "Space would only be a rigid stage and time would only be a steady river if light could travel from Point A to Point B instantaneously.",
              "(That is if light traveled with an infinite speed.)",
              "But it doesn't.",
              "Our illusion is corrected once we incorporate the fact that light has a finite speed of propagation, even if it's so ridiculously high.",
              "(In fact, it is its enormous value that makes our illusions so persistent and convincing.)",
              "Once the correction is factored into our studies of motion, everything changes.",
              "An observer at rest that measures the length of a moving bus will obtain a different result from the passengers in the bus.",
              "To her, the moving bus will be shorter.",
              "If she also saw a clock attached to the bus, she would notice that the seconds pass slower for it than for the watch on her wrist.",
              "Amazed, she would conclude that moving objects shorten in the direction of their motion and that moving clocks tick slower.",
              "The effects, called length contraction and time dilation, become more pronounced as the speed of the moving object approaches the speed of light.",
              "Remarkably, Einstein also showed, in a second paper he wrote that same year, that no object with mass could ever reach the speed of light.",
              "Mass itself grows with speed and becomes infinitely large at the speed of light.",
              "Only light itself, or another entity with no mass, could travel at light speed.",
              "And by the way, all this is perfectly consistent with light traveling in empty space.",
              "No ether.",
              "Light is like nothing else in the cosmos.",
              "In 1915, Einstein expanded his theory to include motions with variable speeds (i.",
              "e., with acceleration).",
              "His theory of general relativity, arguably one of the towering achievements of the human intellect, imprinted the plasticity of space and time into the fabric of the universe itself.",
              "Now, the presence of any material object (or merely energy) could bend space and alter the flow of time.",
              "Space and time became literally pliable.",
              "For example, a light ray from a distant star would be deviated from a straight line as it passed by the sun.",
              "(It does as it passes by you, too, but the bending is so small as to be literally immeasurable.)",
              "In 1919, two expeditions were sent to test Einstein's prediction of this phenomenon.",
              "Their data, despite bad weather and measurement issues, were conclusive: Einstein was right.",
              "Later on, Einstein's prediction for the flow of time was also confirmed: Time slows down in strong gravity.",
              "A clock on the top of the Empire State Building ticks faster than one on the ground.",
              "But the effect is tiny: If you were to spend your lifetime on top of the Empire State Building you would lose 104 millionths of a second.",
              "Even more fun: In a 79-year lifetime, the cells in your brain age faster than those in your feet by about 45 billionths of a second.",
              "Einstein was the first to apply his ideas of space and time plasticity to the universe as a whole.",
              "In 1919, he devised a model for the entire universe: a static, spherical, perfectly symmetric cosmos, with matter homogeneously distributed everywhere, reflecting a mix of Platonic perfection and of Ockham's Razor.",

              "WALTER ISAACSON: Oh, over and over again.",
              "The first major proof is in 1919, because he says, well, gravity will bend a light beam a certain way.",
              "And you say, well, we could look at the light from a star that goes right next to the sun to see if it's bent.",

              "Over and over again, you read stories saying, Einstein's theories disproved or debunked, and then you wait a month or two, and there has been nothing that has cut out the underpinnings of general relativity, of all of relativity.",

              "Although this paper challenged foundational notions about space and time, each of its parts was simply a response to an important problem facing the physics community of Einstein's time.",
              "One of these three challenges Einstein addresses is the relationship between Maxwell's electromagnetic equations and the mechanical worldview.",
              "Scientists in Einstein's day searched for a unifying theory that would explain both electromagnetism and mechanics.",
              "Einstein was attracted to this problem because he was troubled by an electromagnetic principle that did not make sense according to the mechanical world view: Faraday's 1831 magnet-coil experiment.",
              "In this experiment, a magnet is moved near an electric circuit, and then the circuit is moved near the magnet.",
              "According to Faraday, an electric current should be formed whenever there is relative movement, regardless of whether the magnet or the circuit is moving.",
              "However, according to Maxwell's equations, an electric current is only induced when the circuit is at rest and the magnet moving.",
              "This asymmetrical explanation disturbed Einstein, who was committed to aesthetic principles in his science.",
              "In order to resolve this asymmetry, Einstein analyzed the arrangement of magnet and current in terms of relative movement.",
              "He proposed that the existence of an electric current depends on the relative velocity of the magnet and circuit with respect to one another.",
              "His relativity theory wa s thus the product of his aesthetic discomfort with an asymmetrical explanation.",
              "Einstein was not the first to formulate a relativity theory, however: Galileo had considered the concept in the early seventeenth century.",
              "According to Galilean relativity, the laws of mechanics are useless to an observer in a non-accelerating reference frame trying to determine whether he or she is moving with respect to another reference frame.",
              "When Newton revisited this problem fifty years later, he attempted to solve it by postulating an \"absolute space\" eternally at rest, relative to which any reference frame was either at rest or in motion.",
              "However, the fundamental pri nciple of relativity remained the same: the laws of mechanics are the same in all inertial (non-accelerating) reference frames, so it is impossible to determine whether an observer in one frame is moving or stationary with respect to another frame of refe rence.",
              "In Einstein's day, physicists questioned whether the relativity principle could be applied to electrodynamic theory as well.",
              "Was it also true that the laws of electrodynamics were the same in all reference frames?",
              "Physicists were particularly interested in whether the earth's velocity could be detected with respect to the ether, a substance postulated by scientists as a medium through which light waves travel.",
              "In the 1880s, the American physicists Albert Michelson and Edward Morley constructed a dev ice called an interferometer to measure the earth's velocity with respect to the ether, but were unable to detect any movement.",
              "However, there is no evidence that Einstein was familiar with these results when he dismissed altogether the concept of the et her in his relativity paper.",
              "Einstein claimed that it is impossible to detect whether or not one is moving with respect to the ether, rendering meaningless the whole notion of an ether.",
              "His dismissal of the ether also meant that every concept involving space and time had to be considered in relative terms, a fundamental challenge to all of nineteenth-century science.",
              "Einstein's relativity theory was presented as a principled, rather than a constructive, theory.",
              "A principled theory is one that begins with principles and then uses these principles to explain the phenomena;",
              "a constructive theory starts with the observat ions and culminates in theories that explain and reconcile those observations.",
              "Einstein's principled account began with the postulate that the laws of science should appear the same to all freely moving observers.",
              "In particular, all observers should mea sure the speed of light as the same regardless of how fast they are moving.",
              "Thus, there is no \"universal time\" that all clocks measure;",
              "rather, everyone has his or her own personal time.",
              "If one person is moving with respect to another, their clocks will not agree.",
              "To an observer moving in one frame of reference with uniform velocity relative to a second frame of reference, the clock in the second frame will appear to move more slowly than his own clock.",
              "Moreover, since velocity is the measurement of d istance per unit of time, a measuring-stick in the second time frame would appear contracted to the observer in the reference frame.",
              "Of course, we do not observe these effects in everyday situations of movement;",
              "we do not see a ruler as contracted if we are moving by on a bus.",
              "Rather, these phenomena are noticeable only at speeds near the speed of light.",
              "Nonetheless, Einstein's relativity paper showed that time and space are not a priori categories of human understanding;",
              "rather, they are relative quan tities that are defined operationally.",
              "One implication of relativity is the famous \"twin paradox,\" a hypothetical situation in which one twin embarks on a journey through space while the other twin stays on earth.",
              "When the first twin returns home after traveling at a velocity close to the spe ed of light, he finds that he has aged by merely a couple of years, while his brother on earth has been long since dead.",
              "This is because the twin on earth has been traveling through space at a constant time (as the earth orbits the sun), whereas the twin in the spaceship has had to decelerate and then accelerate in order to turn back home, so she has not remained in an inertial (non-accelerating) reference frame.",
              "This paradox runs counter to our commonsense view of time, but it is a natural consequence of relativity theory.",
              "Einstein's relativity theory also implied the equivalence of mass and energy, as expressed by the famous equation E = mc2.",
              "Einstein discovered that electromagnetic radiation, like matter, can carry inertia.",
              "A given amount of electromagnetic energy is e quivalent to a certain amount of inertial mass: a little mass is equivalent to enormous amounts of energy.",
              "With this equation, Einstein provided a solution to the relationship between the mechanical and electromagnetic world views.",
              "He had previously supported the mechanical view alone, but in this paper he showed how mechanical and electromagnetic worldviews could now exist on a n equal footing and inform one another.",

              "General relativity generalises special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime.",
              "In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present.",
              "The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of second order partial differential equations.",
              "Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes classical gravity, can be seen as a prediction of general relativity for the almost flat spacetime geometry around stationary mass distributions.",
              "Some predictions of general relativity, however, are beyond Newton's law of universal gravitation in classical physics.",
              "These predictions concern the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light, and include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, the Shapiro time delay and singularities/black holes.",
              "So far, all tests of general relativity have been shown to be in agreement with the theory.",
              "The time-dependent solutions of general relativity enable us to talk about the history of the universe and have provided the modern framework for cosmology, thus leading to the discovery of the Big Bang and cosmic microwave background radiation.",
              "Despite the introduction of a number of alternative theories, general relativity continues to be the simplest theory consistent with experimental data.",
              "Reconciliation of general relativity with the laws of quantum physics remains a problem, however, as there is a lack of a self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.",
              "It is not yet known how gravity can be unified with the three non-gravitational forces: strong, weak and electromagnetic.",
              "Einstein's theory has astrophysical implications, including the prediction of black holes\u2014regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape from them.",
              "Black holes are the end-state for massive stars.",
              "Microquasars and active galactic nuclei are believed to be stellar black holes and supermassive black holes.",
              "It also predicts gravitational lensing, where the bending of light results in multiple images of the same distant astronomical phenomenon.",
              "Other predictions include the existence of gravitational waves, which have been observed directly by the physics collaboration LIGO and other observatories.",
              "In addition, general relativity has provided the base of cosmological models of an expanding universe.",
              "Widely acknowledged as a theory of extraordinary beauty, general relativity has often been described as the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.",
              "[2] Henri Poincare\u0301's 1905 theory of the dynamics of the electron was a relativistic theory which he applied to all forces, including gravity.",
              "While others thought that gravity was instantaneous or of electromagnetic origin, he suggested that relativity was \"something due to our methods of measurement\".",
              "In his theory, he showed that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light.",
              "[3] Soon afterwards, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his relativistic framework.",
              "In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall (FFO), he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity.",
              "After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations, which form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity.",
              "[4] These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present.",
              "[5] A version of non-Euclidean geometry, called Riemannian geometry, enabled Einstein to develop general relativity by providing the key mathematical framework on which he fit his physical ideas of gravity.",
              "[6] This idea was pointed out by mathematician Marcel Grossmann and published by Grossmann and Einstein in 1913.",
              "[7] The Einstein field equations are nonlinear and considered difficult to solve.",
              "Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory.",
              "But in 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric.",
              "This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes.",
              "In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, eventually resulting in the Reissner\u2013Nordstro\u0308m solution, which is now associated with electrically charged black holes.",
              "[8] In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology.",
              "In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations\u2014the cosmological constant\u2014to match that observational presumption.",
              "[9] By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding.",
              "This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant.",
              "Lemai\u0302tre used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state.",
              "[10] Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.",
              "[11] During that period, general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories.",
              "It was clearly superior to Newtonian gravity, being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory.",
              "Einstein showed in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters (\"fudge factors\"),[12] and in 1919 an expedition led by Eddington confirmed general relativity's prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of 29 May 1919,[13] instantly making Einstein famous.",
              "[14] Yet the theory remained outside the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics until developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, now known as the golden age of general relativity.",
              "[15] Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify quasars as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations.",
              "[16] Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power,[17] and relativistic cosmology also became amenable to direct observational tests.",
              "[18] General relativity has acquired a reputation as a theory of extraordinary beauty.",
              "[2][19][20] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar has noted that at multiple levels, general relativity exhibits what Francis Bacon has termed a \"strangeness in the proportion\" (i.",
              "e. elements that excite wonderment and surprise).",
              "It juxtaposes fundamental concepts (space and time versus matter and motion) which had previously been considered as entirely independent.",
              "Chandrasekhar also noted that Einstein's only guides in his search for an exact theory were the principle of equivalence and his sense that a proper description of gravity should be geometrical at its basis, so that there was an \"element of revelation\" in the manner in which Einstein arrived at his theory.",
              "[21] Other elements of beauty associated with the general theory of relativity are its simplicity and symmetry, the manner in which it incorporates invariance and unification, and its perfect logical consistency.",
              "[22] In the preface to Relativity: The Special and the General Theory, Einstein said \"The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.",
              "The work presumes a standard of education corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and, despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the reader.",
              "The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and connection in which they actually originated.\"",
              "[23] General relativity can be understood by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics.",
              "The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description.",
              "The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.",
              "[24][25] At the base of classical mechanics is the notion that a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion.",
              "Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration.",
              "[26] The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed.",
              "In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.",
              "[27] Conversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate.",
              "However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play.",
              "According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eo\u0308tvo\u0308s and its successors (see Eo\u0308tvo\u0308s experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties.",
              "[28] A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in an enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is stationary in a gravitational field and the ball accelerating, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field versus the ball which upon release has nil acceleration.",
              "[29] Given the universality of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force.",
              "This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity.",
              "This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time\u2014in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific connection which depends on the gradient of the gravitational potential.",
              "Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary Euclidean geometry.",
              "However, spacetime as a whole is more complicated.",
              "As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory;",
              "mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not integrable.",
              "From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved.",
              "The resulting Newton\u2013Cartan theory is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts, i.",
              "e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system.",
              "[30] In this geometric description, tidal effects\u2014the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall\u2014are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.",
              "[31] As intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is merely a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics.",
              "[32] In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics.",
              "(The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincare\u0301 group, which includes translations, rotations, boosts and reflections.)",
              "The differences between the two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.",
              "[33] With Lorentz symmetry, additional structures come into play.",
              "They are defined by the set of light cones (see image).",
              "The light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there is a set of events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image).",
              "These sets are observer-independent.",
              "[34] In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the spacetime's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor.",
              "In mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure[35] or conformal geometry.",
              "Special relativity is defined in the absence of gravity.",
              "For practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected.",
              "Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall motion, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global inertial frames.",
              "Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles.",
              "Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.",
              "[36] A priori, it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold\u2014that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames.",
              "But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf.",
              "below).",
              "The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity.",
              "[37] The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.",
              "[38] The same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field\u2014proper time, to give the technical term\u2014does not follow the rules of special relativity.",
              "In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the Minkowski metric.",
              "As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry.",
              "At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian.",
              "Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space.",
              "The metric tensor that defines the geometry\u2014in particular, how lengths and angles are measured\u2014is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo-Riemannian metric.",
              "Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the Levi-Civita connection, and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable locally inertial coordinates, the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).",
              "[39] Having formulated the relativistic, geometric version of the effects of gravity, the question of gravity's source remains.",
              "In Newtonian gravity, the source is mass.",
              "In special relativity, mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the energy\u2013momentum tensor, which includes both energy and momentum densities as well as stress: pressure and shear.",
              "[40] Using the equivalence principle, this tensor is readily generalized to curved spacetime.",
              "Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity, it is natural to assume that the field equation for gravity relates this tensor and the Ricci tensor, which describes a particular class of tidal effects: the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest, and then fall freely.",
              "In special relativity, conservation of energy\u2013momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy\u2013momentum tensor is divergence-free.",
              "This formula, too, is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved-manifold counterparts, covariant derivatives studied in differential geometry.",
              "With this additional condition\u2014the covariant divergence of the energy\u2013momentum tensor, and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation, is zero\u2014the simplest nontrivial set of equations are what are called Einstein's (field) equations: G \u03bc \u03bd \u2261 R \u03bc \u03bd \u2212 1 2 R g \u03bc \u03bd = \u03ba T \u03bc \u03bd {\\displaystyle G_{\\mu \\nu }\\equiv R_{\\mu \\nu }-{\\textstyle 1 \\over 2}R\\,g_{\\mu \\nu }=\\kappa T_{\\mu \\nu }\\,} On the left-hand side is the Einstein tensor, G \u03bc \u03bd {\\displaystyle G_{\\mu \\nu }} , which is symmetric and a specific divergence-free combination of the Ricci tensor R \u03bc \u03bd {\\displaystyle R_{\\mu \\nu }} and the metric.",
              "In particular, is the curvature scalar.",
              "The Ricci tensor itself is related to the more general Riemann curvature tensor as On the right-hand side, \u03ba {\\displaystyle \\kappa } is a constant and T \u03bc \u03bd {\\displaystyle T_{\\mu \\nu }} is the energy\u2013momentum tensor.",

              "[41] Matching the theory's prediction to observational results for planetary orbits or, equivalently, assuring that the weak-gravity, low-speed limit is Newtonian mechanics, the proportionality constant \u03ba {\\displaystyle \\kappa } is found to be \u03ba = 8 \u03c0 G c 4 {\\textstyle \\kappa ={\\frac {8\\pi G}{c^{4}}}} , where G {\\displaystyle G} is the Newtonian constant of gravitation and c {\\displaystyle c} the speed of light in vacuum.",
              "[42] When there is no matter present, so that the energy\u2013momentum tensor vanishes, the results are the vacuum Einstein equations, In general relativity, the world line of a particle free from all external, non-gravitational force is a particular type of geodesic in curved spacetime.",
              "In other words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a geodesic.",

              "In retrospect, the law of equivalence of inertial mass and gravitational mass is independent of the body's nature of the acceleration imparted to it by the gravitational field.",
              "For Newton's equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out in full, it is: The numerical equality between inertial mass and gravitational mass and acceleration are independent of the properties of the body.",
              "[1][2] Something like the equivalence principle emerged in the early 17th century, when Galileo expressed experimentally that the acceleration of a test mass due to gravitation is independent of the amount of mass being accelerated.",
              "Johannes Kepler, using Galileo's discoveries, showed knowledge of the equivalence principle by accurately describing what would occur if the Moon were stopped in its orbit and dropped towards Earth.",
              "This can be deduced without knowing if or in what manner gravity decreases with distance, but requires assuming the equivalency between gravity and inertia.",
              "If two stones were placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the sphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two magnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, each approaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of the other.",
              "If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by their animal force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would there meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same density.",
              "The 1/54 ratio is Kepler's estimate of the Moon\u2013Earth mass ratio, based on their diameters.",
              "The accuracy of his statement can be deduced by using Newton's inertia law F=ma and Galileo's gravitational observation that distance D = ( 1 / 2 ) a t 2 {\\displaystyle D=(1/2)at^{2}} .",
              "Setting these accelerations equal for a mass is the equivalence principle.",
              "Noting the time to collision for each mass is the same gives Kepler's statement that Dmoon/DEarth=MEarth/Mmoon, without knowing the time to collision or how or if the acceleration force from gravity is a function of distance.",
              "Newton's gravitational theory simplified and formalized Galileo's and Kepler's ideas by recognizing Kepler's \"animal force or some other equivalent\" beyond gravity and inertia were not needed, deducing from Kepler's planetary laws how gravity reduces with distance.",
              "The equivalence principle was properly introduced by Albert Einstein in 1907, when he observed that the acceleration of bodies towards the center of the Earth at a rate of 1g (g = 9.",
              "81 m/s2 being a standard reference of gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface) is equivalent to the acceleration of an inertially moving body that would be observed on a rocket in free space being accelerated at a rate of 1g.",

              "assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and a corresponding acceleration of the reference system.",
              "That is, being on the surface of the Earth is equivalent to being inside a spaceship (far from any sources of gravity) that is being accelerated by its engines.",
              "The direction or vector of acceleration equivalence on the surface of the earth is \"up\" or directly opposite the center of the planet while the vector of acceleration in a spaceship is directly opposite from the mass ejected by its thrusters.",
              "From this principle, Einstein deduced that free-fall is inertial motion.",
              "Objects in free-fall do not experience being accelerated downward (e.",
              "g. toward the earth or other massive body) but rather weightlessness and no acceleration.",
              "In an inertial frame of reference bodies (and photons, or light) obey Newton's first law, moving at constant velocity in straight lines.",
              "Analogously, in a curved spacetime the world line of an inertial particle or pulse of light is as straight as possible (in space and time).",
              "[4] Such a world line is called a geodesic and from the point of view of the inertial frame is a straight line.",
              "This is why an accelerometer in free-fall doesn't register any acceleration;",
              "there isn't any between the internal test mass and the accelerometer's body.",
              "As an example: an inertial body moving along a geodesic through space can be trapped into an orbit around a large gravitational mass without ever experiencing acceleration.",
              "This is possible because spacetime is radically curved in close vicinity to a large gravitational mass.",
              "In such a situation the geodesic lines bend inward around the center of the mass and a free-floating (weightless) inertial body will simply follow those curved geodesics into an elliptical orbit.",
              "An accelerometer on-board would never record any acceleration.",
              "By contrast, in Newtonian mechanics, gravity is assumed to be a force.",
              "This force draws objects having mass towards the center of any massive body.",
              "At the Earth's surface, the force of gravity is counteracted by the mechanical (physical) resistance of the Earth's surface.",
              "So in Newtonian physics, a person at rest on the surface of a (non-rotating) massive object is in an inertial frame of reference.",
              "These considerations suggest the following corollary to the equivalence principle, which Einstein formulated precisely in 1911: Whenever an observer detects the local presence of a force that acts on all objects in direct proportion to the inertial mass of each object, that observer is in an accelerated frame of reference.",
              "Einstein also referred to two reference frames, K and K'.",
              "K is a uniform gravitational field, whereas K' has no gravitational field but is uniformly accelerated such that objects in the two frames experience identical forces: We arrive at a very satisfactory interpretation of this law of experience, if we assume that the systems K and K' are physically exactly equivalent, that is, if we assume that we may just as well regard the system K as being in a space free from gravitational fields, if we then regard K as uniformly accelerated.",
              "This assumption of exact physical equivalence makes it impossible for us to speak of the absolute acceleration of the system of reference, just as the usual theory of relativity forbids us to talk of the absolute velocity of a system;",
              "and it makes the equal falling of all bodies in a gravitational field seem a matter of course.",
              "This observation was the start of a process that culminated in general relativity.",
              "Einstein suggested that it should be elevated to the status of a general principle, which he called the \"principle of equivalence\" when constructing his theory of relativity: As long as we restrict ourselves to purely mechanical processes in the realm where Newton's mechanics holds sway, we are certain of the equivalence of the systems K and K'.",
              "But this view of ours will not have any deeper significance unless the systems K and K' are equivalent with respect to all physical processes, that is, unless the laws of nature with respect to K are in entire agreement with those with respect to K'.",
              "By assuming this to be so, we arrive at a principle which, if it is really true, has great heuristic importance.",
              "For by theoretical consideration of processes which take place relatively to a system of reference with uniform acceleration, we obtain information as to the career of processes in a homogeneous gravitational field.",
              "Einstein combined (postulated) the equivalence principle with special relativity to predict that clocks run at different rates in a gravitational potential, and light rays bend in a gravitational field, even before he developed the concept of curved spacetime.",
              "So the original equivalence principle, as described by Einstein, concluded that free-fall and inertial motion were physically equivalent.",
              "This form of the equivalence principle can be stated as follows.",
              "An observer in a windowless room cannot distinguish between being on the surface of the Earth, and being in a spaceship in deep space accelerating at 1g.",
              "This is not strictly true, because massive bodies give rise to tidal effects (caused by variations in the strength and direction of the gravitational field) which are absent from an accelerating spaceship in deep space.",
              "The room, therefore, should be small enough that tidal effects can be neglected.",
              "Although the equivalence principle guided the development of general relativity, it is not a founding principle of relativity but rather a simple consequence of the geometrical nature of the theory.",
              "In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow geodesics of spacetime, and what we perceive as the force of gravity is instead a result of our being unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the mechanical resistance of Earth's matter or surface prevents us from doing so.",
              "Since Einstein developed general relativity, there was a need to develop a framework to test the theory against other possible theories of gravity compatible with special relativity.",
              "This was developed by Robert Dicke as part of his program to test general relativity.",
              "Two new principles were suggested, the so-called Einstein equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle, each of which assumes the weak equivalence principle as a starting point.",
              "They only differ in whether or not they apply to gravitational experiments.",
              "Another clarification needed is that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g.",
              "If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass.",
              "Accelerating it at 1g means there is a constant force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer).",
              "Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump.",
              "The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration;",
              "it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor;",
              "and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards.",
              "To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet.",
              "Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further.",
              "These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.",
              "Three forms of the equivalence principle are in current use: weak (Galilean), Einsteinian, and strong.",
              "The weak equivalence principle, also known as the universality of free fall or the Galilean equivalence principle can be stated in many ways.",

              "in consequence, physics is governed by the laws of gravity-free special relativity \u2013 at least to a certain approximation, and only if one confines any observations to a sufficiently small region of space and time.",
              "This follows from what Einstein formulated as his equivalence principle which, in turn, is inspired by the consequences of free fall.",
              "In defining the equivalence principle, there are certain subtleties.",
              "In the paragraph above, they are merely hinted at (\u201capproximately\u201d, \u201csmall region\u201d).",

              "If you pick up an object and let it drop, it falls down to the floor, in exactly the way you would expecte given your experiences here on Earth.",
              "Does that mean the elevator is indeed situated in a gravitational field like that of the Earth \u2013 as shown in the following illustration?",
              "It ain\u2019t necessarily so.",
              "Theoretically, you could be in deep space, far away from all significant mass concentrations and their gravitational influence.",
              "The room you are in could be a cabin aboard a rocket \u2013 as long as the rocket engines work at exactly the right rate to accelerate the rocket at 9.",
              "81 metres per square second.",
              "This is sketched in the following illustration: In such a situation, if you let go of an object, the cabin floor would accelerate towards that object at 9.",
              "81 metres per square second \u2013 exactly the same acceleration of free fall here on earth.",
              "From your vantage point as an observer standing on the cabin floor, you cannot distinguish between the two situations: are those objects falling towards a massive body like the earth?",
              "Or is the cabin floor accelerating towards them?",
              "(Addendum April 26, 2014: What happens with objects that do not fall down in a gravitational field on Earth, but rise up \u2013 such as a helium balloon?",
              "As this YouTube video shows, this situation obeys the equivalence principle, as well.",
              "In both cases, the air molecules that move downward/toward the cabin floor push the balloon upward \u2013 in the opposite direction of the gravitational field or in the same direction as the space ship\u2019s acceleration, respectively.)",

              "Again, you cannot be sure.",
              "Alternatively, you and the elevator could be in the gravitational field of a mass, for instance that of the earth, as long as the elevator was in free fall.",
              "In that case you, everything else within the elevator and the elevator itself would all be accelerated at exactly the same rate so that, inside, no influence of gravity could be detected.",
              "Relative to the elevator, all those objects faithfully keep their relative positions (or move at a constant speed), just as they would in a gravity-free region of space.",
              "You, as the elevator\u2019s passenger, would feel weightless \u2013 after all, in an ordinary situation here on earth, you feel your weight as gravity pulls your body down, pressing whatever part of it carries your weight onto the floor.",
              "In the falling elevator, both your body and the floor fall in parallel, at the same rate: This is the kind of weightlessness experienced, for instance, by astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS).",
              "After all, it is not as if space station and crew had escaped the earth\u2019s gravitational field \u2013 at that particular altitude, the pull of the gravitational force is still 90 per cent as strong as on the earth\u2019s surface.",
              "The astronauts\u2019 weigtlessness is due to the fact that, along with their station, they are in free fall.",
              "Not in the kind of free fall that takes them directly towards the earth, but in free fall that takes them around the earth \u2013 in earth orbit.",
              "Thus, inside an elevator, we cannot decide whether or not we are in a gravitational field or not.",
              "Whether or not objects accelerate towards the floor is a matter of reference frame: Even in a gravity-free region of space, objects fall towards the floor if the room we are in is being accelerated.",
              "Conversely, even in a gravitational field, objects drift weightlessly through space, as long as the elevator is in free fall.",
              "Einstein became convinced that this inability to distinguish a region with a gravitational field from one without was not just restricted to observations of falling bodies.",
              "He postulated that it holds true for any physical measurements at all: No experiment, no clever exploitation of the laws of physics, he claimed, can tell us whether we are in free space or in a gravitational field.",
              "This statement is called the equivalence principle.",
              "One of the consequences: In a reference frame that is in free fall, the laws of physics are the same as if there were no gravity at all \u2013 the laws of physics are those of special relativity!",
              "So far, so simple.",
              "Too simple, in fact, in several respects.",
              "Strictly speaking, all that was said about the equivalence of gravity and acceleration is true only for gravitational fields that are strictly homogeneous.",
              "Only in homogeneous gravitational fields are all bodies \u2013 per definition \u2013 accelerated in exactly the same way, namely in exactly the same direction and at exactly the same rate;",
              "as a result, it is indeed true that a researcher inside a cabin cannot distinguish acceleration from gravity.",
              "But real gravitational fields are always to a certain extent inhomogeneous.",
              "Take, for example, the gravitational field of the earth.",
              "True, here on the surface, looking at experiments which take up only a very, very small fraction f the total surface area of the earth, the gravitational field is, to good approximation, homogeneous: all objects fall to the floor along parallel paths, in the same direction (\u201cdown\u201d) and with the same acceleration (at least as long as the effects of air friction can be neglected).",
              "But if we look closer, the situation is a bit more complex.",
              "Here is an example where the deviations from homogeneity are clearly visible \u2013 a truly gigantic elevator which contains two spheres, all falling towards the earth: This extreme example shows clearly: the elevator and the spheres do not fall in parallel.",
              "Instead, they fall towards one and the same point, the earth\u2019s centre of gravity.",
              "And while an observer inside the elevator does not see the common downward component of the fall, he or she will notice that the two spheres move slightly closer together.",
              "This is what is called a tidal effect.",
              "Tidal effects are what tells a freely falling observer that he is in an inhomogeneous gravitational field, and thus definitely not in gravity-free space.",
              "Thus, a more precise formulation of the equivalence principle states that in any freely falling reference frame, the laws of physics are the same as in special relativity, as long as tidal effects can be neglected.",
              "One can, in fact, be more specific as to how tidal effects can be kept small: first of all, by confining all observations to a small region of space: in the animation above, the effects are clearly visible because the distance between the two spheres is not that much smaller than their distance to the earth.",
              "For someone here on earth dropping two objects a mere few metres apart, the effect will be virtually undetectable.",
              "On the other hand, if you watch merely a brief excerpt from the above animation, you will hardly see the two spheres move towards each other.",
              "Realizing that what matters are the size of the region, and the duration of our observations, we are led to a formulation in which the equivalence principle is not just a useful approximation, but exactly true: Within an infinitely small (\u201cinfinitesimal\u201d) spacetime region, one can always find a reference frame \u2013 an infinitely small elevator cabin, observed over an infinitely brief period of time \u2013 in which the laws of physics are the same as in special relativity.",
              "By choosing a suitably small elevator and a suitably brief period of observation, one can keep the difference between the laws of physics in that cabin and those of special relativity arbitrarily small.",

              "These force differences, in turn, are called tidal forces.",
              "The best-known example for tidal effects is the one responsible for their name: High tide and low tide at the sea-shore are caused by position-dependent variations of the gravitational force - very roughly speaking, the oceans on the side of the earth facing the moon are pulled towards that heavenly body more strongly than the solid globe of the earth, and that globe in turn feels a stronger pull than the oceans on the side facing away from the moon.",

              "General relativity generalises special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time or four-dimensional spacetime.",
              "In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present.",
              "The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of second order partial differential equations.",
              "Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes classical gravity, can be seen as a prediction of general relativity for the almost flat spacetime geometry around stationary mass distributions.",
              "Some predictions of general relativity, however, are beyond Newton's law of universal gravitation in classical physics.",
              "These predictions concern the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light, and include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, the Shapiro time delay and singularities/black holes.",
              "So far, all tests of general relativity have been shown to be in agreement with the theory.",
              "The time-dependent solutions of general relativity enable us to talk about the history of the universe and have provided the modern framework for cosmology, thus leading to the discovery of the Big Bang and cosmic microwave background radiation.",
              "Despite the introduction of a number of alternative theories, general relativity continues to be the simplest theory consistent with experimental data.",
              "Reconciliation of general relativity with the laws of quantum physics remains a problem, however, as there is a lack of a self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.",
              "It is not yet known how gravity can be unified with the three non-gravitational forces: strong, weak and electromagnetic.",
              "Einstein's theory has astrophysical implications, including the prediction of black holes\u2014regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape from them.",
              "Black holes are the end-state for massive stars.",
              "Microquasars and active galactic nuclei are believed to be stellar black holes and supermassive black holes.",
              "It also predicts gravitational lensing, where the bending of light results in multiple images of the same distant astronomical phenomenon.",
              "Other predictions include the existence of gravitational waves, which have been observed directly by the physics collaboration LIGO and other observatories.",
              "In addition, general relativity has provided the base of cosmological models of an expanding universe.",
              "Widely acknowledged as a theory of extraordinary beauty, general relativity has often been described as the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.",
              "[2] Henri Poincare\u0301's 1905 theory of the dynamics of the electron was a relativistic theory which he applied to all forces, including gravity.",
              "While others thought that gravity was instantaneous or of electromagnetic origin, he suggested that relativity was \"something due to our methods of measurement\".",
              "In his theory, he showed that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light.",
              "[3] Soon afterwards, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his relativistic framework.",
              "In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall (FFO), he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity.",
              "After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations, which form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity.",
              "[4] These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present.",
              "[5] A version of non-Euclidean geometry, called Riemannian geometry, enabled Einstein to develop general relativity by providing the key mathematical framework on which he fit his physical ideas of gravity.",
              "[6] This idea was pointed out by mathematician Marcel Grossmann and published by Grossmann and Einstein in 1913.",
              "[7] The Einstein field equations are nonlinear and considered difficult to solve.",
              "Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory.",
              "But in 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric.",
              "This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes.",
              "In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, eventually resulting in the Reissner\u2013Nordstro\u0308m solution, which is now associated with electrically charged black holes.",
              "[8] In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology.",
              "In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations\u2014the cosmological constant\u2014to match that observational presumption.",
              "[9] By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding.",
              "This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant.",

              "That is, without physical contact, any change in the position of one mass is instantly communicated to all other masses.",

              "Most of the advance is due to the gravitational pull of other planets, but a small portion of that advancement could not be accounted for by Newtona\u0302\u0080\u0099s law.",

              "Einsteina\u0302\u0080\u0099s theory of gravitation is expressed in one deceptively simple-looking tensor equation (tensors are a generalization of scalars and vectors), which expresses how a mass determines the curvature of space-time around it.",
              "The solutions to that equation yield one of the most fascinating predictions: the black hole.",
              "The prediction is that if an object is sufficiently dense, it will collapse in upon itself and be surrounded by an event horizon from which nothing can escape.",
              "The name a\u0302\u0080\u009cblack hole,a\u0302\u0080\u009d which was coined by astronomer John Wheeler in 1969, refers to the fact that light cannot escape such an object.",
              "Karl Schwarzschild was the first person to note this phenomenon in 1916, but at that time, it was considered mostly to be a mathematical curiosity.",
              "Surprisingly, the idea of a massive body from which light cannot escape dates back to the late 1700s.",
              "Independently, John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace used Newtona\u0302\u0080\u0099s law of gravitation to show that light leaving the surface of a star with enough mass could not escape.",
              "Their work was based on the fact that the speed of light had been measured by Ole RA\u0303 \u0327mer in 1676.",
              "He noted discrepancies in the data for the orbital period of the moon Io about Jupiter.",
              "RA\u0303 \u0327mer realized that the difference arose from the relative positions of Earth and Jupiter at different times and that he could find the speed of light from that difference.",
              "Michell and Laplace both realized that since light had a finite speed, there could be a star massive enough that the escape speed from its surface could exceed that speed.",
              "Hence, light always would fall back to the star.",
              "Oddly, observers far enough away from the very largest stars would not be able to see them, yet they could see a smaller star from the same distance.",
              "Recall that in Gravitational Potential Energy and Total Energy, we found that the escape speed, given by Equation 13.",
              "6, is independent of the mass of the object escaping.",
              "Even though the nature of light was not fully understood at the time, the mass of light, if it had any, was not relevant.",
              "Hence, Equation 13.",
              "6 should be valid for light.",
              "Substituting c, the speed of light, for the escape velocity, we have Thus, we only need values for R and M such that the escape velocity exceeds c, and then light will not be able to escape.",
              "Michell posited that if a star had the density of our Sun and a radius that extended just beyond the orbit of Mars, then light would not be able to escape from its surface.",
              "He also conjectured that we would still be able to detect such a star from the gravitational effect it would have on objects around it.",
              "This was an insightful conclusion, as this is precisely how we infer the existence of such objects today.",
              "While we have yet to, and may never, visit a black hole, the circumstantial evidence for them has become so compelling that few astronomers doubt their existence.",
              "Before we examine some of that evidence, we turn our attention back to Schwarzschilda\u0302\u0080\u0099s solution to the tensor equation from general relativity.",
              "In that solution arises a critical radius, now called the Schwarzschild radius (RS)(RS).",
              "For any mass M, if that mass were compressed to the extent that its radius becomes less than the Schwarzschild radius, then the mass will collapse to a singularity, and anything that passes inside that radius cannot escape.",
              "Once inside RSRS, the arrow of time takes all things to the singularity.",
              "(In a broad mathematical sense, a singularity is where the value of a function goes to infinity.",
              "In this case, it is a point in space of zero volume with a finite mass.",
              "Hence, the mass density and gravitational energy become infinite.)",
              "The Schwarzschild radius is given by If you look at our escape velocity equation with vesc=cvesc=c, you will notice that it gives precisely this result.",
              "But that is merely a fortuitous accident caused by several incorrect assumptions.",

              "In the early 1600s, based on astronomical observations, Kepler established that the orbit described by a planet in the solar system is an ellipse, with the sun occupying one of its foci.",
              "Assuming that a planet is subject only to the gravitational attraction of the sun, Kepler's result is easily obtained mathematically in Newton's theory.",
              "But the other planets also have a gravitational attraction on the planet in question.",
              "What is the effect of their presence?",
              "If one repeats the calculation taking into account this complication, the result is that the attraction exerted by all the other planets of the solar system on the planet in question induces an advance (precession) of the perihelion (the point of maximum approach to the sun of the orbit of the planet), orbit after orbit.",
              "The precession of the Earth's rotation axis also gives rise to the same effect.",
              "For example, Mercury's perihelion moves slightly at the speed of 5,600 arcseconds per century, in the same direction in which the planet rotates around the sun.",
              "However, removing the contribution of the Earth's precession (5,025 arcseconds) does not correctly predict what happens in reality, due to the attraction of the other planets as calculated according to Newtonian physics.",
              "The balance indeed misses 43 arcseconds.",
              "It is a general conviction, supported by centennial computations, that this deviation of Mercury's orbit from the observed precession cannot be achieved by Newtonian theory.",
              "This is the famous anomalous rate of precession of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit.",
              "It was originally recognized by the French Astronomer Urbain Le Verrier in 1859 as being an important astronomical problem.",
              "Starting from 1843, Le Verrier reanalyzed observations of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit from 1697 to 1848, by showing that the rate of the precession of the perihelion was not consistent with the previsions of Newtonian theory.",
              "This discrepancy of 38'' arcseconds per tropical century, which was corrected to 43'' by the Canadian-American astronomer Simon Newcomb in 1882, seemed until now impossible to be accounted through Newton's theory.",
              "Various ad hoc and unsuccessful solutions have been proposed, but these introduced more problems. The most famous approach by 19th-century astronomers was an attempt to explain this discrepancy through the perturbing effect of a hitherto undiscovered planet, Vulcan, smaller than Mercury and even closer to the sun.",
              "However, the search for this planet turned out to be unfruitful.",
              "The solution of the problem was provided by Albert Einstein through his general theory of relativity in 1916.",

              "The first approach concerns the approximation in which one considers Mercury's orbit as being circular instead of elliptical.",
              "The second approach is realized by considering Mercury's orbit in terms of harmonic oscillator.",
              "The third approach arises from Kepler's third law.",
              "Overall, the general theory of relativity remains more precise than Newtonian physics, but my approach shows that the Newtonian framework is more powerful than researchers and astronomers were thinking before this paper, at least for the case of Mercury.",
              "On the other hand, my Newtonian formula of the advance of planets' perihelion breaks down for the other planets.",
              "The predicted Newtonian result is indeed too large for Venus and Earth.",
              "Therefore, in my paper it is also shown that corrections due to gravitational and rotational time dilation, in an intermediate framework that analyzes gravity between Newton and Einstein, solve the problem.",
              "By adding such corrections, I found a result consistent with the one of general relativity.",
              "Thus, the most important results of this paper are: (1) It is not correct that Newtonian theory cannot predict the anomalous rate of precession of the perihelion of planets' orbit.",
              "The real problem is instead that a pure Newtonian prediction is too large.",
              "(2) Perihelion's precession can be achieved with the same precision of general relativity by extending Newtonian gravity through the inclusion of gravitational and rotational time dilation effects.",

              "By contrast with these papers, my work considers the importance of rotational time dilation.",
              "Finally, it is important to stress that a better understanding of gravitational effects in an intermediate framework between Newtonian theory and general relativity, one of the goals of this paper, could, in principle, be crucial for a subsequent better understanding of the famous dark matter and dark energy problems. In the future, I will attempt to use a similar approach in the framework of the galaxy rotation problem.",

              "The observations were of the total solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 and were carried out by two expeditions, one to the West African island of Pri\u0301ncipe, and the other to the Brazilian town of Sobral.",
              "The aim of the expeditions was to measure the gravitational deflection of starlight passing near the Sun.",
              "[1] The value of this deflection had been predicted by Albert Einstein in a 1911 paper;",
              "however, this initial prediction turned out not to be correct because it was based on an incomplete theory of general relativity.",
              "Einstein later improved his prediction after finalizing his theory in 1915 and obtaining the solution to his equations by Karl Schwarzschild.",
              "Following the return of the expeditions, the results were presented by Eddington to the Royal Society of London[2] and, after some deliberation, were accepted.",
              "Widespread newspaper coverage of the results led to worldwide fame for Einstein and his theories.",
              "One of the first considerations of gravitational deflection of light was published in 1801, when Johann Georg von Soldner pointed out that Newtonian gravity predicts that starlight will be deflected when it passes near a massive object.",
              "Initially, in a paper published in 1911, Einstein had incorrectly calculated that the amount of light deflection was the same as the Newtonian value, that is 0.",

              "He did not believe existing eclipse photos would be useful.",
              "In 1912 Freundlich asked if Perrine would include observation of light deflection as part of the Argentine Observatory's program for the solar eclipse of October 10, 1912, in Brazil.",

              "[3] Eddington and Perrine spent several days together in Brazil and may have discussed their observation programs including Einstein's prediction of light deflection.",
              "[4] In 1914 three eclipse expeditions, from Argentina, Germany, and the US, were committed to testing Einstein's theory by observing for light deflection.",

              "The German astronomers were either forced to return home or were taken prisoner by the Russians.",
              "Although the US and Argentine astronomers were not detained, clouds prevented clear observations being made during the eclipse.",
              "Perrine's photographs, although not clear enough to prove Einstein's prediction, were the first obtained in an attempt to test Einstein's prediction of light deflection.",
              "[3][5][6] A second attempt by American astronomers to measure the effect during the 1918 eclipse was foiled by clouds in one location[7] and by ambiguous results due to the lack of the correct equipment in another.",

              "If results had been obtained they may have disproved the 1911 prediction setting back Einstein's reputation.",

              "75 seconds of arc for a star on the limb.",
              "Einstein and subsequent astronomers both benefitted from this correction.",
              "[10] Eddington's interest in general relativity began in 1916, during World War I, when he read papers by Einstein (presented in Berlin, Germany, in 1915), which had been sent by the neutral Dutch physicist Willem de Sitter to the Royal Astronomical Society in Britain.",
              "Eddington, later said to be one of the few people at the time to understand the theory, realised its significance and lectured on relativity at a meeting at the British Association in 1916.",
              "He emphasised the importance of testing the theory by methods such as eclipse observations of light deflection, and the Astronomer Royal, Frank Watson Dyson began to make plans for the eclipse of May 1919, which would be particularly suitable for such a test.",
              "Eddington also produced a major report on general relativity for the Physical Society, published as Report on the Relativity Theory of Gravitation (1918).",
              "Eddington also lectured on relativity at Cambridge University, where he had been professor of astronomy since 1913.",
              "[a] Wartime conscription in Britain was introduced in 1917.",
              "At the age of 34, Eddington was eligible to be drafted into the military, but his exemption from this was obtained by his university on the grounds of national interest.",
              "This exemption was later appealed by the War Ministry, and at a series of hearings in June and July 1918, Eddington, who was a Quaker, stated that he was a conscientious objector, based on religious grounds.",
              "[12] At the final hearing, the Astronomer Royal, Frank Watson Dyson, supported the exemption by proposing that Eddington undertake an expedition to observe the total eclipse in May the following year to test Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.",
              "The appeal board granted a twelve-month extension for Eddington to do so.",
              "Although this extension was rendered moot by the signing of the Armistice in November, ending the war, the expedition went ahead as planned.",
              "The theory behind the experiment concerns the predicted deflection of light by the Sun.",
              "The first observation of light deflection was performed by noting the change in position of stars as they passed near the Sun on the celestial sphere.",
              "The approximate angular deflection \u03b4\u03c6 for a massless particle coming in from infinity and going back out to infinity is given by the following formula:[b] Here, b can be interpreted as the distance of closest approach.",
              "Although this formula is approximate, it is accurate for most measurements of gravitational lensing, due to the smallness of the ratio rs/b.",
              "For light grazing the surface of the Sun, the approximate angular deflection is roughly 1.",
              "75 arcseconds.",
              "[2] This is twice the value predicted by calculations using the Newtonian theory of gravity.",
              "It was this difference in the deflection between the two theories that Eddington's expedition and other later eclipse observers would attempt to observe.",
              "The aim of the expeditions was to take advantage of the shielding effect of the Moon during a total solar eclipse, and to use astrometry to measure the positions of the stars in the sky around the Sun during the eclipse.",
              "These stars, not normally visible in the daytime due to the brightness of the Sun, would become visible during the moment of totality when the Moon covered the solar disc.",
              "A difference in the observed position of the stars during the eclipse, compared to their normal position (measured some months earlier at night, when the Sun is not in the field of view), would indicate that the light from these stars had bent as it passed close to the Sun.",
              "Dyson, when planning the expedition in 1916, had chosen the 1919 eclipse because it would take place with the Sun in front of a bright group of stars called the Hyades.",
              "The brightness of these stars would make it easier to measure any changes in position.",
              "Two teams of two people were to be sent to make observations of the eclipse at two locations: the West African island of Pri\u0301ncipe and the Brazilian town of Sobral.",
              "The Pri\u0301ncipe expedition members were Eddington and Edwin Turner Cottingham, from the Cambridge Observatory, while the Sobral expedition members were Andrew Crommelin and Charles Rundle Davidson, from the Greenwich Observatory in London.",
              "Eddington was Director of the Cambridge Observatory, and Cottingham was a clockmaker who worked on the observatory's instruments.",

              "The theory is correct anyway.\"",
              "[28]) the evidence of Einstein's letters to other scientists indicates, on the contrary, that he was both impressed and moved by the new results, and regarded them as an important success.",
              "[29] The 1919 results were also used as part of the systematic efforts by the Nobel laureate Philipp Lenard to discredit Einstein, whom Lenard, himself an avid national socialist and exponent of what he saw as \"German physics,\" saw as a dangerous exponent of unnatural \"Jewish physics\".",
              "[30] Lenard pointed to the 1801 prediction that Johann Georg von Soldner had derived from Newtonian gravity for starlight bending around a massive object,[31] which corresponds to half the general-relativistic prediction derived by Einstein in 1915, and thus to Einstein's own earlier derivation of 1911, and claimed that it proved Einstein to be a plagiarist, and that von Soldner deserved to be given credit for the 1919 result.",
              "Both the 1919 results themselves and Eddington's text book on general relativity, whose second edition including the results saw numerous translations as interest in Einstein's theory grew, played important roles in the reception of Einstein's theory in the scientific community.",
              "[32] It is notable that while the Eddington results were seen as a confirmation of Einstein's prediction, and in that capacity soon found their way into general relativity text books,[33] among observers followed a decade-long discussion of the quantitative values of light deflection, with the precise results in contention even after several expeditions had repeated Eddington's observations on the occasion of subsequent eclipses.",
              "[34] The discussion concerned both the data analysis \u2013 such as the different weight assigned to different stars in the 1922 and 1929 eclipse expeditions \u2013 and the question of specific systematic effects that could skew the results.",
              "[35][36] All in all, eclipse measurements of this kind, using visible light, retained considerable uncertainty, and it was only radio-astronomical measurements in the late 1960s that definitively showed that the amount of deflection was the full value predicted by general relativity, and not half that number as predicted by a \"Newtonian\" calculation.",
              "[37] Those measurements and their successors are nowadays an important part of the so-called post-Newtonian tests of gravity, the systematic way of parametrizing the predictions of general relativity and other theories in terms of ten adjustable parameters in the context of the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism, where each parameter represents a possible departure from Newton's law of universal gravitation.",
              "The earliest parameterizations of the post-Newtonian approximation were performed by Eddington (1922).",
              "The parameter concerned with the amount of deflection of light by a gravitational source is the so-called Eddington parameter (\u03b3), and it is currently the best-constrained of the ten post-Newtonian parameters.",
              "At about the time of the last serious photo-plate eclipse measurements, by a University of Texas expedition observing in Mauretania in 1973, doubts began to surface about whether or not the original Eddington measurements were sufficient to vindicate Einstein's prediction, or whether biased analysis by Eddington and his colleagues had skewed the results.",
              "[38] Similar concerns about systematic errors and possibly confirmation bias were raised in the science history community[39] and gained more prominence as part of the popular book The Golem by Trevor Pinch and Harry Collins.",
              "[40] A modern reanalysis of the dataset, though, suggests that Eddington's analysis was accurate, and in fact less afflicted by bias than some of the analyses of solar eclipse data that followed.",
              "[41][42] Part of the vindication comes from a 1979 reanalysis of the plates from the two Sobral instruments, using a much more modern plate-measuring machine than was available in 1919, which supports Eddington's results.",

              "Albert Einstein proposed[3][4] three tests of general relativity, subsequently called the \"classical tests\" of general relativity, in 1916: In the letter to The Times (of London) on November 28, 1919, he described the theory of relativity and thanked his English colleagues for their understanding and testing of his work.",
              "He also mentioned three classical tests with comments:[5] Under Newtonian physics, an object in an (isolated) two-body system, consisting of the object orbiting a spherical mass, would trace out an ellipse with the center of mass of the system at a focus of the ellipse.",

              "The challenge, and it\u2019s a big one, is that if a tumultuous astrophysical encounter occurs far away, then by the time the resulting spatial undulations wash by Earth they will have spread so widely that they will be fantastically diluted, perhaps stretching and compressing space by only a fraction of an atomic nucleus.",
              "Nevertheless, researchers have developed a technology that just might be able to see the tiny telltale signs of a ripple in the fabric of space as it rolls by Earth.",
              "In 2001, two four-kilometer-long L-shaped devices, collectively known as LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory), were deployed in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington.",
              "The strategy is that a passing gravitational wave would alternately stretch and compress the two arms of each L, leaving an imprint on laser light racing up and down each arm.",
              "In 2010, LIGO was decommissioned, before any gravitational wave signatures had been detected\u2014the apparatus almost certainly lacked the sensitivity necessary to record the tiny twitches caused by a gravitational wave reaching Earth.",
              "But now an advanced version of LIGO, an upgrade expected to be ten times as sensitive, is being implemented, and researchers anticipate that within a few years the detection of ripples in space caused by distant cosmic disturbances will be commonplace.",
              "Success would be exciting not because anyone really doubts general relativity, but because confirmed links between the theory and observation can yield powerful new applications.",
              "The eclipse measurements of 1919, for example, which established that gravity bends light\u2019s trajectory, have inspired a successful technique now used for finding distant planets.",
              "When such planets pass in front of their host stars, they slightly focus the star\u2019s light causing a pattern of brightening and dimming that astronomers can detect.",
              "A similar technique has also allowed astronomers to measure the mass of particular galaxies by observing how severely they distort the trajectory of light emitted by yet more distant sources.",
              "Another, more familiar example is the global positioning system, which relies on Einstein\u2019s discovery that gravity affects the passage of time.",
              "A GPS device determines its location by measuring the travel time of signals received from various orbiting satellites.",
              "Without taking account of gravity\u2019s impact on how time elapses on the satellites, the GPS system would fail to correctly determine the location of an object, including your car or a guided missile.",
              "Physicists believe that the detection of gravitational waves has the capacity to generate its own application of profound importance: a new approach to observational astronomy.",
              "Since the time of Galileo, we have turned telescopes skyward to gather light waves emitted by distant objects.",
              "The next phase of astronomy may very well center on gathering gravitational waves produced by distant cosmic upheavals, allowing us to probe the universe in a wholly new way.",
              "This is particularly exciting because waves of light could not penetrate the plasma that filled space until a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang\u2014but waves of gravity could.",
              "One day we may thus use gravity, not light, as our most penetrating probe of the universe\u2019s earliest moments.",
              "Because waves of gravity ripple through space somewhat as waves of sound ripple through air, scientists speak of \u201clistening\u201d for gravitational signals.",
