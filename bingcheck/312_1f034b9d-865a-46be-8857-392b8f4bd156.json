    "query": "What are the key factors that contribute to successful collaboration between teams in a professional setting, and how can individuals foster and maintain these collaborative relationships in a remote or hybrid work environment?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Collaboration between teams is essential for achieving organizational goals and fostering innovation. According to various sources[^2^] [^3^] [^4^], some of the key factors that contribute to successful collaboration between teams are:\n\n- **A compelling direction**: Teams need to have a clear and challenging goal that motivates and aligns them.\n- **A strong structure**: Teams need to have well-defined roles, responsibilities, norms, and processes that facilitate coordination and communication.\n- **A supportive context**: Teams need to have access to adequate resources, information, training, and rewards that enable them to perform effectively.\n- **A shared mindset**: Teams need to have a common understanding of their purpose, values, and expectations, and avoid biases and stereotypes that can create divisions.\n\nThese factors are especially important for teams that work remotely or in a hybrid environment, as they face additional challenges such as geographic distance, cultural diversity, time zone differences, and technological issues. To foster and maintain these collaborative relationships in such settings, individuals can:\n\n- **Communicate frequently and transparently**: Use various channels and tools to share information, feedback, ideas, and emotions with team members. Be respectful, honest, and inclusive in your communication.\n- **Build trust and rapport**: Establish personal connections with team members by showing interest, empathy, and appreciation. Engage in social interactions and informal conversations that help you get to know each other better.\n- **Leverage diversity and creativity**: Recognize and value the different perspectives, skills, and experiences that team members bring to the table. Encourage brainstorming, experimentation, and learning from mistakes.\n- **Manage expectations and conflicts**: Clarify roles, responsibilities, deadlines, and deliverables with team members. Address any issues or disagreements that arise promptly and constructively.\n\nI hope this helps you understand some of the key factors and strategies for effective collaboration between teams.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "In part, the prevalence of teams within orga- nizations is due to the complex problems that orga- nizations often face and the synergistic benefits that the use of teams can provide to organizations\u2014that is, teams offer the capability to achieve what cannot be accomplished by one individual acting alone (Hackman, 2011).",
              "Some have heralded teams to be a basic building block of organizations today (Stewart & Barrick, 2000).",
              "Subsequently, there is no lack of theory, research, and consultants in the area of teams and their development (Cannon-Bowers & Bowers, 2010).",
              "In fact, given their prominence in organizations, significant investments have been devoted to ensuring teams will succeed, including investment in scholarship as well as practical tools and resources (Lacerenza, Marlow, Tannenbaum, & Salas, 2018;",
              "Shuffler, DiazGranados, & Salas, 2011).",
              "As a result, numerous scientific reviews have been undertaken to extract the individual, team, system, organizational, and environmental factors that define and shape effective teamwork (Humphrey & Aime, 2014;",

              "We broadly define these actions taken to alter the performance trajectories of organizational teams as TDIs.",

              "Further complicating the issue, although there are distinct types of TDIs recognized in the literature that may potentially complement one another, they have been developed and evaluated in relative isolation from one another (Weaver, Dy, & Rosen, 2014) and to varying degrees of scientific rigor.",
              "Accordingly, an organized perspective that distinguishes TDIs backed by a solid science is much overdue.",
              "As such, this review addresses four major needs that must be resolved to advance TDI research and practice in organizations.",

              "Second, we offer in one place a more indepth review of the different types of TDIs that have garnered substantial attention in the academic litera- ture (Need 2).",
              "In identifying major themes in these literatures, we offer guidance as to the state of the science in terms of each TDI\u2019s current or potential contribution.",
              "Third, in an effort to discuss what makes TDIs effective, we leverage a relatively simple heuristic of \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cwhy,\u201d \u201cwho,\u201d \u201cwhen,\u201d and \u201chow,\u201d to synthesize the impact that TDI characteristics have in shaping whether a particular TDI is ultimately successful or not for a given context or team.",
              "Using our definition and this heuristic, we address a third need in terms of creating a foundation for better understanding how the various TDIs can be better integrated so they may work together (Need 3).",
              "We leverage structural elements of prominent team effectiveness models (i.",
              "e., McGrath, 1964;",
              "Marks, Mathieu, & Zaccaro, 2001), and based on our review of the literature, introduce an integrative framework that considers dynamic team developmental needs to offer direction for determining what TDI or combination of TDIs may be most effective in shaping team performance trajectories.",
              "Last, to push the science and practice of TDIs toward a more holistic evolution (Need 4), we conclude with future directions in terms of considerations regarding potential advancements for empirically and methodologically applying a more integrative perspective to TDIs, especially across organizational contexts.",
              "Each of these needs is particularly important to address, given that we view TDI research and practice as being at a critical crossroads: TDIs can either evolve dynamically to keep up with practical organization demands or continue with the same static lens that is quickly becoming irrelevant.",
              "We began our introduction with the most inclusive definitions in terms of what could possibly be included as a TDI.",
              "This is purposeful in terms of directing a focus on bounding TDIs as requiring intentional action(s) targeted at team performance trajectories.",
              "More specifically, these actions may attempt to (1) improve and support teams that may be struggling or failing, (2) maintain and sustain teams that are adequately performing, and (3) grow and maximize the capacities of teams ready to mature to a higher level of performance.",
              "As such, this drills down from broader categories such as organizational development interventions or human resource efforts, to set the team as the focal unit of analysis for this type of intervention.",
              "However, the simplistic nature of this definition leaves room for including TDIs that may make attempts yet fail every time to impact team performance trajectories.",
              "Moving from this rather broad conceptualization, our first aim is to drill down further into TDIs as a meaningful term, reviewing the extant scientific literature to critically evaluate what an effective TDI looks like and what the broad state of the science looks like regarding trends and patterns in TDI research.",
              "We conducted a series of searches for academic publications within the broader organizational behavior, management, and psychology literatures.",
              "Databases searched included PsycInfo, Academic OneSource, MedLine, and Google Scholar.",

              "When systematic reviews and meta-analyses of TDIs were identified, the reference lists were searched to ensure all relevant articles were included.",
              "Although we did not set a timeframe for our searches, the vast majority of sources came from the past 50 years, in line with similar reviews that acknowledge the early 1970s as the start of a concerted interest in team development (Tannenbaum, Beard, & Salas, 1992).",
              "Likewise, we excluded sports team sources, a common occurrence in the team literature due to the niche nature of such work as compared with other organizational teams (Klein, DiazGranados, Salas, Le, Burke, Lyons, & Goodwin, 2009;",
              "Salas, Cooke, & Rosen, 2008a).",
              "Finally, to be retained, the article had to describe some clear form of TDI.",
              "Our initial searches in these sources resulted in more than 5,000 potentially relevant articles that were then sorted to remove irrelevant articles (e.",
              "g., sports coaching and patient health interventions performed by health-care teams instead of team interventions).",
              "In particular, although some of our resulting TDI types [e.",
              "g., team leadership (TL), team composition (TCo), and team performance monitoring] have broader literatures beyond just that focused on an intervention perspective, we excluded any sources that did not focus on interventions in some form.",
              "Both qualitative and quantitative empirical articles were retained if the intervention they described met the aforementioned broad definition, including case studies, experimental, and quasi- experimental designs.",
              "In addition, we retained sys- tematic reviews and meta-analyses for confirming our overarching themes within and across TDIs.",
              "Overall, our final sample consisted of 514 articles.",
              "Next, we reviewed these articles with two intentions.",
              "First, we examined the approaches, findings, and contributions to establish common themes across TDIs, to address Need 3 (integration of TDIs) and Need 4 (future directions).",
              "Second, we grouped articles based on the types of TDIs they addressed, enabling us to develop within-TDI themes regarding quality of the research thus far, as well as important themes for understanding the impact of and considerations for different TDIs to address Need 1 (defining TDIs) and Need 2 (review of the literature).",
              "Each of the first three authors reviewed the literatures separately and then met to discuss themes within and across TDIs, reconciling any disagreements with one another and with input from the fourth author to produce a final set of themes within and across TDIs.",
              "There is a value in addressing an in-depth review (Need 2), especially in terms of identifying the TDIs that target the developmental needs of teams. Specifically, there have been several dominant view- points of how teams develop: (1) teams develop linearly (i.",
              "e., consistently in the same pattern over time;",
              "Tuckman, 1965) or (2) teams experience some type of temporally based punctuated shift as described in the punctuated equilibrium model (Gersick, 1988).",
              "Recognizing that teams may function more cyclically than linearly, other models have further incorporated this structure, such as in the input-process-output (IPO) model advanced by McGrath (1984), Steiner (1972), and Hackman (1987), that conceptualizes team effectiveness as a system of inputs, processes, and outcomes that influence one another.",
              "By using the lens of the IPO model, we are able to organize our review based on the target of each TDI reviewed.",
              "Similar reviews exploring the effectiveness of individual TDIs do exist in the extant literature and we have relied on these to guide us, especially in identifying and synthesizing key empirical findings.",
              "However, each review highlights only a single TDI at a time, limiting our ability to create a more comprehensive perspective.",
              "Thus, although a full empirical, meta-analytical review is beyond the scope of our current review, it is critical to provide some deeper insight into the different categories of TDIs.",

              "Researchers have considered factors such as importance, frequency, time spent, time to proficiency, criticality of task, difficulty of performing it, and consequences of error (Sanchez & Fraser, 1992) among other factors when assessing work behaviors.",
              "Accordingly, given that TTA built on the individual task analysis work, it is not surprising to see that some of the same features that were relevant for individuals will likewise be relevant for teams, namely, Bowers, Baker, and Salas\u2019 (1994) creation of a team task inventory included dimensions such as importance to train, task criticality, task frequency, task difficulty, difficulty to train, and overall team importance.",
              "Likewise, Lantz and Brav (2007) detail a variety of task features that are also relevant to teams including demand on responsibility, cognitive demands, and learning opportunities.",
              "That said, there are also factors that are only applicable when considering team tasks.",
              "For instance, Campion et al.",
              "(1996) provided evidence that the degree of dependency (i.",

              "As detailed earlier, researchers have started to coalesce in the way that team task features are measured in terms of the techniques used, the sources of information regarding the team\u2019s task, and what features of the task are assessed.",

              "Accordingly, it may be a fruitful direction for researchers to consider both summary indices and heterogeneity scores within single studies, given that Kichuk and Wiesner (1997) evidenced a multilayered story surrounding team compositional effects when considering both summary indexes and heterogeneity scores of team member personality.",
              "The vast majority of studies that have considered TCo have done so with the mindset that TCo is set early in the team\u2019s life cycle and will have downstream effects on team processes and ultimately on team performance.",

              "In fact, the TCo literature is quite diverse.",
              "For instance, work in this literature stream has looked at composition in a variety of ways including considerations of cognitive styles (Aggarwal & Woolley, 2013), general mental ability (Barrick, Stewart Neubert, & Mount, 1998), cultural diversity (Gibson & Saxton, 2005;",

              "e., individual, team, organization;",
              "Salas et al.",
              ", 2007), team needs may be many.",
              "For example, the degree to which team processes, or how the team actually performed the tasks, are maintained, weakened, or strengthened during interaction should be assessed.",
              "Using this multidimensional view, TDIs may be targeted to impact team processes, states, performance goals, and learning, at either the individual or team levels.",
              "As a second important layer to this elemental feature is that when we say TDIs have an \u201cimpact\u201d on the team, this is not meant to imply that TDIs are only focused on increasing functional processes within a team (Shuffler, Jimenez, & Kramer, 2016).",
              "In fact, given that there are also teamwork factors that can be dysfunctional in nature, the need that a given TDI may be addressing could be to reduce certain dys-functional teamwork factors.",
              "Thus, not all of the needs being addressed by TDIs mean that more is better\u2014instead, the TDI should have an impact that is in the appropriate direction for that particular type of need.",
              "Although the previous discussion focused on the type of outcome that is being impacted, our next key feature of effective TDIs addresses the reasoning behind the intervention in the first place.",
              "Although we may know what the need is, it is also important to consider whether this need is more emergent in nature, potentially arising un-expectedly and requiring teams to react, or if it is implemented in anticipation of future needs, setting a team up for future success or cutting off the chances of unexpected breakdowns.",
              "On one hand, some effective TDIs are inherently derived and implemented as a means to specifically and proactively: (1) reduce the likelihood of critical team problems or needs emerging in the future, or (2) encourage well-functioning teams to achieve further synergy or process gains that will advance them to a higher level of performance (Hackman, 2003).",
              "TDIs such as cross-training can provide a pre-emptive view of what a team may need to be prepared for, either to anticipate where a future coordination failure may be most likely, or to allow for enhancement of already effective coordination processes (Blickensderfer et al.",
              ", 1998).",
              "Yet as we have highlighted, teams are not simply successful from the beginning.",
              "Process loss and team derailment occur when teams are unable to achieve their goals due to interpersonal conflict (Sims & Salas, 2007), inability to adapt to change (Burke et al.",
              ", 2006), or similar breakdowns in team competencies and skills.",
              "From this view, some TDIs may be more inherently attuned to addressing more reactive team issues, such that they are designed to fix team issues before they further escalate.",
              "This does not mean that all TDIs that are reactive in scope are frantically thrown together or addressing unanticipated needs.",
              "Indeed, TDIs that could be considered reactive, such as debriefs that occur after the loss of a patient may be designed in advance so that they can be used during a period of process loss (Tannenbaum & Cerasoli, 2013).",
              "However, they are not necessarily appropriate to implement if there is nothing yet to react to\u2014 indeed, by its nature a debrief is not possible until a team has had a chance to work together.",
              "In sum, much like a patient whose symptoms will not improve without seeing a doctor for a diagnosis and prescription, teams who are already struggling to perform can benefit with the right TDI that is designed to react to their problems. Similarly, as a healthy individual still needs a regular checkup to fine tune health habits for well-being maintenance and improvement, even well-functioning teams can benefit from proactive TDIs that preemptively address potential future needs or challenge them to move beyond the current status quo.",
              "We continue the health analogy as we explore who it is that is involved in TDIs.",
              "Essentially, organizations, leaders, consultants, and teams often find themselves in the metaphorical role of the \u201cteam doctor.",
              "\u201d They are responsible for carefully diagnosing the symptoms that are creating team dysfunction, as well as the symptoms that may promote their functioning, with some symptoms being much more obvious than others.",
              "With this holistic understanding of the symptoms, they must then select and implement the right prescription of TDIs.",
              "But who exactly is the doctor for teams?",
              "It can vary based on the intervention, and even may vary within categories of interventions, albeit usually to a lesser degree.",
              "From one view, bringing in an outside perspective can be seen as a beneficial way to develop, implement, and evaluate TDIs as it may provide a more objective perspective, as well as allow for the incorporation of SMEs well versed in the TDIs they are implementing (Cannon-Bowers et al.",
              ", 1995).",
              "However, other interventions rely heavily on the team members themselves to contribute to the diagnosing and intervention design.",
              "For example, TB (Dyer, 2007) requires critical input from the team with regard to its needs before any intervention design and implementation.",
              "Other factors may also drive the \u201cwho\u201d aspect.",
              "TDIs such as TB that are most effective when they engage a consistent set of team members in the design and implementation process may not be the most appropriate for teams with regular and rapid turnover of members.",
              "Instead, an outsider or team leader may be more beneficial for identifying individual teamwork skills that are quickly trained and can be transportable, such as in aviation\u2019s CRM program (Wiener, Kanki, & Helmriech, 2010).",
              "In this form of TT, the focus is on the individual, where transferable teamwork skills are developed that can be applied to a wide range of teamwork environments, a crucial need for aviation crews that regu- larly rotate on a daily basis.",
              "Other TDIs are more holistically focused at the team level, whereby the goal is to focus on addressing the collective needs of the team, such as with TChs that are designed to help lay out and form the structure of the team as a whole (Mathieu & Rapp, 2009).",
              "The focus of this fourth elemental feature is perhaps one of the most critical yet least explored empirically.",
              "As teams are formed to achieve some goal or higher order purpose, it is only logical that they will begin to change, grow, and develop over time as they interact to achieve this goal.",
              "To have any impact on a team, at the very basic level a TDI must be applied at least once to a team, in whatever form that application or approach may be (as will be discussed next).",
              "However, timing and temporality are much more complex for teams. First, there is the view of team development over time, outside of any specific intervention.",
              "As we previously mentioned, several viewpoints have been published in the literature on how teams develop (i.",
              "e., linearly, or via or via punctuated shifts).",
              "Historically the use of the IPO model advanced our understanding about team functioning, but more recently Marks et al.",
              "(2001) leverage the IPO framework to note that not only may teams go through cycles, their cycles may vary in their temporal rhythms, which may even vary within teams working on different tasks.",
              "This framework is a critical recognition of the cyclical nature of team-work, presenting some initial guidance as well in terms of what processes may be enacted in these different cycles.",
              "Finally, Kozlowski et al.",
              "(1999) also leverage this cyclical approach to specifically address team development, whereby needs change for teams as they are moving forward.",
              "This framework posits that team development is actually a process of compilation.",
              "That is, teams develop as a process where skills progress relatively linearly, but this progression is punctuated by transitions as skills are mastered and the team shifts their attention to the development of more complex knowledge and skills.",
              "As such, to be effective, it is important to consider proximal and distal views in terms of when a particular intervention may be most appropriate.",
              "From a more proximal view, the current point in a singular performance cycle may help inform TDI selection, such as using a debrief at the end of a performance cycle instead of the beginning.",
              "Further, the more distal view of time can also inform how TDIs may need to change as a function of how the team is changing.",
              "Taking such a view would allow researchers to consider how either the intervention itself must change, or how the content of the intervention may need to shift over time.",
              "For example, while teams may need more hands-on guidance to shape skill development early on, as they become more experienced, leaders may actually switch to more of a coaching role, serving to offer more limited guidance.",
              "Overall, these timing issues can become quite crucial to TDI selection and implementation, and require further attention.",
              "The final elemental feature of effective TDIs taps into what is largely Need 3: how do we go about integrating and developing effective teams?",
              "In our view, TDIs are not actions that are taken by happenstance that alter the team\u2019s performance.",
              "Instead, we consider TDIs to be intentional for the specific needs of the team.",
              "The intention behind this is to reverberate the need for TDIs to focus on the team needs with an intentional purpose.",
              "All too often it is easy for a leader or organization to want to participate in some TB or TT exercise without fully knowing why it would be useful.",
              "This lack of a clear objective matched to the TDI creates the potential for the intervention to be viewed as useless or a waste of time\u2014as more often than not, it probably is a waste (Payne, 2001;",
              "Salas et al.",
              ", 2005).",
              "From a simplistic viewpoint, the answer to this \u201chow\u201d of TDIs is essentially best determined by posing the earlier four elemental features as questions whose answers can guide the selection of the right type of TDIs for a given situation.",
              "That is, how TDIs are best implemented is essentially contingent on what the team needs (and how many different needs they may have), if those needs are more proactive or more reactive in nature (the why), who is willing and able to be involved in the intervention design, implementation, and evaluation, and when the intervention should be implemented in respect to the temporal dynamics of the team.",
              "Although the heuristic described earlier offers a means for addressing Need 1 (Defining TDIs), Need 3 (Integrating TDIs) becomes all the more prevalent.",
              "Indeed, this heuristic guides us down the path toward selecting one effective TDI based on one team development need.",
              "However, in reality, teams may face many developmental needs simultaneously.",
              "As a result, multiple effective TDIs may be best for addressing these different needs, yet our review found few theoretical and empirical linkages to help explain how to integrate TDIs in any systematic way.",
              "Although each individual TDI has a role in contributing to team effectiveness, it is not clear from the existing literature how these different roles may be coordinated (Salas et al.",
              ", 2015).",
              "As such, we next offer movement toward an organizing framework that conceptualizes how different TDIs can work in conjunction with one another to dynamically meet multiple developmental needs.",
              "This framework, as represented in Figure 2, builds on our review of the TDI literature, the aforementioned \u201ceffective TDI\u201d heuristic, connecting elements from it with three key frameworks from the team effectiveness literatur\u030ce: the structural IMOI model (Ilgen et al.",
              ", 2015;",
              "McGrath, 1964), the temporally driven perspective of team dynamics (Marks et al.",
              ", 2001), and the team development needs model (Kozlowski, et al.",
              ", 1999).",
              "From this foundation, we offer our framework to define the key structural elements contributing to team effectiveness over time, whereby multilevel inputs, mediators, and outcomes may create a need to improve, sustain, or maximize effectiveness.",
              "We then discuss how different TDIs may be more responsive to certain developmental needs and what the resulting implications are for integrating TDIs when multiple developmental needs are present.",
              "A Dynamic, Integrative Framework of Team Development Interventions First, our framework is driven by the IPO conceptualization that team effectiveness is best considered in systems terms;",
              "that is, inputs from different levels (e.",
              "g., organizational, team, and individual) influence team processes, which lead to measurable outcomes.",
              "Advancing this systems view, we shape our structure around the updated IPO, the input-mediator-output-input (IMOI) approach proposedby Ilgen, Hollenbeck, Johnson, and Jundt (2005), which incorporates a feedback loop to recognize that outputs can change the inputs that will feed into another performance cycle for the team.",
              "From this structural perspective, TDIs can be viewed as both (1) contributing to the shaping of inputs, mediators/processes, and outcomes and also (2) serve as inputs, mediators/processes, and outcomes themselves, in turn affecting future development and advancement.",
              "Furthermore, we can also use this structure to begin to map out how different developmental needs may be associated with different inputs, processes, and outputs, and how they may change over time, especially in response to different TDIs that are applied.",
              "Next, although the nature of our figure may seem somewhat linear at first glance, team development over time is undoubtedly dynamic (Cronin, Weingart, & Todorova 2011;",
              "Humphrey et al.",
              ", 2011).",
              "Likewise, teams may pass back and forth among these phases throughout their life cycle, per the temporal patterning noted by Marks et al.",
              "(2001) and indicated by loops throughout our framework that connect the IMO components.",
              "Furthermore, not only do teams go through different temporal rhythms as they work toward team goals, the nature of temporality is such that the team inevitably will develop as a function of working together over time (Kozlowski et al.",
              ", 1999).",
              "Accordingly, different team needs may arise for development, both in terms of needs specific to inputs, processes, and outcomes, but also as a function of the state of team development overall.",
              "That is, newer teams with less experience with one another will face different developmental needs than those who are well established, have been through multiple performance episodes, and are working to move to a higher level of performance (Kozlowski et al.",
              ", 2006).",
              "We highlight this in the Developmental Needs component of our framework, with exemplar developmental needs for teams as they form, as they work to sustain good performance, as they try to improve their current level of less than desirable performance, or as they look to move to a higher level of performance.",
              "Although we do not intend to describe every single team developmental need, as this is outside of the scope of this review, drawing on Kozlowski et al.",
              "\u2019s (1999) framework of team development over time and the broader IMOI literature on teamwork, we can offer exemplars of team development needs that may be critical for consideration.",
              "For inputs, developmental needs as team form are likely to focus on getting to know one another and building relationships, whereas later improvement and sustainment developmental inputs are driven more around how the team may be changing as a response to subsequent performance quality.",
              "Similarly, for processes, team developmental needs are initially around setting the right behavioral, cognitive, and affective patterns needed to accomplish goals and understanding how team members need to work with one another in their roles (Kozlowski, et al.",
              ", 2006).",
              "Later on, process needs are more focused on making adjustments to maintain functional processes and reduce dysfunctional processes (Shuffler, Jimenez, & Kramer, 2015).",
              "Finally, output developmental needs essentially focus on the use of outcomes as a reflection point, with early reflections being more about recognizing individual developmental needs necessary for enhancing future performance, and later developmental needs being driven by what will help the good of the team and the individual combined.",
              "One of the more inherently important and novel aspects of our framework is in linking the mapping of TDIs to inputs, processes, and outcomes.",
              "In our framework, we first present exemplar TDIs, mapped from the categories we identified in our review, to inputs, processes/mediators, and outputs.",
              "These are modeled as such based on the literature mapping these different TDIs as having the strongest impacts on the components within each of these three areas.",
              "However, as some TDIs have demonstrated more overarching effects whereby they can positively influence not just one category but several factors within three IMO components, we deem these \u201cmultifaceted\u201d TDIs.",
              "By framing TDIs from this perspective, it begins to become more clear in terms of how different interventions may be valuable not only in isolation but also in conjunction with other TDIs.",
              "For example, a team facing multiple develop- mental needs regarding communication could initiate a TDI focused on inputs before a performance episode, such as articulating the team\u2019s shared norms regarding team communication via a team charter intervention.",
              "Once they are in a performance episode, a mediator-focused intervention may be pursued such as assessing and monitoring the communication approaches that are being used within the team.",
              "In addition, the team may see value in considering the team\u2019s outcomes by performing a team-debriefing intervention to assess communication strengths and weaknesses.",
              "Finally, the team may want to use interventions that can be used to impact root causes of performance trajectories across the IMO subdimensions.",
              "For instance, a TT intervention could focus on how TL behaviors need to be altered (input variable) or on how the team could enhance team communication by more effectively handling critical conversations (mediator variable).",
              "Together, these interventions will likely achieve much more in terms of impacting performance trajectories than what they might alone.",
              "One other important temporal aspect to note that is different from other IMO frameworks is our focus on performance movement as our overarching outcome of interest.",
              "As our review revealed the focus of TDIs to primarily be on changing team performance trajectories, it is most appropriate to incorporate this as the outcome of interest in our framework.",
              "We use this performance trajectory terminology to more accurately represent the dynamic nature of performance in teams in relation to team development, as a single performance episode is not necessarily the end goal (Marks et al.",
              ", 2001).",
              "Instead, teams may go through multiple performance episodes, where they start from a baseline level of performance that can then be (1) sustained to maintain a steady performance state;",
              "(2) improving an upward trajectory, in terms of achieving higher levels of performance than in the past;",
              "or (3) declining in a downward trajectory, with performance decreasing because of process loss or other failures of the team.",
              "Over time, identifying these upward, downward, or sustaining patterns of performance play a key role in understanding when TDIs may be needed.",
              "Enhancing processes and performance in teams is no simple feat and we do not expect that a shift in how we research and implement TDIs will happen overnight.",
              "However, it is critical for the good of the field and the benefit of organizations to better understand how to use TDIs effectively.",
              "Although research suggests that the aforementioned types of TDIs are effective, we have highlighted major needs in our prior ways of thinking about TDIs.",
              "However, we have also provided guidance as to how these needs can be addressed to evolve our theoretical and empirical capacities to better match the dynamic and complex reality of teamwork today.",
              "As we move forward, the study of TDIs may best be conceptualized as an action science, whereby the research produced can generate knowledge that is actually implementable and meaningful (Argyris, 1996;",
              "Argyris & Schon, 1996).",
              "Given the potentially enormous value for organizations, teams and individuals, such a focus will enable clarity and encourage parsimony in a rather disparate body of work.",
              "Throughout this review, we have outlined numerous recommendations for future research and practice.",
              "Indeed, our themes, heuristic, and integrative framework all summarize critical areas for future research and practice alike.",
              "Thus, we do not intend to rehash all of those points within this section.",
              "Instead, assuming that researchers and practitioners will embrace this dynamic, integrative take on TDIs, we next provide a few final thoughts regarding aspects for consideration and potential methodological approaches that may advance research, as well as some final recommendations for practitioners in encouraging the use of a more integrative, scientific approach to TDIs.",
              "First, as global expansion and technological advances continue, teams are changing in terms of distribution, incorporation of virtual tools, and diversity in composition (Connaughton & Shuffler, 2007;",
              "Kirkman & Mathieu, 2005).",
              "Moreover, technology has complicated the role of the individuals and teams in most complex work systems. Teams are responsible for accomplishing more cognitively complex tasks, which require them to plan, decide, remember, make decisions, solve problems, and generally think as an integrated unit (Cooke, Gorman, & Rowe, 2008).",
              "It is unclear how these contextual issues impact our view of team development and the application of team interventions.",
              "Therefore, it is important that future research attend to these differences in terms of understanding their implications for TDIs.",
              "Although current team practices may work for promoting gains in team process and performance, it is very possible that the incorporation of these factors add a new level of complexity that must be accounted for in design and delivery of interventions.",
              "For example, although most TB interventions occur in face- to-face settings (Tannenbaum et al.",
              ", 1992), when team members are a part of a multinational organization that is spread across the globe, such a face-to-face interaction may not be possible.",
              "Furthermore, the affective and cognitive needs of these types of teams may vary from traditional teams. Therefore, considering the implications of globalization, technology is necessary for future TDI research and determining its impact on team effectiveness.",
              "Another perspective for consideration in future research is leveraging advances in methodologies to meet the call for more integrative research.",
              "One area that future research can choose to develop is examining teams from a profile perspective.",
              "That is, profiles can be considered as subgroups within a population that share a similar pattern across a set of multiple variables (Bauer & Shanahan, 2007).",
              "Prior research has used profiles in studies of individuals, and more recently, studies of teams, as a means for identifying how the integration of multiple constructs contribute to overall effectiveness (Marsh et al.",
              ", 2009;",
              "O\u2019Neill et al.",
              ", 2015).",
              "Thus, profiles can be generated at any level of analysis, ranging from the person-centric to much higher levels (e.",
              "g., team, multiteam system, and organization).",
              "The profile approach may provide a unique advantage to teamwork in particular, over simply considering the effects of different constructs in isolation, by permitting examinations of the interplay among complex teamwork phenomena.",
              "This use of profiles may be particularly beneficial as we move toward more integrative approaches to better address real-world organizational needs and, most importantly, provide better interventions for teamwork.",
              "Specifically, teams that have similar patterns across multiple indicators can be grouped together as a descriptive category representing sub-groups that display a particular set of integrated factors (e.",
              "g., high trust, high cohesion, low conflict vs. low trust, low cohesion, and high conflict).",
              "Furthermore, these profiles can be dynamic in nature, adjusting as the team\u2019s interactions further develop over time (e.",
              "g., moving from a profile of high trust, high cohesion, and low conflict to a profile of low trust, low cohesion, and high conflict during a poor performance episode).",
              "In turn, being able to track how and when a team may start to spiral either into a more effective or less effective (e.",
              "g., upward or downward) team based on their profile shifts may be critical and even necessary for accurately assessing team needs from a developmental perspective.",
              "For example, if we understand the role of trust as part of team profiles, identifying decreases in trust may simultaneously predict when other variables may also decrease in relation to this lowered trust.",
              "That is, profiles may allow for a more concise view of team-work dynamics that will enable organizations to better determine when interventions may need to be applied, perhaps even before the team itself recog- nizes its own needs.",
              "There are additional methodological considerations to be addressed with future research.",
              "For example, using the experience sampling method will incorporate a methodology which asks participants to stop at certain times during their work and make notes of their experience in real time, this will allow us to understand how teams, individuals, and con- text change over time and how challenges can be resolved by TDIs.",
              "Last, one method that should be highlighted in the name of our call to understand the dynamic processes that teams experience is growth modeling.",
              "In the context of TDIs, the focus of growth modeling would be to understand the pattern of change in teams over time (Collins & Parker, 2010).",
              "To be more specific, as detailed in Figure 3, numerous research questions can be considered when viewing TDIs over the duration of the team\u2019s life cycle.",
              "Specifically, does Team 1 in Figure 3 require fewer TDIs as a result of implementing a TDI early on in their life cycle?",
              "Similarly, is the timing of actually implementing a TDI pertinent?",
              "Consideration of such a research question would allow researchers to more fully examine whether a team can do irreparable harm by waiting too long to implement a TDI and whether TDIs can be implemented too soon or too often within a team.",
              "This later research question can be visually appreciated with Team 2 in Figure 3 which is being exposed to multiple TDIs.",
              "Within such a team, it would be necessary to examine if the length of time or span between TDIs has an impact;",
              "it also begs the question of the sustainability of effects for TDIs.",
              "Temporal Considerations for Team Development Interventions Growth modeling and similar time-focused analysis, such as latent transition analysis for detecting profile changes over time (Muthen & Muthen, 2000), can serve to better address two major aspects of temporality as discussed in our review.",
              "First, using growth modeling, we can develop a better understanding of how teams change over time in general, which may provide a clearer picture as to the different needs that should be addressed in teams, leading to a more straightforward selection of TDIs.",
              "Second, such growth modeling and transition analyses can also map the trajectories of how teams respond after the implementation of one or more TDIs, supporting from a research perspective the potential to more cleanly explore how TDIs can be implemented at multiple points over a team\u2019s life cycle rather than just at one particular point.",
              "Overall, the leveraging of such more advanced methodological approaches can serve to meet our call for an evolution in the TDI literature.",
              "From a practical perspective, a dynamic, integrative evolution of TDIs as represented herein should help to determine when different approaches may be most beneficial across the life cycle of a team.",
              "Furthermore, the themes identified within each of the different TDI categories serve to guide practitioners as to an initial starting point for exploring the areas where some integration of TDIs has already occurred (e.",
              "g., TB and TCa), as well as to begin to better understand when and how different interventions may be most useful (e.",
              "g., TB for affective needs, TWD for motivational needs, and TT for process needs).",
              "Given that not all teams are able to fully incorporate every possible type of intervention in their development, these themes and framework should aid in providing clarity in terms of which specific interventions may be most relevant at given points in a team\u2019s life cycle.",
              "The \u201ceffective TDI\u201d heuristic and organizing framework may assist practitioners in focusing on the importance of identifying specific needs of different teams and to work toward finding the right balance of addressing needs with time and resources available.",
              "Certainly, teams may be very different based on factors, such as their composition, size, task type, and structure, and therefore may have different needs from a developmental standpoint, as these different factors can influence process and performance (Bell, 2007).",
              "Because of this, there is not necessarily a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to successful team development;",
              "indeed, we do not believe that this framework provides a single answer to successful team performance.",
              "We also do notbelieve that it is practical for every single team to be diagnosed at a fine-grained level, as most organizations do not have the resources or time for this.",
              "Instead, using scientifically based guides, frameworks and summaries of TDI evidence that is offered here, practitioners should be empowered to move toward a more systematic, scientifically based approach that readily promotes the selection and implementation of TDIs that will best meet specific needs of their teams. In conducting this review, it became apparent that a lack of clear direction regarding how to best use TDIs makes it easy for organizations to slip into a \u201cmore is better\u201d approach.",
              "That is, organizations may apply as many TDIs as individuals and teams can take, in hopes that something will end up being helpful to the team.",
              "At a basic level, this \u201cshotgun approach\u2019 to team development can address some development of transferrable teamwork skills;",
              "yet more often than not, individuals and teams may be getting only a small piece of what is useful for their particular needs while wasting time and resources on irrelevant content.",
              "In response, we hope that integrating disparate TDI literature streams will start a conversation around how these different TDIs can be integrated in a more scientific and systematic way\u2014a topic that is sorely lacking.",
              "In particular, we have highlighted here that while individual types of TDIs each have their own scientific evidence regarding their actual or potential benefits for addressing different types of team developmental needs, too many or too few TDIs can be negated\u2014especially if they are offered at the wrong time and/or for the wrong reasons (Shuffler et al.",
              ", 2011).",
              "As presented, this more systematic approach to TDIs highlights the value in critically considering when each type of TDI is likely to have a pronounced impact in shaping team performance trajectories.",
              "As a result, the results of our review open an array of research opportunities with this approach.",
              "Furthermore, our \u201ceffective TDI\u201d heuristic should serve as a starting point for practitioners to venture down a more systematic path for TDIs, offering a straightforward guide that may help in selecting, designing, implementing, and evaluating TDIs.",

              "This Evidence-Based Summary has been made available in an audio-based format.",
              "Click play to give it a try!",
              "Team financial incentives are commonly used to improve performance by motivating groups of employees.",
              "Team-based reward strategies might be the first response to the fact that in contemporary organizations, work most often needs to go through different hands to complete.",
              "So if you want people to do what it takes for teams to succeed (cooperate, share information, help others), you need to pay for what you ask.",
              "Team-based rewards might be the way forward.",
              "But are they effective?",
              "Through a meta-analysis of 30 studies involving more than 7,000 teams, Garbers and Konradt (2014) found that team-based rewards yield moderate positive effects on team performance.",
              "This good news means that, from an evidence-based perspective, you may consider team-based reward structures within your reward strategy as one means of increasing team performance.",
              "However, there are even more important questions you can ask here: when do team financial incentives yield the strongest motivating effect?",
              "What contextual factors do you need to consider when designing your rewards strategy?",
              "When distributed equitably, bonuses are weighted on the actual contribution of the individual team member.",
              "Distributing rewards equally means giving money to all members when the team has reached its goal: everyone gets the same sized piece of the cake.",
              "The evidence suggests that equitably distributed rewards are more effective than equally distributed rewards in affecting team performance.",
              "So, for example, the practice of distributing the same bonus to all team members at the end of the financial year, while it might be easier to do, may yield weaker effects on future performance.",
              "Team financial incentives appear more effective for performance improvement when they are applied for a team that is involved in complex task rather than simple tasks.",
              "Higher task complexity implies that an employee needs more skills and/or resources to perform a task: more complex tasks do not necessarily take longer to complete, they require more skilled people to get them done.",
              "So why might financial incentives be more helpful for complex tasks?",
              "We can hypothesize that financial incentives may prompt teams to use more resources available and invest more energy, which is what generally happens to succeed at more complex tasks.",
              "The effect of team-based rewards depends also on team size: the smaller the team, the stronger the effect of the financial incentives.",
              "Maybe smaller teams have stronger bonds, more social interaction among members, and less physical distance between members than larger teams. Also, people may perceive the reward as more fair because individual contribution is easier to gauge in a small team than in larger teams. In organizations, success depends highly on collaboration and cooperation within and between teams of individuals.",
              "If this is the case in your organization, then adapting rewards to incentivize those behaviors is the first step to take.",
              "Here are some takeaways from the research: We critically evaluated the trustworthiness of the study we used to inform this Evidence Summary.",
              "We found that the study design \u2013 a meta-analysis of (quasi) experimental studies \u2013 is highly appropriate to demonstrate a causal relationship.",
              "Therefore we can conclude that it is shown that team-based rewards have a causal effect on team performance.",

              "Some may want to merely follow directions provided by authorities during an uncertain period.",
              "In addition, public participation occasionally delays organizations' decision\u2010making process (Godschalk et al.",
              ", 2003), thereby preventing organizations from providing information quickly and timely.",
              "Therefore, whether or not publics perceived opportunities to express their opinions or for the state government to listen to them did not necessarily increase trust during a pandemic.",
              "Furthermore, accountability was not a key element for enhancing publics' trust during a pandemic.",
              "Generally, though the notion of accountability based on reporting balanced information, that is, positive and negative information, and admitting mistakes helps organizations establish quality relationships with publics, our findings suggested that this situation was not always the case during a pandemic.",
              "One possible explanation was that publics may not consider these organizations responsible for the pandemic, unlike other types of organizational crises.",
              "When publics perceive a pandemic as uncontrollable and view government organizations and health institutes as victims (Coombs, 2007), they will not necessarily expect these organizations to acknowledge their mistakes, which is not related to how much they trust these organizations to address the crisis.",
              "In summary, the findings of the current study suggested an effective communication model in the public health crisis context, that is, the COVID\u201019 outbreak, based on the public relations literature by analysing the distinct roles of information substantiality, participation and accountability in building organizational trust with publics.",
              "Second, this study demonstrated the theoretical applicability and practical utility of health behaviour theory via the social cognitive approach in the public health crisis context.",
              "As expected in the theory, original TPB components (i.",
              "e. attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control) and an additional component (i.",
              "e. perceived risks) contributed to people's decisions on social distancing.",
              "One interesting finding was that, among the four predictors, subjective norms were the strongest determinants of social distancing behaviours.",
              "Moreover, as shown in Table 4, subjective norms, among other factors, played a significant mediating role in the relationship between trust and social distancing behaviour.",
              "In the public health crisis management literature, individual factors, such as risk perceptions or self\u2010efficacy, were hypothesized to exert more impact on the adoption of preventive measures than social factors in a national cultural environment that emphasizes individualism (Cho & Lee, 2015).",
              "However, our findings highlighted the significant predictive power of social factors in terms of social distancing behaviour.",
              "As we noted above, such a pattern may be explained by the novel and uncertain situations created by COVID\u201019 in the United States.",
              "The ambiguity and uncertainty of the crisis situation may encourage publics to use other people as references to decide whether or not to follow the same behaviour (e.",
              "g. Kim et al.",
              ", 2015).",
              "Moreover, in addition to the direct impact of subjective norms on behaviours, our findings showed that individuals' cognitive behaviours (i.",
              "e. perceived risks, attitudes and perceived behavioural control) also depended on how their important referents, such as family and friends, viewed the adoption of social distancing (see Table 4 for the results of direct and indirect effects).",
              "The findings once again highlighted the importance of social environments and social pressures in decision\u2010making in uncertain and ambiguous situations.",
              "Results of direct and indirect effects of organizational trust on social cognitive factors in SEM model Another contribution of this study was to expand key theoretical frameworks in health communication by integrating public relations research to understand public behaviours during a pandemic.",
              "The findings suggested that organizational trust significantly increased publics' perceived risks, norms and perceived behavioural control during an outbreak.",
              "However, trust in both organizations did not significantly affect publics' attitudes towards social distancing.",
              "Although we expected trust in government organizations to enable publics to understand the benefits of social distancing practices, this insignificant result may be explained by the American individualistic culture.",
              "Although publics trust organizations to address the public health crisis, they may not agree with social distancing practices, as such preventive measures may violate their beliefs about personal freedom and independence (Davis et al.",
              ", 2015).",
              "Therefore, such individual\u2010first thinking may discredit preventive measures that prioritize community benefits but constrain individual freedom (Davis et al.",
              ", 2015).",
              "As shown in Table 4, however, it was found that normative beliefs acted as a significant mediator that increased the effect of organizational trust on publics' agreement towards social distancing practices.",
              "Such social reinforcement may help publics move beyond the individualistic frame of thinking and believe in the benefits of social distancing, thereby aligning with their trust in organizations.",
              "However, this assumption warrants further investigation by exploring the role of Americans' individualistic values in shaping social distancing behaviour.",
              "This finding suggested that, to understand publics' conflicting viewpoints and complicated motivations to engage in social distancing, examining the effectiveness of government\u2010 or health institution\u2010initiated efforts in reinforcing publics' favourable attitudes towards social distancing may be a worthy direction for future communications research.",
              "In summary, by testing an integrative model of publics' health behaviours during a pandemic and incorporating organizational\u2010, social\u2010 and individual\u2010level antecedents, this study provided a satisfactory foundation for future interdisciplinary research on public relations and health communication, particularly in the context of a public health crisis.",
              "The current study also provided important practical implications for managing a pandemic through strategic communication.",
              "Organizations' transparency is expected more than ever through direct inputs on issues that affect publics.",
              "Based on the tested model, organizations responsible for public health crises (i.",
              "e. the state government and health institutes) should provide relevant, accurate and timely information to help publics (re)build trust, which can enhance individuals' perceived risks and community norms and ultimately lead to desired behaviours, such as social distancing in this case.",
              "Health institutions, such as the CDC, should also provide opportunities for publics to participate in obtaining and creating information related to the crisis.",
              "This situation would create the impression that organizations prioritize publics' interests, which will encourage them to build trust and develop positive perceptions of the guidelines or actions of an institution.",
              "Meanwhile, state governments need to consult with public health and crisis communication experts and collaborate closely with health institutions to identify situations accurately, which will help them communicate the benefits of social distancing to publics clearly and effectively.",
              "Moreover, promotion programmes may consider perceived risks, attitudes, norms and perceived behavioural control related to social distancing.",
              "Given that social norms were the strongest predictors in this study, generating positive social pressure for individuals to follow social distancing instructions will likely be considerably effective in enhancing their recommended cognitive behaviour, thereby increasing the likelihood of practising social distancing.",
              "Thus, proposing programmes and messages that can help establish general prosocial distancing norms is essential.",
              "This study has several limitations that should be addressed.",
              "First, this study was based on cross\u2010sectional survey data collected in early April during the early stage of the stay\u2010at\u2010home order and lockdown.",
              "After the implementation of state\u2010led orders, public opinions on social distancing changed and became polarized with the occurrence of anti\u2010social distancing rallies across the nation (Corse & Calvert, 2020).",
              "In addition, the data were collected during the early stage of COVID\u201019, which limited our choice of organizations (e.",
              "g. health institutes, local government) in this study.",
              "For example, although the CDC generally holds a communication leadership role in public health emergencies, its credibility may have been diminished as a result of its acquiescence to the administration's demands (Sun & Achenbach, 2020).",
              "A longitudinal design is thus needed for future studies to understand the dynamics of public responses to government communication and social distancing.",
              "Second, publics tend to use presidential communications as a crucial information source (Brenan, 2020).",
              "The significant impact of the word of the president, the White House, and the federal government was not examined in this study.",
              "Thus, future studies should investigate how transparent communication from the president and the federal government affects public perceptions and behaviours during a public health crisis.",
              "Third, though participation did not increase government trust, the notion of mutuality was a significant predictor of government trust in the South Korean context in a previous study (Kang et al.",
              ", 2018).",
              "This finding suggested possible cultural differences in terms of strategic communication effects.",
              "Given the nature of the COVID\u201019 global pandemic, future research should explore and compare the effectiveness of communication in a global setting to enrich the understanding of strategic public health crisis communication.",
              "Finally, to delimit the scope of the study, our model included transparent communication and organizational trust as the key antecedents of individuals' social cognitive factors.",
              "Other variables in relation to individuals' risk perception (e.",
