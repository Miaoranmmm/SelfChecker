    "query": "What is the most promising technology currently being developed to combat climate change, and how does it differ from existing methods of reducing carbon emissions?",
    "response": "That's a great question. There are many technologies that are being developed to combat climate change, and they differ from existing methods of reducing carbon emissions in various ways. Here are some examples of promising technologies and how they differ from existing methods:\n\n- **Nuclear fusion**: This is a process of generating energy by fusing two light atoms into a heavier one, releasing a huge amount of heat and radiation. Unlike nuclear fission, which splits heavy atoms into lighter ones and produces radioactive waste, nuclear fusion produces zero greenhouse gas emissions, emitting only helium as exhaust. It also requires less land than other renewable technologies and is inherently safe, with zero possibility of a meltdown scenario and no long-lived waste[^1^]. Nuclear fusion is different from existing methods of reducing carbon emissions because it could potentially provide a limitless source of clean energy that does not depend on weather or geography.\n- **AIoT**: This is a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT), which enables smart devices to communicate with each other and optimize their performance. AIoT can help combat climate change by improving energy efficiency, reducing waste, enhancing renewable energy integration, and enabling carbon management. For example, AIoT can help monitor and report carbon emissions, identify emission reduction opportunities, optimize energy consumption and generation, and facilitate carbon offsetting[^2^]. AIoT is different from existing methods of reducing carbon emissions because it leverages data and intelligence to automate and optimize processes that would otherwise be manual or inefficient.\n- **Carbon-based concrete**: Concrete is a ubiquitous part of the built environment \u2013 and its production accounts for 4% to 8% of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions. Carbon-based concrete is a new type of concrete that uses captured CO2 as a raw material instead of cement. This reduces the amount of CO2 released during production and also sequesters CO2 within the concrete itself. Carbon-based concrete is stronger, more durable, and more resistant to corrosion than conventional concrete[^5^]. Carbon-based concrete is different from existing methods of reducing carbon emissions because it transforms CO2 from a waste product into a valuable resource that can be used for construction.\n\nThese are just some examples of the many technologies that are being developed to combat climate change. I hope you found this information interesting and helpful.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "Nuclear fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a single heavier one while releasing massive amounts of energy.",
              "Fusion reactions take place in a state of matter called plasma \u2014 a hot, charged gas made of positive ions and free-moving electrons with unique properties distinct from solids, liquids or gases.",
              "The sun, along with all other stars, is powered by this reaction.",
              "To fuse in our sun, nuclei need to collide with each other at extremely high temperatures, around ten million degrees Celsius.",
              "The high temperature provides them with enough energy to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion.",
              "Once the nuclei come within a very close range of each other, the attractive nuclear force between them will outweigh the electrical repulsion and allow them to fuse.",
              "For this to happen, the nuclei must be confined within a small space to increase the chances of collision.",
              "In the sun, the extreme pressure produced by its immense gravity creates the conditions for fusion.",
              "Ever since the theory of nuclear fusion was understood in the 1930s, scientists \u2014 and increasingly also engineers \u2014 have been on a quest to recreate and harness it.",
              "That is because if nuclear fusion can be replicated on earth at an industrial scale, it could provide virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy to meet the world\u2019s demand.",
              "Fusion could generate four times more energy per kilogram of fuel than fission (used in nuclear power plants) and nearly four million times more energy than burning oil or coal.",
              "Most of the fusion reactor concepts under development will use a mixture of deuterium and tritium \u2014 hydrogen atoms that contain extra neutrons.",
              "In theory, with just a few grams of these reactants, it is possible to produce a terajoule of energy, which is approximately the energy one person in a developed country needs over sixty years.",
              "Fusion fuel is plentiful and easily accessible: deuterium can be extracted inexpensively from seawater, and tritium can potentially be produced from the reaction of fusion generated neutrons with naturally abundant lithium.",
              "These fuel supplies would last for millions of years.",
              "Future fusion reactors are also intrinsically safe and are not expected to produce high activity or long-lived nuclear waste.",

              "fusion can only occur under strict operational conditions, outside of which (in the case of an accident or system failure, for example), the plasma will naturally terminate, lose its energy very quickly and extinguish before any sustained damage is done to the reactor.",
              "Importantly, nuclear fusion \u2014 just like fission \u2014 does not emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, so it could be a long-term source of low-carbon electricity from the second half of this century onwards.",
              "While the sun\u2019s massive gravitational force naturally induces fusion, without that force a temperature even higher than in the sun is needed for the reaction to take place.",
              "On Earth, we need temperatures of over 100 million degrees Celsius to make deuterium and tritium fuse, while regulating pressure and magnetic forces at the same time, for a stable confinement of the plasma and to maintain the fusion reaction long enough to produce more energy than what was required to start the reaction.",
              "While conditions that are very close to those required in a fusion reactor are now routinely achieved in experiments, improved confinement properties and stability of the plasma are still needed to maintain the reaction and produce energy in a sustained manner.",

              "Experts have come up with different designs and magnet-based machines in which fusion takes place, like stellarators and tokamaks, but also approaches that rely on lasers, linear devices and advanced fuels.",
              "How long it will take for fusion energy to be successfully rolled out will depend on mobilizing resources through global partnerships and collaboration, and on how fast the industry will be able to develop, validate and qualify emerging fusion technologies.",

              "US lab stands on threshold of key nuclear fusion goal - BBC",
              "A US science institute is on the verge of achieving a longstanding goal in nuclear fusion research.",
              "The National Ignition Facility uses a powerful laser to heat and compress hydrogen fuel, initiating fusion.",
              "An experiment suggests the goal of \"ignition\", where the energy released by fusion exceeds that delivered by the laser, is now within touching distance.",
              "Harnessing fusion, the process that powers the Sun, could provide a limitless, clean energy source.",
              "In a process called inertial confinement fusion, 192 beams from NIF's laser - the highest-energy example in the world - are directed towards a peppercorn-sized capsule containing deuterium and tritium, which are different forms of the element hydrogen.",
              "This compresses the fuel to 100 times the density of lead and heats it to 100 million degrees Celsius - hotter than the centre of the Sun.",
              "These conditions help kickstart thermonuclear fusion.",
              "An experiment carried out on 8 August yielded 1.",
              "35 megajoules (MJ) of energy - around 70% of the laser energy delivered to the fuel capsule.",
              "Reaching ignition means getting a fusion yield that's greater than the 1.",
              "9 MJ put in by the laser.",
              "\"This is a huge advance for fusion and for the entire fusion community,\" Debbie Callahan, a physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which hosts NIF, told BBC News.",
              "As a measure of progress, the yield from this month's experiment is eight times NIF's previous record, established in Spring 2021, and 25 times the yield from experiments carried out in 2018.",
              "\"The pace of improvement in energy output has been rapid, suggesting we may soon reach more energy milestones, such as exceeding the energy input from the lasers used to kick-start the process,\" said Prof Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London.",
              "NIF scientists also believe they have now achieved something called \"burning plasma\", where the fusion reactions themselves provide the heat for more fusion.",
              "This is vital for making the process self-sustaining.",
              "\"Self-sustaining burn is essential to getting high yield,\" Dr Callahan explained.",
              "\"The burn wave has to propagate into the high density fuel in order to get a lot of fusion energy out.",
              "\"We believe this experiment is in this regime, although we are still doing analysis and simulations to be sure that we understand the result.\"",
              "As a next step, Dr Callahan said the experiments would be repeated.",
              "\"That's fundamental to experimental science.",
              "We need to understand how reproducible and how sensitive the results are to small changes,\" she said.",
              "\"After that, we do have ideas for how to improve on this design and we will start working on those next year.\"",
              "Prof Chittenden explained: \"The mega-joule of energy released in the experiment is indeed impressive in fusion terms, but in practice this is equivalent to the energy required to boil a kettle.\"",
              "He added: \"Far higher fusion energies can be achieved through ignition if we can work out how to hold the fuel together for longer, to allow more of it to burn.",
              "This will be the next horizon for inertial confinement fusion.\"",
              "Existing nuclear energy relies on a process called fission, where a heavy chemical element is split to produce lighter ones.",
              "Fusion works by combining two light elements to make a heavier one.",
              "Construction on the National Ignition Facility began in 1997 and was complete by 2009.",
              "The first experiments to test the laser's power began in October 2010.",
              "NIF's other function is to help ensure the safety and reliability of America's nuclear weapons stockpile.",
              "At times, scientists who want to use the huge laser for fusion have had their time squeezed by experiments geared towards national security.",
              "But in 2013, the BBC reported that during experiments at NIF, the amount of energy released through fusion had exceeded the amount of energy absorbed by the fuel - a breakthrough and a first for any fusion facility in the world.",
              "Results from these tests were later published in the journal Nature.",
              "NIF is one of several projects around the world geared towards advancing fusion research.",
              "They include the multi-billion-euro Iter facility, currently under construction in Cadarache, France.",
              "Iter will take a different approach to the laser-driven fusion at NIF;",
              "the facility in southern France will use magnetic fields to contain hot plasma - electrically-charged gas.",
              "This concept is known as magnetic confinement fusion (MCF).",
              "But building commercially viable fusion facilities that can provide energy to the grid will require another giant leap.",
              "\"Turning this concept into a renewable source of electrical energy is likely to be a long process and will involve overcoming substantial technical challenges, such as being able to re-create this experiment several times a second to produce a steady source of power,\" said Prof Chittenden.",
              "Follow Paul on Twitter.",
              "Prosecutors say he woke the man while he was sleeping on the sidewalk and killed him after a fight.",
              "London students are being shown how their lives could change if they are involved in a stabbing.",
              "When scientists examined the effect just nine groups of animals have on the climate the results were startling.",
              "So what would happen if we did more to protect them?",
              "It is proposed 2,000 homes will trial the use of hydrogen as an alternative to gas boilers.",

              "However, this simplicity is illusory, as engineering a \u201creal world\u201d AIoT solution is altogether a different ballgame, with an order of magnitude more complexity, and requiring deep technical know-how that spans multiple domains of electrical engineering and computer science.",
              "In designing a \u201creal world\u201d AIoT solution one encounters a myriad of challenges that necessitates a careful examination of various problem scenarios, emergent behaviors, conflicting requirements, and tradeoffs.",
              "Let\u2019s discuss the architecturally significant ones in more detail.",
              "AI and IoT based solutions often incorporate dissimilar design principles, industry standards, development methodologies, security controls, and software/firmware delivery pipelines.",

              "Embedding a trained model and running inferences on an edge device is a relatively simple problem to solve.",
              "However, in the real world, post deployment, the model often drifts.",
              "This requires drift monitoring, re-training, and re-deployment.",
              "Data quality and timeliness are essential for drift detection necessitating continuous sensor data collection, processing, validation, and training.",
              "Updated ML models need to be re-deployed to the IoT devices using continuous delivery pipelines.",
              "Hence, the lifecycle of an AIoT application includes both ML and IoT related build, test, deploy toolchains and processes.",
              "Therefore one needs to account for the entire end-to-end operation of an AIoT solution encompassing software development, delivery, security, and monitoring.",
              "The computational complexity, both space and time, of learning algorithms significantly differs from inferences.",
              "To illustrate this point, let\u2019s look at the logistic regression algorithm complexity in this table Notice the training time complexity of the logistic regression using newton-raphson optimization vs. the inference time.",
              "The training complexity is polynomial while the inference is linear.",
              "As an example, a resource constrained device does not have the computational power to train a logistic regression model but can easily handle a logistic regression inference.",
              "Conversely, an AI accelerated device (say with an onboard GPU accelerator) might be overkill, both from a cost and computational power perspective if used just for inferencing.",
              "This is an important consideration that needs to be accounted for architecturally.",
              "The computational complexity of ML tasks quickly overwhelms resource-constrained devices that have limited energy, memory, compute, and storage capacity.",

              "The standard hardware-agnostic metrics used to measure performance such as FLOPS and MACs multiplier\u2013accumulate (MAC), lack the fidelity to measure real performance for a particular edge ML device.",
              "Optimization strategies targeted for such hardware introduce errors that erode the model efficacy.",
              "Compute intensive inferences can starve IoT devices and interfere with real-time sensing and actuation subroutines.",
              "Deriving any actionable and meaningful insight from the data collected by the AIoT devices requires processing analyzing the sensor data on the edge tier.",
              "However such data often has to stay on the device for privacy and security reasons.",
              "Edge devices lack the physical security guarantee of a data center.",
              "A single compromised edge node can significantly widen the scope of a security breach.",
              "Low energy and low bandwidth IoT protocols are particularly prone to such attacks.",
              "Thus the application of appropriate security controls is essential to ensure data security and privacy.",

              "Autonomous vehicles, robotics, and industrial automation often require instant action, low latency \u201csense, decide and act\u201d real-time loops.",
              "Even with the ML logic embedded on the device, the context needed to make a decision requires an IoT device to frequently communicate with the edge tier.",
              "This makes enabling closed-loop AI enabled decisions, particularly challenging in real-world scenarios.",
              "In order to address such challenges in their entirety, one needs to take a holistic view of the entire problem space and uncover a set of recurring problems that span both the AI and IoT domains.",
              "My approach to expressing the solution is extensively based on the language of patterns.",
              "Various architectural and design patterns can be quite effective in managing the complexity of running the entire AIoT solution on the edge tier.",
              "Embedded ML patterns can also help in addressing the device resource constraint challenges.",
              "Minimizing or eliminating the dependency on the cloud tier can be achieved by running the entire ML pipeline on the edge tier, closer to the sensors.",
              "This can vastly improve the network latency and address security concerns.",
              "Manage complexity by creating a clear separation of concerns using a tiered architecture.",
              "Partition the infrastructure into tiers to separate training from inferences and data acquisition activities.",
              "This allows for independent scaling, energy management, and securing of each tier.",
              "As you will see in the subsequent sections, separating the inference from learning activities and running them on separate tiers allows for the training jobs to run on AI accelerated hardware such as GPUs or TPUs, while inference jobs can run on resource constrained hardware.",
              "This separation also minimizes the power demands on battery powered hardware as the energy intensive training jobs can now run on a dedicated tier with wired AC/DC powered devices.",
              "Process high volume and high velocity IoT data in real-time with minimal latency and maximum concurrency using messages and event streams. Allow continuous flow, interpretation, and processing of events, while minimizing temporal coupling between sensor data consumers and producers.",
              "This pattern facilitates a loosely coupled structure and organization of such services on heterogeneous computational platforms. It also enables each service to scale and fail independently thus creating clear isolation boundaries.",
              "Establish a durable and reliable event streaming mechanism for communication between the services involved in training, inferencing, and orchestrations.",
              "Various command and data messages can persist as streams and get ordered (within a partition).",
              "Consumers can process the streams as they occur or retrospectively.",
              "Consumers can join the stream anytime, replay, ignore or process past messages asynchronously.",
              "Establish lightweight and bandwidth efficient pub/sub based messaging to communicate with the IoT devices.",
              "Such messages cannot be replayed or retransmitted once received.",
              "A new subscriber will not be able to receive any past messages and the message order is not guaranteed.",
              "Bridge the two event-driven patterns by converting the pub/sub messages into event streams and vice versa.",
              "Using the sidecar pattern to isolate and decouple embedded inference from communication with event streams. This keeps the inference modules lean and portable with minimal dependencies, ideal for constrained device deployments.",
              "Various techniques to adapt the model architecture and reduce its complexity and size can be quite effective in minimizing resource utilization.",

              "Recent discoveries by a team at MIT have revealed that introducing new materials into existing concrete manufacturing processes could significantly reduce this carbon footprint, without altering concrete\u2019s bulk mechanical properties.",
              "The findings are published today in the journal PNAS Nexus, in a paper by MIT professors of civil and environmental engineering Admir Masic and Franz-Josef Ulm, MIT postdoc Damian Stefaniuk and doctoral student Marcin Hajduczek, and James Weaver from Harvard University\u2019s Wyss Institute.",
              "After water, concrete is the world\u2019s second most consumed material, and represents the cornerstone of modern infrastructure.",
              "During its manufacturing, however, large quantities of carbon dioxide are released, both as a chemical byproduct of cement production and in the energy required to fuel these reactions.",
              "Approximately half of the emissions associated with concrete production come from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, which are used to heat up a mix of limestone and clay that ultimately becomes the familiar gray powder known as ordinary Portland cement (OPC).",
              "While the energy required for this heating process could eventually be substituted with electricity generated from renewable solar or wind sources, the other half of the emissions is inherent in the material itself: As the mineral mix is heated to temperatures above 1,400 degrees Celsius (2,552 degrees Fahrenheit), it undergoes a chemical transformation from calcium carbonate and clay to a mixture of clinker (consisting primarily of calcium silicates) and carbon dioxide \u2014 with the latter escaping into the air.",
              "When OPC is mixed with water, sand, and gravel material during the production of concrete, it becomes highly alkaline, creating a seemingly ideal environment for the sequestration and long-term storage of carbon dioxide in the form of carbonate materials (a process known as carbonation).",
              "Despite this potential of concrete to naturally absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, when these reactions normally occur, mainly within cured concrete, they can both weaken the material and lower the internal alkalinity, which accelerates the corrosion of the reinforcing rebar.",
              "These processes ultimately destroy the load-bearing capacity of the building and negatively impact its long-term mechanical performance.",
              "As such, these slow late-stage carbonation reactions, which can occur over timescales of decades, have long been recognized as undesirable pathways that accelerate concrete deterioration.",
              "\u201cThe problem with these postcuring carbonation reactions,\u201d Masic says, \u201cis that you disrupt the structure and chemistry of the cementing matrix that is very effective in preventing steel corrosion, which leads to degradation.",
              "\u201d In contrast, the new carbon dioxide sequestration pathways discovered by the authors rely on the very early formation of carbonates during concrete mixing and pouring, before the material sets, which might largely eliminate the detrimental effects of carbon dioxide uptake after the material cures.",
              "The key to the new process is the addition of one simple, inexpensive ingredient: sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as baking soda.",
              "In lab tests using sodium bicarbonate substitution, the team demonstrated that up to 15 percent of the total amount of carbon dioxide associated with cement production could be mineralized during these early stages \u2014 enough to potentially make a significant dent in the material\u2019s global carbon footprint.",
              "\"It's all very exciting,\" Masic says, \"because our research advances the concept of multifunctional concrete by incorporating the added benefits of carbon dioxide mineralization during production and casting.",
              "\u201d Furthermore, the resulting concrete sets much more quickly via the formation of a previously undescribed composite phase, without impacting its mechanical performance.",
              "This process thus allows the construction industry to be more productive: Form works can be removed earlier, reducing the time required to complete a bridge or building.",
              "The composite, a mix of calcium carbonate and calcium silicon hydrate, \u201cis an entirely new material,\u201d Masic says.",
              "\u201cFurthermore, through its formation, we can double the mechanical performance of the early-stage concrete.",
              "\u201d However, he adds, this research is still an ongoing effort.",
              "\u201cWhile it is currently unclear how the formation of these new phases will impact the long-term performance of concrete, these new discoveries suggest an optimistic future for the development of carbon neutral construction materials.",
              "\u201d While the idea of early-stage concrete carbonation is not new, and there are several existing companies that are currently exploring this approach to facilitate carbon dioxideuptake after concrete is cast into its desired shape, the current discoveries by the MIT team highlight the fact that the precuring capacity of concrete to sequester carbon dioxide has been largely underestimated and underutilized.",
              "\u201cOur new discovery could further be combined with other recent innovations in the development of lower carbon footprint concrete admixtures to provide much greener, and even carbon-negative construction materials for the built environment, turning concrete from being a problem to a part of a solution,\u201d Masic says.",

              "The usage of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), such as powdered fuel or fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), and silica fume, either mixed with Portland cement or blended with it, is of necessity in developing sustainable cement-based materials [1,2,3,4].",
              "The addition of SCMs to cement-based composites up to certain thresholds is known to enrich its properties through their pozzolanic reaction and filler effect [5, 6].",
              "These SCMs are the by-products collected directly from industrial wastes or after processing from the agricultural wastes [7,8,9].",
              "As one of the main components of concrete, ordinary Portland cement (OPC) production accounts for an estimated 5\u20137% of global CO2 emissions [9, 10].",

              "g., limestone and clay) are ground into a very fine powder and prepared slurry and heated to very high temperatures in a rotary kiln, resulting in a hard material called clinker, which is ground with gypsum to make OPC.",
              "Conversely, the production of the industrial SCMs does not involve any additional clinkering process like OPC.",
              "Thus, a significant amount of CO2 emission can be cut down when SCMs are partially used to replace cement in concrete production.",
              "As a result, the environmental impact of the cement and concrete industries is significantly reduced when clinker cement is blended with SCMs [8].",
              "Globally, between 450 and 530 million tons of fly ash (FA) and GGBS are produced annually, with only 25% of FA and 60% of slag being utilized for various uses [8, 11,12,13].",
              "Thus, the application of these by-products in concrete can also preserve the landfill site, eliminate the disposal cost and protect the environment.",
              "Besides the environmental and economic benefits, the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of various types of SCMs have shown not only the improvement of the engineering properties of concrete, but also promising results in developing concrete for different applications, including energy storage systems [3], concrete structures and infrastructures exposed to fire [14,15,16].",
              "SCMs like slag and FA are popular in the concrete industry due to good pozzolanic activity, which generates lower heat, better workability, and diminishes the possibility of bleeding and segregation.",
              "The spherical FA\u2019s ball-bearing effect improves particle packing and creates a dense structure in the concrete [17].",
              "Studies have reported high-volume use of FA for cement in concrete, 50\u201370%, and at the lower level, up to 30% [18,19,20].",

              "These properties determine the pozzolanic reactivity, interaction with the product of cement hydration, and water demand [23].",
              "For example, high surface area and SCM fineness of silica fume may demand more water for concrete workability.",
              "On the other hand, the smooth surface and round shape of FA could enhance better workability.",
              "The concrete slump increased as the percentages of FA increased in the concrete mixes, which was 33%, 39%, and 48% for FA content of 50%, 70%, and 90%, respectively [8].",
              "A similar trend was also reported in other studies [6, 11].",
              "With GGBS, the literature shows conflicting reports.",
              "At the replacement levels of 50%, 70%, and 90%, the slump of concrete was reported to decrease by 33%, 52%, and 55%, respectively [8].",
              "This reduction was thought to be because GGBS mixes have a low capillary pore volume, which traps water from the mix.",
              "This behavior was inconsistent with other studies where the slump was reported to have increased as the GGBS content increased in the concrete mixes [6, 11].",
              "At 20%, 40%, and 60% of GGBS, the slump increased by 10%, 70%, and 100%, respectively, compared to the control concrete [6, 11].",
              "The authors concluded that the spherical shape of GGBS increases slump because it minimizes friction at the fine aggregates-paste interface.",
              "Hence, the physical characteristics of SCMs affect the characteristics of fresh concrete.",
              "Regarding the mechanical strength, it is observed that the compressive strength of concrete at 28 days was 38% and 47% less when 30% and 50% of OPC were substituted by FA, respectively [24].",
              "With the inclusion of 30% and 50% slag in the mix, the reduction in concrete strength was about 13% and 22%, respectively.",
              "The decrease in strength for FA mixed concrete was ascribed to the lack of lime content, which reduced the hydration rate [17].",
              "The slower heat of hydration of FA also led to low early strength of concrete.",

              "This lower porosity and water absorption of concrete made with FA and SL ensure its long-term durability, which is a crucial concern for structures and infrastructures.",

              "The outcome of this research are summarized as follows: A significantly higher slump was observed for the concrete made with FA and SL than the control, which increased as the content of FA and SL increased.",
              "The dry density increased up to 45% replacement of OPC by both FA and SL, and beyond that replacement, the density decreased.",
              "At 14 days, the mechanical strength (compressive and tensile) of concrete made with FA and SL was lower than the control concrete, while at 28 days, no strength difference was observed, up to 30% replacement of OPC by FA and SL.",
              "Conversely, concrete prepared with 30% FA and 30% SL exhibited a significantly better mechanical strength than control concrete throughout a longer curing period (at 60 and 90 days).",
              "The concrete prepared with 30% FA and 30% SL had much less porosity and capillary water absorption than the control concrete, which is in accord with the mechanical strength of these concretes.",
              "As the mechanical strength (compressive and tensile) of the concrete decreases, the porosity increases, which is in good agreement with the literature, and the relationship is quite linear.",
              "It was found that the strength of concrete produced with 30% FA and 30% SL increased as the age of the concrete increased from 14 to 900 days, whereas nearly no significant change in strength was detected for control concrete.",
              "The SEM observation confirmed this, which shows a dense ITZ for concrete made with 30% FA and 30% SL, while large and thick cracks were observed through the cement paste and ITZ of control concrete.",
              "The concrete prepared with 30% FA and 30% SL had a constant decrease in porosity and capillary water absorption over a longer length of time (up to 900 days), which is consistent with the concrete\u2019s mechanical strength at these ages.",
