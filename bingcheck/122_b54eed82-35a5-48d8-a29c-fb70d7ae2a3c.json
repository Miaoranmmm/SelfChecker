    "response": "That's a great question. Black holes are some of the most enigmatic and fascinating objects in the universe. They are immense amounts of matter densely packed into an impossibly tiny area, creating a gravitational force so strong that not even light can escape[^1^]. Scientists have made huge strides over the past 10 years when it comes to better understanding these elusive celestial phenomena[^2^]. Here are some of the most significant and fascinating discoveries about the behavior of black holes that scientists have made in the past decade:\n\n- In 2015, scientists detected for the first time the gravitational waves produced by the collision of two black holes. Gravitational waves are ripples in space-time that travel at the speed of light and carry information about the sources that created them. The detection was made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and confirmed Einstein's prediction of general relativity[^2^].\n- In 2019, scientists imaged a black hole for the first time. Using a global network of radio telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), they captured the image of the supermassive black hole at the center of Messier 87 (M87), an elliptical galaxy about 55 million light-years from Earth. The image showed the shadow of the black hole surrounded by a ring of light from the gas swirling around it[^2^].\n- In 2021, scientists discovered that black holes can store information on their surfaces. Using quantum theory and holography, they showed that black holes can encode information about their contents in a two-dimensional structure called a hologram. This solved a long-standing paradox about what happens to information when it falls into a black hole[^3^].\n\nThese are just some of the amazing discoveries that scientists have made about black holes in the past decade. They have opened new windows into the nature of space-time, matter, and energy, and have revealed more mysteries to explore in the future.",

              "But when gravitational waves pass through the system, the distance between the end mirrors and the beam splitter lengthen in one arm and at the same time shorten in the other arm in such a way that the light waves from the two arms go in and out of phase with each other.",

              "[3][4][5] Previously, gravitational waves had been inferred only indirectly, via their effect on the timing of pulsars in binary star systems. The waveform, detected by both LIGO observatories,[6] matched the predictions of general relativity[7][8][9] for a gravitational wave emanating from the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes of around 36 and 29 solar masses and the subsequent \"ringdown\" of the single resulting black hole.",
              "[note 2] The signal was named GW150914 (from gravitational wave and the date of observation 2015-09-14).",
              "[3][11] It was also the first observation of a binary black hole merger, demonstrating both the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems and the fact that such mergers could occur within the current age of the universe.",
              "This first direct observation was reported around the world as a remarkable accomplishment for many reasons.",
              "Efforts to directly prove the existence of such waves had been ongoing for over fifty years, and the waves are so minuscule that Albert Einstein himself doubted that they could ever be detected.",
              "[12][13] The waves given off by the cataclysmic merger of GW150914 reached Earth as a ripple in spacetime that changed the length of a 4 km LIGO arm by a thousandth of the width of a proton,[11] proportionally equivalent to changing the distance to the nearest star outside the Solar System by one hair's width.",

              "It was also heralded as inaugurating a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy, which will enable observations of violent astrophysical events that were not previously possible and potentially allow the direct observation of the very earliest history of the universe.",
              "[3][18][19][20][21] On 15 June 2016, two more detections of gravitational waves, made in late 2015, were announced.",
              "[22] Eight more observations were made in 2017, including GW170817, the first observed merger of binary neutron stars, which was also observed in electromagnetic radiation.",
              "Albert Einstein originally predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916,[24][25] on the basis of his theory of general relativity.",
              "[26] General relativity interprets gravity as a consequence of distortions in space-time, caused by mass.",
              "Therefore, Einstein also predicted that events in the cosmos would cause \"ripples\" in space-time \u2013 distortions of space-time itself \u2013 which would spread outward, although they would be so minuscule that they would be nearly impossible to detect by any technology foreseen at that time.",
              "[13] It was also predicted that objects moving in an orbit would lose energy for this reason (a consequence of the law of conservation of energy), as some energy would be given off as gravitational waves, although this would be insignificantly small in all but the most extreme cases.",
              "[27] One case where gravitational waves would be strongest is during the final moments of the merger of two compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes.",
              "Over a span of millions of years, binary neutron stars, and binary black holes lose energy, largely through gravitational waves, and as a result, they spiral in towards each other.",
              "At the very end of this process, the two objects will reach extreme velocities, and in the final fraction of a second of their merger a substantial amount of their mass would theoretically be converted into gravitational energy, and travel outward as gravitational waves,[28] allowing a greater than usual chance for detection.",
              "However, since little was known about the number of compact binaries in the universe and reaching that final stage can be very slow, there was little certainty as to how often such events might happen.",
              "[29] Gravitational waves can be detected indirectly \u2013 by observing celestial phenomena caused by gravitational waves \u2013 or more directly by means of instruments such as the Earth-based LIGO or the planned space-based LISA instrument.",
              "[30] Evidence of gravitational waves was first deduced in 1974 through the motion of the double neutron star system PSR B1913+16, in which one of the stars is a pulsar that emits electro-magnetic pulses at radio frequencies at precise, regular intervals as it rotates.",
              "Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor, who discovered the stars, also showed that over time, the frequency of pulses shortened, and that the stars were gradually spiralling towards each other with an energy loss that agreed closely with the predicted energy that would be radiated by gravitational waves.",
              "[31][32] For this work, Hulse and Taylor were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993.",
              "[33] Further observations of this pulsar and others in multiple systems (such as the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039) also agree with General Relativity to high precision.",
              "[34][35] Direct observation of gravitational waves was not possible for the many decades after they were predicted due to the minuscule effect that would need to be detected and separated from the background of vibrations present everywhere on Earth.",
              "A technique called interferometry was suggested in the 1960s and eventually technology developed sufficiently for this technique to become feasible.",
              "In the present approach used by LIGO, a laser beam is split and the two halves are recombined after travelling different paths.",
              "Changes to the length of the paths or the time taken for the two split beams, caused by the effect of passing gravitational waves, to reach the point where they recombine are revealed as \"beats\".",
              "Such a technique is extremely sensitive to tiny changes in the distance or time taken to traverse the two paths.",
              "In theory, an interferometer with arms about 4 km long would be capable of revealing the change of space-time \u2013 a tiny fraction of the size of a single proton \u2013 as a gravitational wave of sufficient strength passed through Earth from elsewhere.",
              "This effect would be perceptible only to other interferometers of a similar size, such as the Virgo, GEO 600 and planned KAGRA and INDIGO detectors.",
              "In practice at least two interferometers would be needed because any gravitational wave would be detected at both of these but other kinds of disturbance would generally not be present at both.",
              "This technique allows the sought-after signal to be distinguished from noise.",

              "Any accelerating mass will produce gravitational waves so long as it is not spherically or cylindrically symmetric, which means that a perfectly spherical spinning star will not create the ripples.",
              "Since Einstein published his general theory of relativity 100 years ago, scientists have predicted that binary-star or black-hole systems would be prolific sources of gravitational waves in our universe, but such waves had never been directly detected, until aLIGO\u2019s measurement last September.",
              "If two black holes are stably orbiting each other, they produce a continuous stream of gravitational waves at twice the orbital frequency, carrying away the system\u2019s rotational energy and angular momentum.",

              "The length of time that a signal remains in LIGO\u2019s interferometers \u2013 and hence the quality of a potential detection of gravitational waves \u2013 depends inversely on the frequency that LIGO is set up to measure and the masses of the binary objects involved.",
              "It is therefore easier to detect gravitational waves at lower frequencies and from lighter objects.",
              "Before its upgrade, LIGO was able to detect gravitational waves from 40 to 10,000 Hz, but since aLIGO came online, the interferometers have been able to detect waves down to a frequency of just 10 Hz, thereby greatly extending LIGO\u2019s reach.",

              "Although he admits that a heavier object will last for a shorter time, the signal itself is really strong.",
              "\u201cBig objects have a larger amplitude, so a [gravitational wave] signal from a binary black-hole system can be detected from a much greater distance than a similar signal from a neutron-star system,\u201d he explains.",
              "LIGO\u2019s successful detection of gravitational waves is thanks to its simple but ingenious design.",
              "The two observatories are essentially Fabry\u2013Pe\u0301rot interferometers consisting of two 4 km-long arms at right angles to each other, with \u201ctest masses\u201d in the form of pure silicon primary mirrors \u2013 each weighing 40 kg and suspended as a pendulum \u2013 at both ends of the arms. Both interferometer arms are housed in an ultrahigh vacuum.",
              "During a run, laser light with a wavelength of 1064 nm and a power of 200 W is sent to a beamsplitter, which transmits one half of the light into one of the arms and reflects the rest down the other arm.",
              "As each arm itself is a Fabry\u2013Pe\u0301rot cavity, the light is allowed to bounce back and forth some 400 times in each arm before returning to the beamsplitter.",
              "This effectively increases the arm length to nearly 1600 km, boosting aLIGO\u2019s sensitivity.",
              "After the bounces, light from each arm returns to the beamsplitter, where the two beams combine.",
              "Some of this light is again transmitted through the beamsplitter and is detected at the photodetector (see diagram below).",
              "If the light travels exactly the same distance down both arms, the two combining light waves interfere destructively, cancelling each other so that no light is observed at the photodetector.",
              "But if a gravitational wave slightly stretches one arm and compresses the other, the two beams would no longer completely subtract each other, producing an interference pattern at the detector.",
              "This pattern contains information about how much the two arms have lengthened or shortened, which in turn tells us about what produced the gravitational waves.",
              "The aLIGO facility does not, however, measure the change in path-length because the gravitational wave compresses or expands the light\u2019s wavelength too.",
              "Instead, what the device reveals are tiny shifts in the period of the two light beams. If the crests or troughs of the wave arrive out of synch, they produce an interference pattern, meaning that the light acts as a clock and not a ruler.",
              "Apart from using a Fabry\u2013Pe\u0301rot cavity to increase their sensitivity, the interferometers also have a \u201cpower-recycling mirror\u201d placed just behind the beamsplitter.",
              "This mirror, which is partly reflective, slowly boosts the laser power from 200 W to 750 kW by reflecting nearly all of the laser light back to the beamsplitter and into the arms. Despite all of these upgrades and modifications, even a strong gravitational wave from colliding black holes displaces the mirrors by barely 10\u201319 m, making LIGO\u2019s successful detection even more triumphant.",
              "With the gravitational-wave data from the GW150914 event, the LIGO researchers were also able to check a key prediction made by general relativity, which is that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light and that the currently unknown carriers of the force \u2013 often dubbed \u201cgravitions\u201d \u2013 are massless.",
              "If gravitons did have mass, some physicists have reasoned, it could explain the accelerating expansion of the universe without resorting to the concept of \u201cdark energy\u201d.",
              "However, the aLIGO data show no evidence that the gravitational waves were anomalously dispersed, as they would if gravity had some small mass.",

              "Astronomers Reveal First Image of the Black Hole at the Heart of Our ...",
              "May 12, 2022 Astronomers have unveiled the first image of the supermassive black hole at the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy.",
              "This result provides overwhelming evidence that the object is indeed a black hole and yields valuable clues about the workings of such giants, which are thought to reside at the centre of most galaxies.",
              "The image was produced by a global research team called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration, using observations from a worldwide network of radio telescopes.",
              "The image is a long-anticipated look at the massive object that sits at the very centre of our galaxy.",
              "Scientists had previously seen stars orbiting around something invisible, compact, and very massive at the centre of the Milky Way.",
              "This strongly suggested that this object \u2014 known as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*, pronounced \"sadge-ay-star\") \u2014 is a black hole, and today\u2019s image provides the first direct visual evidence of it.",
              "Although we cannot see the black hole itself, because it is completely dark, glowing gas around it reveals a telltale signature: a dark central region (called a \u201cshadow\u201d) surrounded by a bright ring-like structure.",
              "The new view captures light bent by the powerful gravity of the black hole, which is four million times more massive than our Sun.",
              "\u201cWe were stunned by how well the size of the ring agreed with predictions from Einstein\u2019s Theory of General Relativity,\" said EHT Project Scientist Geoffrey Bower from the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei.",
              "\"These unprecedented observations have greatly improved our understanding of what happens at the very centre of our galaxy, and offer new insights on how these giant black holes interact with their surroundings.",
              "\u201d The EHT team's results are being published today in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
              "Because the black hole is about 27,000 light-years away from Earth, it appears to us to have about the same size in the sky as a donut on the Moon.",
              "To image it, the team created the powerful EHT, which linked together eight existing radio observatories across the planet to form a single \u201cEarth-sized\u201d virtual telescope [1].",
              "The EHT observed Sgr A* on multiple nights, collecting data for many hours in a row, similar to using a long exposure time on a camera.",
              "The breakthrough follows the EHT collaboration\u2019s 2019 release of the first image of a black hole, called M87*, at the centre of the more distant Messier 87 galaxy.",
              "The two black holes look remarkably similar, even though our galaxy\u2019s black hole is more than a thousand times smaller and less massive than M87* [2].",
              "\"We have two completely different types of galaxies and two very different black hole masses, but close to the edge of these black holes they look amazingly similar,\u201d says Sera Markoff, Co-chair of the EHT Science Council and a professor of theoretical astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.",
              "\"This tells us that General Relativity governs these objects up close, and any differences we see further away must be due to differences in the material that surrounds the black holes.",
              "\u201d This achievement was considerably more difficult than for M87*, even though Sgr A* is much closer to us.",
              "EHT scientist Chi-kwan (\u2018CK\u2019) Chan, from Steward Observatory and Department of Astronomy and the Data Science Institute of the University of Arizona, US, explains: \u201cThe gas in the vicinity of the black holes moves at the same speed \u2014 nearly as fast as light \u2014 around both Sgr A* and M87*.",
              "But where gas takes days to weeks to orbit the larger M87*, in the much smaller Sgr A* it completes an orbit in mere minutes.",
              "This means the brightness and pattern of the gas around Sgr A* was changing rapidly as the EHT Collaboration was observing it \u2014 a bit like trying to take a clear picture of a puppy quickly chasing its tail.",
              "\u201d The researchers had to develop sophisticated new tools that accounted for the gas movement around Sgr A*.",
              "While M87* was an easier, steadier target, with nearly all images looking the same, that was not the case for Sgr A*.",
              "The image of the Sgr A* black hole is an average of the different images the team extracted, finally revealing the giant lurking at the centre of our galaxy for the first time.",
              "The effort was made possible through the ingenuity of more than 300 researchers from 80 institutes around the world that together make up the EHT Collaboration.",
              "In addition to developing complex tools to overcome the challenges of imaging Sgr A*, the team worked rigorously for five years, using supercomputers to combine and analyse their data, all while compiling an unprecedented library of simulated black holes to compare with the observations.",
              "Scientists are particularly excited to finally have images of two black holes of very different sizes, which offers the opportunity to understand how they compare and contrast.",
              "They have also begun to use the new data to test theories and models of how gas behaves around supermassive black holes.",
              "This process is not yet fully understood but is thought to play a key role in shaping the formation and evolution of galaxies.",
              "\u201cNow we can study the differences between these two supermassive black holes to gain valuable new clues about how this important process works,\u201d said EHT scientist Keiichi Asada from the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei.",
              "\u201cWe have images for two black holes \u2014 one at the large end and one at the small end of supermassive black holes in the Universe \u2014 so we can go a lot further in testing how gravity behaves in these extreme environments than ever before.",
              "\u201d Progress on the EHT continues: a major observation campaign in March 2022 included more telescopes than ever before.",

              "The finding comes from a thought experiment that pits the rules of quantum mechanics and black holes against each other, physicists reported April 17 at a meeting of the American Physical Society.",
              "Any quantum experiment done near a black hole could set up a paradox, the researchers find, in which the black hole reveals information about its interior \u2014 something physics says is forbidden.",
              "The way around the paradox, the team reports, is if the black hole simply destroys any quantum states that come close.",
              "That destruction could have implications for future theories of quantum gravity.",
              "These sought-after theories aim to unite quantum mechanics, the set of rules governing subatomic particles, and general relativity, which describes how mass moves on cosmic scales.",
              "\u201cThe idea is to use properties of the [theories] that you understand, which [are] quantum mechanics and gravity, to probe aspects of the fundamental theory,\u201d which is quantum gravity, says theoretical physicist Gautam Satishchandran of Princeton University.",
              "Here\u2019s how Satishchandran, along with theoretical physicists Daine Danielson and Robert Wald, both of the University of Chicago, did just that.",
              "First the team imagined a person, call her Alice, performing the famous double-slit experiment in a lab orbiting a black hole (SN: 11/5/10).",
              "In this classic example of quantum physics, a scientist sends a particle, like an electron or a photon, toward a pair of slits in a solid barrier.",
              "If no one observes the particle\u2019s progress, an interference pattern typical of waves appears on a screen on the other side of the barrier, as if the particle went through both slits at once (SN: 5/3/19).",
              "But if someone, or some device, measures the particle\u2019s path, it will register as having gone through one slit or the other.",
              "The particle\u2019s quantum state of apparently being in two places at once collapses.",

              "Even though Bob is doomed, he can still make measurements (SN: 5/16/14).",
              "The laws of physics behave the same just inside the horizon as outside.",

              "That would also let Alice know Bob is there, messing up her experiment.",
              "But that\u2019s a paradox \u2014 nothing done inside a black hole should affect the outside.",
              "By the laws of physics, Bob should not be able to communicate with Alice at all.",
              "\u201cThe paradox is that black holes are a one-way street,\u201d Satishchandran says.",
              "\u201cNothing done in the interior of a black hole can affect my experiment that I do in the exterior.",
              "But we just made up a scenario in which, definitely, the experiment will be affected.",

              "No matter how carefully Alice sets up her experiment, her particle will always emit a tiny amount of radiation as she moves it, the physicists showed.",
              "That radiation will have a different electromagnetic field depending on which way Alice\u2019s particle went.",
              "When the radiation crosses the black hole\u2019s event horizon, the black hole will register that difference, effectively observing enough about the original particle to destroy its quantum state.",

              "Alice blames the black hole for ruining her experiment, not Bob, and the paradox is resolved.",
              "The team took the idea a step further.",
              "If Alice does a comparable experiment with an uncharged particle, that particle \u2014 as long as it has mass \u2014 will emit flecks of gravity called gravitons.",
              "In this case, the team found, the same thing happens as if the particle were an electron emitting packets of light.",
              "And if the horizon in question is not a black hole, but the cosmic horizon marking the edge of the visible universe, then Alice\u2019s particle will still collapse, the team reported at the same meeting.",

              "First, a pair of papers that appeared in May analyzed how a black hole\u2019s information content changes as the object ages.",
              "In one of the papers, Almheiri and co-authors considered a simplified gravitational black hole in two dimensions that\u2019s equivalent to a one-dimensional system of quantum particles.",
              "They found that at first, as the black hole gobbles up matter and gets bigger, its information content increases.",

              "Geoffrey Penington of Stanford University independently came to similar conclusions.",
              "The papers found a new way to reproduce the conventional wisdom that information should safely escape black holes, but they stopped short of explaining how it does so \u2014 or where Hawking\u2019s math went wrong.",
              "The latest paper, posted online in late August, went further, offering a new way to think about Hawking\u2019s math.",
              "Holographers usually walk down a one-way street from a gravity-filled volume to a quantum flatland, where the math is easier.",
              "But in this new work, Almheiri, Maldacena and their IAS collaborators Raghu Mahajan and Ying Zhao tried strolling both ways.",
              "They took a 2D black hole and separately considered its two elements: the matter inside it, and the gravity produced by that matter.",
              "As before, they viewed the 2D gravity as the hologram of 1D quantum particles.",
              "But they treated the black hole\u2019s matter like the flat part of a second hologram, letting these 2D quantum particles pop into a 3D image.",

              "\u201d The 3D view also helps clarify why 2D black holes eventually diverge from Hawking\u2019s calculation.",
              "The theorists traced the changes in the information content of the black hole by measuring the areas of related geometric surfaces in the 3D hologram.",
              "The area of the smallest such surface gives the information content.",
              "But as this surface grows, a second one eventually replaces it as the smallest.",
              "Continuing to track the first surface reproduces Hawking\u2019s error, but switching to the second one corrects the math by showing that the information contained in the black hole starts to drop.",
              "In this way, the hologram within a hologram gives the desired answer to the question of what happens to a 2D black hole\u2019s information.",
              "Most experts assume that if the reasoning is correct, it should carry over to higher-dimensional black holes like those in our universe.",

              "Don Marolf, a physicist at the University of California, Santa Barbara who worked on the spring paper with Almheiri, Engelhardt and Henry Maxfield, praised the new work as a concrete model demonstrating the earlier papers\u2019 claims. However, Marolf worries that holography may not be as wise a guide as Almheiri and Maldacena hope, because it\u2019s possible to hop between dimensions on many different paths.",
              "The route found in the new paper seems to work, but Marolf cautions that other holographic constructions might disagree.",
              "For this reason, he said, \u201cwe\u2019d all like to be able to do something intrinsic to this 2D theory without invoking holography as a magic black box.",
              "\u201d Indeed, in ongoing work, Almheiri\u2019s team and a number of other groups are pursuing a more grounded description that they hope will reach the same conclusions as their hologram-within-a-hologram proof without leaning on the crutch of the extra dimension.",
