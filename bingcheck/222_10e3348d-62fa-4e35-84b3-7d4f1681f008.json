              "The recorded history of sign language in Western societies starts in the 17th century, as a visual language or method of communication, although references to forms of communication using hand gestures date back as far as 5th century BC Greece.",
              "Sign language is composed of a system of conventional gestures, mimic, hand signs and finger spelling, plus the use of hand positions to represent the letters of the alphabet.",
              "Signs can also represent complete ideas or phrases, not only individual words.",
              "Most sign languages are natural languages, different in construction from oral languages used in proximity to them, and are employed mainly by deaf people in order to communicate.",
              "Many sign languages have developed independently throughout the world, and no first sign language can be identified.",
              "Both signed systems and manual alphabets have been found worldwide.",
              "Until the 19th century, most of what we know about historical sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from an oral to a sign language, rather than documentation of the sign language itself.",
              "One of the earliest written references to a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in Plato's Cratylus, where Socrates says: \"If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?\"",
              "[1] In the Middle Ages, monastic sign languages were used by a number of religious orders in Europe since at least the 10th century.",
              "These are not true \"sign languages\", however, but well-developed systems of gestural communication.",
              "[2] In Native American communities prior to 1492, it seems that Plains Indian Sign Language existed as an extensive lingua franca used for trade and possibly ceremonies, story-telling and also daily communication by deaf people.",
              "[3] Accounts of such signing indicate these languages were fairly complex, as ethnographers such as Cabeza de Vaca described detailed communications between them and Native Americans that were conducted in sign.",

              "Indeed, the deeper I delve into the ritual practices of ancient societies, the more I find these practices and those of the Latter-day Saint temple to be mutually instructive.",
              "Nevertheless, like many people who have written a doctoral dissertation, the request to summarize my findings usually leaves me tongue-tied.",
              "One reason for this is that research in the humanities involves discovering questions as well as answering them;",
              "describing the answers is thus difficult without laying the groundwork of the questions that were asked.",
              "This is particularly true with ritual gestures, a topic whose complexity few realize.",
              "Discussion of sacred priesthood ordinances is subject to bounds of place and manner, which means that many members of the Church, even though they have reflected extensively on the meaning of ritual gestures, have not considered questions that arise from dialogue with those who hold alternate interpretations.",
              "In short, members of the Church readily recognize that ancient ritual gestures are relevant to their own, but they lack the tools to evaluate the ancient gestures in an appropriate way.",
              "In this essay, I intend to provide some tools that can help interested Latter-day Saints to evaluate ancient gestures.",
              "Unlike most essays, this one does not aim to answer a research question.",
              "Instead, it aims to suggest questions, with the intent of preparing interested readers to discuss possible answers while having a clear view of the issues involved.",
              "Based on my interactions with many Latter-day Saints, even including those with academic training, I am convinced that many of the questions I will suggest are novel.",
              "The presentation of these questions as an organized [Page 295]scheme is also a new contribution.",
              "The overarching assumption of this essay is that Latter-day Saints, who belong to a tradition saturated with ritual gestures, a tradition which also lays claim to ancient origins, should be among those who are most educated on ancient ritual gestures.",
              "Ancient sources relevant to the study of ritual gestures can be divided into two basic kinds.",
              "First, there are textual sources.",
              "The books of the Old and New Testaments are examples of ancient textual sources that include information about ritual gestures.",
              "For example, in Genesis 14:22, Abram says, \u201cI have raised my hand to Yahweh El Elyon.",
              "\u201d5 The raising of the hand described here is a ritual gesture, in this case one of covenant-making.",
              "6 Other relevant textual sources can be found in a variety of ancient languages and genres, from Homer\u2019s Iliad to hieroglyphic texts on stelae from ancient Egypt.",
              "Many of these sources can be found in published collections in libraries.",
              "Textual sources are especially useful for reconstructing the larger sequence of events in which ritual gestures were situated.",
              "For example, Abram\u2019s reference to the gesture in Genesis 14:22 is followed by an oath, which helps to identify this as a covenant-making gesture.",
              "However, textual sources also carry some inherent ambiguities.",
              "The text does not tell us, for instance, whether Abram raises his hand with the palm inward, outward, sideways, or with some special finger articulation.",
              "Neither does it tell us how high Abram raised his hand or for how long.",
              "These questions can only be decided by comparison with other sources.",
              "Only rarely does an ancient text go into detail about the form of a gesture, and even the rare detailed descriptions are never enough to reconstruct a gesture with full accuracy.",
              "The second kind of source is visual representations, often called \u201ciconographic sources.",
              "\u201d These include sculptures, cast figures, engravings, paintings, and other art forms. These sources are extremely abundant in the ancient world \u2014 as far as my own research area goes, the iconographic sources far outnumber the textual sources.",
              "As one example, a number of carved ivories from the Assyrian fortress of Nimrud show a male figure wearing a crown, kneeling and raising both hands with the palms outward.",
              "7 Iconographic depictions are of great value for understanding the forms of ritual gestures.",
              "However, there are limitations to this.",
              "Ancient visual representations do not depict movement, so it is impossible to know whether what is represented is one moment in a motion sequence [Page 296]or simply a static gesture.",
              "Ancient iconography is also prone to sacrifice accuracy for the sake of visually pleasing composition.",
              "For example, an image of two figures facing each other and performing the same gesture in mirror image may be suspected of having switched the right and left hands of one figure in order to preserve symmetry.",
              "The key issue to bear in mind with textual and iconographic sources is that these sources provide evidence for gestures, but they do not include actual gestures.",
              "For example, the Hebrew phrase used to describe the gesture in Genesis 14:22 is herim yad, \u201craise the hand.",
              "\u201d Even though some scholars are accustomed to using locutions like \u201cthe gesture herim yad,\u201d and some even go so far as to assume that there is a one-to-one correspondence between phrase and gesture, this is inaccurate and potentially misleading.",
              "8 Just as we might describe a given gesture in English as \u201che raised his hand\u201d or \u201che put up his hand,\u201d ancient textual sources also use different phrases to describe what is really the same gesture;",
              "they also occasionally use the same basic phrase to describe different gestures.",
              "Likewise, with iconographic sources, one has to make adjustments to account for the inherent ambiguities of the ancient artistic style.",
              "Therefore, understanding ancient ritual gestures always involves reconstructing these gestures in the imagination, based on clues found in the ancient sources.",
              "The two main aspects that have to be reconstructed are the gesture\u2019s form and its context.",
              "Given the ambiguities inherent in the sources, one should consider multiple possibilities.",
              "One should ask questions like the following: What might this gesture have looked like?",
              "What kind of setting was it performed in?",
              "In asking these questions, both scholars and laypeople can learn much from contemporary artists, playwrights, and moviemakers, who are accustomed to thinking about these issues.",
              "Considering the possibilities of form and context is critical, since these aspects establish the basis for comparison across sources, as well as comparison with ritual gestures that can be observed in modern religious practice.",
              "Most studies of ancient gestures focus on one particular gesture, marshalling textual and iconographic evidence to illuminate the gesture\u2019s form or its meaning in context.",
              "However, it is important to keep in mind that ritual gestures usually exist as part of a system of nonverbal signs in a culture.",
              "Their meaning derives as much from similarities and contrasts with other gestures as from aspects of context.",
              "In The Church of Jesus [Page 297]Christ of Latter-day Saints, for example, in ordinances involving the laying on of hands, each officiator typically uses two hands.",
              "But when there is a large number of Priesthood holders officiating in the circle, each uses only the right hand, while the left hand is placed on the shoulder of the person to the left.",
              "When an infant is being blessed, hands are placed under the infant rather than on the head.",
              "A full account of the gesture of the laying on of hands should account for all of these variations, which are part of the same system.",
              "9 One important consideration in dealing with ancient ritual gestures is the overall complexity of the system.",
              "This consideration is related to the characterization of the system as a whole, including the origins of gestures and how they have developed from those origins.",
              "In Hinduism and Buddhism, there exists a large body of gestures known as mudra, which appear in ritual and especially in religious dance.",
              "The mudra are also described in mythology and depicted in iconography.",
              "There are many dozens of mudra, each having a very specific form and meaning.",
              "The large number of signs in the system allows each sign to function almost like a word in spoken language;",
              "gestures can be strung together to form sequences of meanings, such as to tell a story in dance.",
              "We know a great deal about mudra because Hindu and Buddhist scholars wrote treatises in which the gestures are described in detail.",
              "10 Unfortunately, most ancient societies have not bequeathed to modern times a treatise on ritual gestures.",
              "Evidence of the total number of gestures in ancient Near Eastern ritual is relatively scant.",
              "But it makes a great deal of difference whether we assume on the one hand that the available evidence represents the total system, or whether we assume on the other hand that this represents only the tip of the iceberg.",
              "If the latter is true, then each gesture may have a very specific meaning.",
              "At the beginning of the 20th century, some scholars suggested that ancient Near Eastern gestures were originally part of an extensive system like the mudra (other models included Masonic ritual and the nonverbal signs of Chinese secret societies).",
              "According to this point of view, gestures that originally functioned as part of an extensive system in temple rites have gradually been reduced in number and used in less sacred contexts.",
              "11 More recent scholarship on Near Eastern gestures has taken a nearly opposite view: the ritual gestures are thought to be few in number and to have derived their meanings from mundane contexts.",
              "For example, raising both hands with the palms upward was thought to have begun as a simple begging gesture and to have become a prayer gesture when transferred to a temple context.",
              "12 [Page 298]Given the limited extent of available evidence, it is unlikely that any one of these views can be conclusively proven.",
              "Considering both viewpoints opens up a number of interesting questions, such as the following: Is the ancient system of ritual gestures explainable in terms of another form of behavior, such as dance, spoken language, drama, or mundane human interactions?",
              "If not, might there be vestiges of an earlier system that is explainable in these terms?",
              "In light of modern gestures that are analogous to the ancient ones and that may be historically related, could there be a development in the overall nature of the system from ancient to modern times?",
              "One of the most interesting things I have found in my research is the great diversity of interpretations that have been suggested for ritual gestures.",
              "As one example, for the gesture of raising one hand with the palm outward (as found in Genesis 14:22 and elsewhere in textual and iconographic sources), at least 12 distinct interpretations are found in the literature.",
              "Several scholars regard it as a gesture of \u201cadoration\u201d or \u201cworship,\u201d others call it a \u201cgesture of greeting or blessing,\u201d some describe it as an apotropaic sign (a sign whose purpose is to ward away evil), one views it as a symbol of a deity, one suggests that it is a sign of non-treachery or purity, and the list goes on.",
              "13 Is there any way to say that one interpretation is correct and that another is incorrect?",
              "There are some criteria that can be applied.",
              "One of these is the form of the gesture.",
              "The interpretation that the gesture signifies either a lack of treachery or the purity of the one making the gesture, for example, is less viable if the palm of the hand is turned inward, and it is likewise less viable if the gesture involves making a fist and raising it high above the head as if to smite.",
              "As it turns out, based on comparison with iconographic sources, the gesture likely involved raising the hand in front with the palm facing toward the addressee, so this interpretation (which was made by David Seely) is among the more likely ones.",
              "14 Another criterion is the ritual context of the gesture.",
              "The fact that Abram takes an oath after making reference to the gesture, using standard Hebrew oath formulae, means that an interpretation that fits with the idea of oath-taking is more likely than one that involves, say, destroying enemies.",
              "Nevertheless, we should be careful not to assume that the idea of oath-taking is identical with the meaning of the gesture, since the gesture may impart its own distinctive meaning within the oath-taking context.",
              "[Page 299]Even after applying the criteria of form and context, the number of possible interpretations of any given gesture is rather high.",
              "All of the interpretations mentioned above are still viable in terms of these two criteria, despite the fact that some who have suggested these interpretations have argued as if their interpretation is valid to the exclusion of others.",
              "In rare cases, the range of interpretation of a gesture may be narrowed if the gesture has an obvious relationship to something whose interpretation is indisputable.",
              "For example, it is thought that the ancient Mesopotamian oath gesture of \u201ctouching the throat\u201d involved a motion signifying that the consequence of breaking the oath would be the cutting of the oath-breaker\u2019s throat.",
              "15 Here the gesture\u2019s visual similarity to cutting the throat would guarantee the interpretation of the gesture.",
              "Moreover, ritual gestures may change their form over time, and a gesture that once bore a strong resemblance to another action may develop into a less obvious sign.",
              "In such cases, one could possibly say that the historical origin of the gesture suggests the correctness of a certain interpretation.",
              "However, people do not always know the origins of the ritual gestures they perform, and it is questionable whether an interpretation based on historical development is more correct than one that applies directly to the current gesture as experienced by those who perform it.",
              "Can one appeal to factors external to the gesture itself to decide if one interpretation is uniquely correct?",
              "Often, scholars who study ritual gestures appeal to ideas found in ancient sources, claiming that because an interpretation matches that of a particular source, it must be representative of the ancient culture in a way that other interpretations are not.",
              "For example, Johan Lust cites a host of ancient sources to prove that the core meaning of the raised-hand gesture has nothing to do with oath-taking but rather signifies entering into action to the addressee\u2019s favor or detriment.",
              "16 The main problem with this kind of approach is that the ancient sources can be used to prove a great number of interpretations, and these interpretations may all be indicative of the ancient culture.",
              "It is useful to think of this in general terms, as if the gesture were practiced in our own time.",
              "Latter-day Saints are especially suited to think in these terms, since ritual gestures are an important part of our own living religious tradition.",
              "(In fact, Abram\u2019s oath gesture of raising the hand appears analogous to the act of raising the right hand to sustain leaders and to administer the ordinance of baptism, both of which are connected with covenant-making.)",
              "As long as an interpretation is plausible in terms of the gesture\u2019s form and context, what is there to exclude it?",
              "If a dozen people participating in a ritual interpret the same gesture, each in a [Page 300]different way, who is to say that one participant is correct and the others are not?",
              "If our own religious practice is taken as a model, it would seem likely that the interpretation of gestures was a matter of private introspection and inspiration;",
              "ideas may have been shared in certain settings, but there would be no penalty for having a divergent interpretation or indeed for having no interpretation at all.",
              "This means that citing an ancient source for an interpretation does not prove that the interpretation is exclusively correct, and claims of exclusive correctness probably get us further from the ancient state of affairs rather than closer to it.",
              "It is possible to imagine the interpretation of a gesture in the ancient society being rendered consistent by convention, either with the intervention of an authoritative institution or simply by popular consensus.",
              "A study by Desmond Morris on ritual gestures in Europe included a survey of large numbers of people to determine how people in different locales interpreted various gesture forms used in daily life.",
              "17 When a majority of the members of a community agree on the interpretation of a gesture, this lends correctness to the interpretation, just as the correct meaning of words in a language is based on consensus in the community of those who speak the language.",
              "However, interpretations of ritual gestures often are not subject to convention.",
              "According to the anthropologist Roy Rappaport, one of the main characteristics of ritual is that it is \u201cnot encoded by the performers.",
              "\u201d18 This means that ritual gestures are viewed as deriving from a world outside that of human interaction.",
              "When asked what ritual gestures mean, informants often reply that they do not know, that they are performing the gestures simply because that is what they have always done.",
              "19 If the meaning of ritual gestures is not rendered consistent by repetition among members of the community, and if interpretations are not censored by a higher authority, then there is nothing to stop people from developing a diversity of interpretations.",
              "The question of correctness may then be essentially moot.",
              "An interpretation found in an ancient source would be speculative to the same degree as that of a modern scholar (provided that the scholar is knowledgeable about the ancient culture and has a workable reconstruction of the ritual).",
              "The statement that ritual is \u201cnot encoded by the performers\u201d suggests the possibility that the interpretation of a ritual gesture may be regarded as a mystery whose correctness is based not on convention but on divine ratification.",
              "This idea is implicit in the concept, familiar to Latter-day Saints, of \u201cordinances\u201d \u2014 that is, rites that are prescribed by God through revelation.",
              "If God is the author of a gesture, then God is the ultimate determiner of its interpretation.",
              "In some cases, a revelation [Page 301]having to do with the interpretation of a gesture may be included as part of the ritual itself or in a text associated with the ritual\u2019s origins.",
              "This is seen, for example, in the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper.",
              "One of the texts describing the inauguration of this ordinance includes an interpretation of passing the bread and pouring the wine: \u201cThis is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you\u201d (Luke 22:19-20, KJV).",
              "The sacrament prayers used in the Church today (which are based on passages in the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants) mention eating and drinking in remembrance of the Son.",
              "However, it is almost impossible for explanations such as these to exhaust the meaning of a gesture.",
              "The sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper can be interpreted beyond the words of the ritual and its inaugural texts, and these interpretations are not necessarily invalid just because they are not explicit in the texts.",
              "20 Thus divine revelation as encoded in the ritual can be cited as a standard of correctness, but it does not exclude other interpretations.",
              "While it is usually impossible to narrow the interpretations of a gesture down to a single correct one, it is usually possible to find an interpretation that is more fundamental to the inherent properties of the gesture than others.",
              "Arriving at this fundamental kind of interpretation involves, once again, paying close attention to the form of the gesture and its context as reconstructed from the available evidence.",
              "It also involves paying more attention to what the gesture does than to what it resembles or signifies.",
              "If we take as an example the hand-lifting gesture in Genesis 14:22, we can see that the form of the gesture as revealed in iconography, with the palm of the hand facing toward an addressee and with the fingers pointing upward, has important implications for the way the ritual as a whole is organized.",
              "The gesture designates not only an agent (the one making the gesture) but also a single addressee who is roughly on the same level as the agent.",
              "It also has the potential to call attention to a participant in the ritual who is located above the agent and addressee (such as a heavenly witness), since the fingers point upward.",
              "We can thus say that the gesture sets up a ritual interaction in which there is one agent, one addressee, and sometimes a heavenly participant.",
              "All of the interpretations of this gesture mentioned above presuppose this kind of interaction format.",
              "Further, if we assemble all of the evidence for the contexts in which this gesture is performed, we find that the function that best describes what this gesture does in all cases is that of marking a performative act \u2014 that is, the gesture signals a ritual action that brings [Page 302]about a new state of affairs, such as putting the agent or the addressee under an obligation.",
              "21 In summary, some questions that can be used to evaluate the extent of an interpretation\u2019s \u201ccorrectness\u201d are the following: Does this interpretation accord with the form of the gesture?",
              "Does it accord with the context?",
              "Does the interpretation exclude other interpretations, and if so, on what basis?",
              "Finally, is the interpretation fundamentally related to how the gesture functions in context, or is the gesture viewed in terms of a similarity or symbolic relationship to other concepts?",
              "Since a ritual gesture can have multiple correct interpretations \u2014 some having to do with the gesture\u2019s basic functions and others having to do with its more abstract significance \u2014 the proper task of those interested in the meanings of gestures is not to identify a single correct interpretation but rather to identify the possible interpretations in an organized way.",
              "The number of possible interpretations is infinite, of course.",
              "However, a finite number of universal categories can be used to classify all the possible interpretations.",
              "These categories have been defined in the disciplines of semiotics (the study of signs) and linguistic anthropology.",
              "The ten sets of questions outlined below can facilitate understanding of hand gestures in ancient sources by helping the interested person to identify possible interpretations and to place these interpretations in proper perspective.",
              "Most interpretations of ritual gestures focus on what a particular aspect of the gesture resembles or signifies.",
              "For example, Zeev Falk focuses on the upward motion of the hand-lifting gesture in Genesis 14:22, stating that this signifies affirmation (based on a perceived likeness to clasping the hand of a judge in court).",
              "22 We may call these interpretations referential, since they concern things that the gesture refers to through likeness or symbolism.",
              "Referential interpretations can be classified by the aspect of the gesture that forms the basis of the interpretation.",
              "Hand gestures can be broken down into seven aspects, which include the components of the gesture itself and the larger aspects of which the gesture forms a part.",
              "First, there are the body parts used to perform the gesture: the arm, the hand, and the fingers.",
              "Second, these body parts are formed into a certain shape.",
              "For example, in one gesture depicted on Egyptian reliefs of battle scenes, the hand is formed into the shape of a bull\u2019s head, with the thumb and little finger extended and the other fingers bent forward.",
              "23 In the raised-hand oath gesture discussed above, the hand shape is basically [Page 303]flat, with the fingers extended and close together, and the elbow bent approximately to the square.",
              "A third component is the position of the shaped hand: whether it is held high, low, to the front, to the side, etc.",
              "Fourth, in many cases, the gesture involves a certain motion of the hand, such as moving it repeatedly from a high to a low position or changing its shape from an open hand to a closed fist.",
              "Fifth, the gesture may involve holding or manipulating an object (or pretending to do so).",
              "As for the larger aspects of which the gesture forms a part, we can mention the body of the agent performing the gesture and the overall setting of the ritual.",
              "We can outline these seven aspects as follows: Aspects of Ritual Hand GesturesComponents of the gesture itself: 1.",
              "Body parts (arm, hand, fingers)2.",
              "Shape3.",
              "Position4.",
              "Motion5.",
              "Object Larger Aspects: 6.",
              "Body7.",
              "Setting Each of these aspects can be made the basis of a referential interpretation.",
              "For example, Wolff suggests that the hand in ancient Hebrew society was a symbol of one\u2019s power.",
              "Thus raising the hand would be equivalent to exalting or vaunting one\u2019s own power, and \u201cgiving the hand\u201d (2 Kings 10:15) would signify offering one\u2019s power in helping the addressee.",
              "24 This is an example of a referential interpretation based on the body part used to perform the gesture, namely the hand.",
              "In the cases of the larger aspects of which the gesture forms a part, the meaning of the gesture fits within a referential interpretation of the agent\u2019s body or the larger setting.",
              "For example, Falk\u2019s interpretation of the raised-hand gesture as one of affirmation fits within an interpretation of the ritual setting as a legal one, akin to a courtroom presided over by a judge.",
              "The following questions can help one to identify possible referential interpretations: In addition to referential interpretations, there are interpretations that focus on the fundamental function of the gesture, including both what the gesture does to the context and how it is affected by the context.",
              "An example of this is the interpretation of the hand-lifting gesture that I suggested above, including the shaping of the context into a two- or three-part interaction and the function of marking a performative act.",
              "This kind of interpretation is known in semiotics as indexical;",
              "when a gesture either affects or is affected by an aspect of context, the gesture is said to index that aspect of its context.",
              "Indexical interpretations can be classified by the aspect of context that is singled out as affecting or being affected by the gesture.",
              "A gesture\u2019s context can be analyzed in many ways.",
              "Three main aspects, however, are especially important with regard to the indexical functioning of gestures.",
              "The first aspect is the participants defined by the gesture.",
              "Some gestures are directed inward or lack a specific addressee, in which cases the format consists only of the agent of the gesture.",
              "The gestures I have studied, [Page 305]however, usually have a specific outward directionality and designate at least one addressee.",
              "25 The gesture may be affected by the participant format, such as when one salutes an officer of higher rank in a military ceremony.",
              "The gesture may also impact the relative status of participants, their roles (such as when a person is ordained), or their physical states.",
              "Second, ritual gestures index the surrounding space.",
              "For instance, they may be directed toward one of the cardinal directions.",
              "They may also be performed close-up or at a distance, defining the breadth of the ritual space.",
              "Third, gestures index the ritual sequence as it progresses through time.",
              "The beginning of the gesture and the return of the hands to a resting position mark off the ritual act as such.",
              "Further, the gesture may function as a key allowing the agent to progress to a new stage of the ritual.",
              "Questions to ask in order to identify indexical interpretations include the following: Who does the gesture to whom?",
              "What are the relative statuses of the agent and addressee of the gesture?",
              "Does this status change during the course of the ritual?",
              "Does one of the participants take on a new role or an obligation through the performance of the ritual?",
              "How does it feel to perform the gesture and to be its addressee?",
              "Is there evidence that the gesture was thought to bring about supernatural changes in the physical world?",
              "Where are the participants located, and what is the distance between them?",
              "Do those who perform the gesture form a distinct group, so that the gesture effectively creates a boundary between participants?",
              "What parts of the ritual precede and follow the gesture?",
              "How might the gesture recall, anticipate, or lead into other parts of the ritual?",
              "In identifying indexical interpretations, one must pay attention to speech that accompanies the gesture, since the function of the ritual may be shared between gesture and speech.",
              "For instance, the oath and the gesture in Genesis 14:22-23 work in tandem to carry forward the function of obligating Abram.",
              "Ritual hand gestures are a complex topic with great promise for future research.",
              "Among the most important tools for understanding the multifaceted meanings of gestures are questions that force one to probe into the gestures, their sources, and their interpretations.",
              "I have provided [Page 306]several sets of questions which, I hope, will be of service to those who wish to undertake this process.",
              "Answers to these questions can be found in the sources cited.",
              "But answers are relatively easy to come by;",
              "what is more difficult is knowing how to evaluate these answers and place them in a larger perspective.",
              "I have focused on describing the issues and suggesting relevant questions, with the aim that interested people will be better prepared to obtain their own lasting insights.",
              "Questioning the meanings of gestures is something that can be done by scholars and laymen alike.",
              "To be sure, answers to some questions are more easily accessible to scholars trained in the particulars of the society in question.",
              "Nevertheless, Latter-day Saints have an advantage in hailing from a tradition that encourages us to think deeply about the meanings of ritual gestures.",
              "When we regard the gestures of the ancients, we can feel not only fascination but also kinship.",

              "For our purposes in this book, we will define communication as the process of generating meaning by sending and receiving verbal and nonverbal symbols and signs that are influenced by multiple contexts.",
              "This definition builds on other definitions of communication that have been rephrased and refined over many years.",
              "In fact, since the systematic study of communication began in colleges and universities a little over one hundred years ago, there have been more than 126 published definitions of communication (Dance & Larson, 1976).",
              "In order to get a context for how communication has been conceptualized and studied, let\u2019s look at a history of the field.",
              "While there are rich areas of study in animal communication and interspecies communication, our focus in this book is on human communication.",
              "Even though all animals communicate, as human beings we have a special capacity to use symbols to communicate about things outside our immediate temporal and spatial reality (Dance & Larson).",
              "For example, we have the capacity to use abstract symbols, like the word education, to discuss a concept that encapsulates many aspects of teaching and learning.",
              "We can also reflect on the past and imagine our future.",
              "The ability to think outside our immediate reality is what allows us to create elaborate belief systems, art, philosophy, and academic theories.",
              "It\u2019s true that you can teach a gorilla to sign words like food and baby, but its ability to use symbols doesn\u2019t extend to the same level of abstraction as ours.",
              "However, humans haven\u2019t always had the sophisticated communication systems that we do today.",
              "Some scholars speculate that humans\u2019 first words were onomatopoetic.",
              "You may remember from your English classes that onomatopoeia refers to words that sound like that to which they refer\u2014words like boing, drip, gurgle, swoosh, and whack.",
              "Just think about how a prehistoric human could have communicated a lot using these words and hand gestures.",
              "He or she could use gurgle to alert others to the presence of water or swoosh and whack to recount what happened on a hunt.",
              "In any case, this primitive ability to communicate provided an evolutionary advantage.",
              "Those humans who could talk were able to cooperate, share information, make better tools, impress mates, or warn others of danger, which led them to have more offspring who were also more predisposed to communicate (Poe, 2011).",
              "This eventually led to the development of a \u201cTalking Culture\u201d during the \u201cTalking Era.",
              "\u201d During this 150,000 year period of human existence, ranging from 180,000 BCE to 3500 BCE, talking was the only medium of communication, aside from gestures, that humans had (Poe, 2011).",
              "The beginning of the \u201cManuscript Era,\u201d around 3500 BCE, marked the turn from oral to written culture.",
              "This evolution in communication corresponded with a shift to a more settled, agrarian way of life (Poe, 2011).",
              "As hunter-gatherers settled into small villages and began to plan ahead for how to plant, store, protect, and trade or sell their food, they needed accounting systems to keep track of their materials and record transactions.",
              "While such transactions were initially tracked with actual objects that symbolized an amount\u2014for example, five pebbles represented five measures of grain\u2014symbols, likely carved into clay, later served as the primary method of record keeping.",
              "In this case, five dots might equal five measures of grain.",
              "During this period, villages also developed class systems as more successful farmers turned businessmen prospered and took leadership positions.",
              "Religion also became more complex, and a new class of spiritual leaders emerged.",
              "Soon, armies were needed to protect the stockpiled resources from others who might want to steal it.",
              "The emergence of elite classes and the rise of armies required records and bookkeeping, which furthered the spread of written symbols.",
              "As clergy, the ruling elite, and philosophers began to take up writing, the systems became more complex.",
              "The turn to writing didn\u2019t threaten the influential place of oral communication, however.",
              "During the near 5,000-year period of the \u201cManuscript Era,\u201d literacy, or the ability to read and write, didn\u2019t spread far beyond the most privileged in society.",
              "In fact, it wasn\u2019t until the 1800s that widespread literacy existed in the world.",
              "The end of the \u201cManuscript Era\u201d marked a shift toward a rapid increase in communication technologies.",
              "The \u201cPrint Era\u201d extended from 1450 to 1850 and was marked by the invention of the printing press and the ability to mass-produce written texts.",
              "This 400-year period gave way to the \u201cAudiovisual Era,\u201d which only lasted 140 years, from 1850 to 1990, and was marked by the invention of radio, telegraph, telephone, and television.",
              "Our current period, the \u201cInternet Era,\u201d has only lasted from 1990 until the present.",
              "This period has featured the most rapid dispersion of a new method of communication, as the spread of the Internet and the expansion of digital and personal media signaled the beginning of the digital age.",
              "The evolution of communication media, from speaking to digital technology, has also influenced the field of communication studies.",
              "To better understand how this field of study developed, we must return to the \u201cManuscript Era,\u201d which saw the production of the earliest writings about communication.",
              "In fact, the oldest essay and book ever found were written about communication (McCroskey, 1984).",
              "Although this essay and book predate Aristotle, he is a logical person to start with when tracing the development of the communication scholarship.",
              "His writings on communication, although not the oldest, are the most complete and systematic.",
              "Ancient Greek philosophers and scholars such as Aristotle theorized about the art of rhetoric, which refers to speaking well and persuasively.",
              "Today, we hear the word rhetoric used in negative ways.",
              "A politician, for example, may write off his or her opponent\u2019s statements as \u201cjust rhetoric.",
              "\u201d This leads us to believe that rhetoric refers to misleading, false, or unethical communication, which is not at all in keeping with the usage of the word by ancient or contemporary communication experts.",
              "While rhetoric does refer primarily to persuasive communication messages, much of the writing and teaching about rhetoric conveys the importance of being an ethical rhetor, or communicator.",
              "So when a communicator, such as a politician, speaks in misleading, vague, or dishonest ways, he or she isn\u2019t using rhetoric;",
              "he or she is being an unethical speaker.",
              "The study of rhetoric focused on public communication, primarily oratory used in discussions or debates regarding laws and policy, speeches delivered in courts, and speeches intended to praise or blame another person.",
              "The connections among rhetoric, policy making, and legal proceedings show that communication and citizenship have been connected since the study of communication began.",
              "Throughout this book, we will continue to make connections between communication, ethics, and civic engagement.",
              "Much of the public speaking in ancient Greece took place in courtrooms or in political contexts.",

              "Ancient Greek rhetoricians like Aristotle were followed by Roman orators like Cicero.",
              "Cicero contributed to the field of rhetoric by expanding theories regarding the five canons of rhetoric, which include invention, arrangement, style, delivery, and memory.",
              "Invention refers to the use of evidence and arguments to think about things in new ways and is the most studied of the five canons.",
              "Arrangement refers to the organization of speech, style refers to the use of language, and delivery refers to the vocal and physical characteristics of a speaker.",
              "Memory is the least studied of the five canons and refers to the techniques employed by speakers of that era to retain and then repeat large amounts of information.",
              "The Age of Enlightenment in the 1700s marked a societal turn toward scientific discovery and the acquisition of knowledge, which led to an explosion of philosophical and scientific writings on many aspects of human existence.",
              "This focus on academic development continued into the 1900s and the establishment of distinct communication studies departments.",
              "Communication studies as a distinct academic discipline with departments at universities and colleges has only existed for a little over one hundred years (Keith, 2008).",
              "Although rhetoric has long been a key part of higher education, and colleges and universities have long recognized the importance of speaking, communication departments did not exist.",
              "In the early 1900s, professors with training and expertise in communication were often housed in rhetoric or English departments and were sometimes called \u201cprofessors of speech.",
              "\u201d During this time, tension began to build between professors of English who studied rhetoric as the written word and professors of speech who studied rhetoric as the spoken word.",
              "In 1914, a group of ten speech teachers who were members of the National Council of Teachers of English broke off from the organization and started the National Association of Academic Teachers of Public Speaking, which eventually evolved into today\u2019s National Communication Association.",
              "There was also a distinction of focus and interest among professors of speech.",
              "While some focused on the quality of ideas, arguments, and organization, others focused on coaching the performance and delivery aspects of public speaking (Keith, 2008).",
              "Instruction in the latter stressed the importance of \u201coratory\u201d or \u201celocution,\u201d and this interest in reading and speaking aloud is sustained today in theatre and performance studies and also in oral interpretation classes, which are still taught in many communication departments.",
              "The formalization of speech departments led to an expanded view of the role of communication.",
              "Even though Aristotle and other ancient rhetoricians and philosophers had theorized the connection between rhetoric and citizenship, the role of the communicator became the focus instead of solely focusing on the message.",

              "If we use President Obama as a case study, we can see the breadth of the communication field.",
              "Within one department, you may have fairly traditional rhetoricians who study the speeches of President Obama in comparison with other presidential rhetoric.",
              "Others may study debates between presidential candidates, dissecting the rhetorical strategies used, for example, by Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.",
              "Expanding from messages to channels of communication, scholars may study how different media outlets cover presidential politics.",
              "At an interpersonal level, scholars may study what sorts of conflicts emerge within families that have liberal and conservative individuals.",
              "At a cultural level, communication scholars could study how the election of an African American president creates a narrative of postracial politics.",

              "The five main forms of communication, all of which will be explored in much more detail in this book, are intrapersonal, interpersonal, group, public, and mass communication.",

              "Intrapersonal communication is communication with oneself using internal vocalization or reflective thinking.",
              "Like other forms of communication, intrapersonal communication is triggered by some internal or external stimulus.",
              "We may, for example, communicate with our self about what we want to eat due to the internal stimulus of hunger, or we may react intrapersonally to an event we witness.",
              "Unlike other forms of communication, intrapersonal communication takes place only inside our heads.",
              "The other forms of communication must be perceived by someone else to count as communication.",
              "So what is the point of intrapersonal communication if no one else even sees it?",
              "Intrapersonal communication is communication with ourselves that takes place in our heads.",

              "For example, a person may use self-talk to calm himself down in a stressful situation, or a shy person may remind herself to smile during a social event.",
              "Intrapersonal communication also helps build and maintain our self-concept.",

              "It is rare to find courses devoted to the topic, and it is generally separated from the remaining four types of communication.",
              "The main distinction is that intrapersonal communication is not created with the intention that another person will perceive it.",

              "After all, interpersonal relationships exist in all those contexts.",
              "Interpersonal communication can be planned or unplanned, but since it is interactive, it is usually more structured and influenced by social expectations than intrapersonal communication.",
              "Interpersonal communication is also more goal oriented than intrapersonal communication and fulfills instrumental and relational needs.",
              "In terms of instrumental needs, the goal may be as minor as greeting someone to fulfill a morning ritual or as major as conveying your desire to be in a committed relationship with someone.",
              "Interpersonal communication meets relational needs by communicating the uniqueness of a specific relationship.",
              "Since this form of communication deals so directly with our personal relationships and is the most common form of communication, instances of miscommunication and communication conflict most frequently occur here (Dance & Larson, 1972).",

              "Some of the challenges of group communication relate to task-oriented interactions, such as deciding who will complete each part of a larger project.",
              "But many challenges stem from interpersonal conflict or misunderstandings among group members.",
              "Since group members also communicate with and relate to each other interpersonally and may have preexisting relationships or develop them during the course of group interaction, elements of interpersonal communication occur within group communication too.",

              "Public communication is a sender-focused form of communication in which one person is typically responsible for conveying information to an audience.",
              "Public speaking is something that many people fear, or at least don\u2019t enjoy.",

              "When compared to interpersonal and group communication, public communication is the most consistently intentional, formal, and goal-oriented form of communication we have discussed so far.",
              "Public communication, at least in Western societies, is also more sender focused than interpersonal or group communication.",
              "It is precisely this formality and focus on the sender that makes many new and experienced public speakers anxious at the thought of facing an audience.",
              "One way to begin to manage anxiety toward public speaking is to begin to see connections between public speaking and other forms of communication with which we are more familiar and comfortable.",
              "Despite being formal, public speaking is very similar to the conversations that we have in our daily interactions.",
              "For example, although public speakers don\u2019t necessarily develop individual relationships with audience members, they still have the benefit of being face-to-face with them so they can receive verbal and nonverbal feedback.",

              "The technology required to send mass communication messages distinguishes it from the other forms of communication.",
              "A certain amount of intentionality goes into transmitting a mass communication message since it usually requires one or more extra steps to convey the message.",

              "Unlike interpersonal, group, and public communication, there is no immediate verbal and nonverbal feedback loop in mass communication.",
              "Of course you could write a letter to the editor of a newspaper or send an e-mail to a television or radio broadcaster in response to a story, but the immediate feedback available in face-to-face interactions is not present.",

              "ASL, like spoken languages, has regional and cultural variations, known as variants and dialects.",
              "These variations can include differences in handshapes, movement, facial expressions, and grammar.",
              "One reason why understanding variants and dialects in ASL is crucial is that it allows for better communication between deaf individuals from different regions.",
              "Just like spoken languages, ASL can have different signs for the same concept depending on the region.",
              "By familiarizing oneself with the different variants and dialects, one can bridge communication gaps and ensure smooth interaction.",
              "Moreover, variants and dialects in ASL play a significant role in cultural identity.",
              "Just as spoken languages reflect the culture and heritage of a community, ASL variants and dialects reflect the diverse deaf culture within different regions.",
              "By recognizing and valuing these variants, we demonstrate respect and appreciation for the deaf community\u2019s rich linguistic heritage.",
              "Understanding the variants and dialects of ASL also allows for effective interpretation and translation services.",
              "Sign language interpreters and translators must possess a comprehensive understanding of the various dialects and variants to accurately convey messages between ASL and spoken languages.",
              "Failure to recognize these nuances can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations, which could have significant implications in legal, medical, and educational settings.",
              "Lastly, embracing the variants and dialects in ASL contributes to the overall advancement of the language.",
              "The study and documentation of these variations provide valuable insights into the evolution and development of ASL as a vibrant and living language.",

              "Understanding and adapting to these differences can greatly enhance communication and promote inclusivity within the Deaf and signing communities.",

              "Our article also treats in some detail two other modality effects\u2014ways in which the visual modality allows for linguistic phenomena that make sign languages look crucially different from spoken languages: the way that the space around a signer is incorporated into linguistic units, and the possibility for greater simultaneity in expressing distinct linguistic pieces.",
              "Although we highlight the potential modality effects here too, we also show that in many ways, one grammar will do.",

              "The few examples include onomatopoeia, words that seem to sound like or imitate what they represent such as ding or meow, and sound symbolism, a direct representational link between a sound quality and a concept.",
              "An example of sound symbolism is Ohala's12 Frequency Code, according to which there is a cross-linguistic tendency for words that express smallness to contain high, front vowels and words that express largeness to contain low, back vowels.",
              "On the other hand, it is generally agreed that iconicity is a much more pervasive phenomenon in sign languages, including American Sign Language (ASL).",
              "13 In many cases, it is not hard to see a visual resemblance between a sign of ASL and its intended referent.",

              "Though such iconicity is easy to find in ASL signs, what role these resemblances play in the lexicon and grammar of ASL and other sign languages is a matter of frequent and vigorous debate.",
              "ASL sign BOOK.",
              "The heat of these debates may be traced back to the history of the study and perception of sign languages.",
              "A common misconception about sign languages is that they merely involve a kind of elaborate pantomime in which signers draw pictures in the air that others may interpret.",
              "That is to say, many believed that sign languages were not languages in the true sense, but purely iconic, relying on transparent resemblances of hand shapes and movements to objects and actions to convey meaning.",
              "Such views were common even among scholars and the American deaf community,14 until Stokoe's15 pioneering work in the 1960s demonstrating that the signs of ASL showed linguistic structure similar to the words of spoken languages.",
              "After Stokoe's work became known, the idea that sign languages were natural human languages with grammatical rules gradually began to take root.",
              "A focal point of much research in the 1970s was the question of how much ASL relied on iconicity as a device for making connections between form and meaning.",
              "3 The standard view about human languages, expressed in Hockett's design feature Arbitrariness, was that form-meaning connections were mediated by arbitrary associations at the level of words (or morphemes).",
              "A classic series of experiments by Klima and Bellugi addressed this issue and set the terms of the debate for years to come.",
              "Klima and Bellugi3 (K&B) acknowledge the presence of iconicity in ASL, but seek to test its relevance to the use of the language.",
              "One way iconicity of signs could be relevant to sign language use would be if the meaning of the signs was self-evident, or transparent in K&B's term.",
              "To test the transparency of signs, K&B presented 90 signs of ASL to 10 non-signing hearing subjects and asked them to guess the correct meaning.",
              "Only nine signs were guessed correctly by at least one subject and in many cases the \u2018correct\u2019 guesses were far from an accurate translation.",
              "From this, K&B concluded that the preponderance of ASL signing is not transparent, as would be apparent to any non-signer who attempted to understand a typical ASL conversation.",
              "In a follow-up experiment, K&B did find that a large number of signs exhibit a property they call translucency.",
              "In this experiment, K&B showed hearing non-signers a sign of ASL along with its meaning and asked them to explain why that sign had that meaning, to identify its iconic basis.",
              "The same 90 signs were used, but this time there was broad agreement among subjects on the iconic origins of more than half of the signs.",
              "These results are compatible with the view that iconicity in signs is not determinate.",
              "There are many ways in which one could choose to represent some attribute of an object or action.",
              "Mandel,16 for example, catalogs many different kinds of iconic representations that are found in ASL.",
              "As K&B note, this means that even iconic signs display a high degree of arbitrariness;",
              "there is no reason one iconic representation should be selected over another.",
              "Consequently, many sign languages may have an iconic sign for some concept and yet have very different signs, depending on what kind of iconic representation is chosen.",
              "Thus, it may not be possible to guess the meaning of an iconic sign, though it is easy to recognize the iconic connection when the meaning is revealed.",
              "Consequently, many signs are seen as iconically \u2018motivated\u2019 rather than iconically determined.",
              "17 These results suggest that form-meaning pairs are largely conventional and arbitrary in both signed and spoken languages and that iconicity plays a limited role.",
              "Furthermore, K&B proposed that grammatical processes might cause iconicity to become \u2018submerged\u2019.",
              "For example, the movement of the sign YEAR resembles the movement of the earth around the sun.",
              "The modified sign, NEXT-YEAR, however, which incorporates a point forward indicating the future, causes the orbiting movement to be suppressed.",
              "Likewise, Frishberg18 argued that there is a tendency for iconic signs to become less iconic over time in ASL.",
              "The importance of iconicity in the generation of new signs19 and this tendency toward non-iconicity predict that younger sign languages should exhibit greater iconicity in their vocabularies.",
              "Recent confirmation of this prediction comes from studies of the very young sign language Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language.",

              "Moreover, sometimes it is necessary to conceptualize a \u2018surrogate\u2019 for the referent's actual physical location in order to direct points or verbs appropriately\u2014when the referent is taller, on a ladder, or hanging from a tree limb, versus shorter, sitting on the floor, etc.",
              "Because of the need to bring in a conceptualized version of the physical space involved, Liddell and coworkers reject the idea that these locations are part of a linguistic system of pronouns or verb agreement.",
              "These issues about how particular spatial loci are determined must be resolved.",
              "Some authors have proposed that the linguistic system closely interfaces with gesture\u2014for both sign languages and spoken languages\u2014and that relying on such an interface would allow a pure linguistic analysis to be maintained.",

              "In either case, these authors maintain that once we abstract away from this problem, there is a coherent linguistic system analogous to the systems of pronouns and agreement in spoken languages.",
              "Still, there are some linguistic challenges remaining.",
              "For example, it is not clear that a formal linguistic distinction between second and third person is warranted\u2014some authors claim that all second-person forms behave linguistically the way third-person forms do, with the distinction being simply whether the referent is an addressee or not.",
              "60,61 This issue continues to be debated;",
              "62,63 it is important because of the observation that (virtually) all spoken languages do make a formal distinction between second and third person somewhere in their grammars\u2014so if sign languages fail to make this distinction, they would be different from spoken languages in an important respect.",
              "Another challenge concerns just how the different non-first forms are interpreted.",

              "In a particular discourse, a spoken language pronoun is often unambiguous, as it picks out a relevant previous referent.",

              "43 In principle, this same interpretation process would apply to both sign languages and spoken languages.",

              "In such cases, the hold has a prosodic nature, but it might not have any effect on interpretation.",
              "In other cases, the simultaneous production of new signs while a non-dominant hand is held may serve a clear discourse function.",
              "For example, the sequence IX DOLL, with a hold on the IX, might be used in a naming context (\u2018this is a doll\u2019), or in a questioning context (\u2018do you mean this doll?",
              "\u2019).",
              "Another context would be the use of a series of signs to describe the referent picked out by the point, such as IX BEAUTIFUL, CHEAP, FANCY, with hold on the IX throughout the following signs, to describe a car.",
              "Researchers discuss one use of such sign holds as a way to indicate a discourse topic, and return to the topic after a stretch of signing.",
              "73 For example, the signer might bring up the topic PICTURE\u2014a two-handed sign\u2014and hold the base sign throughout a narrative, referring back to it again by an index sign or by repeating the sign PICTURE.",
              "In this way, the topic stays active in the background of the discourse and is easily retrieved.",
              "This backgrounding use of a held non-dominant hand is frequently associated with the use of classifiers.",
              "This type of backgrounding has been reported for many sign languages, and it has also been studied experimentally.",
              "Using the probe recognition technique, Emmorey7 found that signers keep the referent of the held classifier active and are more quickly able to react to the probe than signers who watched similar sentences without a held classifier.",
              "Classifiers are also involved in another type of simultaneous construction, in which the two hands are used for two different classifiers, the first one expressing the \u2018ground\u2019, which is then held while the second one shows the action of the \u2018figure\u2019.",
              "For example, the signer might produce the sign for a FENCE, then hold the classifier for a fence on the non-dominant hand while the dominant hand signs the lexical sign BIRD, followed by a classifier to indicate the bird perched on the fence.",
              "Finally, another commonly cited simultaneous construction involves using the non-dominant hand to represent a list \u2018buoy\u201951\u2014a ranked set of items, such as the siblings in a family or items in a to-do list.",
              "The buoy may be held in place while each list item is articulated;",
              "in some cases, the dominant hand may articulate the list items at the location of each list item (for example, when the items are numerals, such as dates).",
              "All of these examples of simultaneous constructions tell us that strict linearization of lexical elements is not a requirement of the sign linguistic system, even if it is for speech.",
              "In these examples, it is usually easy to see that one or the other hand articulates its sign first\u2014so there is a sort of linearization.",
              "It is the holding of the sign that would not be captured in a mechanism that only permits strictly sequential elements.",
              "The fact that the held element is relevant, even if backgrounded, suggests that some components of the human capacity for language can handle multiple pieces of information at the same time.",
              "In fact, it is not just the two hands that show sign languages have the potential for multiple simultaneous articulators: signers employ facial expressions and head/body movements for linguistic functions, and these too may be produced simultaneously with manual signs.",
              "Sign language researchers have long argued that non-manual markers play a linguistic role in sign language grammars\u2014unlike what is usually assumed about the role of, say, facial expression co-occurring with spoken language.",
              "However, exactly what that role is has been under discussion.",
              "In particular, while some researchers argue that these are syntactic elements in sign languages,74 others analyze them as prosodic elements without syntactic presence.",
              "75 Many researchers now agree that different types of non-manual markers contribute to sign languages in ways parallel to the contribution prosody makes for spoken languages.",
              "4,76 For example, certain movements of the brows and head are used to mark yes/no questions, content questions, and topics, in many sign languages.",
              "Such markers may be the sign analog to intonational markers for such discourse structures in spoken languages.",
              "It is revealing that discoveries regarding how to analyze these structures in sign languages have been taking place alongside greater attention to the analysis of spoken language intonation, at phonological, discourse, and syntactic levels.",
              "Despite the apparent similarities between sign language non-manuals and spoken language intonation, the possibility that as a consequence of this dimension sign languages are structured significantly differently than spoken languages has been explicitly raised.",
              "For example, Cecchetto and colleagues77 have proposed that sign languages have a modality-specific option for marking specific syntactic dependencies\u2014i.",
              "e., non-manual marking\u2014and therefore, that a different syntax is possible for sign languages.",
              "In particular, they examine the structure of content questions, known as WH-questions, in Italian Sign Language (LIS).",
              "They observe that LIS makes use of the sentence-final position for WH-words, along with non-manual WH-marking that marks a syntactic dependency in the question.",
              "An example is given in (10).",
              "In (10), the symbol tWHAT indicates the structural position where the WH-word \u2018WHAT\u2019 originated\u2014it is the object of the verb EAT, and in LIS objects come before their verbs.",
              "The non-manual marking for a WH-question occurs simultaneously with the signs EAT and WHAT.",
              "According to Cecchetto et al.",
              ", this is because it is marking the dependency between the original position of the WH-phrase and the sentence-final position.",
              "Spoken languages generally do not use the sentence-final position for WH-questions.",
              "According to Cecchetto et al.",
              ", sign languages are exceptional because they use non-manual marking for dependencies.",
              "If the WH-word had moved to the beginning of the sentence [as it does in the English translation of (10)], the non-manual marking would not be able to mark its dependency, as it needs to extend through the end of the sentence for independent reasons.",
              "It is not clear whether the specific proposal that Cecchetto et al.",
              "make on the basis of data from LIS will extend to similar phenomena in other sign languages.",
              "For example, ASL and Libras also use the sentence-final position for some WH-questions, but they do not use non-manual marking for scope in such cases.",
              "78 The jury is still out on the proposal that sign languages permit exceptional syntactic structures due to the presence of non-manual marking.",
              "Both sign and spoken languages have multiple ways to simultaneously articulate linguistic elements.",
              "Only sign languages have the potential to simultaneously articulate two distinct lexical elements\u2014and this potential is realized only in specifically limited ways, such as holding an element on one hand while the other hand continues to sign.",
              "Both sign and spoken languages can simultaneously layer prosodic and syntactic information.",
              "While it has been proposed that in sign languages, this potential also leads to modality-specific word-order effects, we take such a conclusion to be unjustified.",
              "Thus, again, we see that the sign modality does take some advantage of its unique possibilities, but not in an unconstrained way.",
              "The natural sign languages of deaf communities are full-fledged human languages with full expressive power.",
              "For the most part, they are structured in ways familiar from the linguistic analyses of spoken languages.",
              "The study of sign languages adds to the arsenal of data about the extent to which languages vary, and the extent to which they are the same\u2014for the most part, without requiring linguists to change what they think is fundamental about language.",
              "In this sense, \u2018one grammar\u2019 suffices.",
              "Yet, sign languages emerge from and reflect the visual modality of their expression.",
              "Aspects of the way that sign languages are produced and perceived do in fact affect aspects of their structure.",
              "The study of these modality effects tells us not just that sign languages are special in such-and-such a way\u2014they tell us that certain characteristics are shared by all languages, regardless of modality, while other characteristics are shaped by whether the spoken or signed modality is used.",
              "In this respect, the study of sign languages takes the field farther ahead than the study of spoken languages alone.",

          "One of the earliest written references to a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in Plato's Cratylus, where Socrates says: \"If we hadn't a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn't we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body"

          "Just as spoken languages reflect the culture and heritage of a community, ASL variants and dialects reflect the diverse deaf culture within different regions.",
          "Just like spoken languages, ASL can have different signs for the same concept depending on the region.",
          "Some ASL signs are particularly local that are different from the rest of the regions.",
          "ASL, like spoken languages, has regional and cultural variations, known as variants and dialects.",
          "A common type of variation is the regional variation which a few signs are various across the regions.",

          "Unlike in spoken languages, in which grammar is expressed through sound-based signifiers for tense, aspect, mood and syntax (the way we organise individual words), sign languages use hand movements, sign order, as well as body and facial cues to create grammar.",
          "Asking why American Sign Language needs to have a different grammar to American English is like asking why English needs to have a different grammar to Mandarin Chinese - it \"needs\" to have a different grammar because it's fundamentally a different language!"

          "Signed languages have all the levels of complexity and expressive power as spoken languages, they are processed in similar ways by cognitive and related brain networks (Emmorey, 2002) and they can be acquired as native languages by children following the same developmental stages as those identified for spoken language",
