              "Human Aura: The invisible field of electromagnetic energy",
              "Since ancient times we have seen pictures and paintings of different spiritual leaders across various traditions but one thing that is common among all of them is the halo that surrounds their head which is known as the Aura \u2013 energy field.",
              "It not only surrounds just the head but also extends all around your body.",
              "This aura represents your physical, mental, emotional as well as spiritual energies.",
              "The aura is often seen a mix of fine coloured frequencies where each colour defines its own individual nature and characteristics.",
              "The vibration of this aura is very fine and subtle so we need very fine instruments to detect it or perhaps we can use our inborn intuitive mechanism and our latent psychic potential to train ourselves not only to see the aura but also to interpret the different colours and shapes in the aura which can reveal us a lot of unsaid information.",
              "In scientific research we have found that the aura is electromagnetic field of energy that extends all around our body for about 4-5feet (in a average healthy body) and appears to be depleted in cases of unhealthy person.",
              "The aura of a person is directly connected to the level of health of the person.",
              "A person is considered to be Healthy in terms of Physical vitality, mental clarity, emotional well being as well as highly positive spiritual energies.",
              "So a person who is healthy at all these levels has a bigger and brighter aura and vice versa in the case of an unhealthy person.",
              "Scientists and researchers today all around the globe have confirmed that the matter which appears to be solid in reality is NOT TRUE.",
              "This solid looking matter is actually made up of pure energy which is vibrating at a specific frequency which gives matter properties like shape, size, texture etc.",
              "These solid looking objects like a pen, book and even the molecules, atoms and cells in our bodies for that matter are actually made up of vibratory energy particles called electron, protons , neutrons and further more tiny particles.",
              "So when these particles vibrate in their nucleus, a small electrical impulse is generated in our body and according to the famous law of physics \u201cWhen there is a electrical field around a body, a magnetic field gets developed automatically\u201d.",
              "So the tiny electrical impulses in our body results into the formation of a magnetic field around our body which is actually know as the AURA \u2013 electromagnetic field of the body.",
              "Since everything in this universe is made up of the same constituent particles electron, protons, neutrons etc that means EVERYTHING HAS AN AURA.",
              "And if we keep on expanding these so called elementary particles we reach a point where we find nothing but pure energy vibrating at the very essence of these solid looking objects.",
              "Everything in this physical universe is nothing but energy which connects to everything in the universe.",
              "If we study our ancient Indian texts especially the yoga sutras we will come to know the subtle anatomy of our human chakra system which is actually a very important aspect of our Aura.",
              "Spiritually we can say that aura is our very own soul nature, it reflects our innermost desires and feelings, emotions etc.",
              "Aura is the layer of energy which interconnects all other subtle bodies and also acts like a shield covering and protecting our more refined subtle bodies like the mental, emotional, and spiritual and astral bodies.",
              "Like for our physical body to survive and maintain its health, oxygen plays a vital role for our existence similarly the Pranic forces which are commonly called Prana is the subtle energy that is required by our more refined bodies to function and maintain a good health.",
              "So if we want our bodies to absorb oxygen properly from the environment we should keep our lungs healthy thereby keeping our physical body healthy, similarly if we want our subtle bodies to function properly and to absorb the pranic energies properly we need to keep our aura healthy.",
              "Like for our physical bodies we do regular exercises to keep it healthy and working, we should also practice some form of energy exercise which regulates the proper flow of pranic energies in our subtle bodies.",
              "Today with the development of Hi-tech electronic gadgets and instruments which are able to detect the fine subtle vibrations in our surroundings, it has become possible for us to actually capture a glimpse of the human aura.",
              "The research on capturing this subtle energy field through electronic instruments was started by Semyon Kirlian, who accidently discovered that if an object on a photographic plate is connected to a source of high voltage, small corona discharges (created by the strong electric field at the edges of the object) create an image on the photographic plate.",
              "And soon after his research the development of Kirlian camera was done, through which scientists were able to photograph the electromagnetic field around our fingers.",
              "It was found, that objects which are not alive, do not change parameters of their \u201caura\u201d more than 2%.",
              "LIVING objects however can change their aura field dramatically and quickly.",
              "This provides scientists with unique tools to study physics of LIFE and consciousness using bio-electrography.",
              "For example, Prof Bunzen in Russia found that the response in Kirlian Aura seems to precede (appear as soon or earlier than) electric processes in the brain during a decision making process.",
              "From his research, presented in 2001 at the International Congress \u201cScience Information, Spirit\u201d in St Petersburg, it seems that a thought \u201cappears\u201d in the aura before any electrical activity can be detected in the brain.",
              "Is our consciousness electro-photonic to begin with?",
              "All living objects show continuous changes in their aura.",
              "A major series of experiments of a team of scientists coordinated by Prof Korotkov in St Petersburg, Russia, demonstrated that aura of the human body continues to change continuously for almost exactly 72 hours after clinical death.",
              "It seems, that among other things, not only the time, but also the reason for death can be determined on the basis of these changes.",
              "It is interesting to note that in nearly every culture on Earth for centuries people observe a 3 day period between death of the body and burial.",
              "It seems that our wise ancestors knew MUCH MORE about life and death that we can even imagine today.",
              "It also appears that auras of people who interact with various objects such as drugs, crystals, minerals, colours etc.",
              "may change significantly.",
              "Modern Kirlian equipment are capable to quantify these effects in terms of their influence on the electro-photonic glow.",
              "It seems that detailed functioning of every organ and health effects can be also determined from the recorder stimulated electro-photonic glow.",
              "Slowly and gradually as more research was done in this field of Aura photography different technologies were developed claiming to capture the human aura or the electromagnetic field.",
              "Now till date we have different systems like PIP (Poly contrast Interference Photography), DAS (Digital Aura Scanning system), RFI ( Resonant Field imaging) etc which claim to capture the human aura and also help us in detecting the subtle imbalances in our bodies.",
              "As described above we have different layers in our aura which all constitute to what we know as \u201cOur Subtle bodies\u201d, namely they are called physical body, emotional body, mental body, spiritual body and the last is our Astral body.",
              "So all in all our aura is made up of 5 basic layers out of which the physical body we are able to see with our naked eyes because it vibrates at a relatively lower and denser vibrational rate and the rest of the four bodies vibrate at a higher frequency.",

              "Nevertheless, vedic knowledge also admits to the apparent particulate nature of material substance as gross material atoms and subatomic particles, and particles of subtle material prana in the subtle body and so on, but all that substance is actually Krishna surrounding us really, in non-disclosed form in this world, until we change our attitudes to become more kind and gentle towards Himself and each other, and then the true nature of reality is once again disclosed, and we are then readmitted to the eternal spiritual world, vibrating in a variety of eternal forms and natures, that correspond to various eternal forms and natures of Krishna Himself.",

              "One of the most famous of these studies4 was conducted by Nouchine Hadjikhani, a clinical neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School.",
              "In the early 2000s, Hadjikhani met a man who was able to induce an aura by playing basketball.",
              "She took him to courts near Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where he played for 80 minutes before saying that he could feel an aura coming on.",
              "Hadjikhani ushered him into one of the hospital\u2019s scanners, where his aura began \u2014 a sort of white noise in his vision.",
              "As this happened, she witnessed a brief dilation of the man\u2019s cerebral blood vessels, resulting in increased blood flow across an area of his visual cortex.",
              "This was followed by a more prolonged vasoconstriction.",
              "The location of the observations corresponded precisely to where he described seeing visual noise.",
              "\u201cThere was a one-to-one relationship,\u201d Hadjikhani says.",
              "Without direct electrical recordings of what is happening in the human brain during an aura, there will always be uncertainty as to how closely the mechanism in people matches the CSD seen in small mammals.",
              "Turgay Dalkara, a neurologist at Hacettepe University in Ankara who studies CSD and headache in animals, points out that CSD is an all-or-nothing event in mice;",
              "once started, it spreads across the whole cortical hemisphere.",
              "In people, the symptoms indicate that a much smaller region is affected \u2014 most commonly, as in P.",
              "V.",
              "\u2019s case, part of the visual cortex.",
              "P.",
              "V.",
              "would also occasionally begin to experience the initial symptoms of aura, only for it to peter out \u2014 something that would not be expected of an all-or-nothing event.",
              "Nevertheless, CSD remains the likeliest candidate for what underpins migraine aura.",
              "Some researchers suggest that structural differences between human brains and those of rodents and rabbits might account for apparent inconsistencies in the presentation of aura.",
              "The brains of these small mammals lack the characteristic folds of the human cortex, for instance, which could limit and direct the spread of CSD in people.",
              "Neuroscientists have also not found any other potential mechanism that explains the travelling nature of auras so well.",
              "Some work suggests that, rather than neurons, astrocytes \u2014 the brain\u2019s most abundant non-neuronal glial cells \u2014 could carry a wave across the brain, but this idea has not gained traction.",
              "Although some people experience auras without headaches, for many others an aura signals the imminent onset of pain.",
              "How exactly auras and the pain of a migraine are linked, however, is the subject of considerable debate.",
              "Some think that auras directly cause headaches.",
              "The strongest evidence for this comes again from animal work.",
              "Most migraine researchers think that the pain of an attack is generated by increased firing of the trigeminal nerves, which carry sensory information from the face and the meninges that sheathe the brain.",
              "CSD has been shown to activate these nerves in rodents.",
              "For many years, the favoured explanation for how CSD does this was that the potassium and neurotransmitters released as the wave passes through the brain directly stimulate the trigeminal nerves.",
              "But this theory had a timing problem: these events last for only the few minutes that CSD does, whereas the pain lasts for hours or more.",
              "In 2013, Dalkara proposed an alternative mechanism to account for this discrepancy5.",
              "He and his colleagues showed that CSD opens channels in the membranes of neurons that had previously been implicated in immune-cell function.",
              "This initiates a cascade of inflammatory signalling, first by neurons and then by glial cells, that activates the trigeminal nerves.",
              "Signalling in this network becomes self-sustaining and keeps the trigeminal nerves firing long after the CSD has passed.",
              "Dalkara suggests that this apparent causal link between aura and the pain of a migraine casts the headache as a warning signal of disturbances in the brain.",
              "What migraine headaches do, he says, is alert a person that something is wrong with their brain \u2014 in this case, an event that causes a wave of reduced neuronal activity to pass through it.",
              "\u201cLook at the pain systems in the body \u2014 this is their function,\u201d he says.",
              "So far, Dalkara has studied these mechanisms only in rodents.",
              "However, he points out, human neuroimaging data published over the past couple of years by Hadjikhani and her colleagues6,7 suggest that people who have migraines with auras show signs of inflammation in areas of the brain involved in pain processing, as well as in the meninges adjacent to the visual cortex.",
              "Hadjikhani says she is now investigating whether the inflammation subsides when migraine is successfully treated.",
              "Not everyone is as enthusiastic as Dalkara about the assertion that aura causes the pain of migraine headaches.",
              "For some researchers, the variability of auras, and their occurrence with and without headache, counts against the theory.",
              "\u201cThere is very limited evidence in humans that aura is actually what\u2019s causing the pain,\u201d Charles says.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s neither necessary nor sufficient for headache.",
              "\u201d Dalkara theorizes that the inconsistent relationship between aura and headache might be in part due to variation in the intensity and propagation of CSD events.",
              "Stronger CSDs could first generate an aura, then initiate an inflammatory cascade leading to headache, whereas weaker CSDs might cause neurological symptoms, but be too insubstantial to activate inflammatory signalling \u2014 which would explain auras without a headache.",
              "As for headaches that arise without aura, Dalkara points to a 2018 study in mice in which he showed that both sleep deprivation and depletion of the brain\u2019s energy stores can also initiate the inflammatory cascades seen in migraine8.",
              "This suggests that there are multiple routes to migraine headache \u2014 CSD might cause pain, but perhaps not exclusively.",
              "Hadjikhani is exploring another possible explanation for why people experience migraine headaches without aura.",
              "Most researchers attribute the high prevalence of visual auras to the visual cortex being especially susceptible to CSD.",
              "But Hadjikhani wonders whether visual disturbances are simply very noticeable, and that many people have CSD-like events without realizing.",
              "When Hadjikhani sent detailed questionnaires to people with migraine asking them to list any transient neurological symptoms, many reported issues with recognizing faces or objects, changes in colour perception, and problems with memory and language.",
              "They also described more abstract phenomena, such as a feeling of not being in control of their own hand.",
              "\u201cIf you start asking, you find a lot of interesting evidence,\u201d Hadjikhani says.",
              "More from Nature Outlooks More from Nature Outlooks She also thinks that CSD events might sometimes pass without any perceptible symptoms \u2014 a silent aura.",
              "P.",
              "V.",
              "\u2019s observations lend weight to this idea.",
              "Sometimes his auras begin to spread across his vision, then apparently stop, only to pick up again later.",
              "Crucially, they recommence at a place consistent with them having continued across his visual cortex.",
              "The most straightforward interpretation is that the underlying cause never went away, but for a time he was unaware of any symptoms. If silent auras are common, Hadjikhani says, it would make migraine a more uniform condition than it first seems, and lend weight to the idea that CSD events might induce headaches even in people who do not perceive auras.",
              "Not everyone is convinced.",
              "Peter Goadsby, a neurologist at King\u2019s College London, thinks that it is problematic to attribute any transient neurological disturbance to CSD without direct evidence linking the two \u2014 especially if the symptoms don\u2019t proceed in a way that suggests the underlying cause is travelling across brain tissue.",
              "And Charles notes that detailed self-reporting by people with migraine has shown that aura and headache can be present at the same time, rather than occurring in sequence.",
              "Fully grasping aura and its relationship with headache requires more-incisive observations of migraine.",
              "Without a way to robustly detect CSD \u2014 or any other physical indicator of an aura \u2014 in a person\u2019s brain, Hougaard thinks it is impossible to rigorously test the various hypotheses.",
              "He is currently seeking a drug that induces auras in people, which could allow neuroimaging studies to more precisely reveal what happens in the brain during these events.",
              "Granted an opportunity to routinely peer directly into the brain during aura, in many different people, researchers might at last be able to marry the careful descriptions of auras, made by people who experience them, with their biological basis.",

              "But the real question here is: is there any scientific proof that auras exist?",
              "Let\u2019s see what science says about the concept of the human aura.",
              "In 1939, Soviet researcher Semyon Kirlian discovered a curious effect.",
              "He placed an object on photographic paper and passed a high voltage across it.",

              "For example, you can see the Kirlian effect in the photograph of tomatoes below: Similar photographs of inanimate objects like coins, leaves, and finally, even human body parts have been taken.",
              "Looks convincing, doesn\u2019t it?",
              "Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the case.",
              "Later studies showed that the Kirlian aura has to do with an object\u2019s moisture.",
              "Any living thing, from a vegetable or plant to a human, has a certain level of moisture.",
              "It turned out that electricity created an area of gas ionization around the object, which lead to changes in the electric charge on the film.",
              "Thus, scientific experiments showed that Kirlian photography had nothing to do with spiritual concepts like the aura.",
              "At the same time, we all know that certain people are able to perceive energy and see auras.",
              "Some even claim that they can see distinct aura colors and offer their interpretation of those.",
              "Again, science doesn\u2019t offer any evidence of psychic phenomena here.",
              "Experiments demonstrate that aura readers\u2019 experiences are basically visual illusions.",
              "The specific illusion that could explain the visual perception of auras, according to science, is called the afterimage.",
              "You experience it when you look at the sun or any bright object and then continue to see its glowing silhouette for a few moments.",

              "After all, humankind is in the constant process of exploring the universe and the way it works.",
              "If there is no scientific confirmation of certain phenomena, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they don\u2019t exist.",
              "A few centuries ago, people believed the Earth was the center of the universe, remember?",
              "Scientists who were ahead of their time were executed, such as Giordano Bruno, or misunderstood, such as Nikola Tesla.",

              "So this means that if a soul wishes to fly through the spiritual atmosphere around each spiritual planet in an airplane, then Krishna becomes that airplane, and so on.",
              "The will of souls in this world, however, is imperfect, thus they are held in appropriate external forms that condition and limit what they can will for, and disease is a concomitant of wishing to live in such an imperfect state of consciousness, a state of secession from the constitutional Higher Self God Krishna, who in fact is the greater part of their own self-cognitive faculty, whilst yet still remaining an eternally individual entity Himself, just as the the sun is needed to make the physical eyes function, so there is a vital eternal constitutional relationship with Krishna, that if avoided, renders each soul very much less self-aware of their own true eternal personalities, forms and qualities.",

              "Each soul is like a spiritual pebble in a river of such subtle energy, around which that energy flows to form the percept of the senses themselves, and then the percept of those senses in the form of gross and subtle matter.",
              "In the Bhagavad Gita, our communal Higher Self God Krishna tells us that He is the origin of all the substance that exists around each and every other soul, both in this world and in the eternal spiritual world beyond this world, as ultimately, when the true spiritual nature of everything is revealed, all gross and subtle material matter, and all spiritual matter of the planets in the spiritual worlds, is none other than the non-divisible cosmic-sized soul of Krishna Himself, fully conscious in it\u2019s own right.",
              "Nevertheless, vedic knowledge also admits to the apparent particulate nature of material substance as gross material atoms and subatomic particles, and particles of subtle material prana in the subtle body and so on, but all that substance is actually Krishna surrounding us really, in non-disclosed form in this world, until we change our attitudes to become more kind and gentle towards Himself and each other, and then the true nature of reality is once again disclosed, and we are then readmitted to the eternal spiritual world, vibrating in a variety of eternal forms and natures, that correspond to various eternal forms and natures of Krishna Himself.",

              "Neuroscientists have also not found any other potential mechanism that explains the travelling nature of auras so well.",
              "Some work suggests that, rather than neurons, astrocytes \u2014 the brain\u2019s most abundant non-neuronal glial cells \u2014 could carry a wave across the brain, but this idea has not gained traction.",
              "Although some people experience auras without headaches, for many others an aura signals the imminent onset of pain.",
              "How exactly auras and the pain of a migraine are linked, however, is the subject of considerable debate.",
              "Some think that auras directly cause headaches.",
              "The strongest evidence for this comes again from animal work.",
              "Most migraine researchers think that the pain of an attack is generated by increased firing of the trigeminal nerves, which carry sensory information from the face and the meninges that sheathe the brain.",
              "CSD has been shown to activate these nerves in rodents.",
              "For many years, the favoured explanation for how CSD does this was that the potassium and neurotransmitters released as the wave passes through the brain directly stimulate the trigeminal nerves.",
              "But this theory had a timing problem: these events last for only the few minutes that CSD does, whereas the pain lasts for hours or more.",
              "In 2013, Dalkara proposed an alternative mechanism to account for this discrepancy5.",
              "He and his colleagues showed that CSD opens channels in the membranes of neurons that had previously been implicated in immune-cell function.",
              "This initiates a cascade of inflammatory signalling, first by neurons and then by glial cells, that activates the trigeminal nerves.",
              "Signalling in this network becomes self-sustaining and keeps the trigeminal nerves firing long after the CSD has passed.",
              "Dalkara suggests that this apparent causal link between aura and the pain of a migraine casts the headache as a warning signal of disturbances in the brain.",
              "What migraine headaches do, he says, is alert a person that something is wrong with their brain \u2014 in this case, an event that causes a wave of reduced neuronal activity to pass through it.",
              "\u201cLook at the pain systems in the body \u2014 this is their function,\u201d he says.",
              "So far, Dalkara has studied these mechanisms only in rodents.",
              "However, he points out, human neuroimaging data published over the past couple of years by Hadjikhani and her colleagues6,7 suggest that people who have migraines with auras show signs of inflammation in areas of the brain involved in pain processing, as well as in the meninges adjacent to the visual cortex.",
              "Hadjikhani says she is now investigating whether the inflammation subsides when migraine is successfully treated.",
              "Not everyone is as enthusiastic as Dalkara about the assertion that aura causes the pain of migraine headaches.",
              "For some researchers, the variability of auras, and their occurrence with and without headache, counts against the theory.",
              "\u201cThere is very limited evidence in humans that aura is actually what\u2019s causing the pain,\u201d Charles says.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s neither necessary nor sufficient for headache.",
              "\u201d Dalkara theorizes that the inconsistent relationship between aura and headache might be in part due to variation in the intensity and propagation of CSD events.",
              "Stronger CSDs could first generate an aura, then initiate an inflammatory cascade leading to headache, whereas weaker CSDs might cause neurological symptoms, but be too insubstantial to activate inflammatory signalling \u2014 which would explain auras without a headache.",
              "As for headaches that arise without aura, Dalkara points to a 2018 study in mice in which he showed that both sleep deprivation and depletion of the brain\u2019s energy stores can also initiate the inflammatory cascades seen in migraine8.",
              "This suggests that there are multiple routes to migraine headache \u2014 CSD might cause pain, but perhaps not exclusively.",
              "Hadjikhani is exploring another possible explanation for why people experience migraine headaches without aura.",
              "Most researchers attribute the high prevalence of visual auras to the visual cortex being especially susceptible to CSD.",
              "But Hadjikhani wonders whether visual disturbances are simply very noticeable, and that many people have CSD-like events without realizing.",
              "When Hadjikhani sent detailed questionnaires to people with migraine asking them to list any transient neurological symptoms, many reported issues with recognizing faces or objects, changes in colour perception, and problems with memory and language.",
              "They also described more abstract phenomena, such as a feeling of not being in control of their own hand.",
              "\u201cIf you start asking, you find a lot of interesting evidence,\u201d Hadjikhani says.",

              "Crucially, they recommence at a place consistent with them having continued across his visual cortex.",
              "The most straightforward interpretation is that the underlying cause never went away, but for a time he was unaware of any symptoms. If silent auras are common, Hadjikhani says, it would make migraine a more uniform condition than it first seems, and lend weight to the idea that CSD events might induce headaches even in people who do not perceive auras.",
              "Not everyone is convinced.",
              "Peter Goadsby, a neurologist at King\u2019s College London, thinks that it is problematic to attribute any transient neurological disturbance to CSD without direct evidence linking the two \u2014 especially if the symptoms don\u2019t proceed in a way that suggests the underlying cause is travelling across brain tissue.",
              "And Charles notes that detailed self-reporting by people with migraine has shown that aura and headache can be present at the same time, rather than occurring in sequence.",
              "Fully grasping aura and its relationship with headache requires more-incisive observations of migraine.",
              "Without a way to robustly detect CSD \u2014 or any other physical indicator of an aura \u2014 in a person\u2019s brain, Hougaard thinks it is impossible to rigorously test the various hypotheses.",
              "He is currently seeking a drug that induces auras in people, which could allow neuroimaging studies to more precisely reveal what happens in the brain during these events.",
              "Granted an opportunity to routinely peer directly into the brain during aura, in many different people, researchers might at last be able to marry the careful descriptions of auras, made by people who experience them, with their biological basis.",

              "However, visual perception is a highly complex process that requires a number of interlinking processes, including both low-level and higher-level integration mechanisms. Whilst studying these processes in isolation provides us with a deeper understanding of the underlying neural abnormalities in schizophrenia, it will become increasingly more important to investigate the integrative processes by which multiple top\u2013down or bottom\u2013up processes converge in visual perceptual organisation, and the degree to which they contribute to the overall percept.",

              "However, he points out, human neuroimaging data published over the past couple of years by Hadjikhani and her colleagues6,7 suggest that people who have migraines with auras show signs of inflammation in areas of the brain involved in pain processing, as well as in the meninges adjacent to the visual cortex.",
              "Hadjikhani says she is now investigating whether the inflammation subsides when migraine is successfully treated.",

              "Stronger CSDs could first generate an aura, then initiate an inflammatory cascade leading to headache, whereas weaker CSDs might cause neurological symptoms, but be too insubstantial to activate inflammatory signalling \u2014 which would explain auras without a headache.",
              "As for headaches that arise without aura, Dalkara points to a 2018 study in mice in which he showed that both sleep deprivation and depletion of the brain\u2019s energy stores can also initiate the inflammatory cascades seen in migraine8.",
              "This suggests that there are multiple routes to migraine headache \u2014 CSD might cause pain, but perhaps not exclusively.",
              "Hadjikhani is exploring another possible explanation for why people experience migraine headaches without aura.",
              "Most researchers attribute the high prevalence of visual auras to the visual cortex being especially susceptible to CSD.",
              "But Hadjikhani wonders whether visual disturbances are simply very noticeable, and that many people have CSD-like events without realizing.",
              "When Hadjikhani sent detailed questionnaires to people with migraine asking them to list any transient neurological symptoms, many reported issues with recognizing faces or objects, changes in colour perception, and problems with memory and language.",

              "Crucially, they recommence at a place consistent with them having continued across his visual cortex.",
              "The most straightforward interpretation is that the underlying cause never went away, but for a time he was unaware of any symptoms. If silent auras are common, Hadjikhani says, it would make migraine a more uniform condition than it first seems, and lend weight to the idea that CSD events might induce headaches even in people who do not perceive auras.",
              "Not everyone is convinced.",
              "Peter Goadsby, a neurologist at King\u2019s College London, thinks that it is problematic to attribute any transient neurological disturbance to CSD without direct evidence linking the two \u2014 especially if the symptoms don\u2019t proceed in a way that suggests the underlying cause is travelling across brain tissue.",
              "And Charles notes that detailed self-reporting by people with migraine has shown that aura and headache can be present at the same time, rather than occurring in sequence.",
              "Fully grasping aura and its relationship with headache requires more-incisive observations of migraine.",
              "Without a way to robustly detect CSD \u2014 or any other physical indicator of an aura \u2014 in a person\u2019s brain, Hougaard thinks it is impossible to rigorously test the various hypotheses.",
              "He is currently seeking a drug that induces auras in people, which could allow neuroimaging studies to more precisely reveal what happens in the brain during these events.",
              "Granted an opportunity to routinely peer directly into the brain during aura, in many different people, researchers might at last be able to marry the careful descriptions of auras, made by people who experience them, with their biological basis.",
