    "response": "According to various sources[^2^] [^4^] [^5^], the longest living species of animal on Earth is the **Greenland shark** (Somniosus microcephalus), with a lifespan of between **300-500 years**. These sharks are slow-moving and sluggish, making them an easy target for hunters. However, they have few predators due to their thick skin and large size. Their long lifespan may be due to their low metabolism and lack of predators[^1^].\n\nThe average lifespan of a Greenland shark is estimated to be around **390 years**, based on radiocarbon dating of their eye lenses[^4^]. However, this method has some uncertainties and the exact age of individual sharks may vary. The oldest known Greenland shark was estimated to be **392 \u00b1 120 years old**[^4^], meaning it could have been born as early as 1505 or as late as 1725!",

              "[2] The Greenland shark is a potentially important yet poorly studied cold-water species inhabiting the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.",
              "The Greenland shark has the longest known lifespan of all vertebrate species (estimated to be between 250 and 500 years),[3] and is among the largest extant species of shark.",
              "It is a generalist feeder, consuming a variety of available foods.",
              "[4] As an adaptation to living at depth,[5] it has a high concentration of trimethylamine N-oxide in its tissues, which causes the meat to be toxic.",
              "[6] Greenland shark flesh, treated to reduce toxin levels, is eaten in Iceland as a delicacy known as k\u00e6stur ha\u0301karl.",
              "[7] As it lives in the cold depths of the Arctic and North Atlantic, isolated from human activity, it is not known to be a threat to humans, and no attacks have been recorded.",

              "[8][9][10][11] Males are typically smaller than females.",
              "It rivals the Pacific sleeper shark (possibly up to 7 m or 23 ft long) as the largest species in the family Somniosidae.",
              "The Greenland shark is a thickset species, with a short, rounded snout, small eyes, and very small dorsal and pectoral fins.",
              "The gill openings are very small for the species' great size.",
              "Coloration can range from pale creamy-gray to blackish-brown and the body is typically uniform in color, though whitish spots or faint dark streaks are occasionally seen on the back.",
              "[10] When feeding on large carcasses, the shark employs a rolling motion of its jaw.",
              "The 48 to 52 teeth of the upper jaw are very thin and pointed, lacking serrations.",
              "These upper jaw teeth act as an anchor while the lower jaw proceeds to cut massive chunks out of the prey.",
              "The 48 to 52 lower teeth are interlocking, broad and square in shape, containing short, smooth cusps that point outward.",
              "[10] Teeth in the two halves of the lower jaw are strongly pitched in opposite directions.",
              "[12] The Greenland shark is an apex predator and eats mostly fish, although they have been observed actively hunting seals in Canada.",
              "[4] The prey found in the stomachs of Greenland sharks is an indicator of the active hunting patterns of these predators.",
              "[13] Recorded fish prey have included smaller sharks, skates, eels, herring, capelin, Arctic char, cod, rosefish, sculpins, lumpfish, wolffish, and flounder.",
              "[10] Small Greenland sharks eat predominantly squid, while the larger sharks that are greater than 200 cm (79 in) were discovered eating prey such as epibenthic and benthic fishes as well as seals.",
              "The largest of these sharks were found having eaten redfish, as well as other higher trophic level prey.",
              "[14] Greenland sharks, because of their slow speeds, often hunt prey that are asleep.",
              "Using their cryptic coloration, they can approach prey undetected before closing the remaining distance by opening their large buccal cavity to create a suction that draws in the prey.",
              "This is the likely explanation for why the gut contents of Greenland sharks are often whole prey specimens.",
              "[13] Greenland sharks have also been found with remains of seals, moose,[15] and reindeer (in one case an entire reindeer body) in their stomachs.",
              "[10][16] The Greenland shark is known to be a scavenger and is attracted by the smell of rotting meat in the water.",

              "[10] They also scavenge on seals.",
              "[17] Although such a large shark could easily consume a human swimmer, the frigid waters it typically inhabits make the likelihood of attacks on people very low.",
              "No cases of predation on humans have been verified.",
              "[10] As an ectotherm living in a just-above-freezing environment, the Greenland shark has the lowest swim speed and tail-beat frequency for its size across all fish species, which most likely correlates with its very slow metabolism and extreme longevity.",

              "It is hypothesized that they may ambush them while they sleep.",
              "[20] Greenland sharks migrate annually based on depth and temperature rather than distance, although some do travel.",
              "During the winter, the sharks congregate in the shallows (up to 80\u00b0 north) for warmth but migrate separately in summer to the deeps or even farther south.",

              "This observation is notable for being the first possible record of a Greenland shark from the Western Caribbean, and being caught on a nearshore coral reef (the only other record of this species from the Caribbean was made from a deep-water habitat off the Caribbean coast of Colombia).",
              "The discovery indicates that Greenland sharks may have a wider distribution in the tropics, primarily at greater depths, than previously believed.",
              "[27] The shark is often infested by the copepod Ommatokoita elongata, a crustacean which attaches itself to the shark's eyes.",
              "[28] It was speculated that the copepod may display bioluminescence and thus attract prey for the shark in a mutualistic relationship, but this hypothesis has not been verified.",
              "[29] These parasites also damage the eyeball in several ways, leading to almost complete blindness.",
              "This does not seem to reduce the life expectancy or predatory ability of Greenland sharks, due to their strong reliance on smell and hearing.",
              "[28][30] The shark occupies what tends to be a very deep environment seeking its preferred cold water (\u22120.",

              "The pieces that are cut off exhibit a contraction of their muscular fibres for some time after life is extinct.",
              "It is, therefore, extremely difficult to kill, and unsafe to trust the hand within its mouth, even when the head is cut off.",
              "And, if we are to believe Crantz, this motion is to be observed three days after, if the part is trod on or struck.",
              "The Greenland shark has the longest known lifespan of all vertebrate species.",
              "[32] One Greenland shark was tagged off the coast of Greenland in 1936 and recaptured in 1952.",

              "[32][34][35] Efforts to conserve Greenland sharks are particularly important due to their extreme longevity, long maturation periods, and the heightened sensitivity of large shark populations.",
              "[36] As recently as 1957, females were found not to deposit eggs in the bottom mud, but retain the developing embryos within their bodies so they are born alive (a process known as ovoviviparity) after an estimated gestation period of 8\u201318 years.",
              "[18] About ten pups per litter is normal, each initially measuring some 38\u201342 cm (15\u201316+1\u20442 in) in length.",
              "[34][37][self-published source?]",
              "Within a Greenland shark's uterus, villi serve a key function in supplying oxygen to embryos.",
              "It is speculated that due to embryonic metabolism dealing with reproduction, this only allows for a limited litter size of around 10 pups.",
              "[38] It has been estimated that due to their extreme longevity, Greenland sharks can have 200 to 700 pups during their lifetime.",
              "[18] Like other elasmobranchii, Greenland sharks have high concentrations of the two nitrogenous compounds urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their tissues, which increase their buoyancy[39] and function as osmoprotectants.",
              "TMAO also counteracts the protein-destabilizing tendencies of urea[40][41] and deep-water pressure.",
              "[5][41] Its presence in the tissues of both elasmobranch and teleost fish has been found to increase with depth.",
              "[5][42] The blood of Greenland sharks contains three major types of hemoglobin, made up of two copies of \u03b1 globin combined with two copies of three very similar \u03b2 subunits.",
              "These three types show very similar oxygenation and carbonylation properties, which are unaffected by urea, an important compound in marine elasmobranch physiology.",
              "They display identical electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectra, indicating that their heme-pocket structures are identical or highly similar.",
              "The hemoglobins also have a lower affinity for O2 compared to temperate sharks.",
              "These characteristics are interpreted as adaptations to living at great water depths.",
              "[43] The flesh of the Greenland shark is toxic because of the presence of high concentrations of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO).",
              "If the meat is eaten without pretreatment, the ingested TMAO is metabolized into trimethylamine, which may be a uremic toxin.",
              "Occasionally, sled dogs that eat the flesh are unable to stand up because of this effect.",
              "Similar toxic effects occur with the related Pacific sleeper shark, but not in most other shark species.",
              "[44][45] The meat can be treated for safe consumption by boiling in several changes of water, drying, or fermenting for several months to produce k\u00e6stur ha\u0301karl.",
              "Traditionally, this is done by burying the meat in boreal ground for 6\u20138 weeks, which presses the TMAO out of the meat and also results in partial fermentation.",
              "The meat is then excavated and hung in strips to dry for several more months.",
              "[46] It is considered a delicacy in Iceland.",
              "[47][self-published source?]",
              "[48][49] The Greenland shark's poisonous flesh has a high urea content, which gave rise to the Inuit legend of Skalugsuak, the first Greenland shark.",
              "[50] The legend says that an old woman washed her hair in urine (a common practice to kill head lice) and dried it with a cloth.",
              "The cloth blew into the ocean to become Skalugsuak.",
              "[51] Another legend tells of Sedna whose father cut off her fingers while drowning her, with each finger turning into a sea creature, including Skalugsuak.",
              "[52] The Greenland shark plays a role in cosmologies of the Inuit from the Canadian Eastern Arctic and Greenland.",
              "Igloolik Inuit believe that the shark lives within the urine pot of Sedna, goddess of the sea, and consequently, its flesh has a urine-like smell and acts as a helping spirit to shamans.",
              "[53] As both scavengers and active predators, Greenland sharks have established themselves as apex predators in Arctic ecosystems. They eat a wide variety of fish, seals, and other prey within these ecosystems and have an important role in the intricate food web.",
              "[13][14] Greenland sharks are recognized as the longest-lived vertebrates on earth.",
              "They have a slow growth rate, late maturity period, and low fecundity, making the management and conservation of this species very important.",
              "As a result of their low productivity and extreme longevity, this species is particularly susceptible to overfishing.",
              "Therefore, Greenland sharks' longevity and conservative life history traits, in tandem with their vulnerability to accidental catching and commercial fishing, promotes a growing concern for the sustainability of this species.",
              "[54] The shark has historically been hunted for its liver oil up until the development of synthetic oils and cessation of export of liver oil and skin from Greenland in the 1960s.",
              "[55][full citation needed] In the 1970s, the species was perceived as a problem for other fisheries in western Norway and the government subsidized a fishery to reduce the stock of the species.",

              "[58][full citation needed] Annual catch of Greenland sharks from the Barents Sea was estimated to be around 1,200 individuals per year.",
              "[57][1] The shark is likely affected by quantity, dynamics, and distribution of Arctic sea ice.",
              "[54] The rate of projected loss of sea ice will continue to negatively influence the abundance, distribution and availability of prey, while, at the same time, providing greater access for fishing fleets.",

              "It was this final statement that really piqued Steffensen\u2019s curiosity.",
              "Upon returning to Denmark, where he is a professor at the University of Copenhagen, he pored through the scientific literature.",
              "He came across a study tracking size of the sharks over decades, and size and age are tightly correlated in fish.",
              "The study showed that one of the sharks grew something like three inches in 16 years.",
              "\u201cIf the sharks grew half a centimeter per year and they can grow up to five meters [15 feet] or more, it doesn\u2019t take a lot of math to calculate that they probably are very old.",

              "Julius Nielsen, then a doctoral student and now a scientist with the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, helped lead the study and gained access to the remains of 28 female Greenland sharks caught by local fishermen, between three and 15 feet in length.",
              "Following Heinemeier\u2019s technique, they extracted the eyes, peeled their outer layers, and scraped the lenses.",
              "\u201cTheir eyeballs are about the size of oranges,\u201d says Steffensen, adding that at that moment he had some in his own freezer.",
              "\u201cAnd your eye lens is built up nearly like an onion: it\u2019s layered on the outside, but in the middle you have the nucleus, and the nucleus has the original carbon.",

              "There could be Greenland sharks alive today, the results suggest, that were born during the Renaissance.",
              "\u201cI think our first response was: \u2018What did we do wrong?",
              "\u2019 No, I mean, seriously, you come up with this number, and you think, \u2018Holy crap, we\u2019ve done something wrong,\u2019\u201d says Peter Bushnell, a biologist at Indiana University South Bend who worked closely with Steffensen and led the analysis.",
              "Among the subtleties they observed was that larger, older sharks grow at an exponentially slower rate than young ones.",
              "So among the largest sharks, a difference of just four inches could represent several decades of life.",
              "The largest shark in the study was more than 16 feet long.",
              "Steffensen knew from personal experience that Greenland sharks could reach 18 feet.",
              "That couple of feet could represent a couple more centuries.",
              "To be fair, Bushnell and Steffensen are sure to say, this kind of extrapolation comes with a high degree of uncertainty.",
              "But if these sharks do indeed live for centuries, it \u201craises all kinds of different questions about cells and cardiovascular function and heart tissue and blood vessels, and, you know, everything,\u201d Bushnell says.",
              "\u201cHow does something live that long?",
              "\u201d After Steffensen and his colleagues published their findings in Science in 2016, this spooky, cadaverous shark became something of a sensation.",

              "Greenland sharks are large, deep-sea creatures that evolved to live in icy-cold temperatures, all of which dials down their metabolism.",
              "Their languid movements and ascetic ability to live off a single seal for nearly a year shows that they are highly energy efficient.",

              "Animals that live slowly reproduce slowly.",
              "It may take around 150 years for them to become sexually mature, so all the bycatch in the fishing industry means that a lot of sharks are dying before they give birth.",
              "A recent study led by Nielsen estimated that Greenland sharks may produce more than 200 pups per pregnancy, up to 20 times more than previously thought.",
              "So while they may offset the difficulty of delayed sexual maturity by having hundreds of pups at a time, it also suggests that survival of the species may rest on a limited population of centuries-old, exceptionally fertile females, says Nielsen.",

              "Once dug up again, the flesh is cut into large pieces and dried in the open air for 4-5 months before being cut into small cubes to be eaten with a toothpick.",
              "There are many descriptions of what Hakarl is like to eat, it's one of those foods that brings people out in inventive turns of phrase to describe how utterly disgusting it is.",

              "It reminded me somewhat of rather too old and somewhat off stinky cheese, like a piece of stilton or gorgonzola that had gone over the top and while still being edible, you wouldn't choose to eat it (I love stilton and gorgonzola).",

              "It smells much worse than it tastes apparently, but I missed that part out as our guide picked it up and popped it quickly in his mouth so I did the same, probably a good move.",
              "In the past when imported foods were much more uncommon than they are now, I can see how the Icelanders with relatively little variety of food that grew or could be caught locally, it would be a welcome addition to what was available, it is becoming less commonly eaten, particularly by the young.",

              "This preliminary estimate accepts that aRMR measured at a specific activity level and temperature is not necessarily representative of the individual\u2019s field metabolic rate but serves to contextualize its low metabolic rate in ecological terms. Furthermore, the consumption of large meals by Greenland sharks combined with their slow metabolism could facilitate life in resource scarce environments, such as the Arctic, and allow this species to maximize the use of seasonally abundant or migratory prey such as marine mammals.",

              "Every print subscription comes with full digital access LONG LIVE SHARKS A Greenland shark (near the surface after being released from a boat) might outdo all other vertebrates in longevity, a new study says.",
              "J.",
              "Nielsen By Susan Milius August 11, 2016 at 2:00 pm The latest in birthday science proposes that the vertebrate with the longest life span yet measured is the mysterious Greenland shark.",
              "Dating based on forms of carbon found in sharks\u2019 eye lenses suggests that a large female Somniosus microcephalus was about 392 years old (give or take 120 years) when she died, says marine biologist Julius Nielsen of University of Copenhagen.",
              "Even with that uncertainty, the shark outdoes what Nielsen considers the previous record holder: a bowhead whale estimated to have lived 211 years.",
              "The dating comes from the first use of eye-lens dating for a fish, Nielsen says.",
              "An analysis that produced the date, involving 27 other Greenland shark specimens, suggests that females don\u2019t reach sexual maturity until they\u2019re about 156 years old, Nielsen and his colleagues report August 12 in Science.",
              "Remarkably little basic biology is known for the Greenland shark, though.",
              "And figuring out the age of these sharks has \u201cstymied all solution attempts,\u201d says Steven Campana of the University of Iceland in Reykjavik.",
              "\u201dGiven that the Greenland shark is one of the largest carnivores in the world and the king of the food chain [in northern waters], it is almost unbelievable that we don\u2019t know if this shark lives to 20 years or to 1,000,\u201d says Campana, who has long studied shark aging but was not part of this research.",
              "Both extremes have been suggested.",
              "Unlike familiar bony fish, such as salmon and cod, sharks don\u2019t have ear bones that build up calcified rings that reveal age.",
              "Some sharks, such as the great whites, have some calcified vertebrae that serve, but the Greenland species is \u201ca soft shark,\u201d Nielsen says.",
              "And it\u2019s an odd-looking one.",
              "He finds that some people are disappointed with their first sight of the big, dark, ponderous beasts because they\u2019re a long way from the stereotype of the great white sharks\u2019 streamlined killer look.",
              "\u201cDefinitely plump,\u201d Nielsen says.",
              "Working with 28 Greenland sharks of different sizes that were accidentally caught during fisheries surveys, Nielsen and his colleagues examined eye lenses.",
              "The highly specialized clear proteins in lenses start with a nugget formed in utero, and studies in mammals have scrutinized that small bit for clues to a creature\u2019s birth date.",
              "Nielsen\u2019s team looked for anomalies in carbon created by the pulse of radioactivity from the 1950s bomb testing in the Pacific Ocean.",
              "Radiocarbons worked their way into, and lingered in, all the food webs on the planet.",
              "The pulse first reached the sharks\u2019 realms in the North Atlantic in the 1960s, the scientific literature indicates.",
              "Nielsen was startled to discover that only three specimens in his collection had the carbon anomalies \u2014 and they were the smaller sharks.",
              "He and colleagues used the size of a shark that appeared to have been born just as the bomb pulse was arriving in the ocean food system as a kind of calibration marker.",
              "Then, in an elaborate statistical analysis, they used size and growth rates to work out ages for the rest.",
              "Campana is skeptical that Greenland sharks can live nearly 400 years.",
              "Other sharks typically live for 10 to 80 years, he says.",
              "\u201cI certainly accept that it grows for more than a century.",
              "\u201d But to crown the Greenland shark a record holder, he is waiting for future research.",
              "Extreme life spans evolve just like polar bear white fur or long giraffe necks to fit into the sum of ways an organism feeds, dodges its predators and reproduces in its environment.",
              "Says James R.",
              "Carey of the University of California, Davis, who studies demography across the tree of life, \u201cthe really deeper question is once you identify a species that\u2019s long-lived \u2014 why?",

              "The scientists think this indicates these two sharks were affected by the bomb pulse.",
              "Unfortunately, due to variability of bomb pulse curves that model its effect on radiocarbon dating, assigning an age to these animals is impossible, though it's likely that they were born later than the early 1960s.",
              "Another shark was found to have a slightly elevated radiocarbon level compared to the other sharks, possibly because it was born close to the onset of the bomb pulse.",

              "This video can not be played Julius Neilsen explains how they used carbon dating on a shark's eye lens to discover the age For some fish, scientists are able to examine ear bones called otoliths, which when sectioned, show a pattern of concentric rings that scientists can count as they would the rings in a tree.",
              "Sharks are harder, but some species, such as the Great White, have calcified tissue that grows in layers on their back bones, that can also be used to age the animals.",
              "\"But the Greenland shark is a very, very soft shark - it has no hard body parts where growth layers are deposited.",
              "So it was believed that the age could not be investigated,\" Mr Nielsen told the BBC.",

              "So we can isolate the tissue that formed when the shark was a pup, and do radiocarbon dating.\"",
              "The team looked at 28 sharks, most of which had died after being caught in fishing nets as by-catch.",
              "Using this technique, they established that the largest shark - a 5m-long female - was extremely ancient.",

              "It means she was born between the years of 1501 and 1744, but her most likely date of birth was in the 17th century.",
              "\"Even with the lowest part of this uncertainty, 272 years, even if that is the maximum age, it should still be considered the longest-living vertebrate,\" said Mr Nielsen.",

              "The team believes the animals only reach sexual maturity when they are 4m-long.",
              "And with this new, very lengthy age-range, it suggests this does not occur until the animals are about 150 years old.",
              "The researchers say this has consequences for future conservation of the animals.",
              "Because of their extreme longevity, Greenland sharks may still be recovering from being over-fished before WW2.",
              "The sharks' livers were once used for machine oil, and they were killed in great numbers before a synthetic alternative was found and the demand fell.",
              "\"When you evaluate the size distribution all over the North Atlantic, it is quite rare that you see sexually mature females, and quite rare that you find newborn pups or juveniles,\" Mr Nielsen explained.",

          "This is equivalent to a daily maintenance ration of only 164 g (95% CI 155\u2013173 g) of Greenland halibut, 61 g (95% CI 57\u201364 g) of ringed seal or 86 g (95% CI 81\u201391 g) of narwhal while the sharks are resident in the fjords during the late summer/autumn, or 193 g (95% CI 182\u2013203 g), 71 g (95% CI 67\u201375 g) or 101 g (95% CI 95\u2013107 g), respectively, when considering their mean energy needs for the entire year.",
          "Furthermore, the consumption of large meals by Greenland sharks combined with their slow metabolism could facilitate life in resource scarce environments, such as the Arctic, and allow this species to maximize the use of seasonally abundant or migratory prey such as marine mammals.",
          "As Greenland sharks are a lethargic polar species, these low FMR estimates, and corresponding prey consumption estimates, suggest they require very little energy to sustain themselves under natural conditions.",
          "Conversely, a large and slow moving ectothermic predator such as the Greenland shark, requiring much less energy to fuel its metabolism, may be able to survive extended periods of time between feeding events (Furey et al., 2016), allowing it to thrive in areas with scarce or unpredictable resource availability, and possibly accounting for a presumably much lower success rate in cases of active predation (Norberg, 1977)."
