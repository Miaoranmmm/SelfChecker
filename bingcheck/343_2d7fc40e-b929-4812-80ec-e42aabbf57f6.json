    "query": "What is the most effective way to promote sustainable agriculture practices, and what practices have been shown to have a positive impact on the environment and food security while also being economically viable for farmers?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. Sustainable agriculture practices are methods of producing food and fiber that seek to protect the environment, maintain or improve soil fertility, and enhance quality of life for farmers and communities[^1^]. Some of the most effective sustainable agriculture practices are[^1^] [^4^]:\n\n- **Crop rotation**: This is the practice of growing different crops on the same piece of land in a sequential manner. Crop rotation can help prevent soil erosion, pest infestation, weed growth, and nutrient depletion, as well as increase crop yield and diversity[^1^].\n- **Agroforestry**: This is the practice of integrating trees and shrubs with crops and livestock on the same land. Agroforestry can provide multiple benefits such as enhancing soil fertility, water conservation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and income diversification[^1^].\n- **Cover crops**: These are crops that are planted between main crops or after harvest to cover and protect the soil. Cover crops can help reduce soil erosion, suppress weeds, improve soil structure and organic matter, fix nitrogen, and provide fodder for animals[^1^].\n- **Mixed cropping**: This is the practice of growing two or more crops together on the same piece of land. Mixed cropping can help increase crop productivity, resilience, and diversity, as well as reduce pest and disease incidence, weed growth, and fertilizer use[^1^].\n- **Permaculture**: This is a design system that mimics natural ecosystems and aims to create sustainable human settlements. Permaculture can help optimize land use, conserve resources, recycle waste, enhance biodiversity, and promote social harmony[^1^].\n\nThese practices have been shown to have a positive impact on the environment and food security while also being economically viable for farmers. For example, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), sustainable agriculture can help increase profitable farm income, promote environmental stewardship, enhance quality of life for farm families and communities, increase production for human food and fiber needs, protect the environment and expand the natural resource base, sustain the economic viability of agriculture systems, and mitigate and adapt to climate change[^2^] [^3^]. However, there are also some challenges and barriers to implementing these practices, such as lack of knowledge, skills, resources, incentives, policies, markets, and infrastructure[^2^] [^3^]. Therefore, there is a need for more research, education, extension, innovation, collaboration, and support to promote sustainable agriculture practices worldwide[^2^] [^3^].

              "Many agricultural areas rely on simple flooding, or surface irrigation, as the principle means of irrigation.",
              "However, flooding often inundates fields with more water than crops require, and significant amounts of water are lost to evaporation or during transportation from the water source.",
              "Some sustainable farmers seek to implement reduced-volume irrigation, which provides slow streams of water to meet the water needs of specific crops while lessening water waste.",

              "The incentive to improve the productivity of smallholders\u2019 farmland through area expansion is confined, and farmers are hesitant to diversify crops due to modest outputs from diverse specified crops, given the expanding population versus the subsequent fragmentation of land size and depletion of natural resources [30].",
              "According to [31], farmers with more and smaller plots prefer employing fewer current technologies, monocropping, and decreasing the average distance between plots, while an increase in farm size improves the farmer\u2019s interest in picking diverse crops with rotation, lowering the overall cost of production per unit.",

              "The pathogen cycle is disrupted by rotations that result in the growth of a plant belonging to a different family, as the pathogen cannot infect a plant belonging to a different family.",
              "As a result, the pathogen population in the soil rapidly declines.",
              "Consider the seven-year diverse crop rotation period, which includes three years of alfalfa, two years of chile pepper, and two years of cotton before returning to alfalfa.",
              "Alfalfa, chile, and cotton are three plants that correspond to a variety of crops.",
              "These three plants\u2014alfalfa, chile, and cotton\u2014belong to different crop families, so they can help break the disease cycle and boost productivity [38, 39].",
              "By breaking the pest cycle, lowering weeds and illnesses, improving soil quality, and safeguarding the ecosystem, the DCR aids in pest management [40].",
              "By shortening the life cycles of soil-borne pathogens aligned with a species plant or crop genotype, the DCR offers a good chance for the development of certain soil-functional microorganisms [41].",
              "For example, different genotypes of chickpeas (cultivars) or rotating vegetative crops (such as pea and chickpea) can affect the microbial functionality of the soil as well as the performance of pulse crops and subsequent wheat crops [42].",
              "Various plant species, in particular, can produce residues and root exudates that improve the diversity and efficiency of the soil\u2019s microbial population as well as soil C and N cycling [17, 36, 43].",
              "The goal of DCR implementation is to increase the microbial population and soil heterogeneity [35].",
              "Different microbes interact with different plant roots, promoting soil quality with a wider spectrum of soil microbiomes [44].",
              "Diversified crop rotation approaches as cover crops sown between both forms of cash crops integrate root exudates and biomass to maintain the physicochemical composition of soil erosion.",
              "Through the creation and secretion or emergence of rhizosphere, root and associated hyphal interaction or degradation stabilizing and destabilizing components, and the creation of resilient biopores, the root and remnants of these plant parts may impact numerous elements in preserving soil quality.",
              "The study in [45] reported small and inconsistent differences in soil watertable and bulk aggregates accompanying the use of crops like wheat or lupin in South Australia.",
              "Similarly, the work in [46] found that following canola and lupin cropping;",
              "the soil was more permeable and had decreased soil hardness.",
              "After harvesting diversified crop peas and barley and after their roots were accounted for the accumulation of soils and the production of macropore, the soil has solid and more permanent particles.",
              "It is worth noting that the non-AMF (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) hosts are both lupin and canola, which makes it difficult to interpret changes in cumulative stabilization supporting glomalin development by the matching AMF [47] regarding the recent history of other crops.",
              "Furthermore, certain nonmycorrhizal plant species, such as canola and mustard, may be unable to form symbiotic relationships with a specific rhizobacterial characteristic as more chemical fertilizer is required, thus altering the physiological soil structure and fertility in the near future [48].",
              "It is self-evident that soil with perfect physical, chemical, and biological features improves soil quality in the farming system.",
              "For example, a wheat-pulse crop rotation can improve soil conditions and increase system productivity [49\u201351].",
              "The authors of [52\u201355] found that a four-year wheat-fallow field pea (Pisum sativum) rotation provided enough cover to prevent soil deterioration by conserving the land\u2019s physical structure.",

              "Diversified cropping schemes, for example, improve water use efficiency and grain production by combining cereals with broadleaf crops [57].",
              "According to two global studies conducted by [24, 56, 58], crop rotation diversification or better crop rotation has been linked to higher soil organic carbon (SOC) levels than monoculture [59, 60].",
              "In general, the crop rotation system\u2019s different abundance, uniformity, and dispersion of crop residues contribute to higher soil enzyme activity than the crop rotation system [61].",
              "High soil component quality has been shown to have a positive impact on crop productivity [62].",
              "Farmers can improve management of weed, insect, and disease , reduce soil depletion, and promote SOC and nitrogen fixation in agricultural production processes by farming different crops in the same location (crop rotation).",
              "For example, in two current long-term rotational tests of consistent corn, consistent soybean, corn-soybean, and corn-soybean-wheat rotation, the most diversified rotation of corn-soybean-wheat rotation increased the organic carbon capacity of the soil by 7% compared to consistent soybean, and rotational and tilling interactions with soil organic carbon were 7% greater than standard farming [22].",
              "The mutual retention or enhancement of these plants\u2019 output capacities can provide an extra benefit [32, 63].",
              "By adopting a wider variety of crops, SOC sequestration, soil composition, and texture can be enhanced while production is enhanced, reducing soil and environmental damage [49, 56, 64].",
              "By replacing fallow periods with growing different crops that replenish soil nutrients, crop rotation has helped to increase productivity.",
              "Crop rotation also aids in the fight against erosion forces.",
              "The agronomic impact of crop rotation is given in Table 2.",
              "Long before the development of the current farming system, its economic and ecological value was recognized.",

              "Crop diversification is one of the most cost-effective solutions to reduce income instability among farmers, especially among impoverished smallholders [73].",
              "To prevent production risks or control limited resources when seeding or harvesting, farmers frequently employ this strategy by picking diversified crops preceded by crop rotation.",
              "The latest data of the economic net return from crop rotations in the Midwest United States shows that increasing land efficiency reduces outside investments while increasing crop yields [74].",
              "Farmers can get significant concrete benefits from alfalfa-containing crop rotations while minimizing the risk of herbicide-resistant enormous ragweed pests, according to the results of the stochastic study [75].",
              "DCR is linked to increased production of various agricultural inputs as well as a systemic economic transformation in which farm contracts account for a greater part of GDP [76].",
              "Continued financial crises, quick demand fluctuations, and increased technological breakthroughs provide a clear incentive to diversify crops, lowering risk in the agricultural system.",
              "Numerous researchers, including [77] in Zimbabwe, [78] in El Salvador and Honduras, and [79] in the Brazilian Amazon, have found a significant beneficial relationship between crop diversification rotations and total agricultural productivity for the full year.",
              "According to [77], increased production from a diverse crop rotation system results in higher revenue for farmers throughout the year.",
              "Similarly, [78] showed an average increase of 21% in farm income across all samples in the study, while [79] found a generally positive relationship between diversification and income in the Brazilian Amazon.",
              "Furthermore, the integration of different crops in the same area could raise farmers\u2019 income and stabilize them [80, 81].",
              "In parts of the world where diverse cropping is a common element of agroecosystem management, productivity is usually far more robust and consistent throughout time [66, 82].",
              "In comparison to standard double-crop rotations, the DCR field study in the Iowa region between 2003 and 2011 found that crop output has improved, agricultural inputs have dropped, and weeds have decreased.",
              "When compared to a single system, using a varied crop rotation strategy can have a synergistic effect, resulting in enhanced rewards [58].",
              "In crop rotation, the availability of nutrients from the soil provides ample nourishment to all plants, ensuring that the yield produced is successful.",
              "Multiyear crop rotations, which require fewer commercial fertilizers and additional agricultural inputs including fertilizer and crop nutrient recycling, banded fertilizer application, and chemical pest control inputs, can help reduce reliance on external inputs [83].",
              "Adoption of DCR in a specific sequence, such as corn-soybean-wheat-oats, corn-soybean-wheat, corn-soybean-wheat, corn-soybean-oats, and cover crops, helps to maintain soil health by reducing the use of chemical fertilizers.",
              "Crimson clover, annual ryegrass, oats, cereal rye, and oil-seed radishes are examples of cover crops that can improve soil structure, improve soil organic matter, enhance water percolation, suppress weeds, reduce soil erosion, and fix residual nitrogen after grain harvest [84].",
              "These positive cover crop effects can boost farm profitability by lowering expenses (e.",
              "g., by reducing the need for commercial fertilizers) or increasing production (by improving soil quality and fertility).",
              "In Michigan, for example, [85] found that using cover crops in a corn-soybean-wheat rotation reduced nitrate leaching while maintaining profitability.",
              "As a result, integrating varied crop rotation benefits farmers by reducing their reliance on external inputs, resulting in financial gains.",
              "Therefore, the implementation of diversified crop rotation enables farmers to reduce the resilience of external inputs, supporting them with economic benefits.",
              "Due to a lack of essential investments in machines, infrastructures, and expertise, as well as research proof, DCR measures are rarely applied [72, 86\u201390].",
              "One of the most significant challenges to the adoption of this strategy is financial, as integrating extra crops into normal rotations may require farmers to make significant up-front investments, such as in new machinery, and impose an additional short-term cost.",
              "Furthermore, most farmers who rent farmland from others have short-term contracts that do not allow for long-term planning or incentives for soil or production development.",
              "Lack of experience, limited financing access for investment, and lack of technological support and knowledge by stakeholders and farmers have all been identified as important barriers to adopting diversified crop rotation [89, 91].",
              "Furthermore, the scarcity of markets is widely acknowledged in the form of impediments to extending rotations of varied crops, with some farmers participating in biomass markets, albeit these markets are currently quite regulated [89].",
              "Despite the potential benefits of conservation agriculture, such as diversified crop rotation for enhanced crop yields, soil health through minimizing soil erosion, water-use efficiency, and other factors, its adoption rate is low.",
              "Access to information issues and a lack of understanding can stymie broader adoption [68].",
              "Furthermore, due to inadequate budget allocation, the inadequacy of mobility, outmoded knowledge, understaffing, and low staff morale, the basic impediments to the application of new conservation methods are communication skills and technological diffusion [92].",
              "Crop insurance and credit limits are other significant barriers to this approach\u2019s adoption, as lenders unfamiliar with the profitability potential of longer cycles with varied cropping systems are sometimes put off by complex rotations and are hesitant to issue loans in this sector.",
              "Farmers usually need assurance that new methods are feasible, can be effectively implemented in their locations, and can benefit their bottom line.",
              "Similarly, the DCR adoption is hampered by a lack of reinforcement and institutional coordination that involves both public and private institutions, a lack of investment and apprehension about production risk, and a lack of strategy studies that address dissemination and implementation.",
              "Apart from these, climate issues, technological adaptation problems in DCR, model farmer development, exposure and exhibition, and demonstration limitations are the principal roadblocks to DCR adaptation on a larger and broader scale [89, 93].",
              "Because the DCR concept is a relatively new system among farming communities, they may be hesitant to adopt it due to concerns about economic loss from the newly chosen rotation compared to their old rotation of fewer crops that they have been familiar with for a long time.",
              "Diversified crop rotations are becoming more popular as a tool for maintaining sustainable crop production as people are becoming more concerned about the need to provide high-quality food with minimal environmental impact.",
              "DCR encourages beneficial soil microbes and their interactions, breaks the disease cycle, and reduces the number of weeds.",
              "DCR improves the physical and chemical properties of soil and increases land-use efficiency and crop productivity.",
              "It is a valuable practice for long-term profitability.",
              "Farmers require diversified crop rotations that are flexible and economic in order to respond to market demands.",
              "Policy and organizational supports are needed to adopt diversified crop rotation practices at the farmer\u2019s level.",
              "The scientific community should focus their current and future research strategies and efforts on developing better-diversified crop rotation practices that are adaptable to changing climatic conditions.",

              "Although the modern concept of agroforestry emerged in the early 20th century, the use of woody perennials in agricultural systems is ancient, with written descriptions of the practice dating back to Roman times (see perennial agriculture).",

              "Additionally, the area devoted to each crop should be consistent from year to year, with enough elasticity built into the rotation plan.",
              "Depending on the soil type, more or less fertile, low-lying, acidic, or alkaline soils, the rotation plan should stress the importance of crop rotation.",
              "The importance, location of the farm, and region-based crops should also be considered in the rotation plan.",
              "Finally, legumes should be included in the crop rotation with non-legumes as it is a multi-advantageous crop.",
              "Legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen, cover the land to prevent soil erosion and smother weeds, making them an excellent addition to any crop rotation plan.",
              "In conclusion, mixed cropping and intercropping are effective agricultural practices that offer a range of benefits and challenges.",
              "Mixed cropping involves growing two or more crops together on the same piece of land, providing advantages such as pest and disease control, increased productivity, and food security.",
              "However, it also requires careful management to address competition and differences in crop morphology.",
              "Intercropping, on the other hand, focuses on growing multiple crops in close proximity to optimize resource utilization and yield.",
              "It allows for efficient nutrient utilization, reduces the risk of crop failure, and provides a diverse range of food items. Nevertheless, intercropping can lead to competition for space and nutrients, and controlling pests, diseases, and weeds may be more challenging.",

              "In practice, permaculture aims to raise food and use the land in a supportable, nondestructive manner, and it often extends into a philosophy that prescribes a way of living.",
              "Adhering to this ethical framework can be achieved through combining several tenets of design and engineering with thoughtful land use, recycling, gardening with crop rotation and rainwater harvesting, renewable energy use, and low-impact livestock farming.",
              "Bruce Charles (\u201cBill\u201d) Mollison, an Australian biogeography and environmental psychology professor, coined the term permaculture, a portmanteau of permanent and agriculture, in 1978.",
              "As of the early 21st century, permaculture was practiced by more than three million people in 140 countries.",
              "The goal of permaculture is responsible production and land stewardship and sustainable agriculture.",
              "Those who practice permaculture argue that by shifting their focus toward production and limiting consumption, people can reduce their own ecological impact on the land, the food system, and the energy grid and extend Earth\u2019s limited natural resources for future generations, with the added benefit of maintaining plant and animal habitats.",
              "Practitioners note that living according to such a philosophy can be applied on a large scale.",
              "For example, planned real estate developments can be designed as ecovillages\u2014that is, planned communities with dwellings built and operated with sustainable materials, renewable energy resources, and centrally located farms or community-supported gardens.",
              "Permaculture can also be applied on an individual scale, with small garden plots in suburban backyards.",
              "Some of the ideas of permaculture involve combining sustainable architecture and agroforestry with garden planning that includes companion and succession planting, soil fertility monitoring, rotational grazing, and incorporating renewable energy, such as using animal manure as the feedstock for a biogas digester.",
              "Wherever possible, various elements in the design should serve multiple functions.",
              "Raising chickens, for example, can provide eggs, meat, pest control, and soil enrichment: as they range throughout the garden, the birds dig, scratch, and till the soil, and their waste is a good source of nitrogen, which can be composted for use as fertilizer.",
              "Closed-loop agriculture, or zero-waste farming, is often cited as a goal of permaculture\u2014by returning all the materials and nutrients used to produce plants and animals for human consumption to the soil, usually through composting or feeding plant excess to animals.",
              "This ensures that the soil stays healthy and will be able to produce crops in the future.",
              "Critics of permaculture point out that it is unreasonable to expect most people\u2014especially those in densely populated areas\u2014to have the space, equipment, and time to raise their own food.",
              "In addition, some aspects of permaculture may be difficult to apply on an individual scale within an urban centre, such as human-waste composting projects, which may run afoul of municipal codes.",
              "Some elements\u2014such as aquaculture or biogas digester systems\u2014have start-up costs that can be prohibitively expensive.",
              "Some critics also note that high labour requirements and the prospect of lower crop yields may make permaculture inefficient economically, especially when competing with contemporary large-scale resource-intensive industrial farming (see also intensive agriculture).",
              "Mollison and David Holmgren, a graduate student at the University of Tasmania, first conceptualized permaculture and established the movement\u2019s principles in their book Permaculture One in 1978.",
              "In his research, Mollison observed patterns of interplay between human beings, agriculture, and the environment\u2014inspired by the way Indigenous and Aboriginal subsistence farmers worked in harmony with nature, which stood in contrast to modern industrial agriculture.",

              "It is estimated that global food production needs to increase by at least 50 percent during this decade to ensure the planet\u2019s growing population is adequately fed.",
              "However, we must do so sustainably, moving beyond yield- or output-centric metrics, and embracing a long-term, holistic approach to food production \u2013 one that also takes into account the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability.",
              "Drivers of unsustainability Unsustainability in agriculture and food systems is driven by a variety of factors.",
              "These include the growing demand for food, the need to create an income and livelihoods, the reliance on outdated approaches or technologies, all of which can lead to overuse of natural resources, causing phenomena such as deforestation, loss of biodiversity and increased greenhouse gas emissions.",
              "Over time, these practices can eventually result in a decline in yields, lower incomes, reduced resilience to shocks and increased food insecurity, in particular among the most vulnerable communities.",
              "Climate change and agriculture: A complex relationship Climate change further complicates the situation, both because of the unprecedented threat it poses to life on the planet, and because of its intricate relationship with agriculture.",
              "In fact, while agriculture sectors are among the hardest hit by the effects of climate change and climate variability, they are also a key driver behind climate change itself.",
              "Widespread, unsustainable food production practices over the decades have been major contributors to the climate crisis we are experiencing today.",
              "By eradicating unsustainable food and agriculture systems, we can unlock a virtuous circle that benefits the environment, curbs the impacts of climate change and helps sustainably increase production to feed the world.",
              "The challenges to countries Adapting to the challenges posed by climate change, an ever-growing population, and a degraded natural resource base requires major transitions in food production systems. The transformative nature of the SDGs, which seek to address those challenges, demands a profound shift away from current unsustainable approaches \u2013 one that must embrace and engage local communities as well as national governments.",
              "Farmers, fishers, herders and other food producers must be made aware of, and benefit from, the latest methodologies and tools that can help them sustainably increase production and safeguard natural resources.",
              "While a variety of data has been gathered, and methodologies and tools conceived to drive such transitions, governments and local stakeholders can find it challenging to use them for decision making and policy formulation, and assessing which options are the most suitable for their specific context.",
              "When we consider that agriculture has a key role to play in achieving a broad set of SDGs, it is a challenge to create integrated systems that achieve optimal co-benefits and reduce trade-offs.",
              "Furthermore, countries\u2019 capacities, and the traditional knowledge base they could rely on in the past, are increasingly inadequate in the face of the disruption caused by climate change.",
              "Climate change proofing and the enhancement of resilience to current and future shocks are therefore imperative.",

              "Led by the FAO Strategic Programme for sustainable agriculture, the project will assist farmers by providing guidance in selecting the best approaches to address their specific challenges.",
              "At the national level, the tools will facilitate the selection of optimal transitions to more productive and more sustainable agriculture and the establishment of the needed policy and enabling environment for local stakeholders.",
              "Furthermore, the project will develop a stronger evidence base by considering the trade-offs and synergies within the context of sustainable agriculture and will ensure relevant tools are accessible to policy-makers, decision-makers and communities, to inform action in support of sustainability transitions.",
              "These tools include guidance materials for governments, such as a manual detailing practical steps to design or update policies that can facilitate the transition to SFA.",
              "A mobile application is also being developed under the project: leveraging global, regional and national data where possible, and integrating them with context-specific, farm-level information, the app will facilitate assessment, planning and decision making through an intuitive user-friendly interface.",
              "Data itself are a core element of the project: the collection, analysis and sharing of data and information relevant to production and sustainability in agriculture are essential to the formulation of effective strategic plans by countries.",
              "Through the project, decision-makers and stakeholders, including governments and farmers alike, will enhance their ability to assess the sustainability and productivity of their current systems, and identify suitable, sustainable solutions to the challenges they face, spurring progress towards the SDGs.",

The aim is to optimize diverse production while restoring the biological and social integrity of rural communities and linkages to urban centers.",
              "These regional approaches are emerging in areas where conventional agriculture has diminished due to consolidation trends, shifting markets and loss of farm infrastructure.",
              "They are embraced by conventional farmers attuned to new direct-to-market opportunities and young people new to farming, driven by a desire to create wholesome and meaningful lifestyles.",
