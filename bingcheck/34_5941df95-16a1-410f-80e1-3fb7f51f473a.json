    "response": "That's an interesting question. There is great variety in dance in the United States of America, as it reflects the diverse influences of its society and culture. Some of the dance forms that originated or developed in the United States are hip hop, salsa, swing, tap dance, rock and roll, and modern square dance[^2^]. These dances are usually associated with social dance practice, entertainment, or performance.\n\nOne of the sources of dance in the United States is the Native American dances, which played an important role in social and religious life. Native American dances were a form of expressing national or tribal loyalty, communicating with the spirits, and bonding with the community. These dances have survived and continue to preserve an important part of the history and identity of the Native Americans[^2^].\n\nAnother source of dance in the United States is the folk dances that evolved from the life and conditions of the early colonists and settlers. According to one study[^1^], there are four distinctive regional types of American folk dances: New England Country Dances, Appalachian Mountain Dances, the Mid-West and Mid-South Play Party Games, and the country-wide Square Dances. These dances reflect the origins and influences of the immigrants who came from different countries, especially from Ireland and Scotland[^1^].\n\nThese are some examples of the history and cultural significance of traditional dances in the United States. Of course, there are many more dance forms and styles that have contributed to the rich and diverse dance scene in this country.",

              "Dances such as the Black Bottom, Charleston, Shag, and Tap Dance travelled north with Dixieland jazz to New York, Kansas City, and Chicago in the Great Migration (African American) of the 1920s, where rural blacks travelled to escape persecution, Jim Crow laws, lynching and unemployment in the South (during the Great Depression).",

              "Elsewhere, religious dance societies were based on age grades, as in the male warrior societies of the northern Plains.",
              "Some of these societies crossed local and even tribal boundaries, as in the extremely complex organization of Mexico\u2019s concheros, whose intertribal hierarchy runs from a capita\u0301n general de la conquista de Tenochtitla\u0301n through various local commanders and military ranks with specific duties to the attendant devil, sorcerers, and mythological figures.",
              "The concheros\u2019 claim to an Aztec heritage is given considerable credence despite some Spanish mixture.",
              "In the organization of, and participation in, dance according to priestly or social status, the earlier Aztec dances were images of the completely theocratic government.",
              "A far cry from the democratic customs of the Iroquois, the circumscribed ceremonial roles of Aztec actor-dancers reflected the social structure comprising priests, nobles and warriors, commoners, serfs, and slaves.",
              "The priestly and noble-warrior classes took active roles in the many festivals of the Aztec calendar, and the priests trained noble youths for the priesthood or in dancing and singing.",
              "Warrior youths performed ceremonial combat, and the warrior orders of the eagle and of the ocelot fought captive slaves during certain festivals.",
              "Both commoners and serfs constituted the audiences, the former sometimes doing serpent dances with the nobility, the latter sometimes ceremonially attacked and routed by the priests.",
              "There were age roles and gender roles as well, but the slaves, captives of sacred war with other city-states or purchased in the marketplace, as victims, had a passive role in the ceremonial activities.",
              "Opposites played dramatically against one another in these rites: nobles and commoners, old and young, male and female.",
              "The warrior orders symbolized the clash of the sky and light with the earth and darkness, and, as aggressors against poorly armed captives, they enacted the drama of sacrificer and victim.",
              "It was the priests and the passive slaves, however, who played the supreme moment of the ritual.",
              "The circle of social gradations was closed as the highest and the lowest ranks performed together the most crucial act of the Aztec dance-drama, human sacrifice."

              "In what is now Nunavut on the west coast of Hudson Bay in Canada, communal feasting, dancing, singing, games, and shamanistic performances took place within a circle of bones or one of stones.",

              "As this dance is the Ground work of all other dancing, I thought it my duty to recommend ye knowledge of it.",
              "The menuet ordinaire or ballroom minuet was the chief dance of ceremony and ritual.",
              "Devised in the 1660s for the French court, it was a dramatic and powerful dance.",
              "Using one of several standard step-sequences and a specific floor pattern, it left some latitude for individualization through ornamentation.",
              "Alone on the floor with their concentration on each other and moving with four steps in six beats, two dancers move on a symmetrical track using the entire dance space.",
              "Honors to partner and the company open and close the dance.",
              "The remainder of the dance consists of parallel passes across the floor and one- and two-hand turns.",
              "The minuet has a complex basic step, but it is not a string of different steps as in other composed dances like gavottes or allemandes.",
              "The challenge of the minuet is the smooth execution with one\u2019s partner, something akin to ice-dancing.",
              "It is hard to do so that it looks easy, which, of course, is the desired effect.",
              "The minuet became a ritual of the ballroom for the entire eighteenth century.",
              "A symbol of precedence and power, the first minuet was performed by the leading man and most important lady present while the rest of the company watched.",
              "It served to remind everyone of his or her position within the group.",
              "Balls at court often consisted of nothing but minuets as the clamor to be seen attracted more and more dancers.",
              "In America, minuets opened most formal occasions, the Governor, senior military officer, leading merchant, or the host of the event dancing with the most senior ladies present.",
              "That the minuet was daunting echoes from account after account of frightened dancers, trembling knees, and laughable performances.",
              "It is no wonder that everyone relaxed when the minuets were over and the country dances could begin.",
              "The best-documented group dance of the period is the eighteenth-century version of the English country dance, arranged for \u201cas many couples as will\u201d standing in lines, partner-facing partner.",
              "The figures of over 25,000 dances were published with their music in English books between 1700 and 1830 and many more in Ireland and Scotland and Holland.",
              "The figures for over 2,800 dances appear in American collections handmade or published between 1730 and 1810.",
              "Most of these dances appear to be of English origin or inspiration;",
              "several of the collections are direct copies of English books.",
              "Democratic rather than hierarchical, each country dance is constructed so that after one repetition of the figures, the leading couple is in second place and repeats the figures with the next one or two couples.",
              "This progression continues down through the entire line and back up, until the leading couple is again at the top and each couple in the set has had a turn leading the dance.",
              "Before 1680, Americans probably danced earlier forms of the English country dance using familiar renaissance steps: the single, the double, and perhaps some steps from the galliard for the more energetic.",
              "Once the new French technique was introduced, the basic step became a smooth pas de bourre\u0301e, with a demi-coupe\u0301 for setting and honors.",
              "Optional steps included pas de rigaudon (rigadoon), assemble\u0301, balance\u0301, chasse\u0301, contretemps, and pas de gavotte (Keller 18\u201320).",
              "For most occasions, deportment and performance style was still formal and presentational.",
              "Despite the informal-sounding name, country dances were not undisciplined romps.",
              "At a ball or dancing party, the top couple in the set selected the dance.",
              "They not only had to know how the dance figures fit the music, but were responsible for selecting steps appropriate for the abilities of the dancers present, and, by their performance of the first round, the phrasing of steps and figures to the music, a daunting responsibility.",
              "Calling the figures as the dance progressed was not an American invention as is often claimed.",
              "In 1752 Nicholas Dukes suggests that the top couple might recite the names of the figures when they selected the dance of their choice (Dukes iv).",
              "Public prompting was used in the late 1770s in London by Francis Werner who played on the harp and directed the figures at the same time (Werner title page).",
              "It did not become a wide-spread practice until the nineteenth century when the dancers no longer selected the dances to be performed and dance events drew less homogeneous companies.",
              "Several other types of dance appeared in early American ballrooms, promoted by dancing masters to hold their pupils\u2019 interest and by fashionable dancers who wished to keep one step ahead of the crowd.",
              "In the 1680s, possibly inspired by the English country dance and using many of the same figures, French dancing masters developed another type of country dance, terming it contredanse.",
              "For the next hundred years, as the English longways progressive dance with increasingly simpler figures became the favorite of middle-class ballrooms, the French type developed into a more and more complex, non-progressive dance, usually in closed set formation, suitable for the most elite dancers.",
              "Lacking a clear notation system and, unlike the English country dance, too complicated to transmit in words, these did not become widely fashionable at first.",
              "In the 1760s, La Cuisse perfected a system of depicting the figures graphically and these interesting and challenging dances began to appear in print.",
              "Almost immediately, English dancers adopted a fairly basic type of French contredanse, the cotillon, anglicized as \u201ccotillion.",
              "\u201d This dance was usually but not always performed in a square of four couples.",
              "A cotillion consisted of a number of standard verses called \u201cchanges\u201d followed by a chorus that was distinctive to that particular dance.",
              "The changes were movements such as circles, hand-turns, hands-across, allemande turns, and rights-and-lefts (chain).",

              "It is interesting to note that the longways English country dance type has remained in use to the present in New England, having been the fashionable group dance when much of that area was settled.",
              "In contrast, the cotillion was at its height of fashion in urban ballrooms between 1780 and 1810, a period during which many European migrants arrived in eastern cities, and many others left for new homes over the mountains.",
              "Ironically, it was the cotillion that was carried west and was the basis of traditional American square dancing, recently declared our \u201cnational folk dance\u201d and far more associated with cowboy culture than the French ballrooms that gave it birth.",

              "There was the complete disapproval of those who saw only its inherent licentiousness, but from others came at least a tacit toleration of the obviously irrepressible urge to dance.",
              "The South, more heavily populated by colonists with aristocratic backgrounds, was generally more inclined to dance than the North, where religious fervour had motivated much of the migration from England.",
              "But what was allowed and even encouraged in Connecticut was strictly forbidden in Massachusetts.",
              "The general consensus was apparently that dancing in itself was not bad, but that no punishment could be severe enough for what was regarded as lascivious dancing.",
              "The Quakers, who had settled mainly in Pennsylvania, were very much against dancing, and in 1706 they complained bitterly about a dancing and fencing school being tolerated in Philadelphia.",
              "They feared that the school\u2019s teachings would tend to corrupt their children.",
              "Nonetheless, Playford\u2019s The English Dancing Master was by no means unknown in America.",
              "There were also dancing masters and dancing mistresses to instruct in and lead the dances that had been brought from the Old World.",
              "There were society balls in the cities along the coast, and on the inland frontiers the settlers of the widely scattered farmsteads often came together for exuberant feasting and social dancing.",
              "Here dancing was considered a socializing virtue expressed in this anonymous observation: I really know among us of no custom which is so useful and tends so much to establish the union and the little society which subsists among us.",
              "Poor as we are, if we have not the gorgeous balls, the harmonious concerts, the shrill horn of Europe, yet we delight our hearts as well with the simple negro fiddle.",
              "What the colonists saw of American Indian dancing they found very strange and primitive, and there was virtually no exchange of dancing customs between the groups.",
              "The situation differed, however, with regard to the Black slaves, who in the 17th century had brought their own songs and dances from their native lands in Africa.",
              "During religious holidays in New Amsterdam, Blacks danced in the streets to the musical accompaniment of three-stringed fiddles and drums constructed from eel pots and covered with sheep-skins.",
              "Dutch families joined in the festivities.",
              "When New Amsterdam became New York, however, the English discouraged dancing between whites and Blacks;",
              "Blacks went on to develop the characteristic dance style that would so deeply affect social dancing in the 19th and 20th centuries.",
              "Early in the 18th century, rather rough theatrical entertainments, acts of acrobatic skill or pantomimes in which dances played an increasing role, began to spread through the American colonies.",
              "These often amateurish showings got a mighty boost when the first professional companies came from Europe, about the middle of the century, to perform plays and harlequinades with incidental dances.",
              "The age of the minuet was followed by that of the waltz.",
              "As the French Revolution approached, the minuet, a form that exuded the essence of earlier decades, died a natural death.",
              "The English country dances, expressing the self-satisfaction of the bourgeoisie, fared little better.",
              "The young people, whose preferences led the way in creating new forms, had lived through the revolutionary events of the 1780s and \u201990s.",
              "They now looked to dance as a way to unleash deeper emotion, to satisfy the needs of body and soul, and to mobilize more vital and dynamic expression than that permitted by the sober and decorous rules of the dancing masters.",
              "The overflow of feeling and the striving for horizons broader than those understood by the traditional canons of French Rationalism were among the factors that generated the Romantic movement in the arts of Europe.",
              "This new direction was clearly expressed in the waltz, a dance filled with the Dionysian spirit.",
              "Like much of the spirit of the Romantic movement, the waltz was of German origin.",
              "It paralleled the Sturm und Drang movement in German literature, which featured the new forms of prose and poetry by Johann von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller.",
              "One of the most glowing advocates of the waltz was Goethe, who time and again praised it, nowhere more than in his novel Die Leiden des Jungen Werthers (1774;",

              "The waltz started as a turning dance of couples.",
              "It was especially popular in south Germany and Austria, where it was known under such different names as Dreher, La\u0308ndler, and Deutscher.",
              "More than any other dance it appeared to represent some of the abstract values of the new era, the ideals of freedom, character, passion, and expressiveness.",
              "This may explain somewhat its eruption into the limelight of international popularity.",
              "This popularity was scaled in 1787 when it was brought to operatic stage.",
              "Vienna became the city of the waltz, for there it surpassed everything in wild fury.",
              "It swept over national frontiers, and in 1804 the French were reported to be passionately in love with this light, gliding dance.",
              "\u201cA waltz, another waltz\u201d was the common cry from the ballroom floor, for the French could not get enough of the dance.",
              "Some guardians of the public morality disapproved of the \u201cmad whirling\u201d of the waltz and it did not arrive in England until 1812.",
              "At the Prussian court in Berlin it was forbidden until 1818, though Queen Luise had danced it while still a princess in 1794.",
              "The guardians could do no more than delay its total victory, and it conquered the world without sanction of courts, of dancing masters, or of other powers.",
              "After many centuries of leadership, France no longer set the fashions.",
              "In 1819 Carl Maria von Weber\u2019s Invitation to the Dance represented the declaration of love of classical music to the waltz.",
              "Shortly thereafter began the age of the Viennese waltz kings, most notably expressed by the Strauss family.",
              "The waltz sired a great variety of offspring throughout Europe.",
              "Germany developed such variations of the waltz as the schottisch, with turns like those of the waltz.",
              "France had its airy balance valse, and the Americans later on had their Boston waltz, a slower, gliding variant.",
              "About 1840 a serious rival to the waltz emerged in the polka, a Bohemian dance that took its name from the Czech word pu\u030alka, \u201chalf step.",
              "\u201d It was full of fiery vigour.",
              "Another Bohemian folk dance finding favour in the dance halls was the rejdova\u0301k or redowa, while Poland\u2019s mazurka and krakowiak enjoyed great popularity.",
