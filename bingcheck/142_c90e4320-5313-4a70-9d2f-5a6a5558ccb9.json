              "Traditionally the plant breeding has been done by crossing and selection.",
              "However, the traditional breeding methods are labor- and time-intensive.",
              "Genome editing allows targeting and modifying specific DNA sequences [1,2,3,4].",
              "Generally, introducing mutations in the target DNA sequence using genome-editing technologies involves three common steps.",
              "First, an exogenous engineered nuclease consisting of recognition module and nuclease domain recognizes the target DNA sequence.",
              "Then, the engineered nuclease binds to the target DNA sequence and induces double-strand breaks (DSBs) at or in the vicinity of the target site.",
              "The endogenous nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways then repair the DSB.",
              "While NHEJ is an error-prone repair process and often results in the introduction of mutations, such as small insertions and deletions (Indel), HDR results in a precise repair of DSBs [1, 2].",
              "These technologies have been successfully applied in various organisms, including plants [1,2,3].",
              "Three technologies have been developed as major genome-editing technologies [1,2,3].",
              "At first, zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) has been reported as an engineered nuclease.",
              "Secondary, transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) has appeared as a more flexible engineered nuclease.",
              "Finally, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 nuclease (Cas9) has been developed as a more simple and flexible engineered nuclease.",
              "ZFNs and TALENs consist of a sequence-specific DNA binding module and a FokI nuclease domain.",
              "The FokI nuclease domain requires dimerization to become an active nuclease.",
              "Therefore, two modules need to be designed to target closely spaced DNA sequences, allowing dimerization of FokI at the target DNA sequence.",
              "This requirement for dimerization gives specificity to ZFNs and TALENs.",
              "However, in fact, it is expensive and difficult to design active nucleases [1, 3].",
              "By contrast, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is inexpensive, and the experimental design is easy [1,2,3].",
              "The CRISPR/Cas9 system emerged as a genome-editing tool in 2012 [4,5,6].",
              "The simplicity, ease, and high efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system have facilitated its development into the most widely applied genome-editing tool.",
              "The CRISPR/Cas9 system has two major components: Cas9 protein and guide RNA (gRNA).",
              "Cas9 protein is an RNA-dependent DNA endonuclease that forms a complex with gRNA.",
              "The gRNA is a small RNA that contains 20 nt nucleotides complementary to target sequences and is necessary for recruiting Cas9 protein to the target site.",
              "This is the main difference between CRISPR/Cas9 and the other genome-editing technologies, that is, it relies on the DNA-RNA interaction, instead of DNA-protein interaction, for target DNA sequence recognition.",
              "In the case of ZFNs and TALENs that target the specific sequence by DNA\u2013protein interaction, design and expression of two different DNA-binding domains (500\u2013700 amino acid in case of TALEN) are required per target site.",
              "This process is rather laborious.",
              "On the other hand, in the case of CRISPR/Cas9, which uses DNA\u2013RNA interaction, design of an 18\u201320 bp oligonucleotide is all that is required.",
              "This makes it very easy to adapt the CRISPR/Cas9 system for genome editing applications.",
              "To function as a genome editing tool, Cas9 and gRNA have to bind to a specific protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which is a short nucleotide sequence located at the 3\u2032 end of the target sequence.",
              "In the case of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), which is the Cas9 most commonly used for genome editing, the sequence 5\u2032-NGG-3\u2032 is recognized as the PAM.",
              "Unless otherwise mentioned, the genome editing experiments presented in the current review have been done using SpCas9.",
              "Recruitment of Cas9 usually results in DSBs at the target site in the genome, but the unintended changes (off-target effects) have sometimes been induced.",
              "The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been developed for precise genome editing with minimal effects on the genome by enhancing the specificity or avoiding the DSB [2, 3].",
              "Furthermore, when the desired mutant plants were developed, removal of the exogenous transgenes has been evaluated attentively [3].",
              "In this review, we summarized the recent approaches for the targeted manipulation of plant genome using CRISPR/Cas9, focusing on the ones that lead to heritable genome modifications even in the absence of transgenes and on the production of transgene-free plants (null segregants), discussing their advantages and disadvantages, and scope for further development.",
              "We also introduce the newly developed and discovered CRISPR/Cas systems as promising tools for plant genome engineering in the near future.",
              "The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been successfully applied in various plant species.",
              "These include not only model plants, such as Arabidopsis, but also crops, such as rice, tobacco, sorghum, wheat, maize, soybean, tomato, potato, poplar, apple and banana [1, 3].",
              "Calli, leaf discs, protoplasts and flowers have been used as a plant material.",
              "The purpose of the applications includes the enhancement of abiotic or biotic stress resistance, engineering of metabolic pathways and increase of grain yield.",
              "The introduced mutations are inherited by the next generation of plants, indicating that plant genome editing can be used for plant research and the production of useful plants.",
              "An important advantage of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system is the possibility of simultaneously editing multiple target genes [7,8,9].",
              "For example, Zso\u0308go\u0308n et al.",
              ", [7] has targeted six genes in a two-step experimental approach and induced mutations into four genes.",
              "By applying the second round of genome editing experiments, the simultaneous genome editing of six genes were achieved.",
              "This study is also important because they have achieved the de novo domestication of wild tomato by targeting the six loci important for key domestication traits.",
              "The results indicates that multiplex genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to mimic the domestication process during evolution in a short time frame, with implications for a rapid and convenient generation of new plants with desirable traits.",
              "Simultaneous targeting of multiple sites also can induce deletions with defined sizes between target sites [8, 9], which would be useful for the disruption of regulatory sequences and production of knockout mutants whose gene functions were disrupted not by out-of-frame mutations but by the deletion of a certain region.",
              "Gene targeting (GT) by CRISPR/Cas9 is another approach for engineering the plant genome precisely.",
              "GT can be performed via HDR pathway but the HDR efficiency is much lower than NHEJ in plant cells.",
              "To enhance GT efficiency in plants, several approaches have been developed, such as suppressing the NHEJ pathway [10, 11], amplifying donor DNAs using virus replicons [12], and driving Cas9 expression using egg-specific promoters [13].",
              "Recently, Miki et al.",
              "[13] reported a sequential transformation of Arabidopsis for enhanced GT efficiency.",
              "The authors first generated parental lines expressing the Cas9 gene under the control of the egg cell- and early embryo-specific DD45 promoter from Arabidopsis.",
              "They then introduced the donor DNA fragment and gRNA expression vectors into selected parental plants that exhibited high genome-editing activity, by the floral dip method.",
              "In this manner, the authors achieved heritable gene targeting with 5\u201310% efficiency (according to the number of T2Arabidopsis populations examined).",
              "However, further improvements in GT efficiency are needed to increase the efficiency of predictable and precise genome editing.",
              "Despite the various benefits of using CRISPR/Cas9, one of the important associated concerns are off-target effects, i.",
              "e., unintended mutations at unintended sites induced by genome editing.",
              "Several methods have been developed to detect the off-target mutations in vitro and in vivo.",
              "These include SITE-seq [14], Digenome-seq [15], CIRCLE-seq [16], GUIDE-seq [17], and DISCOVER-seq [18].",
              "In parallel, the engineering of Cas9 proteins has been performed to enhance the specificity.",
              "The details will be discussed later.",
              "On the other hand, new types of mutations, which have not been addressed so far, were recently reported.",
              "Kosicki et al.",

              "Although such unexpected large deletions have not yet been reported in plants, the possibility of their occurrence should be taken into account.",
              "DSBs are key events in genome editing, but they carry the risk of genome instability and unpredictable outcomes of DNA repair.",
              "Therefore, approaches to alter the targeted DNA or gene expression without inducing DSBs have been explored.",

              "This variability is due to the diversity of the generated genotypes, resulting from the existence of several base-editable sequences within the typical base-editing window (between positions 3 and 9 of the protospacer region) and unexpected mutations outside the base-editing window [27].",
              "In addition, the ALS gRNA could target the intragenic alleles in all three subgenomes in wheat, expanding the possibility of genotype variability [27].",

              "Achieving more precision to create a specific point mutation or insert a DNA sequence into the genome by exploiting HR, however, is much more challenging to achieve in plants than in other organisms (7).",
              "Insertion of a DNA sequence, referred to as homology-directed repair (HDR), requires the delivery of a DNA repair template along with the CRISPR/Cas components.",
              "However, the efficiency of HDR is low in plants, with only one in 105\u2013104 transformation events, mainly because NHEJ is the primary repair mechanism in plants (12).",

              "The knowledge of the genes and their function are key to determining the type of editing approach that would be best suited for the desired outcome.",

              "Gene editing in plants would not be possible without established methodologies for DNA delivery into cells and the subsequent recovery of modified plants, which forms the basis of genetic engineering.",
              "Plant genetic engineering has been achieved through various methods, including floral dip (20), direct DNA uptake into protoplasts (21), delivery of DNA by biolistics (particle bombardment) (22), and Agrobacterium-mediated techniques (23).",
              "Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages that need to be considered when choosing a delivery approach, because not all methods work, or at least work efficiently enough for all plant species.",
              "For example, the floral dip method, which involves the dipping of flowers at immature stages into a solution of Agrobacterium tumefaciens that contains a gene construct and then harvesting mature seeds, results in recovery of transgenic plants of certain Arabidopsis ecotypes and its close relative, Camelina sativa (20, 24).",
              "However, the floral dip method is not applicable to many plant species, such as those clonally propagated, and it is not consistently reproducible to make it a realistic DNA delivery approach for other species (25).",

              "This is certainly needed for polyploid (more than two sets of chromosomes) species.",
              "There have been reports of successful CRISPR/Cas-mediated mutagenesis of multiple gene copies in several polyploid plant species, including oilseed rape, a tetraploid (26), and wheat, a hexaploid (27).",
              "The first plant genome to be sequenced was Arabidopsis, which serves as a valuable model species, and it took 10 years to complete (28).",
              "However, as sequencing technologies have evolved and improved, the time and cost of sequencing large and complex genomes has decreased, making it more realistic to sequence a larger number of plant genomes (28, 29).",
              "Indeed, many of the genomes of major crop species have been sequenced (30).",
              "However, depending on the plant species, some are more difficult to sequence because of the large genome size, the level of heterozygosity and ploidy (more than two sets of chromosomes), and the amount and structure of repetitive DNA (28).",
              "These characteristics, which complicate sequencing efforts, set plant genomes apart from other organisms. Utilization of CRISPR/Cas-mediated editing relies on both the availability of DNA delivery systems into plant cells as well as genomic resources.",
              "Whereas there might not be genome sequence available for every plant cultivar of interest, a reference genome sequence could be used for gRNA design and selection based on placement near the required PAM for cleavage by the Cas protein.",
              "gRNAs can be designed with this limited genomic information, but possible variations in DNA, such as single polymorphisms (SNPs) that might exist between a reference genome and a cultivar of interest, could lead to inefficient editing.",

              "To fine-tune modifications in genomes down to single-base-pair changes, David Liu's group at Harvard University modified the CRISPR/Cas9 design to facilitate the irreversible conversion of one DNA base to another, which was termed base editing (50, 51).",
              "An inactivated Cas9 (dCas9) that binds DNA but does not cleave was fused to a cytosine deaminase (cytosine base editor, CBE), which converts a cytosine to uracil, resulting in a C-to-T or G-to-A substitution within 5 bp of the dCas9 binding site.",
              "Adenine base editors (ABE) that also contained dCas9 were designed to convert A to G or T to C through use of the adenine deaminase APOBEC1 (51).",
              "Base editing was first demonstrated in yeast and mammalian cell lines, with new designs under development to improve activity and allow more flexibility for single-nucleotide targeting (52).",
              "Through modification of the base editing complexes, several groups were able to achieve base editing in food crops such as rice (53), tomato (54), and wheat (55).",
              "Although base editing was achieved in these food crops, the incidence of off-targeting or causing mutations elsewhere in the genome was unknown.",
              "Therefore, Jin et al.",
              "(56) used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to assess off-targeting in rice plants recovered after experiments that employed CBE and ABE designs.",
              "The WGS results revealed that CBE designs resulted in more off-targets than ABE, and they concluded that the CBEs need to be optimized to increase the fidelity in plants.",
              "The total number of off-targets categorized as C-to-T single-nucleotide variants were 504 and 632.",
              "To minimize the incidence of off-targeting, investigation would involve optimization of cytidine deaminase and possibly the uracil glycosylase inhibitor, which is a conserved DNA repair enzyme that removes uracil and initiates the base excision repair mechanism (57).",
              "Food products that result from the application of genetic engineering methodologies are commonly referred to as GMOs, genetically modified organisms. Genetic engineering is based on the introduction of DNA, often referred to as \u201cforeign\u201d DNA.",
              "The DNA introduced might not always be from a plant source, and this causes concern for some consumers.",
              "Gene editing, especially the approaches that involve the creation of indels, is expected to result in fewer concerns, because it is based on direct modification of a plant's DNA and not the introduction of foreign DNA.",
              "However, the current DNA delivery methods used for introduction of CRIPSR/Cas reagents do involve the insertion of foreign DNA, including the Cas protein.",
              "This leads to the development of a DNA-free gene editing option driven by the need to have an approach where foreign DNA was not introduced because of consumer concern and multiple regulatory oversight requirements related to genetically engineered food crops (58).",
              "As a result, a system was designed that involved delivery of a ribonucleoprotein that contains the Cas9 protein together with a gRNA (CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex) instead of DNA plasmids that harbor genes for these components (59).",
              "An additional component option is that a donor plant DNA sequence of interest can also be included for insertion or replacement in the genome.",
              "However, while this method is attractive from the standpoint of assuaging consumer concern and decreasing regulatory scrutiny, one drawback is the amenability of this approach to the methods used for gene delivery into plant cells.",
              "The methods most amenable to this DNA-free approach are delivery into protoplasts or by biolistics (particle bombardment) and not Agrobacterium mediated, which is the method that works efficiently for the majority of crop species (60).",
              "It is difficult to regenerate plants from protoplasts for most species, and the biolistics method only works efficiently for a few species, such as maize and rice.",

              "(61) compared three approaches, biolistic RNP/DNA codelivery, biolistic delivery of CRISPR/Cas reagents as plasmid DNA, and Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas reagents into mature-seed derived rice embryos that were cultured on medium for 7 days.",
              "All three approaches were successful at achieving the intended edits;",
              "however, both biolistic delivery approaches resulted in more than 14% random plasmid or chromosomal DNA fragment insertion at the intended target sites, whereas integration of random DNA was not observed with Agrobacterium-mediated delivery.",
              "These results demonstrated both the importance of the delivery method and the necessity for careful molecular assessment of recovered edited lines to expose unwanted modifications.",
              "Multiplex genome editing involves the simultaneous delivery of multiple gRNAs within one CRISPR construct.",
              "The advantage of providing multiple gRNAs is that modification of several related or unrelated genomic sites can be simultaneously targeted through delivery of one CRISPR construct into plant cells.",
              "This type of editing has been accomplished by designing constructs that are a string of connected gene cassettes (Fig.",
              "2B) (62).",
              "However, there are more simplified vector construction systems available that were specifically developed to reduce the complexity of construct design to target multiple sites than those reported during the early days of CRISPR/Cas-mediated editing (63).",
              "The simplified multiplex vector systems streamline the building of gene editing constructs to target multiple sites compared with CRISPR/Cas vector systems, which would require a series of cassettes, each containing a polymerase III promoter, such as U3 and U6, gRNA, and terminator (62).",

              "Depending on the number of selected target sites, this type of construction can be a challenge and lead to large plasmids that would not efficiently transfer into plant cells by gene delivery methods.",

              "2B).",
              "They demonstrated that a tandem structure of multiple tRNA-gRNAs in a polycistronic expression cassette of a vector produced gRNAs with the intended in vivo-targeted sequences that resulted in the cleavage of multiple chromosomal targets by Cas9 in rice.",
              "They reported an efficiency of 100% in stable rice transgenic lines.",
              "The system developed by Cermak et al.",
              "also simplified construction for targeting multiples sites, because expression of both the gRNAs and Cas9 is driven by one type of polymerase promoter, polymerase II, which is a better characterized type than polymerase III options found in plants.",
              "Since these early reports, other multiplex editing vector systems have been designed for simultaneously targeting multiple genes (65, 66).",
              "Cermak et al.",

              "An appropriate context when considering the implications of this potential non-target mutagenesis is the frequency of spontaneous natural mutagenesis (10\u20138\u201310\u20139 per base pair (bp), or perhaps 5\u2013140 per plant genome)19,20.",

              "Another concern could be that genome editing, similar to chemical- or radiation-induced mutations17, breaks reproductive barriers that would prevent some mutations from occurring in nature.",
              "For example, some DNA segments are tightly linked, effectively preventing recombination during sexual reproduction.",
              "Although this feature can be seen equally as an advantage or an opportunity of mutation and genome-editing technologies, ultimately, as in conventional breeding, genome editing is followed by extensive field evaluations in target environments to select and deliver to farmers only those crops that are superior to current varieties, considering all agronomic and consumer criteria.",
              "Today, most genome-edited plants are produced using an intermediate step that involves insertion of foreign DNA sequences that are removed in subsequent steps, so that the final genome-edited plants are not transgenic.",
              "However, use of an intermediate transgenic step presents technical risks that require appropriate stewardship, both in the lab and greenhouse.",
              "Molecular tools can then be used to demonstrate that the transgenic intermediate has been resolved before field trials, with country-appropriate stewardship for edited crops.",
              "As genome-editing technologies evolve, the use of an intermediate transgenic step may become unnecessary, further simplifying genome-edited plant development and greatly enhancing its utility for editing clonally propagated crops \u2014 for which removal of the intermediate transgenic elements is challenging.",
              "Another risk can arise if advanced technologies disproportionately benefit wealthy players, including multinational corporations and large-scale farmers, or disadvantage smallholders or farmers engaged in alternative agricultural systems such as organic agriculture4,23.",
              "One response to mitigate this risk may be misuse of regulatory processes, such as differential labeling, that work to stigmatize and inhibit adoption by food companies and discourage consumption.",

              "We propose that the most effective approach to mitigate this risk is to ensure that genome-editing technology remains accessible to those who will use it to democratize its benefits, particularly for resource-poor farmers and consumers in LMICs.",
              "Lack of transparency regarding the products of genome-editing technologies would create a \u2018social license risk\u2019 by fuelling a lack of trust in product developers, regulators, producers and ultimately in the resulting genome-edited products4.",
              "By \u2018social license for a new technology\u2019, we refer to the willingness of potential users and consumers, and society at large, to accept products developed using that technology.",
              "Although social license is influenced by governmental policies, including local regulatory frameworks, global regulatory harmonization, trade and product-labeling requirements, and by public perceptions of risks and benefits, it is ultimately granted by the public locally and globally.",
              "One mechanism for transparency is an easily accessible registry through which developers of genome-edited crops can disclose the use of genome-editing technologies and meet public interest in knowledge about how specific foods are produced.",

              "However, lack of resolution about the ultimate ownership generates long-term uncertainty for the products developed using the technology.",
              "Clear legal rulings are needed to guide plant breeders, especially those in the resource-constrained public sector, who otherwise may avoid or delay using genome-editing technologies until these intellectual property uncertainties are resolved28.",
              "Although the business model for commercialization of crop varieties developed using genome editing within CGIAR is not yet fully developed, CGIAR implements various models to advance new varieties through national agricultural research programs, and local and global seed companies that serve smallholder farmers.",
              "For example, maize hybrids are licensed to seed companies, which then compete naturally in the marketplace.",

              "The CJEU judgment that classified gene-edited crops as transgenics was at odds with an emerging consensus among western-hemisphere countries that saw no justification in regulating crops that were edited with only single-point mutations (SDN1) as transgenics.",
              "Later in 2018, a coalition of nine countries, led by the United States, Canada and Argentina, and joined by Australia, signed a statement within the World Trade Organization (WTO) to affirm that cultivars derived from genome editing should be regulated in the same way as conventional cultivars32.",
              "The United States, joined by Argentina and Paraguay, also raised a specific concern within the WTO regarding the unjustifiable trade restrictions that could emerge from the CJEU decision, plus a stifling of agricultural research and innovation11.",
              "The United Kingdom began freeing itself from the CJEU ruling on gene-edited crops soon after its exit from the EU.",
              "Other countries, including Japan, signaled their intent not to classify most genome-edited crops as transgenic11.",
              "China\u2019s position on the regulation of genome-edited crops could also prove decisive for global harmonization.",
              "China has invested heavily in genome editing, and by 2019 it was publishing twice as many CRISPR-related agricultural papers as the United States33.",
              "The situation in Latin America is still evolving, with several countries, including Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Uruguay and Chile, converging towards the \u2018Argentina model\u2019, which only regulates genome-edited plants with permanent insertion of foreign DNA12,34.",
              "The market may respond to genome-edited crops in different ways.",
              "If they are not strongly regulated, the faster speed and lower cost of developing varieties by using genome editing could democratize their use by researchers at public universities and scientific institutions, including for orphan or commercially minor crops, and could differentially benefit smallholder farmers and consumers.",
              "If the products of genome editing are instead regulated in the same way as transgenics, then genome-edited crops may not reach farms in countries that adopt such policies, or in the countries that want to export foods to those markets;",
              "the research and varieties would be highly managed and controlled by multinational seed companies, and remain mostly unavailable to smallholder farmers in LMICs.",
              "LMICs face a daunting situation where demand for food, feedstuff and fiber, climate change and productivity threats adversely impact their food, nutrition and livelihood security.",
              "Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the world was off-track to meet its commitments to end hunger and malnutrition in all their forms by 2030 (ref.",
              "35).",
              "Almost 12% of the global population was severely food insecure in 2020, representing 928 million people \u2014 148 million more than in 2019 (ref.",
              "36).",
              "We recommend that policies are made and social license is granted to support the use of genome-editing technologies and genome-edited crops to help improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and LMIC populations in general.",
              "As regulatory, trade and intellectual property frameworks, and social license, are currently being discussed and decided, the time for action by policy makers and society is now, to ensure that the best that science can offer contributes to equity and is not available only to the privileged or wealthy.",

              "Secondly, mutations occur spontaneously with every generational advance, giving rise both to favorable and unfavorable (sometimes lethal to the variety, such as chlorophyll deficiency) alleles that drive natural selection for fitness and enable farmer- and consumer-guided selection for preferred traits.",
              "These risks provide a baseline and context to assess the risks of genome-edited plants.",
              "One frequently cited risk of genome editing is whether it could lead to additional mutations that compromise the safety or agronomic performance of a variety.",
              "From the initial deployment of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology, and as for previous double-strand break technologies (such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), zinc-finger nucleases or meganucleases), it was apparent that sites other than the target site could be inadvertently edited following introduction of a double-stranded break18.",
              "An appropriate context when considering the implications of this potential non-target mutagenesis is the frequency of spontaneous natural mutagenesis (10\u20138\u201310\u20139 per base pair (bp), or perhaps 5\u2013140 per plant genome)19,20.",
              "For perspective, the genomic data of 3,010 accessions of Asian cultivated rice identified diversity as high as 1 single-nucleotide polymorphism for every 22 bp in the 370-Mbp rice genome21.",
              "Another consideration is whether non-target edits in plants present new concerns relative to the risks that are inherent to other breeding approaches.",
              "The frequency of chemical- or radiation-induced mutations introduced during the development of more than 3,200 horticultural and crop varieties is around 1,000 times greater than natural frequencies.",
              "Current genome-editing technology options generate non-target mutations at a similar frequency to natural mutations that result from spontaneous mutagenesis15,16,17, and at a frequency much lower than that of induced mutation methods.",
              "Continuous improvement in the bioinformatic tools and approaches used to design genome-editing targets works to mitigate and reduce the likelihood of occurrence of non-target edits in crop plants.",
              "Much effort has been invested to develop robust assays for mutations, and to understand the frequency and nature of non-target site mutations resulting from CRISPR technology22.",
              "These efforts have resulted in CRISPR systems with increased fidelity and fewer non-target edits.",
              "With technological advances that help limit non-target mutations, we believe that there are no significant safety concerns that are unique to the deployment of genome-edited crops when assessed in the context of the long history of safe use of conventionally bred varieties, including those derived from mutagenesis.",
              "Another concern could be that genome editing, similar to chemical- or radiation-induced mutations17, breaks reproductive barriers that would prevent some mutations from occurring in nature.",
              "For example, some DNA segments are tightly linked, effectively preventing recombination during sexual reproduction.",
              "Although this feature can be seen equally as an advantage or an opportunity of mutation and genome-editing technologies, ultimately, as in conventional breeding, genome editing is followed by extensive field evaluations in target environments to select and deliver to farmers only those crops that are superior to current varieties, considering all agronomic and consumer criteria.",
              "Today, most genome-edited plants are produced using an intermediate step that involves insertion of foreign DNA sequences that are removed in subsequent steps, so that the final genome-edited plants are not transgenic.",
              "However, use of an intermediate transgenic step presents technical risks that require appropriate stewardship, both in the lab and greenhouse.",
              "Molecular tools can then be used to demonstrate that the transgenic intermediate has been resolved before field trials, with country-appropriate stewardship for edited crops.",
              "As genome-editing technologies evolve, the use of an intermediate transgenic step may become unnecessary, further simplifying genome-edited plant development and greatly enhancing its utility for editing clonally propagated crops \u2014 for which removal of the intermediate transgenic elements is challenging.",
              "Another risk can arise if advanced technologies disproportionately benefit wealthy players, including multinational corporations and large-scale farmers, or disadvantage smallholders or farmers engaged in alternative agricultural systems such as organic agriculture4,23.",
              "One response to mitigate this risk may be misuse of regulatory processes, such as differential labeling, that work to stigmatize and inhibit adoption by food companies and discourage consumption.",
              "Some organizations have already sought to define products developed using genome-editing technologies as transgenic, which could lead to unwarranted avoidance of genome-edited crops by food and ingredient companies, smallholders and trade-dependent developing countries.",
              "Labeling rules should be framed in a harmonized global system that is based on transparent science-based consideration of risks, in which new traits in food would be included as a label if they introduce new allergens or toxins or fundamentally change the composition of the food;",
              "production method should not be part of mandatory labeling requirements.",
              "We propose that the most effective approach to mitigate this risk is to ensure that genome-editing technology remains accessible to those who will use it to democratize its benefits, particularly for resource-poor farmers and consumers in LMICs.",
              "Lack of transparency regarding the products of genome-editing technologies would create a \u2018social license risk\u2019 by fuelling a lack of trust in product developers, regulators, producers and ultimately in the resulting genome-edited products4.",
              "By \u2018social license for a new technology\u2019, we refer to the willingness of potential users and consumers, and society at large, to accept products developed using that technology.",
              "Although social license is influenced by governmental policies, including local regulatory frameworks, global regulatory harmonization, trade and product-labeling requirements, and by public perceptions of risks and benefits, it is ultimately granted by the public locally and globally.",
              "One mechanism for transparency is an easily accessible registry through which developers of genome-edited crops can disclose the use of genome-editing technologies and meet public interest in knowledge about how specific foods are produced.",
              "Such registries should remain separate from the patent and regulatory risk-assessment systems. One such registry, developed by The Center for Food Integrity through their Coalition for Responsible Gene Editing in Agriculture (https://foodintegrity.",
              "org/programs/gene-editing-agriculture/), uses a consumer-focused approach that is designed to address transparency concerns, and incorporates needs of the concerned public and civil society through consumer and related engagements.",
              "Another risk for genome-editing technologies is the intellectual property landscape, which has evolved around the foundational patent dispute between the Broad Institute (Harvard\u2013Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Berkeley groups24,25.",
              "Although this dispute is not fully resolved, those who control the foundational intellectual property for agricultural applications have signaled their willingness to license their technologies to public institutions and companies to develop and commercialize genome-edited products26.",
              "This has been demonstrated through the granting of licenses to multiple CGIAR centres and others27 that are working on crops for smallholders.",
              "The availability of CRISPR alternatives to CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), some of which may have independent patent estates, could facilitate the development of genome-edited crops.",
              "However, lack of resolution about the ultimate ownership generates long-term uncertainty for the products developed using the technology.",
              "Clear legal rulings are needed to guide plant breeders, especially those in the resource-constrained public sector, who otherwise may avoid or delay using genome-editing technologies until these intellectual property uncertainties are resolved28.",
              "Although the business model for commercialization of crop varieties developed using genome editing within CGIAR is not yet fully developed, CGIAR implements various models to advance new varieties through national agricultural research programs, and local and global seed companies that serve smallholder farmers.",
              "For example, maize hybrids are licensed to seed companies, which then compete naturally in the marketplace.",
              "Various models would be explored to maximize the value of edited products to smallholder farmers and their communities, ensuring access.",
              "While the innovation infrastructure for genome-edited crops and other biotechnologies within institutional frameworks in LMICs varies significantly, there are projects, institutes, strategic alliances and explicit biotechnology and bioeconomy policies that can help overcome some of the environmental factors that limit widespread use of genome-edited crops.",

              "however, some or all benefits may be offset if the technologies are poorly regulated.",
              "Part of the initial attraction of genome-editing technologies grew from expectations that they would not encounter as much precautionary regulation as transgenic \u2018GMO\u2019 (genetically modified organism) methods.",
              "These expectations were dampened in 2018, when the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that genome-edited crops will be considered as transgenics in the EU for regulatory purposes.",
              "The EU stance on transgenics in the past discouraged developing countries that traded foods with the EU from using such varieties, as they are unable to bear costs incurred to meet the differentiated market requirements.",
              "As a result, smallholders in many LMICs have been unable to access transgenic technology and are becoming less competitive with farmers in countries that approved and adopted the technology31.",
              "The same could happen with genome-edited crops.",
              "The CJEU judgment that classified gene-edited crops as transgenics was at odds with an emerging consensus among western-hemisphere countries that saw no justification in regulating crops that were edited with only single-point mutations (SDN1) as transgenics.",
              "Later in 2018, a coalition of nine countries, led by the United States, Canada and Argentina, and joined by Australia, signed a statement within the World Trade Organization (WTO) to affirm that cultivars derived from genome editing should be regulated in the same way as conventional cultivars32.",
              "The United States, joined by Argentina and Paraguay, also raised a specific concern within the WTO regarding the unjustifiable trade restrictions that could emerge from the CJEU decision, plus a stifling of agricultural research and innovation11.",

              "If they are not strongly regulated, the faster speed and lower cost of developing varieties by using genome editing could democratize their use by researchers at public universities and scientific institutions, including for orphan or commercially minor crops, and could differentially benefit smallholder farmers and consumers.",
              "If the products of genome editing are instead regulated in the same way as transgenics, then genome-edited crops may not reach farms in countries that adopt such policies, or in the countries that want to export foods to those markets;",

              "However, these crops cannot withstand the changing environmental conditions and therefore these crops are undergoing significant yield losses.",
              "This phenomenon has recently been witnessed in Pakistan where the early onset of high-temperature regimes followed by heavy rains have almost entirely damaged the crops, especially rice and cotton.",
              "The rainfall has not only affected the standing crops but its knockdown effects are also extending this cropping season as well.",
              "For instance, it is feared that the next crop\u2014wheat, a staple food crop in the country\u2014would not be sown in many flooded regions in this growing season.",
              "The other abiotic stresses including drought, salinity, temperature, and heavy metal toxicity [1] are also gradually converting the cultivated lands into barren soils.",

              "Abiotic stresses can result in significant yield losses.",
              "For instance, drought alone can cause a 50\u201370% reduction in crop yield for different crops [2].",
              "For example, due to drought stress, 40% yield losses were reported in maize [3], 21% in wheat [3], 50% in rice [4], 27\u201340% in chickpea [5], 42% in soybean [6], and 68% in cowpea [7].",
              "Salinity stress is the second most devastating menace that not only reduces crop productivity but also deteriorates fertile lands [8].",
              "About one-fifth of the agricultural irrigated land is affected by excessive salts [9,10].",
              "Poor quality irrigation water together with changing climatic conditions and the excessive use of chemicals including fertilizers and pesticides continue to add new acreage under salinity stress.",
              "It was estimated that the excessive use of chemicals including fertilizers and pesticides will cause 50% of the cultivated lands to be saline by 2050 [11].",
              "The third most important factor is the increase in temperature that may depress crop production substantially.",
              "For example, every 1 \u00b0C increase in atmospheric temperature reduces wheat yield by 6% [12], rice yield by 10\u201320% [13], and 21\u201331% corn yield [14].",
              "This means that developing stress-tolerant crops could increase the crop yield.",
              "It has been a widely accepted fact that developing resilient crop varieties that can withstand the impact of abiotic stresses including changing climatic conditions is the only option for harvesting sustainable crop productions.",
              "Although conventional breeding as well as molecular techniques and genetic engineering contributed significantly to producing biotic stress-resilient crop varieties [15], however, limited success was achieved in addressing abiotic stresses owing to the complex genetics involved in resistance mechanisms. New genetic tools including genome editing are being used extensively for developing resilient crops but stringent regulations for cultivating such crops remained a major hurdle in the spread of genome-edited crops [16,17].",
              "Improvements in the genome editing assay including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) have caused it to be possible to edit the genome very precisely [18,19,20].",

              "Over the last few years, this system has revolutionized the way scientists perform genetic studies and crop breeding, due to its simplicity, flexibility, consistency and high efficiency.",
              "Considerable progress has been made in optimizing CRISPR/Cas9 systems in plants, particularly for targeted gene mutagenesis.",
              "However, there are still a number of important challenges ahead, including methods for the efficient delivery of CRISPR and other editing tools to most plants, and more effective strategies for sequence knock-ins and replacements.",

              "For thousands of years, plant domestication relied on natural variations to select for favorable genetic changes.",
              "During this process, the generation of genetic variants was completely uncontrollable and largely depended on the environment of plant cultivation.",
              "In order to create new varieties, breeders have used different methods to introduce heritable mutations into plant genomes.",
              "In the past century, the use of various mutagens enabled rapid generation of large pools of genetic variation.",
              "Chemical compounds and irradiation are common mutagens used in traditional breeding programs to induce random mutations.",
              "However, these methods have several drawbacks, including the non-specific nature of the generated mutations, the large amount of nucleotides simultaneously mutated and sometimes the deletion, duplication or rearrangement of large genomic fragments [1].",
              "As a consequence, the identification of mutations of interest is a long and labor-intensive process.",
              "In addition, random mutagenesis methods are usually less effective for trait improvements in polyploid crops, given their formidable genetic redundancy.",
              "The development of sequence-specific engineered endonucleases, the mega-nucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), has paved the way for targeted gene editing in plant genomes [2].",
              "These programmable nucleases enable the generation of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in a site-specific manner.",
              "In eukaryotic cells, the induced DSBs can be repaired either via the error-prone end-joining pathway or via the error-free homology-directed repair (HdR) pathway [3].",
              "Both pathways can be harnessed to introduce gene modifications at the target loci.",
              "However, the choice of repair pathway depends on many factors including the phase of the cell cycle, the nature of the DSB ends and the availability of repair templates [4].",
              "The most powerful gene editing tool available, the well-developed CRISPR/Cas9 system, is an RNA-directed DNA endonuclease adapted from the bacterial immune system [5].",
              "It is composed of a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) molecule for target recognition, a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) for crRNA maturation and a Cas9 protein for DNA cleavage.",
              "The crRNA-tracrRNA duplex has been artificially fused into a chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct DNA cleavage by the Cas9 protein [6].",
              "Given the simplicity of this two-component CRISPR/Cas9 system, it has been widely adopted for research in eukaryotic organisms, including plants [7,8].",
              "Theoretically, any DNA molecule with sequence complementarity to the first 20 nt of the sgRNA can be a target, but DNA cleavage is only permitted when a G-rich (NGG) protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is identified at the 3\u2032 end of the DNA targets (protospacer) [9].",
              "The original CRIPSR system was developed from the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9), but there are now many Cas9 orthologs identified from different bacterial genomes with diverse properties [10].",
              "For example, a smaller Cas9 derived from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) as well as a Cas9 derived from Streptococcus thermophilus (StCas9) were shown to work efficiently in plants [11].",
              "In addition to type II CRISPR/Cas9 systems, type V CRISPR/Cas12a (also known as Cpf1) systems have also been harnessed for plant gene editing.",
              "Type V Cas12a systems are quite different from Cas9 systems in three aspects.",
              "First, they recognize T-rich PAM sequences (TTTN or TTN), which are located just upstream of the non-complementary strand of the target.",
              "Second, Cas12a proteins produce DSBs with 5 nt 5\u2032 overhangs instead of the blunt ends produced by type II CRISPR/Cas9 systems. Third, Cas12a can process its own crRNAs from primary transcripts of CRISPR arrays and no tracrRNAs are required for crRNA maturation [12,13].",
              "The unique properties of CRISPR/Cas12a systems make them a good complement to CRISPR/Cas9 systems. Moreover, to further expand the gene editing toolkit, engineered Cas9 variants with altered PAM sequences and improved cleavage specificity have been developed [14].",
              "For example, phage-assisted continuous evolution has been used to produce an \u2018evolved\u2019 xCas9 protein that can recognize a broad range of PAM sequences and reduce the generation of off-targets in the human genome.",
              "Recently, a more efficient SpCas9 variant compatible with \u2018NG\u2019 PAM was obtained via structure-directed evolution strategies [15], and this Cas9-NG-derived editing tool has been shown to be effective in plants [16].",
              "Many studies have shown that new tools originally developed for animal systems can also work efficiently in plant cells [17\u201319].",
              "The outcomes of CRISPR-induced DSBs repaired by the end-joining system are mostly small insertions and deletions (indels), in the absence of donor templates [20].",
              "Hence, CRISPR tools are most commonly used as a biological mutagen to induce the generation of out-of-frame mutations in genes of interest.",
              "This application of CRISPR/Cas9 largely facilitates the production of heritable gene mutations for reverse genetics studies and crop breeding, especially when multiple genes need to be mutated simultaneously.",
              "Although targeted gene replacements or integrations can also be obtained using CRISPR/Cas9 systems, the frequency is still very low.",
              "Taking advantage of the high mutagenesis efficiency of CRISPR/Cas systems, another important application of this technology is in the realm of forward genetics studies.",
              "The development of CRISPR/Cas systems allows the simultaneous and random modification of functionally redundant or related genes by customizing a guide RNA library.",
              "So far, CRISPR/Cas systems have been harnessed to generate customized mutation libraries at a genome scale in human cell lines and many other species including rice [21\u201323].",
              "The size and nature of the customized guide RNA library can be very flexible, ranging from a few genes in a specific gene family to a large number of genes suspected to be involved in broad genetic pathways, depending on the research purpose.",
              "Compared to the traditional random mutagenesis methods, the use of CRISPR mutation libraries can be very focused, hence decreasing work load and cost in genetic screens.",
              "Moreover, unlike random mutagens, CRISPR systems recognize their targets via base pairing, therefore gene mutations that induce interesting phenotypes can be readily traced by identifying the corresponding guide RNA sequences.",
              "Despite the enormous potential of CRISPR and other gene editing tools, significant challenges remain if this potential is to be fully realized.",
              "Some of the challenges have to do with technical innovations needed for effective delivery of the editing tools and for precise gene editing, while others come from the social environment, such as government policies and public acceptance.",
              "Since the first use of CRISPR/Cas9 for plant gene editing in 2013, this powerful tool has been quickly adopted by the research community and greatly boosted the study of plant genetics [24].",
              "In contrast, its application in crop breeding is still hampered by several concerns.",
              "There is controversy surrounding the technology in parts of the world, not the least of which focuses on whether gene-edited plants should be considered \u2018genetically modified organisms\u2019 (abbreviated commonly as GMOs), as defined previously for transgenic organisms. All trait-improved crops have arisen from genetic and/or epigenetic variations.",
              "To accelerate the generation of variants for human consumption, physical or chemical mutagens, such as radiation and ethyl methanesulfonate, have been widely used to induce changes in plant genomes for many years [25].",
              "In 1983, the first transgenic plants were generated using disarmed Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains, whose tumor-inducing elements in Ti plasmids had been replaced by antibiotic resistance markers [26].",
              "This technology enabled the integration of exogenous DNA fragments, called transgenes, into host plants to confer a new property, e.",
              "g. herbicide or insect resistance, yield increase or quality improvement.",
              "Organisms produced in this way are called GMOs.",
              "Although these transgenic crops have contributed to the improvement of agriculture production, they became associated with unsubstantiated concerns over food and environmental safety.",
              "As a consequence, strict regulatory frameworks and exhaustive risk assessment processes were imposed on GMOs in many countries [27].",
              "With the emergence of gene editing tools, there is a need to reconsider the current definition of GMOs and corresponding regulatory frameworks, since the genome modifications achieved by gene editing methods are very different from those of transgenic technology.",
              "Firstly, most of the CRISPR-induced gene mutations are small indels rather than large fragment insertions or rearrangements [20].",
              "Such small indel variations are frequently present in plants grown under natural conditions and can also be induced at a large scale using radiation or chemical mutagens [25].",
              "Second, unlike traditional GMO plants, which require the presence and stable inheritance of transgenes in the genome, trait-improved plants created using CRISPR and other gene editing tools can be transgene-free.",
              "To obtain transgene-free plants, CRISPR constructs can be transiently expressed in plant cells, without any DNA integration into the genome, or CRISPR constructs can be stably incorporated and expressed but then removed by genetic segregation.",
              "Alternatively, CRISPR systems can be delivered into plant regenerative cells without DNA constructs using in vitro transcripts or ribonucleoproteins (RNPs).",
              "There is no internationally accepted regulatory framework for gene editing.",
              "As an example of two opposite regulatory policies, the US Department of Agriculture has determined that gene-edited crops are exempt from regulation [28], while the European Court of Justice has recently ruled that gene-edited products should be treated like traditional GMOs, which are subjected to very strict regulation in the European Union [29].",
              "For many countries, a clear regulatory policy has not been developed for gene-edited crops.",
              "Gene-edited plants can be considered as products of biological mutagenesis, much like chemical and radiation mutagenesis widely used in conventional plant breeding.",
              "In our opinion, transgene-free gene-edited plants should be treated in the same way as plants bred by conventional chemical or radiation mutagenesis, and should not be subjected to special regulatory policies.",
              "An important consideration in the implementation of regulatory policies is the ability to identify the regulated organisms (GMOs).",
              "The widespread adoption of genome editing technologies bring serious technical challenges to the regulatory authorities, as it can be impossible to differentiate the edited events from natural or chemical/radiation-induced mutants.",
              "Much like the nuclear fission technology that can be used to generate electricity to benefit mankind or to make nuclear bombs for human destruction, the revolutionary CRISPR gene editing technology can bring enormous benefits to humans through applications in crop breeding, or cause fear and ethical disaster when used to make \u2018CRISPR\u2019d babies\u2019 [30].",
              "Clearly, science-based regulatory policies that treat gene-edited crops the same way as crops from conventional mutagenesis breeding are needed to encourage the application of gene editing technologies for crop breeding to feed the growing population in the world.",
              "The specificity of CRISPR/Cas9 systems is a major concern in the application of CRISPR tools for targeted gene editing, especially in the field of gene therapy in humans.",
              "Some studies in mammalian cells and other systems have shown that Cas9/sgRNA complexes often have the ability to cut DNA sequences with an imperfect match to the guide sequences [31,32], while others have shown moderate or low off-target activity [32,33].",
              "In plants, when whole-genome sequencing was applied to detect off-target mutations in Arabidopsis [34], rice [35,36] and tomato [37], very limited off-target effects were identified.",
              "Any potential off-target sites can be largely avoided by designing guide RNAs with high specificity using software tools, such as CRISPR-P [38] and CRISPR-GE [39].",
              "In general, the nucleotides in the PAM and PAM-proximal sgRNA sequences are crucial for target recognition, while PAM-distal sequences can tolerate some, but not many, mismatches [32].",
              "Moreover, the specificity of CRISPR systems can be further improved by using engineered Cas9 variants, such as enhanced-specificity Cas9s (eSpCas9) [40], high-fidelity Cas9s (Cas9-HF) [41] and xCas9 [42].",
              "Compared to medical applications, the off-target activity of CRISPR systems in plant cells is less concerning.",
              "In gene function studies in plants, off-target effects might interfere with the analysis and interpretation of the results, making it necessary to ascertain whether there is any off-target mutation in the genome affecting the phenotype of interest.",
              "Any unwanted mutations can be segregated out through genetic crosses.",
              "In a segregating population, a correlation between the phenotype and genotypes of on-target and off-target can be established in progenies.",
              "When gene editing tools are applied to crop breeding, off-target mutations may have either a negative, no (neutral) or positive effect on agronomic traits.",
              "Plants with negative-effect mutations are naturally discarded during the breeding/selection process or, alternatively, the negative-effect mutations can be segregated out during sexual reproduction.",
              "However, if the off-target mutations have neutral or positive effects on the trait(s), they can be retained in the newly bred lines.",
              "Therefore, similar to traditional breeding using physical and chemical mutagens where numerous mutations are generated, there is no need to be concerned with any off-target effects, because the breeding process selects for plants with mutations having positive or neutral effects, regardless of whether the mutations are due to on-targets or off-targets.",
              "Engineered CRISPR systems are quickly becoming more efficient, flexible and precise to meet multiple requirements for targeted gene modifications.",
              "Although these developments are paving the way to design dream plants for the future, many challenges still remain.",
              "Since the first application of a disarmed Agrobacterium strain for plant transformation in 1983, the Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation method has become the most commonly used gene delivery technique in a number of plant species.",
              "This technique is very robust and simple to use, especially for Arabidopsis and some related crucifers.",
              "Transgenic plants can be obtained efficiently via sexual propagation by screening for antibiotic-resistant seedlings from Agrobacterium-infected flowers.",
              "For plant expression, the engineered CRISPR systems need to be transcribed using plant-optimized gene transcription modules and inserted into the T-DNA region of a binary vector [43].",
              "Although the introduced CRISPR constructs are very effective, it is almost impossible to avoid the generation of chimeras in the T1 generation, unless successful genome modifications are produced at the zygote stage [44,45].",
              "Therefore, to generate heritable genome modifications, the CRISPR cassettes need to be expressed in germline cells or meristematic cells that have the potential to generate germline cells [46].",
              "In general, promoters with strong expression in meristematic cells are preferred to generate heritable gene mutations in the progeny of first-generation transgenic plants.",
              "It also worth mentioning that the in planta expression of the introduced CRISPR/Cas systems can be regulated not only that the transcriptional level, but also at the post-transcriptional level [47].",
              "Therefore, the chance of obtaining heritable gene mutations can be further improved if the post-transcription gene silencing pathway is suppressed.",
              "However, for most other plants, the flower dipping in planta transformation method is not feasible.",
              "Therefore, it is necessary to regenerate transgenic plants from explant-derived calli.",
              "Agrobacteria and biolistic particle bombardment both can be very effective in delivering CRISPR constructs into cultured plant cells [48].",
              "Considering that genetically modified plants are regenerated from transformed cultured cells, the gene editing efficiency of CRISPR systems can be optimized either by using strong constitutive promoters or by extending the culture period [49].",
              "Transgenic plants containing homozygous or biallelic gene modifications can even be obtained in the first generation after tissue culture, accelerating the application for crop breeding [35,50].",
              "When these plant genetic transformation methods are used to deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 constructs into plant cells, some people may be concerned about the presence of transgenes during the editing process, even though the final products can be made transgene-free [51].",
              "To avoid such concern, an alternative method is to deliver in vitro transcripts of CRISPR modules or assembled Cas9 RNPs into regenerative cells [52].",
              "However, due to the protective effect of the cell wall, direct cell injection or transfection methods, such as microinjection, lipofection or electroporation, are not usually suitable for intact plant cells.",
              "Nevertheless, there are solutions to this problem, as in the case of lettuce, where Cas9 RNPs can be introduced into wall-less protoplasts followed by tissue regeneration [53].",
              "Direct delivery of Cas9 RNPs or In vitro Transcription (IVTs) into young embryos of maize and bread wheat has also been achieved using biolistic bombardment [54,55].",
              "Although the use of IVTs and RNPs alleviates concerns about the random integration of foreign DNA fragments, the procedure of tissue regeneration from protoplasts and the identification of gene-edited plants from bombarded embryos can be very costly and laborious.",
              "So far, these transgene-independent techniques are only feasible with very few plant species and varieties.",
              "The biggest hurdle for the application of plant gene editing technologies is the lack of a powerful cell delivery method into reproductive cells, which could be readily and widely applied to diverse plant species, especially recalcitrant species that are difficult or impossible to regenerate through tissue culture.",
              "In the past decade, nanotechnology has had a profound impact in a variety of fields, including manufacturing, energy and medicine.",
              "However, its application to plant science, especially using nanocarriers to deliver chemicals and biomolecules into cells, is still a new research area.",
              "Compared to mammalian cell systems, nanoparticle (NP)-mediated plant biomolecule delivery is more challenging, owing to the presence of the plant cell wall.",
              "Several NPs, such as carbon nanotubes [56], mesoporous silica NPs [57] and metal/metal oxide NPs [58] can traverse the plant cell wall and be taken up directly by plant cells, while other NPs, such as gold NPs, magnetic NPs and some composite NPs, require external aids to assist in their penetration [59].",
              "NP uptake and permeability throughout plant tissues is limited by cell wall pore diameters.",
              "The cell wall is commonly thought to exclude particles >5\u201320 nm;",
              "however, NPs \u2264 50\u2013200 nm were reported as cell wall permeable with external aids [60].",
              "To utilize NPs for in planta genetic engineering, the core problem is how to deliver preloaded NPs into plant reproductive cells.",
              "Recently, magnetofection, a method using magnetic NPs as DNA carriers, has been used to deliver foreign DNA into cotton pollens [61].",
              "After pollination using the transfected pollens, stably transformed plants were obtained in progenies at a frequency of about 1%.",
              "If reproducible, this study might open the door to generate heritable gene modifications in a wide range of flowering plants using magnetofected pollens.",
              "Nevertheless, a possible limitation of this method is its reliance on the presence of multiple pores in the pollen for the NPs to enter.",
              "In addition to pollen grains, other germline cell-containing tissues and meristematic tissues may also be targeted for NP-mediated delivery of genes or proteins, since gene modifications in these tissues may be transmitted to the progeny, although efficient delivery of NPs into these reproductive cells can be very challenging, considering that they are usually hidden by multiple outer tissue layers.",
              "With the explosion of genome sequencing data, gene functional studies have become more and more dependent on reverse genetic strategies.",
              "In plants like Arabidopsis, forward genetics approaches have led to the identification of the genetic functions of many genes over recent decades [62].",
              "However, phenotypes contributed by redundant genes are usually missed by forward genetics screens.",
              "The use of CRISPR has allowed the simultaneous targeting of multiple genes, facilitating the analysis of functionally redundant genes by reverse genetics.",
