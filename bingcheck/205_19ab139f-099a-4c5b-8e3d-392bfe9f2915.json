    "query": "What is the most significant archaeological discovery in recent history, and how has it changed our understanding of ancient civilizations?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. There are many archaeological discoveries that have changed our understanding of ancient civilizations, and it is hard to pick one that is the most significant. However, some possible candidates are:\n\n- The **Tomb of Tutankhamun**, discovered by Howard Carter in 1922 near Luxor, Egypt. This was one of the most intact and richly decorated tombs of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, and it revealed a wealth of information about the culture, religion, art, and politics of the 18th dynasty[^4^].\n- The **Terracotta Army**, discovered by farmers in 1974 near Xi'an, China. This was a massive collection of life-sized clay soldiers, horses, chariots, and weapons that were buried with the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, in the 3rd century BCE. The terracotta army demonstrated the power and ambition of the Qin dynasty, as well as the diversity and sophistication of ancient Chinese craftsmanship[^4^].\n- The **Dead Sea Scrolls**, discovered by Bedouin shepherds in 1947 near Qumran, Israel. These were a collection of ancient manuscripts that contained some of the oldest copies of the Hebrew Bible, as well as other religious and historical texts. The Dead Sea Scrolls shed light on the origins and development of Judaism and Christianity, as well as the history and culture of the Second Temple period[^4^].\n- The **Rosetta Stone**, discovered by French soldiers in 1799 near Rosetta, Egypt. This was a stone slab that had a decree written in three languages: ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, Demotic script, and ancient Greek. The Rosetta Stone enabled scholars to decipher hieroglyphs for the first time, and thus opened up a new understanding of ancient Egyptian civilization[^4^].\n\nArchaeological discoveries can change our understanding of ancient civilizations by providing new evidence and insights that challenge or complement existing sources and interpretations. They can reveal aspects of daily life, social structure, political organization, religious beliefs, artistic expression, technological innovation, and cultural interaction that were previously unknown or misunderstood. They can also help us to date and correlate events and phenomena across different regions and periods[^7^] [^8^] [^9^] [^10^] [^11^]. Archaeology is a dynamic and ongoing process of inquiry and discovery that constantly enriches our knowledge of the human past.",

              "Beyond a door simply marked \u201cArchive\u201d is what looks like a normal office: fluorescent lights, cheap blue carpet and a row of plain gray rolling stacks.",
              "It doesn\u2019t seem like the most fertile ground for archaeological discovery.",
              "But the hum of the air conditioner lets slip that this modest room is protecting something special.",
              "The temperature is held at 65 degrees Fahrenheit, while a humidifier keeps the moisture level tightly controlled.",
              "This is the archive of the Griffith Institute, arguably the best Egyptology library in the world and home to the legacy of Howard Carter, the British archaeologist who led the discovery of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb 100 years ago this November.",
              "The story of Carter\u2019s incredible find has been recounted so many times that it becomes more like a myth with every retelling.",
              "Some of the details wear ever deeper, like ruts, while others have faded from memory.",
              "But the notebooks, sketches, diaries and diagrams held in these dull-looking stacks contain the firsthand thoughts and impressions Carter recorded at the time.",
              "That\u2019s what brought me here a few years ago, while researching my 2013 book, The Shadow King, which investigates our modern obsession with the elusive Pharaoh Tutankhamun.",
              "I wanted to look afresh at Carter\u2019s discovery, working from original sources to recover lost details and bring the story back to life.",
              "I visited the archive accompanied by its soft-spoken keeper, Jaromir Malek, and his assistant, Elizabeth Fleming.",
              "On the wall hung a somber portrait of Carter, his small, piercing, black eyes gazing irritably down.",
              "He looked less like a pioneering Egyptologist than an accountant or a banker.",
              "But Fleming assured me the man had vision and a sense of beauty.",
              "To prove it, she brought out perhaps the archive\u2019s most aesthetically pleasing items\u2014a collection of graceful watercolors painted by Carter himself during the last decade of the 19th century.",
              "Carter\u2019s artistic ability was what brought him to Egypt in the first place.",
              "He was born in London in 1874, the youngest of eight surviving children, and his father painted animal portraits\u2014mainly dogs and horses\u2014for rich local clients.",
              "Through his father, Carter met an Egyptologist named Percy Newberry, who in 1891 arranged for Carter, then only 17, to travel to Egypt to help record the extensive artwork being uncovered in tombs and temples around the country.",
              "Carter soon showed great promise as an archaeologist in his own right, learning rigorous methods from Flinders Petrie, who pretty much invented the idea of archaeology as a science and is today perhaps the only Egyptologist who can rival Carter\u2019s fame.",
              "In the watercolors Fleming showed me, Carter copied ancient Egyptian depictions of various animals and birds, painting them alongside their modern-day equivalents\u2014inhabitants of the desert around him, from the scimitar-horned oryx and Nubian ibex to the Egyptian vulture, falcon and red-backed shrike.",
              "The pictures are elegant and effortless, with the attention to detail of someone who is both knowledgeable and passionate about his subject.",
              "Award-winning science writer Jo Marchant traces the mummy's story from its first brutal autopsy in 1925 to the most recent arguments over its DNA.",
              "In the early 1900s, Carter took a series of jobs with the Egyptian antiquities service, holding several senior positions, including chief inspector of antiquities in Lower Egypt, a prestigious posting that included responsibility for the Great Pyramids, near Cairo.",
              "(He lost the job after instructing Egyptian guards to defend themselves against a party of drunken French tourists who tried to force their way onto a site.)",
              "His career in the service over, Carter moved to the city of Luxor, in southern Egypt, and scraped by selling his watercolors to tourists.",
              "Carter\u2019s dream was always to excavate a single site: the Valley of the Kings.",
              "This secluded, barren ravine, hidden behind limestone cliffs, lies just across the Nile from Luxor.",
              "Beginning in the early 19th century, Western excavators unearthed dozens of royal tombs dug into its walls.",
              "But the rights to dig in the valley were always held by others, and Carter could only watch as his rivals made a series of remarkable finds.",
              "One of the most successful excavators was a retired American lawyer named Theodore Davis, who had a huge fortune but no patience for scientific procedure.",
              "Most of the royal resting places found in the valley were raided and emptied in ancient times, but Davis uncovered several intact tombs from the latter part of Egypt\u2019s great 18th Dynasty, dating to 3,300 years ago.",
              "These included the pristine chambers of the parents of Queen Tiye (who lived circa 1390 B.",
              "C.",
              "E.",
              "to 1353 B.",
              "C.",
              "E.)",
              "and a mysterious tomb known as KV55, which held a cache of treasure and a nameless mummy suspected to belong to Tiye\u2019s son, the rebellious pharaoh Akhenaten, who threw out Egypt\u2019s traditional religion and built a new capital city in the desert at Amarna.",
              "Carter, carefully studying the scars left in the valley by previous excavators, was certain there were places that hadn\u2019t yet been searched, particularly in the central floor of the valley, not far from Davis\u2019 finds, beneath a spot covered by ancient flood debris.",
              "He became convinced this area would yield the tomb of a little-known king named Tutankhamun, who ruled shortly after Akhenaten and restored Egypt\u2019s traditional order.",
              "Tutankhamun was one of the few 18th-Dynasty pharaohs for whom neither a tomb nor a mummy had been found.",
              "Several items among Davis\u2019 finds bore his name, including a strange collection of large earthen pots, which were filled with broken pottery, bags of powder and dried flowers.",
              "What was more, the entrance to KV55 bore seal impressions associated with Tutankhamun, suggesting it had been closed during his reign.",
              "Carter hypothesized that if Tutankhamun had buried his predecessor here, he might have chosen a similar location for himself.",
              "In 1914, Davis, close to death, finally gave up the rights to dig in the valley, famously saying, \u201cI fear the Valley of the Tombs is now exhausted.",
              "\u201d Most other Egyptologists agreed with him, but Carter, who had by then teamed up with a rich patron\u2014the English aristocrat George Herbert, Earl of Carnarvon\u2014seized his chance.",
              "Before they could start digging, however, World War I broke out, and excavations ceased.",
              "Carnarvon turned his estate in England, Highclere Castle, into a military hospital (more recently it stood in for the home of the Crawley family in the British television series \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d);",
              "Carter worked for the foreign office in the Middle East.",
              "But archaeological activity slowly restarted during the later years of the war, and in November 1917, Carter was finally able to pursue his dream.",
              "In those days, the Valley of the Kings looked like a huge quarry, covered with piles of stones up to 30 feet high\u2014waste left by previous excavators.",
              "Before he could investigate the triangular patch of central valley floor he\u2019d chosen for his search, Carter had no choice but to clear tens of thousands of tons of this waste, then dig through an unexcavated layer of ancient flood debris all the way down to the bedrock.",
              "To remove the rubbish, he borrowed a railway track from the antiquities service, with trucks that were pushed along the rails by hand.",
              "His team of local workmen and boys\u2014the unsung Egyptians who carried out the real hard labor behind archaeological discoveries in the valley\u2014used picks and hoes to fill their baskets, then emptied them into the trucks thousands of times each day.",
              "Over month after month of backbreaking work, these men literally moved mountains, clearing hundreds of square feet of the valley.",
              "The waste layers were so closely fused with the natural soil that the workers had to keep a close watch for charcoal and fish bones, which signaled whether they were digging through untouched layers of earth or artificial layers dumped by previous excavators.",
              "Toward the end of that first season, in early 1918, the laborers uncovered the remains of a group of ancient workmen\u2019s huts, dating to the 19th Dynasty, just after Tutankhamun\u2019s time, right in front of the tomb of Ramses VI, which dated to around the same time.",
              "The huts were undisturbed, suggesting no one had penetrated the layer of flood debris beneath them since at least the second millennium B.",
              "C.",
              "E.",
              ", and stood only 40 feet from the KV55 cache.",
              "If there were an intact, undiscovered 18th-Dynasty tomb somewhere nearby, beneath those ancient huts was the perfect place to look.",
              "Yet Carter didn\u2019t.",
              "It\u2019s a decision that provides fascinating insight into his character.",
              "Later, he maintained that excavating beneath the huts would have cut off visitor access to Ramses\u2019 tomb, one of the most popular in the valley.",
              "But another explanation may have been that Carter, aware of how promising the site was, decided to save it for a time when Carnarvon\u2019s enthusiasm for funding his work might flag.",
              "Finding Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb was undoubtedly important to Carter, but he also valued the less-glamorous task of carefully checking each unexcavated part of the valley before his patron found something else to do.",
              "The Egyptologist John Romer, in his classic 1981 book Valley of the Kings, pointed out that instead of following up on \u201csuch a plum site, so large and obviously untouched,\u201d Carter next chose to investigate the foundation deposits of a previously known tomb.",
              "\u201cIndeed,\u201d wrote Romer, \u201cmost of Carter\u2019s activities in the valley were of this type, designed to settle scholarly questions on the dating and origin of the tombs.",
              "\u201d Perhaps we should see Carter as more methodically minded scientist than dogged tomb hunter.",
              "Whatever the reason, Carter worked elsewhere for five depressing seasons.",
              "During those long years, he found hardly anything, just a few ritual deposits marking the foundations of known tombs and a cache of 13 alabaster vases, which Carnarvon\u2019s daughter, Evelyn Herbert, who always accompanied her father on trips to Egypt, insisted on personally digging out of the ground.",
              "It was a lonely time for the archaeologist, and he must have wondered if his critics were right.",
              "But he loved the remote and solitary valley, with its rugged rocks, which he once said \u201cwere not unproductive of delight.",
              "\u201d Carter found it especially majestic during the 20-minute donkey ride to the home he\u2019d built for himself, nicknamed \u201cCastle Carter,\u201d when the noise of his donkey\u2019s footsteps was interrupted only by the booming of a desert eagle owl or the occasional howl of a jackal.",
              "By 1922, Carnarvon had serious doubts about continuing the work.",
              "He was tired of excavating with so little reward, not to mention the snide jokes of other Egyptologists.",
              "That summer, he invited Carter to Highclere, intending to bring the partnership to an end.",
              "But Carter didn\u2019t give up easily.",
              "He finally told Carnarvon about the prime site beneath the workmen\u2019s huts.",
              "Perhaps, to clinch the deal, Carter also mentioned a new clue suggesting that Tutankhamun really was buried in the valley.",
              "It had just come from Herbert Winlock, an Egyptologist at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York who was studying the debris-filled KV55 jars inscribed with Tutankhamun\u2019s name.",
              "Winlock, comparing the seemingly meaningless scraps with other discoveries elsewhere, finally realized what they were\u2014the materials used in Tutankhamun\u2019s embalming.",
              "Ancient Egyptians didn\u2019t throw away anything that touched the king\u2019s body as it was being prepared for burial;",
              "instead, they carefully gathered all the rubbish and buried it close to the relevant tomb.",
              "Some of the jars contained the powdered salts embalmers used to dry out the body and the rags they cleaned up with afterward.",
              "Other pots contained broken pottery, animal bones and flower necklaces\u2014likely the remains of the banquet held at Tutankhamun\u2019s funeral, including floral garlands worn by the guests.",
              "It was the surest sign yet that the king\u2019s tomb was nearby.",
              "In October 1922, with Carnarvon\u2019s support, Carter returned to the valley for one final season.",
              "At the Griffith Institute, Fleming brought out the notebooks describing what happened next.",
              "There was a small diary, cream-colored with a red spine, as well as a larger ring binder\u2014Carter\u2019s excavation journal.",
              "Together with popular books about Tutankhamun that Carter wrote over the following decade, they provide a pretty good sense of what he was up to in those historic days and weeks.",
              "Carter started excavations on November 1, 1922, exactly where he had left off in 1918, by the workmen\u2019s huts in front of Ramses VI\u2019s tomb.",
              "He spent the next couple of days uncovering more huts, noting their details, then removing them to clear away the three feet or so of stony soil that lay between them and bedrock.",
              "On Saturday, November 4, Carter arrived at the dig site at about ten in the morning to find his usually rowdy team of workmen strangely quiet.",
              "At first, he feared there had been an accident.",
              "Then, one of his foremen, the Egyptian Ahmed Gerigar, told him that the workers had discovered a step, cut into bedrock under one of the first huts they\u2019d cleared.",
              "As the men dug further, a steep, sunken staircase began to emerge, cut into the rock about 12 feet below the entrance of Ramses VI\u2019s tomb.",
              "Carter tried to suppress his excitement.",
              "Toward sunset on Sunday, the men exposed the upper part of a door made from rough stones and covered with plaster.",
              "The seals on the door, showing the jackal god Anubis over nine bound captives\u2014the official seal of the Royal Necropolis\u2014were intact.",
              "There was no visible sign of exactly who was buried inside, but the style was 18th Dynasty.",
              "Carter broke through the plaster and removed the stones from the upper right corner of the door.",
              "Then he shone in a flashlight.",
              "The passage was filled with stones and rubble\u2014more evidence that the last people to enter had been the priests who sealed it, not thieves.",
              "\u201cIt was a thrilling moment for an excavator,\u201d Carter wrote in his journal on November 5, \u201cto suddenly find himself, after so many years of toilsome work, on the verge of what looked like a magnificent discovery\u2014an untouched tomb.",
              "\u201d Carter knew he could proceed no further without his sponsor present.",
              "Reluctantly, he closed the hole he had made, and the next morning, he cabled Carnarvon at Highclere: \u201cAt last have made wonderful discovery in Valley;",
              "a magnificent tomb with seals intact, recovered same for your arrival, congratulations.",
              "\u201d The next day, the men worked feverishly to protect the find from looters;",
              "they covered up the door and steps, then rolled boulders over the entrance.",
              "The tomb vanished, and more than once, Carter found himself wondering if finding it had even been real.",
              "He spent the next couple of weeks preparing to open the tomb and hiring staff, including Arthur Callender, an old friend and retired railway engineer who was to be his right-hand man in the work ahead.",
              "Carnarvon and his daughter arrived in Luxor on November 22.",
              "By November 24, the workmen had reached the doorway.",
              "Now the lower part of the door was uncovered for the first time\u2014and there on the door were seal impressions showing a basket, scarab beetle and the sun\u2019s disk, the cartouche of none other than Tutankhamun.",
              "The workmen pulled down the rough stones of the door and began to empty the corridor behind.",
              "By the afternoon of Sunday, November 26, after clearing a steep passage about 30 feet long, the workmen came to a second sealed door.",
              "Again, Carter removed stones to make a hole in the top corner.",
              "He poked an iron testing rod into the darkness, then lit a candle to check that the air was safe to breathe.",
              "Reassured that the air wasn\u2019t poisonous, he widened the hole and looked in.",
              "Carnarvon, Herbert, Callender and several of the Egyptian foremen waited anxiously behind him.",
              "Carter\u2019s candlelight crept uninvited into the darkness.",
              "Inside the tomb, time creaked into motion.",
              "Blurred shapes came into focus.",
              "Objects lumbered into being.",
              "After thousands of years of silence, the tomb had visitors.",
              "From reading Carter\u2019s diaries, Malek, keeper of the Griffith Institute\u2019s archive, told me, \u201cHe was obviously a man of few words.",
              "He was very prosaic, very down to earth.",
              "But when you read Carter\u2019s description of when they first opened the tomb, he suddenly becomes a poet.",
              "\u201d With white-gloved hands, Malek\u2019s assistant, Fleming, pulled Carter\u2019s yellowed journal from a cardboard case and laid it gently on a cushion.",
              "She found the famous page\u2014square paper filled with neat, black ink\u2014and started to read Carter\u2019s stiff but evocative words: It was sometime before one could see, the hot air escaping caused the candle to flicker, but as soon as one\u2019s eyes became accustomed to the glimmer of light the interior of the chamber gradually loomed before one, with its strange and wonderful medley of extraordinary and beautiful objects heaped upon one another.",
              "At first, Carter thought he was looking at wall paintings;",
              "it was a moment before he realized he was seeing actual three-dimensional objects.",
              "Carnarvon couldn\u2019t bear it any longer.",
              "\u201cCan you see anything?",
              "\u201d he demanded.",
              "As with many details of this story, different sources give different accounts for what happened next.",
              "In his excavation journal, Carter wrote that he answered, \u201cYes, it is wonderful.",
              "\u201d An account written by Carnarvon gives the rather less catchy \u201cThere are some marvelous objects here.",
              "\u201d But the most memorable\u2014and most quoted\u2014version is the one Carter came up with later, probably with help from his co-author, Arthur Mace, for his 1923 popular account of the discovery, in which he simply says, \u201cYes, wonderful things.",
              "\u201d Widening the hole in the door, the others crowded together and shined a light into the darkness.",
              "What they saw arguably still stands as the most amazing archaeological discovery of all time.",
              "Looming out of the darkness of the chamber were two ebony-black statues of a king with gold staffs, kilts and sandals;",
              "gilded couches with the heads of strange beasts;",
              "exquisitely painted ornamental caskets;",
              "dried flowers;",
              "alabaster vases;",
              "strange black shrines adorned with a gilded monster snake;",
              "white chests;",
              "finely carved chairs;",
              "a golden throne;",
              "a heap of curious white egg-shaped boxes;",
              "stools of all shapes and designs;",
              "and a scramble of overturned chariot parts, glinting with gold.",
              "The impression was not so much that of an orderly royal tomb, Carter wrote in his journal on November 26, but \u201cthe property-room of an opera of a vanished civilization.",
              "\u201d News of the discovery quickly spread, along with a variety of tall tales.",
              "One local legend held that three mysterious airplanes had landed in the valley and taken off to an unknown destination loaded with treasure.",
              "On November 29, Carter held an official opening of the tomb\u2019s antechamber, attended by various Egyptian and foreign notables and a reporter from the London Times.",
              "The paper raved about the tomb\u2019s contents: a child\u2019s stool, quaint bronze musical instruments, a dummy for wigs and robes, and food including trussed duck and haunches of venison.",
              "Archaeology was changed forever, and Carter, who might have retired from excavation after his final season with Carnarvon, faced a challenge greater than any archaeologist before him: recording, retrieving and conserving thousands of fragile artifacts from this packed space while the whole world was watching.",
              "Before long, the Valley of the Kings became like a little village, with Carter and his newly enlarged team of assistants\u2014including draftsmen, a chemist and conservator, and a photographer\u2014using a variety of nearby tombs for different purposes.",
              "The tomb originally holding the KV55 cache became a darkroom, the entrance hung with a pair of heavy black curtains.",
              "In the long, narrow passage leading into the tomb of Seti II, 300 feet long and just 12 feet wide, conservator Arthur Mace and chemist Alfred Lucas set up a laboratory.",
              "The deeper part was used for storage, while the upper section (where the electric lights could reach) hosted wooden tables, benches, and shelves filled with bottles of conservation materials, including acetone, paraffin, celluloid solution and beeswax.",
              "Stabilizing the objects coming out of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb was almost impossibly difficult, as they were liable to fall apart at the touch.",
              "It took three weeks to empty a single casket of the king\u2019s clothing;",
              "one robe alone sported more than 3,000 gold sequins and 12,000 blue beads, each in danger of falling off.",
              "Meanwhile, tourists and journalists flocked to Luxor by the thousands.",
              "The city was so deluged by newspaper dispatches that three new telegraph lines were laid direct to Cairo, and a local hospital was turned into a telegraph office.",
              "Luxor\u2019s two biggest hotels set up tents in their gardens, asking guests to sleep on army cots.",
              "Each day, visitors crossed the river on wooden sailing boats called feluccas, then headed into the valley by donkey, sand cart or horse-drawn cab.",
              "There, they made themselves at home, sitting on a wall around the top of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb.",
              "About once a day, Carter\u2019s team brought out the most recently retrieved objects and carried them in a convoy to the lab.",
              "The priceless artifacts looked like casualties of war on their wooden stretchers, wrapped in surgical bandages and fixed with safety pins.",
              "Carter himself was bombarded with letters and telegrams: congratulations, offers of assistance, requests for souvenirs, offers of money for everything from movie rights to copyright on Egyptian fashions of dress.",
              "He was given advice on how to preserve antiquities and how to appease evil spirits.",
              "Shoemakers wanted the design of the royal slippers, and grocers wanted parcels of mummified foods\u2014apparently, they expected them to be canned.",
              "Eventually, the contents of the tomb would number more than 5,000 items. Over the next eight years, Carter carefully worked his way through four densely packed chambers, revealing treasures ranging from jewelry and model boats to hunting chariots and an ostrich feather fan.",
              "The deepest chamber, nicknamed the Treasury, was guarded by a huge black jackal, representing the god Anubis, with a linen cloak, collar of blue flowers, claws of silver, and ears and eyes of gold.",
              "Clues such as dirty footprints and fingermarks in jars of perfumed oil showed that there had indeed been ancient looters, though they didn\u2019t get away with much.",
              "In a side room, personal possessions painted a picture of the human being behind all the royal gold and treasure.",
              "One sturdy wooden chest, made up of complicated partitions and drawers, was stuffed with knickknacks and playthings from Tutankhamun\u2019s youth: anklets, pocket game boards, slings, paints, mechanical toys and a fire lighter.",
              "Carter scribbled details of them all on more than 3,500 notecards and hundreds of journal pages.",
              "Perhaps most impressive of all was the king\u2019s burial chamber, decorated with rich paintings and filled with four nested gilded shrines, at the center of which was a perfectly preserved sarcophagus made of pink quartzite.",
              "Reliefs of goddesses were carved onto each corner, protecting the sides and ends of the casket with their outstretched, winged arms. Carter finally came face to face with the king himself on February 12, 1924.",
              "By then, Carnarvon had been dead nearly a year, having suffered blood poisoning brought on by an infection after he sliced the top off a mosquito bite while shaving\u2014and inspiring the legend of Tutankhamun\u2019s curse.",
              "Opening the pharaoh\u2019s sarcophagus, Carter recalled later, was the \u201csupreme and culminating moment\u201d that he had looked forward to since it became clear the chambers he\u2019d discovered were an intact tomb.",
              "With a delicate pulley system, in front of an audience of dignitaries and VIPs, Carter slowly raised the huge, 2,500-pound stone lid.",
              "Inside, the contents were covered in shrouds.",
              "When he rolled them back, Carter wrote, \u201ca gasp of wonderment escaped our lips, so gorgeous was the sight that met our eyes.",
              "\u201d Inside was a glorious figure, seven feet long and made of wood that was covered in gold.",
              "The observers didn\u2019t yet know it, but this was only the outermost of three tightly fitting nesting coffins, each elaborately adorned, the inner one formed from solid gold.",
              "The form before them lay on a wooden bier, just as shown in the tomb paintings a few feet away.",
              "Its arms were folded across its chest, hands clasping a flail and crooked scepter made of gold and a ceramic glaze known as faience.",
              "The twin heads of a sacred cobra and vulture\u2014protectors of Upper and Lower Egypt, respectively\u2014were mounted on its golden forehead.",
              "For ancient Egyptians, the coffin represented the king\u2019s transformed immortal state, physically perfect and eternally young, with flesh of gold.",
              "But there was also a sign of human grief and frailty: a tiny wreath of olive leaves and cornflowers placed on the king\u2019s forehead, with fragile petals that still had a tinge of blue.",
              "\u201cMany and disturbing were our emotions,\u201d wrote Carter.",
              "\u201cMost of them voiceless.",
              "But, in that silence, to listen\u2014you could almost hear the ghostly footsteps of the departing mourners.",
              "\u201d According to the Times reporter present, the face of the coffin was so \u201cremarkably real\u201d that for a moment, the observers forgot they were gazing at a mere mummy case.",
              "It felt instead as if they were in the presence of some great, golden person lying in state.",
              "In the world above, empires had risen and fallen;",
              "wars and natural disasters had wracked the land;",
              "civilizations had sprung up, developed and disappeared;",
              "major religions had come into existence and been superseded by others.",
              "Through it all, a few feet beneath the earth, this forgotten king had lain in his sarcophagus, his golden face and obsidian eyes staring up toward the sky.",

              "Discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun - Wikipedia",
              "The tomb of Tutankhamun was discovered in the Valley of the Kings in 1922 by excavators led by the Egyptologist Howard Carter, more than 3,300 years after his death and burial.",
              "Whereas the tombs of most pharaohs were plundered by graverobbers in ancient times, Tutankhamun's tomb was hidden by debris for most of its existence and therefore not extensively robbed.",
              "It thus became the first known largely intact royal burial from ancient Egypt.",
              "To date, the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb is widely considered one of the most famous archaeological discoveries of all time.",
              "The tomb was opened beginning on 4 November 1922 during an excavation by Carter and his aristocratic patron, the 5th Earl of Carnarvon.",
              "The unexpectedly rich burial consisted of more than five thousand objects, many of which were in a highly fragile state, so conserving the burial goods for removal from the tomb required an unprecedented effort.",
              "The opulence of the burial goods inspired a media frenzy and popularised ancient Egyptian-inspired designs with the Western public.",
              "To the Egyptians, who had recently become partially independent of British rule, the tomb became a symbol of national pride, strengthening Pharaonism, a nationalist ideology that emphasised modern Egypt's ties to the ancient civilisation, and creating friction between Egyptians and the British-led excavation team.",
              "The publicity surrounding the excavation intensified when Carnarvon died of an infection, giving rise to speculation that his death and other misfortunes connected with the tomb were the result of an ancient curse.",
              "After Lord Carnarvon's death, tensions arose between Carter and the Egyptian government over who should control access to the tomb.",
              "In early 1924, Carter stopped work in protest, beginning a dispute that lasted until the end of the year.",
              "Under the agreement that resolved the dispute, the artefacts from the tomb would not be divided between the government and the dig's sponsors, as was standard practice in previous Egyptological digs, and most of the tomb's contents went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
              "In later seasons media attention waned, apart from coverage of the removal of Tutankhamun's mummy from its coffin in 1925.",
              "The last two chambers of the tomb were cleared from 1926 to 1930, and the last of the burial goods were conserved and shipped to Cairo in 1932.",
              "The tomb's discovery did not reveal as much about the history of Tutankhamun's time as Egyptologists had initially hoped, but it did establish the length of his reign and gave clues about the end of the Amarna Period, the era of radical innovation that preceded his reign.",
              "It was more informative about the material culture of Tutankhamun's time, demonstrating what a complete royal burial was like and providing evidence about the lifestyles of wealthy Egyptians and the behaviour of ancient tomb robbers.",
              "The interest generated by the find stimulated efforts to train Egyptians in Egyptology.",
              "Since the discovery, the Egyptian government has capitalised on its enduring fame by using exhibitions of the burial goods for purposes of fundraising and diplomacy, and Tutankhamun has become a symbol of ancient Egypt itself.",
              "The pharaoh Tutankhamun ruled during the Eighteenth Dynasty, during the New Kingdom.",
              "He died c.",
              "1323 BC and was entombed in the Valley of the Kings, near Thebes (modern Luxor), like most New Kingdom rulers.",
              "[1] Instead of a full-size royal tomb cut into the slopes of the valley, he was interred in a small tomb dug into the valley floor, probably a private tomb that was modified to fit the large amount of goods that accompanied a royal burial.",
              "[2] The tomb was robbed twice soon after its construction.",
              "Officials restored and resealed it, filling the entrance passage with chips of limestone to deter further intrusion.",
              "During the reigns of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI, nearly two centuries after Tutankhamun's death, his tomb was covered by debris from the construction of their tomb, KV9.",
              "[Note 1] Tutankhamun's tomb was thus hidden from later waves of robbery so that, unlike the other tombs in the valley, it retained most of the goods it was stocked with.",
              "[5] In the early twentieth century Egypt was a de facto British colony, ostensibly ruled by monarchs from the Muhammad Ali dynasty but in fact managed by a British consul-general, who oversaw a government staffed by Egyptians but dominated by the British.",
              "Egyptology, the study of ancient Egypt, was overseen by the Antiquities Service, a department of the Egyptian government.",
              "[6][7] New excavations of ancient sites were heavily dependent on the system known as \"partage\" or \"division of finds\": museums or private collectors of ancient artefacts would fund an Egyptological dig in exchange for a share of the artefacts, customarily half, and the remainder went to the Antiquities Service and its museum, the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
              "[8][9] Many of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings had been open since ancient times.",
              "[10] Dozens of others, whose entrances had been deliberately buried by their builders or had become hidden by flash flood debris, were discovered in the course of the nineteenth century.",
              "[11][12] Royal mummies[13] and individual burial goods were discovered in some of these tombs, but nothing close to a complete set of royal burial equipment was found.",
              "[14] A period of rapid discoveries in the valley began after Howard Carter became the Antiquities Service's inspector for Upper Egypt, including the Valley of the Kings, in 1900.",
              "[15] Carter had come to Egypt as an artist, assisting in recording Egyptian tomb art, and was then trained as an archaeologist.",
              "[16] As inspector, Carter both restored and protected the open tombs in the valley and sought to dig for undiscovered tombs.",
              "In searching for a patron to fund these efforts he found Theodore M.",
              "Davis, a wealthy American who regularly visited Egypt.",
              "With Davis's support Carter made several small finds and cleared three previously unexplored tombs.",
              "[17] After the Antiquities Service transferred Carter to Lower Egypt in 1904, Davis held the concession to excavate in the valley for another ten years, his efforts managed by a series of five archaeologists.",
              "[15] Davis pressured these excavators to work rapidly,[18] nearly doubling the number of known tombs in the valley,[19] but his discoveries were often carelessly treated and inadequately documented.",
              "[20] His excavation of KV55, the tomb of a member of the royal family from Tutankhamun's time, was so poorly handled that the identity of its occupant has been uncertain ever since.",
              "[21] Little was known about Tutankhamun in Davis's time, though he was known to have restored traditional practices in the monarchy after a brief episode of radical innovation known as the Amarna Period.",
              "It was thus likely that he was buried in the Valley of the Kings, the traditional site for royal burials before and after the Amarna Period.",
              "[22] Davis never found Tutankhamun's tomb, assuming no tomb would have been cut into the valley floor, but he did find signs that the king had been buried in the valley.",
              "[23] One such sign was a pit, discovered in 1907 and designated KV54, that contained a handful of objects bearing Tutankhamun's name.",
              "These objects are now thought to have been either burial goods that were originally stored in the entrance corridor of Tutankhamun's tomb, which were removed and reburied in KV54 when the restorers filled the corridor, or objects related to Tutankhamun's funeral.",
              "Another was an uninscribed tomb, found in 1909 and known as KV58, that contained pieces of a chariot harness bearing Tutankhamun's name and that of his successor, Ay.",
              "Davis concluded that KV58 was all that remained of Tutankhamun's burial, which would mean that virtually all the kings' tombs expected to exist in the valley were accounted for.",
              "[24] The last years of Davis's work in the valley produced almost no finds, and in 1912 he wrote: \"I fear the Valley of the Tombs is now exhausted.\"",
              "[25] Carter left the Antiquities Service in 1905 after a group of French tourists forced their way into a closed archaeological site at Saqqara and he ordered the Egyptian guards to eject them.",
              "The use of force by Egyptians against Europeans caused a scandal and led to his resignation.",
              "[26] He subsequently worked as an excavator for George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, a collector of Egyptian antiquities, at several sites in Egypt.",
              "Carnarvon bought the concession for the Valley of the Kings when Davis relinquished it in 1914, and although the First World War made it difficult to conduct fieldwork, in 1917 Carter began to clear the valley down to the bedrock.",
              "[27] This required sifting through the spoil heaps produced by decades of earlier excavations, as well as the valley's natural alluvium.",
              "[28] At the time neither Carter nor Carnarvon stated they were looking for Tutankhamun's tomb, but there was reason for them to believe it had not been found.",
              "The objects in KV54 and KV58 indicated that Tutankhamun had been buried somewhere in the valley, but such meagre remains were unlikely to be a royal burial.",
              "[29] During these excavations the political status of Egypt changed dramatically.",
              "The Egyptian Revolution of 1919 convinced British authorities that Egypt's current status was unsustainable, and they issued the Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence in February 1922.",
              "It left the United Kingdom with substantial influence over the government, particularly in military and foreign affairs.",
              "[30] Antiquities policy was one of the areas ceded to the Egyptians.",
              "The Antiquities Service retained its incumbent director, Pierre Lacau, but he now answered to an Egyptian minister of public works.",
              "[31] The season for excavation and tourism in Egypt extends from November to April, avoiding the worst of the country's heat.",
              "[32] In mid-1922, when Carter and Carnarvon were paused between digging seasons, only one section of the Valley of the Kings remained covered by debris.",
              "This area was difficult to clear because it included the remains of ancient workers' huts and lay close to the entrance to KV9, which attracted heavy tourist traffic.",
              "Carnarvon discussed abandoning excavation in the valley, given how fruitless the effort had been, but Carter offered to cover the expense of clearing this final section.",
              "Carnarvon, impressed by Carter's dedication, agreed to fund the work for one more season.",
              "[33] To minimise the disruption to tourists, Carter and his Egyptian workforce began on 1 November 1922, earlier in the season than usual.",
              "[34] On 4 November a worker uncovered a step in the rock.",
              "According to Carter's published account the workmen discovered the step while digging beneath the remains of the huts;",
              "other accounts attribute the discovery to a boy digging outside the assigned work area.",
              "[35][Note 2] The step proved to be the beginning of a tomb entrance staircase.",
              "At the bottom stood a doorway sealed with limestone and plaster, into which Carter cut a peephole to see the passage beyond was filled with rubble.",
              "[39][40] Carter sent a telegram to Carnarvon, then in England, and had the workmen re-fill the pit to secure the tomb until Carnarvon's arrival.",
              "While waiting, Carter asked his friend and colleague Arthur Callender to assist with the upcoming excavation.",
              "[41] The digging resumed after 23 November with Carnarvon's arrival in Luxor with his daughter Evelyn Herbert.",
              "Upon closer examination the doorway seal was found to be inscribed with the name of Tutankhamun, suggesting that this was his tomb.",
              "The debris that filled the passage contained objects bearing the names of other kings, suggesting it might be a cache of miscellaneous objects buried during his reign.",
              "The doorway had been partially demolished before being resealed, indicating an ancient robbery.",
              "On 26 November the excavators reached another sealed doorway.",
              "[42] Carter's book on the discovery, co-written with Arthur Cruttenden Mace, described the breaching of the seal in one of the most famous passages in the history of archaeology:[43][44] With trembling hands I made a tiny breach in the upper left-hand corner.",
              "Darkness and blank space, as far as an iron testing-rod could reach, showed that whatever lay beyond was empty, and not filled like the passage we had just cleared.",
              "Candle tests were applied as a precaution against possible foul gases, and then, widening the hole a little, I inserted the candle and peered in, Lord Carnarvon, Lady Evelyn and Callender standing anxiously beside me to hear the verdict.",
              "At first I could see nothing, the hot air escaping from the chamber causing the candle flame to flicker, but presently, as my eyes grew accustomed to the light, details of the room within emerged slowly from the mist, strange animals, statues, and gold \u2013 everywhere the glint of gold.",
              "[45] Carnarvon asked Carter if he could see anything.",
              "Accounts differ as to the wording of Carter's answer;",
              "in the best-known version, in his book, Carter replied \"Yes, wonderful things.\"",
              "[44][Note 3] The gilded furniture and statuary that Carter saw when first looking into the tomb stood in a room that came to be known as the antechamber.",
              "[47] This room alone contained burial goods in greater quantity than the excavators had ever expected.",
              "Some were types of object that were very familiar from previous finds;",
              "some were exceptionally elaborate examples of their kind;",
              "and some were entirely unexpected.",
              "[48][49] From the antechamber led two doorways that had been blocked with plaster and then breached by ancient robbers.",
              "One was left open, revealing that the chamber beyond, dubbed the annexe, was filled with a chaotic jumble of objects.",
              "The other had been resealed in ancient times.",
              "Many of the objects bore Tutankhamun's name, leaving the excavators in no doubt that this was his original burial.",
              "[50] At some point in the days after first peering into the antechamber, the excavators breached the plaster of the blocked doorway.",
              "[51] Carter, Carnarvon and Evelyn Herbert squeezed through the hole to find the tomb's burial chamber, which was mostly filled by the set of gilded shrines that enclosed Tutankhamun's sarcophagus.",
              "[52] The robbers had gone no further than the outermost shrine.",
              "[53] Carter, in particular, may have wanted to be certain of that fact;",
              "in 1900 he had opened what he thought was an undisturbed royal tomb, the Bab el-Hosan, in front of many highly placed guests, only to find it nearly empty.",
              "[54][55] The excavators resealed the hole with new plaster,[51] though their breach of the doorway became something of an open secret in the Egyptological community.",
              "[52] Later Egyptologists have held differing opinions on the excavators' actions.",
              "T.",
              "G.",
              "H.",
              "James, Carter's biographer, argued that entering the burial chamber, before the site had been inspected by officials from the Antiquities Service, did not violate the terms of Carnarvon's concession or the standards of behaviour among archaeologists in the 1920s.",
              "[56] Joyce Tyldesley asserts that it was against the terms of the concession and points out that the breach necessitated moving some of the artefacts that stood in front of the partition, meaning their original positions could not be recorded.",
              "[57] Clearing the tomb of its artefacts would require an unprecedented effort.",
              "[58] Moisture from flash floods in the valley above had periodically seeped into the tomb over the centuries.",
              "As a result, alternating periods of humidity and dryness had warped wood, dissolved glue and caused leather and textiles to decay.",
              "Every exposed surface was covered with an unidentified pink film.",
              "Carter later estimated that without intensive restoration efforts, only a tenth of the burial goods would have survived being transported to Cairo.",
              "[59] He needed assistance, and he called upon Albert Lythgoe, head of the Egyptian Expedition of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which was working nearby, to loan some of its personnel.",
              "Lythgoe sent Mace, a specialist in conservation;",
              "Harry Burton, regarded as the best archaeological photographer in Egypt;",
              "and the architect Walter Hauser and the artist Lindsley Hall, who drew scale drawings of the antechamber and its contents.",
              "[60] Other experts also volunteered their services: Alfred Lucas, a chemist for the Antiquities Service, whose expertise would be a great help in the conservation effort;",
              "James Henry Breasted and Alan Gardiner, two of the foremost scholars of the Egyptian language of the time, to translate any texts discovered in the tomb;",
              "and Percy Newberry, a specialist of botanical specimens, and his wife Essie, who helped conserve textiles from the burial.",
              "[61][62][Note 4] They used the entrance of KV15, the tomb of Seti II, as a storeroom and conservation laboratory;",
              "KV55 as a photographic darkroom;",
              "and KV4, the tomb of Ramesses XI, as a place to take meals.",
              "[64] Four Egyptian foremen \u2013 Ahmed Gerigar, Gad Hassan, Hussein Abu Awad and Hussein Ahmed Said \u2013 also worked in the tomb, and a handful of Egyptian porters, whose names are not recorded, carried objects from Tutankhamun's tomb to KV15.",
              "[65] On 16 December the excavators began clearing the antechamber, starting with the objects north of the entrance and moving anti-clockwise around the room.",
              "[66] Objects were labelled with reference numbers and photographed in situ before being moved.",
              "[67] Carter said of the stacks of furniture and other objects in the antechamber, \"So crowded were they that it was a matter of extreme difficulty to move one without running serious risk of damaging others, and in some cases they were so inextricably tangled that an elaborate series of supports had to be devised to hold one object or group of objects in place while another was being removed.\"",
              "[68] The disorganised contents of boxes had to be sorted through, and in some cases pieces of a single object, such as an elaborate inlaid corselet, were scattered through the chamber and had to be searched for before being reassembled.",
              "[69] Upon removal from the tomb, the objects were cleaned and, if necessary, treated with preservatives such as celluloid solution or paraffin wax.",
              "[70] The items in most urgent need of conservation were treated on the spot, but most were removed to KV15 for treatment.",
              "[68] The tomb inspired a public craze that came to be known as \"Tutmania\", a specific instance of the long-standing phenomenon of Western Egyptomania.",
              "[71] As Breasted's son Charles put it, the news of the discovery \"broke upon a world sated with post-First World War conferences, with nothing proved and nothing achieved, after a summer journalistically so dull that an English farmer's report of a gooseberry the size of a crabapple achieved the main news pages of the London metropolitan dailies.\"",
              "[72] The resulting media frenzy was unprecedented in the history of Egyptology.",
              "[73] Carter and Carnarvon became internationally famous,[74] and Tutankhamun, formerly unknown to the public, became so familiar as to be given a nickname, \"King Tut\".",
              "[75] Tourists in Luxor abandoned the normal sightseeing itinerary and flocked to the tomb, crowding around the retaining wall that surrounded the pit in which the tomb entrance lay.",
              "At times the excavators feared the wall might collapse from the weight of the people leaning on it.",
              "When possible, the excavators left objects uncovered when carrying them out of the entrance, to please the sightseers.",
              "People who demanded to enter the tomb, many of whom were too highly positioned or well-connected to refuse, presented a greater difficulty.",
              "Every visit to the tomb by a non-archaeologist increased the risk of damage to the burial goods and disrupted the excavators' work schedule;",
              "Carter and Mace estimated that a quarter of the work time during the first season was given over to accommodating such visitors.",
              "[76] The phenomenon extended far beyond the tomb itself.",
              "Guests at the Winter Palace Hotel in Luxor danced to the \"Tutankhamun Rag\",[77] and in the United States the discovery inspired a flurry of ephemeral Egypt-themed films and a more enduring hit song, \"Old King Tut\".",
              "[78] Interest in Egyptology, and sales of books about ancient Egypt, also surged;",
              "[79] several established Egyptologists published books about Tutankhamun to capitalise on the trend.",
              "[80] The opulence of Tutankhamun's burial goods, in particular, caught the public's attention.",
              "[81] Replicas of them appeared as early as 1924, when the British Empire Exhibition featured a reproduction of the tomb, though many of the contents could not be included, as they had not yet been seen even by the excavators.",
              "[82] The public in Europe and the United States compared the everyday items in the tomb to modern household goods, and producers of clothing, jewellery, furniture and household decor hastened to create Egyptian-inspired designs.",
              "Some were based on actual artefacts found in the tomb;",
              "others simply adopted ancient Egyptian names and motifs.",
              "Although Egyptian Revival decorative arts had existed since the early nineteenth century, they had largely been aimed at the world of wealthy art connoisseurs.",
              "The products of Tutmania were mass-produced and marketed to the public.",
              "[83] In the nineteenth century Egyptians had little interest in ancient Egyptian civilisation.",
              "[84] In the early twentieth century that attitude changed, largely because of Ahmed Kamal, one of the first Egyptian Egyptologists, who raised public awareness of ancient Egyptian history.",
              "[85][86] In the years leading up to the First World War, Egyptian nationalists began treating ancient Egypt as a source of national identity, one that bound together Egypt's Muslims and Coptic Christians and emphasised that Egypt had once been powerful and independent.",
              "[87][88] This ideology, known as Pharaonism, was well established by the time of the 1919 revolution.",
              "The Western mania for ancient Egypt had inspired modern Egyptians to adopt it as a source of national pride, and Tutankhamun in particular became a national symbol once Tutmania emerged.",
              "[89] After the discovery, ancient imagery became ubiquitous in Egyptian print media, and ancient Egypt became a common subject for Egyptian plays and novels.",
              "Major Egyptian literary figures, such as the poet Ahmed Shawqi, focused on Pharaonist themes in the wake of the discovery.",
              "[90] The first Egyptian film, made in 1923, was titled In the Country of Tut-Ankh-Amun.",
              "[91] Carnarvon embraced the publicity, hoping to defray the costs of the excavation by licensing rights to the media.",
              "[92] On 9 January 1923 he signed a contract with The Times, granting its reporter, Arthur Merton, exclusive press access to the tomb.",
              "[93] Other Egyptological digs had made similar arrangements with newspapers in the past, but the unique nature of the Tutankhamun find made this one a major source of conflict.",
              "[94] A coalition of other press outlets criticised the Times monopoly on official information from the excavation,[95] and their coverage of Carnarvon grew increasingly negative.",
              "[96] Egyptian papers joined the international press in denouncing the monopoly, which they saw as a sign of continued foreign domination.",
              "At the same time Pharaonist authors expressed fear that the tomb would be subject to a division of finds, sending many of the burial goods out of the country.",
              "An editorial in Al-Ahram, written by Fikri Abaza, declared \"Lord Carnarvon is exploiting the mortal remains of our ancient fathers before our eyes, and he fails to give the grandchildren any information about their forefathers\".",
              "[97] The antechamber was almost entirely cleared by mid-February,[98] and on 16 February Carter and Carnarvon formally opened the burial chamber with government officials in attendance.",
              "[99] At the east end of the burial chamber was an open doorway to a fourth room, dubbed the treasury.",
              "It contained the canopic chest that housed Tutankhamun's embalmed organs.",
              "Carter had the entrance to this chamber boarded up so it would not be a distraction during the upcoming clearance of the burial chamber;",
              "it was only reopened in 1927.",
              "[100] After a viewing period for the press and the general public, the tomb was closed for the season on 26 February.",
              "[101] As in each subsequent season, a large temporary workforce of local workmen was recruited to rebury the tomb entrance to prevent intrusion,[102][103] while the objects that had been conserved were packed up for the workmen to propel by hand along a length of Decauville railway track.",
              "[104][105] The limited length of available track had to be constantly taken up and re-laid to cover the distance down to the Nile, where the artefacts were shipped to Cairo.",
              "[104] Shortly after the tomb was closed, Carnarvon accidentally cut open a mosquito bite on his cheek while shaving.",
              "The wound became infected, and after weeks of illness, culminating in blood poisoning and pneumonia, he died on 5 April.",
              "[106] Carnarvon had been in frail health for twenty years, but his death soon attracted speculation that something more than infectious disease was at work.",
              "[107] Works of fiction in which Egyptian spirits or reanimated mummies exact revenge upon those who disturb their tombs first appeared in the late nineteenth century.",
              "[108][109] This fictional trope came to be known as the \"mummy's curse\" or \"curse of the pharaohs\".",
              "[110] The real-life stories of Walter Ingram, who died in 1888 after purchasing an Egyptian mummy, and of a coffin lid called the \"Unlucky Mummy\", which was purported to cause a variety of misfortunes, cemented the idea of the curse in the public imagination.",
              "[111] Now the pre-existing concept was applied to Carnarvon's death.",
              "[112] Several people, such as the author Marie Corelli and a psychic known as Cheiro, claimed to have warned Carnarvon of mortal peril before his death.",
              "[113] Arthur Weigall, a former Egyptologist who was now the Daily Mail correspondent on the tomb, said he had observed Carnarvon joking as he entered the tomb and remarked \"If he goes down in that spirit, I give him six weeks to live!\"",
              "[114] Later accounts, such as the recollections of the anthropologist Henry Field, claimed that an ancient text wishing death upon violators of the tomb was inscribed over its doorway or on an object within.",
              "[115] No written curse has ever been documented in Tutankhamun's tomb, and although some Egyptian tombs did contain such curses, most are from non-royal tombs that predate Tutankhamun by centuries.",
              "[116] Any deaths or unusual events connected with the tomb were treated as possible results of the curse.",
              "Carnarvon's son and heir, Henry Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon, said that Cairo suffered a power outage at the moment of his father's death, and in England his father's dog let out a howl and died.",
              "[117] Another such story, recounted by Carter and others involved in the excavation,[118][119] involved a canary that Carter had bought at the beginning of the digging season.",
              "[120] Initially the Egyptian workmen regarded the bird as sign of good luck, and when the tomb was discovered they dubbed it \"the tomb of the bird.\"",
              "When a cobra entered Carter's house and ate the canary, the Egyptians called it an ill omen, relating the intruding animal to the uraeus, the protective cobra emblem, on the brow of Tutankhamun's statues.",
              "[121][122] When George Jay Gould, who had visited the tomb, died the following May, his death was attributed to the curse, as was that of Aubrey Herbert, Carnarvon's half-brother, in September.",
              "[123][124] Later additions to the list of purportedly cursed deaths included those of Mace in 1928,[125] Carnarvon's secretary Richard Bethell in 1929 and Weigall in 1934.",
              "[126] Most Egyptologists dismissed such claims.[127] In subsequent decades, some sources, such as the author Philipp Vandenberg, suggested natural explanations for the fatalities, such as poisons present in the tomb,[128] but a study in the British Medical Journal in 2002 found no significant difference in mortality between those who had entered the tomb and those who had not.",
              "[129] Egyptian writers picked up the trope of the curse and adapted it for their own purposes.",
              "Al-Ahram published humorous stories in which Tutankhamun awoke from death to comment on the politics of the day.",
              "More serious works of fiction depicted mummies confronting the Westerners who disturb their tombs, although in a more benign manner than in the Western stories on the same theme.",
              "These stories portrayed mummies not as objects of horror but as national ancestors seeking to redress the treatment of Egypt and its heritage by foreign powers.",
              "[130] Between digging seasons, Carter and Mace wrote the first volume of The Tomb of Tut.",
              "ankh.",
              "Amen, their account of the discovery and the work that had been done thus far;",
              "it was published in October as Carter headed back to Egypt to resume work.",
              "[131] With Carnarvon's death, the tomb clearance would be financed by Carnarvon's widow, Almina Herbert, Countess of Carnarvon, but with Carter now the spokesman to the government and the press.",
              "[132] The season began with the removal of the two life-size statues of Tutankhamun standing in the antechamber on either side of the chamber doorway.",
              "After that the excavators began to remove the sarcophagus shrines.",
              "The task was difficult as the shrines took up most of the burial chamber and left the excavators with little room to move.",
              "[133] The partition wall between the antechamber and burial chamber \u2013 which bore a portion of the painted decoration of the burial chamber wall[134] \u2013 had to be partly demolished to give the excavators room to manoeuvre, and scaffolding had to be erected so the shrines could be dismantled from the top down.",
              "[135] Friction increased between the excavators and the Antiquities Service as Carter sought to strictly limit visitors to the tomb.",
              "Lacau required an Antiquities Service inspector on site and demanded that Carter submit a list of all his personnel for government approval.",
              "This regulation has since become standard on Egyptological digs but was novel at the time, and in this case it was clearly aimed at Merton, whom Carter had appointed as a member of the excavation team.",
              "[136] Lacau mentioned the division of finds in a 10 January 1924 letter to Carter,[137] raising a topic the excavators had previously avoided.",
              "[138] In 1922 Lacau had declared the end of the traditional half-share given to excavators;",
              "the government might grant artefacts to the sponsors of an excavation as gifts, but all antiquities in Egypt belonged in principle to the government.",
              "This change did not apply to Carnarvon's existing concession, which allowed for a division of finds except in case of an intact tomb, whose contents must be surrendered entirely to the Antiquities Service.",
              "[137] Carnarvon had planned to argue that Tutankhamun's tomb did not qualify as intact because it had been robbed, even though it was restored and resealed in ancient times.",
              "He had expected to receive a share of the artefacts and had promised that the Metropolitan Museum would be \"well taken care of\", receiving a portion of his share, in exchange for its assistance.",
              "[139] Lacau now implied that all the tomb's contents were property of the Egyptian government, meaning no division of finds would take place.",
              "[140] Other Egyptologists worried that the regulations Lacau was imposing would hamper Egyptological work.",
              "Lythgoe, Gardiner, Breasted and Newberry sent a letter of protest to Lacau and his superior, the minister of public works, asserting that the Tutankhamun discovery \"belongs not to Egypt alone but to the entire world\".",
              "This further inflamed the political tensions.",
              "[141] The Egyptian elections of January 1924 had brought the Wafd Party to power, forming a nationalist government headed by Prime Minister Saad Zaghloul.",
              "[142] The letter thus went to the Wafd's new minister of public works, Morcos Bey Hanna,[141] who was not inclined to be accommodating towards Britons, as the British government had put him on trial for treason for his actions during the Revolution of 1919.",
              "[143][144] Once the shrines were disassembled, the excavators rigged a system of pulleys to lift the lid of the stone sarcophagus, an especially delicate task because it was cracked.",
              "On 12 February the lid was raised, revealing, beneath a shroud, a gilded and inlaid wooden coffin in human shape, bearing Tutankhamun's face \u2013 the outermost of a nested set.",
              "It was the first complete set of royal coffins ever found, and its artistic quality and state of preservation impressed even the experienced Egyptologists who were present.",
              "[145] A viewing of the coffin by the Egyptian press was scheduled for 13 February, followed by a tour for the excavators' wives and families.",
              "[146] Hanna saw this tour as a slight \u2013 he pointed out that wives of Egyptian cabinet ministers had not been allowed into the tomb[147] \u2013 and forbade the families' visit, sending a police force to ensure his order was carried out.",
              "[148] Carter and his collaborators were incensed, and they announced they were halting work in protest of what they called \"impossible restrictions and discourtesies\" imposed by the Egyptian government.",
              "Carter locked the tomb, where the sarcophagus lid was still suspended above the coffin.",
              "[149] Hanna terminated the Carnarvon concession, and Lacau brought workmen to the tomb to saw off Carter's locks and secure the sarcophagus lid.",
              "[150] The government held a lavish event at the tomb to celebrate its reopening, attended by officials and celebrity guests.",
              "[151] The attendance of British officials at the reopening ceremony signalled that the British government would not support Carter in the dispute.",
              "[Note 5] Nevertheless he sued the Antiquities Service in the Mixed Courts of Egypt, a colonial institution for resolving disputes involving non-Egyptians.",
              "[154] He used Carnarvon's lawyer, F.",
              "M.",
              "Maxwell, a politically insensitive choice, as Maxwell had been the prosecutor in Hanna's treason trial and sought the death penalty for him.",
              "In March Maxwell remarked in court that the government had seized control of the tomb \"like a bandit\".",
              "[155] In Arabic the word for \"bandit\" is so profound an insult that news of the remark provoked riots in Cairo.",
              "[156] The Mixed Courts ultimately ruled in Carter's favour, but Hanna took the case to a higher court, which on 31 March issued a decision that fully supported his actions.",
              "[155][157] Carter had left Egypt on 21 March, setting out on a lecture tour in the United States and Canada.",
              "His absence eased the tensions surrounding the tomb, as did the impending retirement of Maxwell, who began transferring his responsibilities to a more conciliatory lawyer, Georges Merzbach.",
              "[158][159] Meanwhile Hanna attempted to find another Egyptologist to complete the tomb clearance, but none were willing to take on the task.",
              "[160] In April, the Egyptian government sent a committee to inspect the excavators' unfinished work in the valley.",
              "Among the materials stored in the tombs, they discovered a wooden bust of Tutankhamun emerging from a lotus flower, packed in a crate, that was not included in Carter's excavation notes.",
              "The Egyptian members of the committee suspected Carter had intended to surreptitiously remove the bust from the site.",
              "When asked about it by telegram, Carter responded that the bust had been among the objects found in the entrance corridor, and that he and Callender had packed it because of its fragile state.",
              "[161] The political situation in Egypt changed dramatically on 19 November 1924, when Sir Lee Stack, the sirdar of the Egyptian Army, was assassinated by nationalists.",
              "The furious British reaction drove Zaghloul to resign.",
              "His successor, Ahmed Zeiwar Pasha, formed a more pro-British government, with which the parties involved in the tomb clearance were able to reach an agreement.",
              "Carter would continue to oversee the clearance;",
              "Lady Carnarvon would continue to fund it but renounced her claim to a share of the burial goods;",
              "[Note 6] and the Times monopoly was ended.",
              "Carter resumed work on 25 January 1925.",
              "[163][164] In the shortened and uneventful third season of the dig, the excavators removed nothing but worked to conserve the objects already in the laboratory tomb.",
              "[164] Thus press interest quickly dwindled,[164] and although coverage flared up when Tutankhamun's mummy was unwrapped, the remainder of the clearance took place out of the media spotlight.",
              "[166] Over the following summer Callender, who objected to his loss of income from the shortening of the season, fell out with Carter and resigned.",
              "[167] Burton, Lucas and the foremen were thus Carter's only consistent collaborators during the remainder of the process.",
              "[168] The fourth season began in late 1925 and focused on Tutankhamun's burial itself.",
              "[169] His mummy lay within a nested series of three coffins, of which the innermost was mainly composed of 110.",
              "4 kilograms (243 lb) of solid gold.",
              "On his body, and within his mummy wrappings, the king bore a plethora of jewellery and other objects, including a gold burial mask.",
              "[170] The inner coffin and the mummy had both been covered in unguents at burial.",
              "These unguents had solidified into hard resin, gluing the mummy and its trappings into a single mass stuck to the bottom of the inner coffin, which was in turn stuck to the bottom of the middle coffin.",
              "[171] The unguents had undergone a chemical reaction that had carbonised the linen mummy wrappings, and even some of the tissues of the mummy itself, rendering Tutankhamun's flesh extremely fragile.",
              "[172][173] The excavators first tried to melt the resin by taking the coffins out of the tomb to be heated by the sun, but this failed.",
              "[174] Therefore, Tutankhamun's remains were still in place within the coffins when the anatomists Douglas Derry and Saleh Bey Hamdi began examining them on 11 November 1925.",
              "Over the course of eight days they dismembered the mummy and individually chiselled the pieces out of the mass of resin, removing the burial goods as they did so, and examined the pieces individually.",
              "[175] Once the examination was complete the excavators began separating the coffins.",
              "They built trestles to suspend the conjoined coffins upside-down, then placed paraffin lamps underneath to raise the temperature to 500 \u00b0C (932 \u00b0F), shielding the coffins from the heat using wet blankets and plates of zinc.",
              "Once the coffins were pulled apart, the remaining resin was cleared away with solvents.",
              "[176][177] In this season Carter established a pattern of work that continued for the rest of the clearance process: in the first months of the season the excavators would remove objects from Tutankhamun's tomb, then after the new year open it to the public while concentrating on conserving the objects in the laboratory tomb.",
              "[178] Though the excavators had hoped to clear the treasury during the fourth season, the unexpected challenges of the burial chamber forced them to wait another year.",
              "[179] When resuming work in the fifth season Carter rearranged the pieces of the mummy to look whole once again, then placed them in the outermost coffin and covered the sarcophagus with a plate of glass instead of the original lid.",
              "With this done, the excavators dismantled the barrier to the treasury and began sorting through its contents: a shrine of the god Anubis, more boxes of belongings such as jewellery, wooden tomb models of boats and the canopic chest that contained the internal organs that were removed from Tutankhamun's body during embalming.",
              "The room's most unexpected contents were the mummies of two fetuses, which are presumed to be Tutankhamun's stillborn children.",
              "[180] In early 1927 Carter published the second volume of The Tomb of Tut.",
              "ankh.",
              "Amen, written with substantial anonymous help from a friend, the novelist Percy White.",
              "In the following season the excavators faced the annexe, which contained more than half of the individual objects in the entire tomb.",
              "[181] The floor of this room was entirely covered with haphazardly piled burial goods and lay nearly a metre below the floor of the antechamber.",
              "To start work in the annexe the excavators had to clear enough space to stand in the room by having one man lean through the doorway at a precarious angle, supported by slings held by three or four others standing in the antechamber.",
              "The last object was removed from the annexe on 15 December, and the rest of the season was spent on conservation.",
              "[182] Little was achieved in the sixth season, as Lucas and Burton developed illnesses that prevented them from working for several weeks.",
              "The seventh saw more contention between Carter and the authorities, as the Carnarvon concession expired in 1929 and ownership of the tomb reverted to the Egyptian government.",
              "Egyptian law forbade anyone not employed by the government to possess the keys to government property, and Carter objected to having to rely on a government inspector to open the tomb for him each day.",
              "In early 1930, the government came to its final settlement with Lady Carnarvon, compensating her with a payout for the expenses incurred during the excavation.",
              "[183] The final challenge involved conserving the dismantled pieces of the shrines, which were still stacked in the antechamber.",
              "[182] Harold Plenderleith, a scientist at the British Museum, intermittently assisted Carter and Lucas with this task.",
              "[184] The last of the shrine pieces were removed from the tomb in November 1930.",
              "Conservation of objects continued until February 1932, when the last burial goods were sent to Cairo.",
              "[185] The artefacts from the tomb were numbered at 5,398 distinct objects.",
              "[186] By Carter's estimation, one quarter of a per cent of these objects were damaged beyond repair.",
              "[187] Most of the remainder were sent to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo,[188] coming to form about a sixth of the museum's permanent exhibits.",
              "[71] The sarcophagus, outermost coffin, and mummy remained in the burial chamber, as did a skullcap and large bib-like broad collar, both made of delicate beadwork, that Carter apparently thought too fragile to remove from the mummy.",
              "[189][Note 7] Retrospective discussion of the clearance tends to emphasize how scrupulous and methodical the process was.",
              "[191] Jason Thompson, author of a history of Egyptology, regards Carter as one of the three most skilled archaeologists working in Egypt in his time and says that if Davis had discovered the tomb in 1914, the clearance \"would have been substandard at best, and the contents of the tomb probably would have been dispersed\".",
              "[192] Yet Carter did give out some small objects to visitors to the tomb or to fellow Egyptologists, where they may have found their way into museum collections.",
              "Gardiner, for instance, had a falling-out with Carter in 1934 after realising an amulet that Carter had given him had been stolen from the tomb.",
              "[193][194] The Egyptologist Bob Brier says of these artefacts that \"Carter believed he had a right to do with them as he pleased.\"",
              "[195] After Carter's death in 1939 his niece and heir, Phyllis Walker, discovered several such objects among his possessions and had them returned to Egypt.",
              "[196] In 1978 Thomas Hoving, a former curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, pointed out several items in the museum's collection that were not clearly traceable to the tomb but that he thought likely to have originated there.",
              "[197] The museum gave several of these objects to the Egyptian government in 2010.",
              "[198] The final volume of The Tomb of Tut.",
              "ankh.",
              "Amen, covering the treasury and annexe, was published in 1933.",
              "Yet the three volumes, aimed at the general public, did not constitute a full archaeological description of the tomb and its contents.",
              "[199] The clearance process had produced a large volume of documentation.",
              "[200] Nearly every object was catalogued, and most were photographed by Burton, although many minor objects, somewhere between fifteen and twenty per cent of the total, were not photographed.",
              "[201] Several experts had produced specialised contributions, such as Derry and Hamdi's anatomical examination and Newberry's botanical studies.",
              "Carter hoped to assemble all this material into a formal Egyptological report.",
              "Beyond outlining a general six-volume plan, he had not begun on the project by the time he died.",
              "[202] The Egyptian Council of Ministers moved to fund a full publication of the tomb in 1951, but the effort died in the wake of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.",
              "[203] Shortly after Carter's death, Walker donated his journals and notes on the excavation to the Griffith Institute at the University of Oxford.",
              "In the 1990s the institute launched an effort to scan this material, which they made available online in the early 2010s.",
              "[204][205] When the tomb was discovered, Egyptologists hoped it might contain documents that would clarify the history of the period in which Tutankhamun lived.",
              "No such documents were found, but the artefacts did provide clues.",
              "[206] The dates on wine jars from the tomb established that Tutankhamun had not reigned much longer than nine years.",
              "[207] Egyptologists had previously assumed his only claim to the throne was through his marriage to his queen, Ankhesenamun, and perhaps that he had been an elderly courtier.",
              "Yet the examination of the mummy revealed that he was between the ages of 17 and 22 at death, and the unusual shape of his skull resembled that of the unidentified royal mummy from the KV55 tomb, suggesting that he was related to it and was thus of royal blood himself.",
              "[208][209] Some artworks from the tomb are in the art style of the Amarna Period, and some refer to the Aten, the deity worshipped in that period, indicating that the return to orthodoxy during Tutankhamun's reign was gradual.",
              "[210][211] Much of the tomb's historical value was in the burial goods, which included sumptuous examples of ancient Egyptian decorative arts and enhanced the understanding of the material culture of the New Kingdom, primarily how royalty lived.",
              "[212][213] Many of the clothes from the tomb, for example, are far more varied and embellished than the clothes portrayed in art from Tutankhamun's time.",
              "[214] The tomb also provides exceptional evidence about tomb robbery and official restoration efforts, because the presence of most of the burial goods makes it possible to partly reconstruct what was stolen and what was restored.",
              "[215] The discovery marked a change in the history of the Valley of the Kings.",
              "Once the clearance was complete, many Egyptologists lost interest in the valley, assuming there was nothing left there to be found.",
              "[216][217] What little archaeological work took place in the valley over the next few decades largely consisted of more fully recording what had already been unearthed.",
              "[217] No further tombs were discovered in the valley until 2006, when KV63 was found.",
              "[218][Note 8] The discovery also affected Egyptology in a different way: together with Egypt's newfound partial independence, the enthusiasm surrounding Tutankhamun helped stimulate the growth of Egyptian Egyptology.",
              "[221] At the time of the discovery very few Egyptians were trained in archaeology, and those few were looked down upon by European Egyptologists.",
              "[222] Hamdi was the only Egyptian among the specialised experts who worked on the tomb.",
              "The first Egyptian university programme for Egyptology was established in 1924, and over the course of the decade a new generation of Egyptian Egyptologists were trained.",
              "[223] Although Western public interest in Tutankhamun experienced a lull lasting more than thirty years, it was revived after the Egyptian government began sending the burial goods on international museum exhibitions.",
              "[166] The exhibitions began in the early 1960s as a means of encouraging Western support for the relocation of ancient Egyptian monuments that were threatened to be flooded by the construction of the Aswan High Dam.",
              "[224] Such exhibitions proved highly popular;",
              "the one that toured the United States in the 1970s drew more than eight million visitors and moved American museums' business model to focus on lucrative blockbuster exhibitions.",
              "[225] Much of the revenue from the exhibitions went to support the monuments' relocation[226] and to pay for improvements to the Egyptian Museum.",
              "[227] The exhibitions also served other diplomatic functions, helping to improve Egypt's relations with Britain and France after the Suez Crisis in 1956, and with the United States after the Yom Kippur War in 1973.",
              "[228] Today the discovery remains the most famous find in the Valley of the Kings[229] and Tutankhamun the best-known ruler of ancient Egypt.",
              "[230] It is also considered one of the greatest discoveries in archaeology.",
              "[231] The Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves writes that thanks to his fame, Tutankhamun \"has been reborn as Egypt's most famous son, to achieve true immortality at last.\"",
              "[232] The tomb and its treasures are key attractions for Egypt's tourist industry[233] and sources of pride for the Egyptian public.",

              "Howard Carter was born in Kensington on 9 May 1874,[1] the youngest child (of eleven) of artist and illustrator Samuel John Carter and Martha Joyce Carter (ne\u0301e Sands).",
              "His father helped train and develop his artistic talents.",
              "[2] Carter spent much of his childhood with relatives in the Norfolk market town of Swaffham, the birthplace of both his parents.",
              "[3][4] His father had previously relocated to London, but after three of the children had died young, Carter, who was a sickly child, was moved to Norfolk and raised for the most part by a nurse in Swaffham.",
              "[5] Receiving only limited formal education at Swaffham, he showed talent as an artist.",
              "The nearby mansion of the Amherst family, Didlington Hall, contained a sizable collection of Egyptian antiques, which sparked Carter's interest in that subject.",
              "Lady Amherst was impressed by his artistic skills, and in 1891 she prompted the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF) to send Carter to assist an Amherst family friend, Percy Newberry, in the excavation and recording of Middle Kingdom tombs at Beni Hasan.",
              "[6] Although only 17, Carter was innovative in improving the methods of copying tomb decoration.",
              "In 1892, he worked under the tutelage of Flinders Petrie for one season at Amarna, the capital founded by the pharaoh Akhenaten.",
              "From 1894 to 1899, he worked with E\u0301douard Naville at Deir el-Bahari, where he recorded the wall reliefs in the temple of Hatshepsut.",
              "[7] In 1899, Carter was appointed Inspector of Monuments for Upper Egypt in the Egyptian Antiquities Service (EAS).",
              "[8] Based at Luxor, he oversaw a number of excavations and restorations at nearby Thebes, while in the Valley of the Kings he supervised the systematic exploration of the valley by the American archaeologist Theodore Davis.",
              "[7] In the early 1902, Carter began searching the Valley of the Kings on his own.",
              "He initially aimed at the southeast rocky wall of the valley basin.",
              "Despite being an inaccessible area, within 3 days he found what he was looking for: stone steps, sepulchral entrance, corridor, sarcophagus chamber, in short, the last home of the fourth Thutmose, carefully stripped (except for a few furnishings and a cart).",
              "While digging to find Thutmose IV's final resting place, Howard unearthed an alabaster cup and a small blue scarab with Queen Hatshepsut's name on it.",
              "[9] On February 1903, sixty meters north of the tomb of Thutmose IV, Carter found a stone bearing the ring with the name of Hatshepsut.",
              "In 1904, after a dispute with local people over tomb thefts, he was transferred to the Inspectorate of Lower Egypt.",
              "[10] Carter was praised for his improvements in the protection of, and accessibility to, existing excavation sites,[11] and his development of a grid-block system for searching for tombs.",
              "The Antiquities Service also provided funding for Carter to head his own excavation projects.",
              "Carter resigned from the Antiquities Service in 1905 after a formal inquiry into what became known as the Saqqara Affair, a violent confrontation that took place on January 8, 1905.",
              "between Egyptian site guards and a group of French tourists.",
              "Carter sided with the Egyptian personnel, refusing to apologise when the French authorities made an official complaint.",
              "[12] Moving back to Luxor, Carter was without formal employment for nearly three years.",
              "He made a living by painting and selling watercolours to tourists and, in 1906, acting as a freelance draughtsman for Theodore Davis.",
              "[13] In 1907, he began work for Lord Carnarvon, who employed him to supervise the excavation of nobles' tombs in Deir el-Bahri, near Thebes.",
              "[14] Gaston Maspero, head of the Egyptian Antiquities Service, had recommended Carter to Carnarvon as he knew he would apply modern archaeological methods and systems of recording.",
              "[15] Carter soon developed a good working relationship with his patron, with Lady Burghclere, Carnarvon's sister, observing that \"for the next sixteen years the two men worked together with varying fortune, yet ever united not more by their common aim than by their mutual regard and affection\".",
              "[16] In 1914, Lord Carnarvon received the concession to dig in the Valley of the Kings.",
              "[17] Carter led the work, undertaking a systematic search for any tombs missed by previous expeditions, in particular that of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun.",
              "However, excavations were soon interrupted by the First World War, Carter spending the war years working for the British Government as a diplomatic courier and translator.",
              "He enthusiastically resumed his excavation work towards the end of 1917.",
              "[17] By 1922, Lord Carnarvon had become dissatisfied with the lack of results after several years of finding little.",
              "After considering withdrawing his funding, Carnarvon agreed, after a discussion with Carter, that he would fund one more season of work in the Valley of the Kings.",
              "[18] Carter returned to the Valley of Kings, and investigated a line of huts that he had abandoned a few seasons earlier.",
              "The crew cleared the huts and rock debris beneath.",
              "On 4 November 1922, their young water boy accidentally stumbled on a stone that turned out to be the top of a flight of steps cut into the bedrock.",
              "[19] Carter had the steps partially dug out until the top of a mud-plastered doorway was found.",
              "The doorway was stamped with indistinct cartouches (oval seals with hieroglyphic writing).",
              "Carter ordered the staircase to be refilled, and sent a telegram to Carnarvon, who arrived from England two-and-a-half weeks later on 23 November, accompanied by his daughter Lady Evelyn Herbert.",
              "[20] On 24 November 1922, the full extent of the stairway was cleared and a seal containing Tutankhamun's cartouche found on the outer doorway.",
              "This door was removed and the rubble-filled corridor behind cleared, revealing the door of the tomb itself.",
              "[21] On 26 November, Carter, with Carnarvon, Lady Evelyn and assistant Arthur Callender in attendance, made a \"tiny breach in the top left-hand corner\" of the doorway, using a chisel that his grandmother had given him for his 17th birthday.",
              "He was able to peer in by the light of a candle and see that many of the gold and ebony treasures were still in place.",
              "He did not yet know whether it was \"a tomb or merely an old cache\", but he did see a promising sealed doorway between two sentinel statues.",
              "Carnarvon asked, \"Can you see anything?\"",
              "Carter replied: \"Yes, wonderful things!\"",
              "[22] Carter had, in fact, discovered Tutankhamun's tomb (subsequently designated KV62).",
              "[23] The tomb was then secured, to be entered in the presence of an official of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities the next day.",
              "[24] However that night, Carter, Carnarvon, Lady Evelyn and Callender apparently made an unauthorised visit, becoming the first people in modern times to enter the tomb.",
              "[25][26][27] Some sources suggest that the group also entered the inner burial chamber.",
              "[28] In this account, a small hole was found in the chamber's sealed doorway and Carter, Carnarvon and Lady Evelyn crawled through.",
              "[27] The next morning, 27 November, saw an inspection of the tomb in the presence of an Egyptian official.",
              "Callender rigged up electric lighting, illuminating a vast haul of items, including gilded couches, chests, thrones, and shrines.",
              "They also saw evidence of two further chambers, including the sealed doorway to the inner burial chamber, guarded by two life-size statues of Tutankhamun.",
              "[29] In spite of evidence of break-ins in ancient times, the tomb was virtually intact, and would ultimately be found to contain over 5,000 items. On 29 November the tomb was officially opened in the presence of a number of invited dignitaries and Egyptian officials.",
              "[30] Realising the size and scope of the task ahead, Carter sought help from Albert Lythgoe of the Metropolitan Museum's excavation team, working nearby, who readily agreed to lend a number of his staff, including Arthur Mace and archaeological photographer Harry Burton,[31] while the Egyptian government loaned analytical chemist Alfred Lucas.",
              "[32] The next several months were spent cataloguing and conserving the contents of the antechamber under the \"often stressful\" supervision of Pierre Lacau, director general of the Department of Antiquities.",
              "[33] On 16 February 1923, Carter opened the sealed doorway and confirmed it led to a burial chamber, containing the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun.",
              "The tomb was considered the best preserved and most intact pharaonic tomb ever found in the Valley of the Kings, and the discovery was eagerly covered by the world's press.",
              "However, much to the annoyance of other newspapers, Lord Carnarvon sold exclusive reporting rights to The Times.",
              "Only Arthur Merton of that paper was allowed on the scene, and his vivid descriptions helped to establish Carter's reputation with the British public.",
              "[34] Towards the end of February 1923, a rift between Lord Carnarvon and Carter, probably caused by a disagreement on how to manage the supervising Egyptian authorities, temporarily halted the excavation.",
              "Work recommenced in early March after Lord Carnarvon apologised to Carter.",
              "[35] Later that month Lord Carnarvon contracted blood poisoning while staying in Luxor near the tomb site.",
              "He died in Cairo on 5 April 1923.",
              "[36] Lady Carnarvon retained her late husband's concession in the Valley of the Kings, allowing Carter to continue his work.",
              "Carter's meticulous assessing and cataloguing of the thousands of objects in the tomb took nearly ten years, most being moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
              "There were several breaks in the work, including one lasting nearly a year in 1924\u201325, caused by a dispute over what Carter saw as excessive control of the excavation by the Egyptian Antiquities Service.",
              "The Egyptian authorities eventually agreed that Carter should complete the tomb's clearance.",
              "[37] This continued until 1929, with some final work lasting until February 1932.",
              "[38] Despite the significance of his archaeological find, Carter received no honour from the British government.",
              "However, in 1926, he received the Order of the Nile, third class, from King Fuad I of Egypt.",
              "[39] He was also awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Yale University and honorary membership in the Real Academia de la Historia of Madrid, Spain.",
              "[40] Carter wrote a number of books on Egyptology during his career,[41] including Five Years' Exploration at Thebes, co-written with Lord Carnarvon in 1912, describing their early excavations,[42] and a three-volume popular account of the discovery and excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb.",
              "[43] He also delivered a series of illustrated lectures on the excavation, including a 1924 tour of Britain, France, Spain and the United States.",
              "[44] Those in New York and other US cities were attended by large and enthusiastic audiences, sparking American Egyptomania,[45] with President Coolidge requesting a private lecture.",
              "[46] In 2022, a 1934 letter to Carter from Alan Gardiner came to light, accusing him of stealing from Tutankhamun's tomb.",
              "Carter had given Gardiner an amulet and assured him it had not come from the tomb, but Reginald Engelbach, director of the Egyptian Museum, later confirmed its match with other samples originating in the tomb.",
              "Egyptologist Bob Brier said the letter proved previous rumours, and the contemporary suspicions of Egyptian authorities, that Carter had been siphoning treasures for himself.",
              "[47] Carter could be awkward in company, particularly with those of a higher social standing.",
              "[48] Often abrasive, he admitted to having a hot temper,[49] which often aggravated disputes, including the 1905 Saqqara Affair and the 1924\u201325 dispute with Egyptian authorities.",
              "The suggestion that Carter had an affair with Lady Evelyn Herbert,[50] the daughter of the 5th Earl of Carnarvon, was later rejected by Lady Evelyn herself, who told her daughter Patricia that \"at first I was in awe of him, later I was rather frightened of him\", resenting Carter's \"determination\" to come between her and her father.",
              "[51] More recently, the 8th Earl dismissed the idea, describing Carter as a \"stoical loner\".",
              "[52] Harold Plenderleith, a former associate of Carter's at the British Museum, was quoted as saying that he knew \"something about Carter that was not fit to disclose\", which some have interpreted as meaning that Plenderleith believed that Carter was homosexual.",
              "[53] An Egyptian guide who knew Carter claimed that his tastes extended to \"both boys and the occasional 'dancing girl'\"[54] There is, however, no evidence that Carter enjoyed any close relationships throughout his life,[55] and he never married nor had children.",
              "[45] After the clearance of the tomb had been completed in 1932 Carter retired from excavation work.",
              "He continued to live in his house near Luxor in winter and retained a flat in London but, as interest in Tutankhamun declined, he lived a fairly isolated existence with few close friends.",
              "[56] He had acted as a part-time dealer for both collectors and museums for a number of years.",
              "[57] He continued in this role, including acting for the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Detroit Institute of Arts.",
              "Carter died from Hodgkin's disease aged 64 at his London flat at 49 Albert Court, next to the Royal Albert Hall, on 2 March 1939.",
              "[58][59][60][61] He was buried in Putney Vale Cemetery in London on 6 March, nine people attending his funeral.",
              "[62] His love for Egypt remained strong;",
              "the epitaph on his gravestone reads: \"May your spirit live, may you spend millions of years, you who love Thebes, sitting with your face to the north wind, your eyes beholding happiness\", a quotation taken from the Wishing Cup of Tutankhamun,[63] and \"O night, spread thy wings over me as the imperishable stars\".",
              "[64] Probate was granted on 5 July 1939 to Egyptologist Henry Burton and to publisher Bruce Sterling Ingram.",
              "Carter is described as Howard Carter of Luxor, Upper Egypt, Africa, and of 49 Albert Court, Kensington Grove, Kensington, London.",
              "His estate was valued at \u00a32,002 (equivalent to \u00a3132,051 in 2021).",
              "The second grant of Probate was issued in Cairo on 1 September 1939.",
              "[65] In his role as executor, Burton identified at least 18 items in Carter's antiquities collection that had been taken from Tutankhamun's tomb without authorisation.",
              "As this was a sensitive matter that could affect Anglo-Egyptian relations, Burton sought wider advice, finally recommending that the items be discreetly presented or sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, with most eventually going either there or to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
              "[66] The Metropolitan Museum items were later returned to Egypt.",
              "[67] Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb revived popular interest in Ancient Egypt \u2013 'Egyptomania' \u2013 and created \"Tutmania\", which influenced popular song and fashion.",
              "[68] Carter used this heightened interest to promote his books on the discovery and his lecture tours in Britain, America and Europe.",
              "[44] While interest had waned by the mid-1930s,[69] from the early 1970s touring exhibitions of the tomb's artefacts led to a sustained rise in popularity.",
              "This has been reflected in TV dramas, films and books, with Carter's quest and discovery of the tomb portrayed with varying levels of accuracy.",
              "[70] One common element in popular representations of the excavation is the idea of a 'curse'.",
              "Carter consistently dismissed the suggestion as 'tommy-rot', commenting that \"the sentiment of the Egyptologist .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "is not one of fear, but of respect and awe .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "entirely opposed to foolish superstitions\".",

              "Beyond a door simply marked \u201cArchive\u201d is what looks like a normal office: fluorescent lights, cheap blue carpet and a row of plain gray rolling stacks.",
              "It doesn\u2019t seem like the most fertile ground for archaeological discovery.",
              "But the hum of the air conditioner lets slip that this modest room is protecting something special.",

              "This is the archive of the Griffith Institute, arguably the best Egyptology library in the world and home to the legacy of Howard Carter, the British archaeologist who led the discovery of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb 100 years ago this November.",
              "The story of Carter\u2019s incredible find has been recounted so many times that it becomes more like a myth with every retelling.",
              "Some of the details wear ever deeper, like ruts, while others have faded from memory.",
              "But the notebooks, sketches, diaries and diagrams held in these dull-looking stacks contain the firsthand thoughts and impressions Carter recorded at the time.",
              "That\u2019s what brought me here a few years ago, while researching my 2013 book, The Shadow King, which investigates our modern obsession with the elusive Pharaoh Tutankhamun.",
              "I wanted to look afresh at Carter\u2019s discovery, working from original sources to recover lost details and bring the story back to life.",
              "I visited the archive accompanied by its soft-spoken keeper, Jaromir Malek, and his assistant, Elizabeth Fleming.",
              "On the wall hung a somber portrait of Carter, his small, piercing, black eyes gazing irritably down.",
              "He looked less like a pioneering Egyptologist than an accountant or a banker.",
              "But Fleming assured me the man had vision and a sense of beauty.",
              "To prove it, she brought out perhaps the archive\u2019s most aesthetically pleasing items\u2014a collection of graceful watercolors painted by Carter himself during the last decade of the 19th century.",
              "Carter\u2019s artistic ability was what brought him to Egypt in the first place.",
              "He was born in London in 1874, the youngest of eight surviving children, and his father painted animal portraits\u2014mainly dogs and horses\u2014for rich local clients.",
              "Through his father, Carter met an Egyptologist named Percy Newberry, who in 1891 arranged for Carter, then only 17, to travel to Egypt to help record the extensive artwork being uncovered in tombs and temples around the country.",
              "Carter soon showed great promise as an archaeologist in his own right, learning rigorous methods from Flinders Petrie, who pretty much invented the idea of archaeology as a science and is today perhaps the only Egyptologist who can rival Carter\u2019s fame.",
              "In the watercolors Fleming showed me, Carter copied ancient Egyptian depictions of various animals and birds, painting them alongside their modern-day equivalents\u2014inhabitants of the desert around him, from the scimitar-horned oryx and Nubian ibex to the Egyptian vulture, falcon and red-backed shrike.",
              "The pictures are elegant and effortless, with the attention to detail of someone who is both knowledgeable and passionate about his subject.",
              "Award-winning science writer Jo Marchant traces the mummy's story from its first brutal autopsy in 1925 to the most recent arguments over its DNA.",
              "In the early 1900s, Carter took a series of jobs with the Egyptian antiquities service, holding several senior positions, including chief inspector of antiquities in Lower Egypt, a prestigious posting that included responsibility for the Great Pyramids, near Cairo.",
              "(He lost the job after instructing Egyptian guards to defend themselves against a party of drunken French tourists who tried to force their way onto a site.)",
              "His career in the service over, Carter moved to the city of Luxor, in southern Egypt, and scraped by selling his watercolors to tourists.",
              "Carter\u2019s dream was always to excavate a single site: the Valley of the Kings.",
              "This secluded, barren ravine, hidden behind limestone cliffs, lies just across the Nile from Luxor.",
              "Beginning in the early 19th century, Western excavators unearthed dozens of royal tombs dug into its walls.",
              "But the rights to dig in the valley were always held by others, and Carter could only watch as his rivals made a series of remarkable finds.",
              "One of the most successful excavators was a retired American lawyer named Theodore Davis, who had a huge fortune but no patience for scientific procedure.",
              "Most of the royal resting places found in the valley were raided and emptied in ancient times, but Davis uncovered several intact tombs from the latter part of Egypt\u2019s great 18th Dynasty, dating to 3,300 years ago.",
              "These included the pristine chambers of the parents of Queen Tiye (who lived circa 1390 B.",
              "C.",
              "E.",
              "to 1353 B.",
              "C.",
              "E.)",
              "and a mysterious tomb known as KV55, which held a cache of treasure and a nameless mummy suspected to belong to Tiye\u2019s son, the rebellious pharaoh Akhenaten, who threw out Egypt\u2019s traditional religion and built a new capital city in the desert at Amarna.",
              "Carter, carefully studying the scars left in the valley by previous excavators, was certain there were places that hadn\u2019t yet been searched, particularly in the central floor of the valley, not far from Davis\u2019 finds, beneath a spot covered by ancient flood debris.",
              "He became convinced this area would yield the tomb of a little-known king named Tutankhamun, who ruled shortly after Akhenaten and restored Egypt\u2019s traditional order.",
              "Tutankhamun was one of the few 18th-Dynasty pharaohs for whom neither a tomb nor a mummy had been found.",
              "Several items among Davis\u2019 finds bore his name, including a strange collection of large earthen pots, which were filled with broken pottery, bags of powder and dried flowers.",
              "What was more, the entrance to KV55 bore seal impressions associated with Tutankhamun, suggesting it had been closed during his reign.",
              "Carter hypothesized that if Tutankhamun had buried his predecessor here, he might have chosen a similar location for himself.",
              "In 1914, Davis, close to death, finally gave up the rights to dig in the valley, famously saying, \u201cI fear the Valley of the Tombs is now exhausted.",
              "\u201d Most other Egyptologists agreed with him, but Carter, who had by then teamed up with a rich patron\u2014the English aristocrat George Herbert, Earl of Carnarvon\u2014seized his chance.",
              "Before they could start digging, however, World War I broke out, and excavations ceased.",
              "Carnarvon turned his estate in England, Highclere Castle, into a military hospital (more recently it stood in for the home of the Crawley family in the British television series \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d);",
              "Carter worked for the foreign office in the Middle East.",
              "But archaeological activity slowly restarted during the later years of the war, and in November 1917, Carter was finally able to pursue his dream.",
              "In those days, the Valley of the Kings looked like a huge quarry, covered with piles of stones up to 30 feet high\u2014waste left by previous excavators.",
              "Before he could investigate the triangular patch of central valley floor he\u2019d chosen for his search, Carter had no choice but to clear tens of thousands of tons of this waste, then dig through an unexcavated layer of ancient flood debris all the way down to the bedrock.",
              "To remove the rubbish, he borrowed a railway track from the antiquities service, with trucks that were pushed along the rails by hand.",
              "His team of local workmen and boys\u2014the unsung Egyptians who carried out the real hard labor behind archaeological discoveries in the valley\u2014used picks and hoes to fill their baskets, then emptied them into the trucks thousands of times each day.",
              "Over month after month of backbreaking work, these men literally moved mountains, clearing hundreds of square feet of the valley.",
              "The waste layers were so closely fused with the natural soil that the workers had to keep a close watch for charcoal and fish bones, which signaled whether they were digging through untouched layers of earth or artificial layers dumped by previous excavators.",
              "Toward the end of that first season, in early 1918, the laborers uncovered the remains of a group of ancient workmen\u2019s huts, dating to the 19th Dynasty, just after Tutankhamun\u2019s time, right in front of the tomb of Ramses VI, which dated to around the same time.",
              "The huts were undisturbed, suggesting no one had penetrated the layer of flood debris beneath them since at least the second millennium B.",
              "C.",
              "E.",
              ", and stood only 40 feet from the KV55 cache.",
              "If there were an intact, undiscovered 18th-Dynasty tomb somewhere nearby, beneath those ancient huts was the perfect place to look.",
              "Yet Carter didn\u2019t.",
              "It\u2019s a decision that provides fascinating insight into his character.",
              "Later, he maintained that excavating beneath the huts would have cut off visitor access to Ramses\u2019 tomb, one of the most popular in the valley.",
              "But another explanation may have been that Carter, aware of how promising the site was, decided to save it for a time when Carnarvon\u2019s enthusiasm for funding his work might flag.",
              "Finding Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb was undoubtedly important to Carter, but he also valued the less-glamorous task of carefully checking each unexcavated part of the valley before his patron found something else to do.",
              "The Egyptologist John Romer, in his classic 1981 book Valley of the Kings, pointed out that instead of following up on \u201csuch a plum site, so large and obviously untouched,\u201d Carter next chose to investigate the foundation deposits of a previously known tomb.",
              "\u201cIndeed,\u201d wrote Romer, \u201cmost of Carter\u2019s activities in the valley were of this type, designed to settle scholarly questions on the dating and origin of the tombs.",
              "\u201d Perhaps we should see Carter as more methodically minded scientist than dogged tomb hunter.",
              "Whatever the reason, Carter worked elsewhere for five depressing seasons.",
              "During those long years, he found hardly anything, just a few ritual deposits marking the foundations of known tombs and a cache of 13 alabaster vases, which Carnarvon\u2019s daughter, Evelyn Herbert, who always accompanied her father on trips to Egypt, insisted on personally digging out of the ground.",
              "It was a lonely time for the archaeologist, and he must have wondered if his critics were right.",
              "But he loved the remote and solitary valley, with its rugged rocks, which he once said \u201cwere not unproductive of delight.",
              "\u201d Carter found it especially majestic during the 20-minute donkey ride to the home he\u2019d built for himself, nicknamed \u201cCastle Carter,\u201d when the noise of his donkey\u2019s footsteps was interrupted only by the booming of a desert eagle owl or the occasional howl of a jackal.",
              "By 1922, Carnarvon had serious doubts about continuing the work.",
              "He was tired of excavating with so little reward, not to mention the snide jokes of other Egyptologists.",
              "That summer, he invited Carter to Highclere, intending to bring the partnership to an end.",
              "But Carter didn\u2019t give up easily.",
              "He finally told Carnarvon about the prime site beneath the workmen\u2019s huts.",
              "Perhaps, to clinch the deal, Carter also mentioned a new clue suggesting that Tutankhamun really was buried in the valley.",
              "It had just come from Herbert Winlock, an Egyptologist at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York who was studying the debris-filled KV55 jars inscribed with Tutankhamun\u2019s name.",
              "Winlock, comparing the seemingly meaningless scraps with other discoveries elsewhere, finally realized what they were\u2014the materials used in Tutankhamun\u2019s embalming.",
              "Ancient Egyptians didn\u2019t throw away anything that touched the king\u2019s body as it was being prepared for burial;",
              "instead, they carefully gathered all the rubbish and buried it close to the relevant tomb.",
              "Some of the jars contained the powdered salts embalmers used to dry out the body and the rags they cleaned up with afterward.",
              "Other pots contained broken pottery, animal bones and flower necklaces\u2014likely the remains of the banquet held at Tutankhamun\u2019s funeral, including floral garlands worn by the guests.",
              "It was the surest sign yet that the king\u2019s tomb was nearby.",
              "In October 1922, with Carnarvon\u2019s support, Carter returned to the valley for one final season.",
              "At the Griffith Institute, Fleming brought out the notebooks describing what happened next.",
              "There was a small diary, cream-colored with a red spine, as well as a larger ring binder\u2014Carter\u2019s excavation journal.",
              "Together with popular books about Tutankhamun that Carter wrote over the following decade, they provide a pretty good sense of what he was up to in those historic days and weeks.",
              "Carter started excavations on November 1, 1922, exactly where he had left off in 1918, by the workmen\u2019s huts in front of Ramses VI\u2019s tomb.",
              "He spent the next couple of days uncovering more huts, noting their details, then removing them to clear away the three feet or so of stony soil that lay between them and bedrock.",
              "On Saturday, November 4, Carter arrived at the dig site at about ten in the morning to find his usually rowdy team of workmen strangely quiet.",
              "At first, he feared there had been an accident.",
              "Then, one of his foremen, the Egyptian Ahmed Gerigar, told him that the workers had discovered a step, cut into bedrock under one of the first huts they\u2019d cleared.",
              "As the men dug further, a steep, sunken staircase began to emerge, cut into the rock about 12 feet below the entrance of Ramses VI\u2019s tomb.",
              "Carter tried to suppress his excitement.",
              "Toward sunset on Sunday, the men exposed the upper part of a door made from rough stones and covered with plaster.",
              "The seals on the door, showing the jackal god Anubis over nine bound captives\u2014the official seal of the Royal Necropolis\u2014were intact.",
              "There was no visible sign of exactly who was buried inside, but the style was 18th Dynasty.",
              "Carter broke through the plaster and removed the stones from the upper right corner of the door.",
              "Then he shone in a flashlight.",
              "The passage was filled with stones and rubble\u2014more evidence that the last people to enter had been the priests who sealed it, not thieves.",
              "\u201cIt was a thrilling moment for an excavator,\u201d Carter wrote in his journal on November 5, \u201cto suddenly find himself, after so many years of toilsome work, on the verge of what looked like a magnificent discovery\u2014an untouched tomb.",
              "\u201d Carter knew he could proceed no further without his sponsor present.",
              "Reluctantly, he closed the hole he had made, and the next morning, he cabled Carnarvon at Highclere: \u201cAt last have made wonderful discovery in Valley;",
              "a magnificent tomb with seals intact, recovered same for your arrival, congratulations.",
              "\u201d The next day, the men worked feverishly to protect the find from looters;",
              "they covered up the door and steps, then rolled boulders over the entrance.",
              "The tomb vanished, and more than once, Carter found himself wondering if finding it had even been real.",
              "He spent the next couple of weeks preparing to open the tomb and hiring staff, including Arthur Callender, an old friend and retired railway engineer who was to be his right-hand man in the work ahead.",
              "Carnarvon and his daughter arrived in Luxor on November 22.",
              "By November 24, the workmen had reached the doorway.",
              "Now the lower part of the door was uncovered for the first time\u2014and there on the door were seal impressions showing a basket, scarab beetle and the sun\u2019s disk, the cartouche of none other than Tutankhamun.",
              "The workmen pulled down the rough stones of the door and began to empty the corridor behind.",
              "By the afternoon of Sunday, November 26, after clearing a steep passage about 30 feet long, the workmen came to a second sealed door.",
              "Again, Carter removed stones to make a hole in the top corner.",
              "He poked an iron testing rod into the darkness, then lit a candle to check that the air was safe to breathe.",
              "Reassured that the air wasn\u2019t poisonous, he widened the hole and looked in.",
              "Carnarvon, Herbert, Callender and several of the Egyptian foremen waited anxiously behind him.",
              "Carter\u2019s candlelight crept uninvited into the darkness.",
              "Inside the tomb, time creaked into motion.",
              "Blurred shapes came into focus.",
              "Objects lumbered into being.",
              "After thousands of years of silence, the tomb had visitors.",
              "From reading Carter\u2019s diaries, Malek, keeper of the Griffith Institute\u2019s archive, told me, \u201cHe was obviously a man of few words.",
              "He was very prosaic, very down to earth.",
              "But when you read Carter\u2019s description of when they first opened the tomb, he suddenly becomes a poet.",
              "\u201d With white-gloved hands, Malek\u2019s assistant, Fleming, pulled Carter\u2019s yellowed journal from a cardboard case and laid it gently on a cushion.",
              "She found the famous page\u2014square paper filled with neat, black ink\u2014and started to read Carter\u2019s stiff but evocative words: It was sometime before one could see, the hot air escaping caused the candle to flicker, but as soon as one\u2019s eyes became accustomed to the glimmer of light the interior of the chamber gradually loomed before one, with its strange and wonderful medley of extraordinary and beautiful objects heaped upon one another.",
              "At first, Carter thought he was looking at wall paintings;",
              "it was a moment before he realized he was seeing actual three-dimensional objects.",
              "Carnarvon couldn\u2019t bear it any longer.",
              "\u201cCan you see anything?",
              "\u201d he demanded.",
              "As with many details of this story, different sources give different accounts for what happened next.",
              "In his excavation journal, Carter wrote that he answered, \u201cYes, it is wonderful.",
              "\u201d An account written by Carnarvon gives the rather less catchy \u201cThere are some marvelous objects here.",
              "\u201d But the most memorable\u2014and most quoted\u2014version is the one Carter came up with later, probably with help from his co-author, Arthur Mace, for his 1923 popular account of the discovery, in which he simply says, \u201cYes, wonderful things.",
              "\u201d Widening the hole in the door, the others crowded together and shined a light into the darkness.",
              "What they saw arguably still stands as the most amazing archaeological discovery of all time.",
              "Looming out of the darkness of the chamber were two ebony-black statues of a king with gold staffs, kilts and sandals;",
              "gilded couches with the heads of strange beasts;",
              "exquisitely painted ornamental caskets;",
              "dried flowers;",
              "alabaster vases;",
              "strange black shrines adorned with a gilded monster snake;",
              "white chests;",
              "finely carved chairs;",
              "a golden throne;",
              "a heap of curious white egg-shaped boxes;",
              "stools of all shapes and designs;",
              "and a scramble of overturned chariot parts, glinting with gold.",
              "The impression was not so much that of an orderly royal tomb, Carter wrote in his journal on November 26, but \u201cthe property-room of an opera of a vanished civilization.",
              "\u201d News of the discovery quickly spread, along with a variety of tall tales.",
              "One local legend held that three mysterious airplanes had landed in the valley and taken off to an unknown destination loaded with treasure.",
              "On November 29, Carter held an official opening of the tomb\u2019s antechamber, attended by various Egyptian and foreign notables and a reporter from the London Times.",
              "The paper raved about the tomb\u2019s contents: a child\u2019s stool, quaint bronze musical instruments, a dummy for wigs and robes, and food including trussed duck and haunches of venison.",
              "Archaeology was changed forever, and Carter, who might have retired from excavation after his final season with Carnarvon, faced a challenge greater than any archaeologist before him: recording, retrieving and conserving thousands of fragile artifacts from this packed space while the whole world was watching.",
              "Before long, the Valley of the Kings became like a little village, with Carter and his newly enlarged team of assistants\u2014including draftsmen, a chemist and conservator, and a photographer\u2014using a variety of nearby tombs for different purposes.",
              "The tomb originally holding the KV55 cache became a darkroom, the entrance hung with a pair of heavy black curtains.",
              "In the long, narrow passage leading into the tomb of Seti II, 300 feet long and just 12 feet wide, conservator Arthur Mace and chemist Alfred Lucas set up a laboratory.",
              "The deeper part was used for storage, while the upper section (where the electric lights could reach) hosted wooden tables, benches, and shelves filled with bottles of conservation materials, including acetone, paraffin, celluloid solution and beeswax.",
              "Stabilizing the objects coming out of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb was almost impossibly difficult, as they were liable to fall apart at the touch.",
              "It took three weeks to empty a single casket of the king\u2019s clothing;",
              "one robe alone sported more than 3,000 gold sequins and 12,000 blue beads, each in danger of falling off.",
              "Meanwhile, tourists and journalists flocked to Luxor by the thousands.",
              "The city was so deluged by newspaper dispatches that three new telegraph lines were laid direct to Cairo, and a local hospital was turned into a telegraph office.",
              "Luxor\u2019s two biggest hotels set up tents in their gardens, asking guests to sleep on army cots.",
              "Each day, visitors crossed the river on wooden sailing boats called feluccas, then headed into the valley by donkey, sand cart or horse-drawn cab.",
              "There, they made themselves at home, sitting on a wall around the top of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb.",
              "About once a day, Carter\u2019s team brought out the most recently retrieved objects and carried them in a convoy to the lab.",
              "The priceless artifacts looked like casualties of war on their wooden stretchers, wrapped in surgical bandages and fixed with safety pins.",
              "Carter himself was bombarded with letters and telegrams: congratulations, offers of assistance, requests for souvenirs, offers of money for everything from movie rights to copyright on Egyptian fashions of dress.",
              "He was given advice on how to preserve antiquities and how to appease evil spirits.",
              "Shoemakers wanted the design of the royal slippers, and grocers wanted parcels of mummified foods\u2014apparently, they expected them to be canned.",
              "Eventually, the contents of the tomb would number more than 5,000 items. Over the next eight years, Carter carefully worked his way through four densely packed chambers, revealing treasures ranging from jewelry and model boats to hunting chariots and an ostrich feather fan.",
              "The deepest chamber, nicknamed the Treasury, was guarded by a huge black jackal, representing the god Anubis, with a linen cloak, collar of blue flowers, claws of silver, and ears and eyes of gold.",
              "Clues such as dirty footprints and fingermarks in jars of perfumed oil showed that there had indeed been ancient looters, though they didn\u2019t get away with much.",
              "In a side room, personal possessions painted a picture of the human being behind all the royal gold and treasure.",
              "One sturdy wooden chest, made up of complicated partitions and drawers, was stuffed with knickknacks and playthings from Tutankhamun\u2019s youth: anklets, pocket game boards, slings, paints, mechanical toys and a fire lighter.",
              "Carter scribbled details of them all on more than 3,500 notecards and hundreds of journal pages.",
              "Perhaps most impressive of all was the king\u2019s burial chamber, decorated with rich paintings and filled with four nested gilded shrines, at the center of which was a perfectly preserved sarcophagus made of pink quartzite.",
              "Reliefs of goddesses were carved onto each corner, protecting the sides and ends of the casket with their outstretched, winged arms. Carter finally came face to face with the king himself on February 12, 1924.",
              "By then, Carnarvon had been dead nearly a year, having suffered blood poisoning brought on by an infection after he sliced the top off a mosquito bite while shaving\u2014and inspiring the legend of Tutankhamun\u2019s curse.",
              "Opening the pharaoh\u2019s sarcophagus, Carter recalled later, was the \u201csupreme and culminating moment\u201d that he had looked forward to since it became clear the chambers he\u2019d discovered were an intact tomb.",
              "With a delicate pulley system, in front of an audience of dignitaries and VIPs, Carter slowly raised the huge, 2,500-pound stone lid.",
              "Inside, the contents were covered in shrouds.",
              "When he rolled them back, Carter wrote, \u201ca gasp of wonderment escaped our lips, so gorgeous was the sight that met our eyes.",
              "\u201d Inside was a glorious figure, seven feet long and made of wood that was covered in gold.",
              "The observers didn\u2019t yet know it, but this was only the outermost of three tightly fitting nesting coffins, each elaborately adorned, the inner one formed from solid gold.",
              "The form before them lay on a wooden bier, just as shown in the tomb paintings a few feet away.",
              "Its arms were folded across its chest, hands clasping a flail and crooked scepter made of gold and a ceramic glaze known as faience.",
              "The twin heads of a sacred cobra and vulture\u2014protectors of Upper and Lower Egypt, respectively\u2014were mounted on its golden forehead.",
              "For ancient Egyptians, the coffin represented the king\u2019s transformed immortal state, physically perfect and eternally young, with flesh of gold.",
              "But there was also a sign of human grief and frailty: a tiny wreath of olive leaves and cornflowers placed on the king\u2019s forehead, with fragile petals that still had a tinge of blue.",
              "\u201cMany and disturbing were our emotions,\u201d wrote Carter.",
              "\u201cMost of them voiceless.",
              "But, in that silence, to listen\u2014you could almost hear the ghostly footsteps of the departing mourners.",
              "\u201d According to the Times reporter present, the face of the coffin was so \u201cremarkably real\u201d that for a moment, the observers forgot they were gazing at a mere mummy case.",
              "It felt instead as if they were in the presence of some great, golden person lying in state.",
              "In the world above, empires had risen and fallen;",
              "wars and natural disasters had wracked the land;",
              "civilizations had sprung up, developed and disappeared;",
              "major religions had come into existence and been superseded by others.",
              "Through it all, a few feet beneath the earth, this forgotten king had lain in his sarcophagus, his golden face and obsidian eyes staring up toward the sky.",

              "Unmasking Howard Carter\u2014the man who found Tutankhamun",
              "A century after the discovery that would captivate the world, the British archaeologist at the centre of the find remains an enigmatic figure\u2014much like the pharaoh himself.",
              "The moment Howard Carter was assured everlasting fame can be pinpointed to five syllables, uttered breathlessly in a hot, dusty tunnel outside Luxor at around 2 p.",
              "m.",
              "on November 26, 1922.",
              "The British Egyptologist had just made a small hole with an iron spike through the top left corner of a wall of ancient mortar.",
              "His hands shook;",
              "The wall was actually a door, bearing the funerary seal of the pharaoh Tutankhamun.",
              "Carter waited for the foetid flow of warm air to disperse from the hole before inserting a candle and peering in after it.",
              "It was the first light to fall on the room that lay beyond for over 3,200 years\u2014and Carter\u2019s the first gaze.",
              "He remained silent as he watched the candle dance over glimmers of gold in the dark.",
              "Then came a question from his companion, George Herbert: \u201cCan you see anything?",
              "\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Carter replied.",
              "\u201cWonderful things.",
              "\u201d Both the scene and the soundbite are the stuff of historical gold, in every sense.",
              "But for many, the discovery of KV62\u2014otherwise known as the resplendently intact tomb of the boy king Tutankhamun\u2014is also where the story of Egyptology\u2019s most famous excavator begins, and ends.",
              "A century after the find that would change history, the story of Howard Carter himself remains peculiarly obscure, a slight picture of a gifted but polarising individual.",
              "Born in Kensington in 1874, Howard Carter was from a generational family of artists who worked around the Norfolk town of Swaffham.",
              "His father Samuel John had relocated to London and become a modestly successful painter of rural pursuits and animals.",
              "Art was a talent exhibited by several of the future Egyptologist\u2019s siblings, as well as Howard himself.",
              "The youngest of eleven children, three of whom died in infancy, as a child he too was considered ominously sickly\u2014enough for his parents to move his upringing from London to Norfolk, where he was raised largely by a nurse in the family\u2019s Swaffham home.",
              "There young Howard spent much of his childhood, nurturing a love of nature.",
              "His official education was obscure, and probably took place at a \u2018dame school\u2019\u2014a kind of informal facility run by local women common in Victorian times.",
              "It was also evidently brief, with Carter noting in later life that he \u2018earned a living from the age of fifteen.",
              "\u2019 Learning artistic skills from his father, he was almost certainly destined to follow a similar path were it not for an acquaintance with the wealthy Amherst family\u2014some of whom his father had been commissioned to paint.",
              "The Amherst home of Didlington Hall was a sprawling testament to the family\u2019s enthusiasm for antiquities and artistic ephemera from Egypt, with which the young Carter became fascinated.",
              "This led to his intoxication with the country, and his first assignment there\u2014as a junior draughtsman under the tutelage of archaeologist Percy Newberry\u2014in 1890, at the age of 16.",
              "His first work was as a \u2018tracer\u2019\u2014inscription copier\u2014at Newberry\u2019s Beni Hasan digs.",
              "Later basing himself seasonally in Luxor, Carter would rapidly galvanise his reputation with a role in the Egyptian Antiquities Service and through his work as a documentarian, a skilled epigraph artist, and his handling of the more practical aspects of excavation.",
              "Working under the wings of archaeologists such as Flinders Petrie, Edouard Naville and Theodore M.",
              "Davis, Carter made several significant early finds, including the tombs of Thutmose IV and Hatshepsut\u2014the latter, in 1903 within chamber KV60 in the Valley of the Kings, yielding a mummy many today believe to be the great queen herself.",
              "His work, even then, was that of a methodical and tenacious excavator.",
              "\u201cPersonally, I view Carter as a game changer in Egyptian history,\u201d says Nora Shawki, an Egyptian archaeologist and National Geographic Explorer.",
              "\u201cHis qualifications were debatable, [and he was] initially commissioned as a site artist for an archaeologist.",
              "But his methods were extremely detailed and meticulous, and his documentation in his journals extraordinary.",
              "They\u2019re still helpful to modern day archaeologists.",
              "\u201d As to Howard Carter\u2019s personality, what records there are paint a sometimes austere picture of the world\u2019s most famous\u2014yet curiously uncelebrated\u2014archaeologist.",
              "He lived as a bachelor in a series of cavernous desert properties, was fond of cigars and whisky, kept pets including a series of dogs, a gazelle and a canary, and owned a horse named Sultan.",
              "He spent time with his siblings and their families, though never married or had children.",
              "His early career in Egypt was notable for the odd professional skirmish, notably the \u2018Saqqara Affair\u2019 in 1904\u2014a well-publicised clash between Egyptian tomb sentries and allegedly drunk French tourists.",
              "While crotchety relations in the murderous heat and bureaucratic quagmire of Egyptology were common, Carter did seem to have a knack for finding himself in conflict.",
              "In his scholarly 1992 biopic of Carter, TGH James\u2014a former Keeper of Antiquities of the British Museum\u2014described him as a man of \u2018uncertain temper and generally unforgiving nature,\u2019 and this did seem to impact his professional relations.",
              "Following Saqqara\u2014for which Carter was criticised for his principle of supporting the guards\u2014he resigned from the Egyptian Antiquities Service in 1905.",

              "Both Carter and Carnarvon suspected that Davies was wrong in assuming that KV58 was in fact the tomb they were after, since Tutankhamun's mummy was not found either among the cache of royal mummies discovered back in 1881 CE at Deir el Bahari or at KV35 (Amenhotep II) in 1898 CE.",

              "The Terracotta Army is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China.",
              "It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210\u2013209 BCE with the purpose of protecting him in his afterlife.",
              "The figures, dating from approximately the late 200s BCE,[1] were discovered in 1974 by local farmers in Lintong County, outside Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.",
              "The figures vary in height according to their rank, the tallest being the generals.",
              "The figures include warriors, chariots and horses.",
              "Estimates from 2007 were that the three pits containing the Terracotta Army hold more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which remain in situ in the pits near Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum.",
              "[2] Other, non-military terracotta figures were found in other pits, including officials, acrobats, strongmen, and musicians.",
              "[3] The construction of the tomb was described by historian Sima Qian (145\u201390 BCE) in Records of the Grand Historian, the first of China's 24 dynastic histories, written a century after the mausoleum's completion.",
              "Work on the mausoleum began in 246 BCE, soon after Emperor Qin (then aged 13) succeeded his father as King of Qin, and the project eventually involved 700,000 conscripted workers.",
              "[5][6] Geographer Li Daoyuan, writing six centuries after the first emperor's death, recorded in Shui Jing Zhu that Mount Li was a favoured location due to its auspicious geology: \"famed for its jade mines, its northern side was rich in gold, and its southern side rich in beautiful jade;",
              "the first emperor, covetous of its fine reputation, therefore chose to be buried there\".",
              "[7][8] Sima Qian wrote that the first emperor was buried with palaces, towers, officials, valuable artifacts and wondrous objects.",
              "According to this account, 100 flowing rivers were simulated using mercury, and above them the ceiling was decorated with heavenly bodies, below which lay the features of the land.",
              "Some translations of this passage refer to \"models\" or \"imitations\";",
              "however, those words were not used in the original text, which also makes no mention of the terracotta army.",
              "[5][9] High levels of mercury were found in the soil of the tomb mound, giving credence to Sima Qian's account.",
              "[10] Also, the Emperor is well documented for building monumental statues in human form during his reign, such as the Twelve Metal Colossi.",
              "[11][12] Later historical accounts suggested that the complex and tomb itself had been looted by Xiang Yu, a contender for the throne after the death of the first emperor.",
              "[13][14][15] However, there are indications that the tomb itself may not have been plundered.",
              "[16] The Terracotta Army was discovered on 29 March 1974 by a group of farmers\u2014Yang Zhifa, his five brothers, and neighbour Wang Puzhi\u2014who were digging a well approximately 1.",
              "5 km (0.",
              "93 mi) east of the Qin Emperor's tomb mound at Mount Li (Lishan),[17][18][19][20] a region riddled with underground springs and watercourses.",
              "For centuries, occasional reports mentioned pieces of terracotta figures and fragments of the Qin necropolis \u2013 roofing tiles, bricks and chunks of masonry.",
              "[21] This discovery prompted Chinese archaeologists, including Zhao Kangmin, to investigate,[22] revealing the largest pottery figurine group ever found.",
              "A museum complex has since been constructed over the area, the largest pit being enclosed by a roofed structure.",
              "[23] The Terracotta Army is part of a much larger necropolis.",
              "Ground-penetrating radar and core sampling have measured the area to be approximately 98 square kilometers (38 square miles).",
              "[24] The necropolis was constructed as a microcosm of the emperor's imperial palace or compound,[citation needed] and covers a large area around the tomb mound of the first emperor.",
              "The earthen tomb mound is located at the foot of Mount Li and built in a pyramidal shape,[25] and is surrounded by two solidly built rammed earth walls with gateway entrances.",
              "The necropolis consists of several offices, halls, stables, other structures as well as an imperial park placed around the tomb mound.",
              "[citation needed] The warriors stand guard to the east of the tomb.",
              "Up to 5 m (16 ft) of reddish, sandy soil had accumulated over the site in the two millennia following its construction, but archaeologists found evidence of earlier disturbances at the site.",
              "During the excavations near the Mount Li burial mound, archaeologists found several graves dating from the 18th and 19th centuries, where diggers had apparently struck terracotta fragments.",
              "These were discarded as worthless and used along with soil to backfill the excavations.",
              "[26] The tomb appears to be a hermetically sealed space roughly the size of a football pitch (c.",
              "100 \u00d7 75 m).",
              "[27][28] The tomb remains unopened, possibly due to concerns over preservation of its artifacts.",
              "[27] For example, after the excavation of the Terracotta Army, the painted surface present on some terracotta figures began to flake and fade.",
              "[29] The lacquer covering the paint can curl in fifteen seconds once exposed to Xi'an's dry air and can flake off in just four minutes.",
              "[30] Four main pits approximately 7 m (23 ft) deep have been excavated.",
              "[31][32] These are located approximately 1.",
              "5 km (0.",
              "93 mi) east of the burial mound.",
              "The soldiers within were laid out as if to protect the tomb from the east, where the Qin Emperor's conquered states lay.",
              "Pit 1, which is 230 m (750 ft) long and 62 m (203 ft) wide,[33] contains the main army of more than 6,000 figures.",
              "[34] Pit 1 has eleven corridors, most more than 3 m (10 ft) wide and paved with small bricks with a wooden ceiling supported by large beams and posts.",
              "This design was also used for the tombs of nobles and would have resembled palace hallways when built.",
              "The wooden ceilings were covered with reed mats and layers of clay for waterproofing, and then mounded with more soil raising them about 2 to 3 m (6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in) above the surrounding ground level when completed.",
              "[35] Pit 2 has cavalry and infantry units as well as war chariots and is thought to represent a military guard.",
              "Pit 3 is the command post, with high-ranking officers and a war chariot.",
              "Pit 4 is empty, perhaps left unfinished by its builders.",
              "Some of the figures in Pits 1 and 2 show fire damage, while remains of burnt ceiling rafters have also been found.",
              "[36] These, together with the missing weapons, have been taken as evidence of the reported looting by Xiang Yu and the subsequent burning of the site, which is thought to have caused the roof to collapse and crush the army figures below.",
              "The terracotta figures currently on display have been restored from the fragments.",
              "Other pits that formed the necropolis have also been excavated.",
              "[37] These pits lie within and outside the walls surrounding the tomb mound.",
              "They variously contain bronze carriages, terracotta figures of entertainers such as acrobats and strongmen, officials, stone armour suits, burial sites of horses, rare animals and labourers, as well as bronze cranes and ducks set in an underground park.",
              "[3] The terracotta figures are life-sized, typically ranging from 175 cm (5.",
              "74 ft) to about 200 cm (6.",
              "6 ft) (the officers are typically taller).",
              "They vary in height, uniform, and hairstyle in accordance with rank.",
              "Their faces appear to be different for each individual figure;",
              "scholars, however, have identified 10 basic face shapes.",
              "[38] The figures are of these general types: armored infantry;",
              "unarmored infantry;",
              "cavalrymen who wear a pillbox hat;",
              "helmeted drivers of chariots with more armor protection;",
              "spear-carrying charioteers;",
              "kneeling crossbowmen or archers who are armored;",
              "standing archers who are not;",
              "as well as generals and other lower-ranking officers.",
              "[39] There are, however, many variations in the uniforms within the ranks: for example, some may wear shin pads while others not;",
              "they may wear either long or short trousers, some of which may be padded;",
              "and their body armors vary depending on rank, function, and position in formation.",
              "[40] There are also terracotta horses placed among the warrior figures.",
              "Originally, the figures were painted with ground precious stones, intensely fired bones (white), pigments of iron oxide (dark red), cinnabar (red), malachite (green), azurite (blue), charcoal (black), cinnabar barium copper silicate mix (Chinese purple or Han purple), tree sap from a nearby source, (more than likely from the Chinese lacquer tree) (brown),[41] and other colors including pink, lilac, red, white,[42] and one unidentified color.",
              "[41] The colored lacquer finish and individual facial features would have given the figures a realistic feel, with eyebrows and facial hair in black and the faces done in pink.",
              "[43] However, in Xi'an's dry climate, much of the color coating would flake off in less than four minutes after removing the mud surrounding the army.",
              "[41] The Acrobats are a series of terracotta sculpture from pit K9901 displaying an advanced understanding of human anatomy.",
              "The original function of these statues remains unclear, but they are described as either acrobats or dancers.",
              "Their number was relatively few compared to the warriors in uniform, probably about a dozen.",
              "The figures are essentially naked, except for a loincloth.",
              "These figures are very vivid and less stereotypical than the soldiers, especially through the dynamic treatment of the musculature and bone joints.",
              "Some of the men are very lean, while others have massive bodies.",
              "Several of them are shown in the process of moving or making gestures.",
              "These terracotta statues demonstrate an advanced mastery of the depiction of the shapes and proportions of the human body.",
              "[44] Since the time of their discovery, the figures have been noted for their exceptional stylistic realism and individualism, with assessments having found that no two figures share the exact same features.",
              "[45][46] The earliest note on this aspect was that of 20th century art historian German Hafner who, in 1986, was the first to speculate on a possible Hellenistic link to these sculptures due to the unusual display of naturalism relative to general Qin era sculpture: \"the art of the terracotta army originated from Western contact, originated from knowledge of Alexander the Great and the splendor of Greek art\".",
              "[47] This idea was also generally supported by Duan Qingbo, Director of the excavation team at the First Emperor's necropolis from 1998 to 2006,[47] or by Professor Lukas Nickel of SOAS.",
              "[48][49] Duan Qingbo also noted the close similarity of the Terracoty Army with the Central Asian Khalchayan statuary, in style as well as in technique.",
              "[50] Li Xiuzhen, senior archaeologist from the Mausoleum Site Museum, acknowledged Western influence but insisted on Chinese authorship: \"We now think the Terracotta Army, the acrobats and the bronze sculptures found on site were inspired by ancient Greek sculptures and art\",[51] but although \"the terracotta warriors may be inspired by Western culture, they were uniquely made by the Chinese\" and \"we found no Greek names on the backs of Terracotta Warriors, which supports my idea that there was no Greek artisan training the local sculptors\".",
              "[52] Others have argued that such speculations rest on flawed and old \"Eurocentric\" ideas that assumed other civilizations were incapable of sophisticated artistry and thus foreign artistry must be seen through Western traditions.",
              "[53] Darryl Wilkinson of Dartmouth College has instead argued that the Qin era display of sculptural naturalism, alongside that of the pre-Columbian Moche culture in Peru, indicate that \"the Greeks did not invent naturalism\" and that \"naturalism is not the product of any one culture's civilizational 'genius.'",
              "\"[54] Raoul McLaughlin, an independent researcher on Roman trade, said there is no Greek influence on the Terracotta Army and emphasized the differences in artisanship, construction material, and symbology.",
              "[55] Only very few figurines are known from before the time of the terracotta army, so that its human and animal depictions must have appeared dramatically new to contemporaries.",
              "[56] Only rare and very small terracotta warrior figurines are known from the end of the Zhou dynasty in 4th-3rd century BCE, such as the Taerpo horserider, the first known representation of a cavalryman in China, from a military tomb in the Taerpo cemetery near Xianyang (Qin state of the Warring States period).",
              "[57][58] The rider wears Central Asian, Scythian-style clothing,[59] and his high pointed nose suggests he is a foreigner,[58] but these early statuettes lack the naturalistic and realistic quality of the Qin terracota army.",
              "[60] The terracotta army left some legacy however, as funeral terracotta armies are known from later dynasties, although in a less stern and militaristic style, and with much smaller statuettes, such as the Western Han Yangjiawan terracotta army (195 BCE) or Yangling terracotta army (141 BCE).",
              "[61] The human-sized monumental style of the Qin emperor was thus very short-lived, and would not reappear until the 4-6th centuries CE with the onset of monumental Buddhist sculpture in China.",
              "[62] The terracotta army figures were manufactured in workshops by government laborers and local craftsmen using local materials.",
              "Heads, arms, legs, and torsos were created separately and then assembled by luting the pieces together.",
              "When completed, the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty.",
              "[64] The faces were created using molds, and at least ten face molds may have been used.",
              "[38] Clay was then added after assembly to provide individual facial features to make each figure appear different.",
              "[65] Studies have shown that there is strong resemblance between the statues and the region's modern inhabitants, which led some scholars to theorize that the high level of stylistic realism stems from the figures being modelled on actual soldiers.",
              "[66][67] It is believed that the warriors' legs were made in much the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were manufactured at the time.",
              "This would classify the process as assembly line production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting a figure as one solid piece and subsequently firing it.",
              "In those times of tight imperial control, each workshop was required to inscribe its name on items produced to ensure quality control.",
              "This has aided modern historians in verifying which workshops were commandeered to make tiles and other mundane items for the terracotta army.",
              "A worker's grave pit was discovered and excavated in 2003.",
              "121 skeletons were retrieved.",
              "The individuals were mostly from 15 to 40 years old, with an average height of around 1.",
              "7 meters.",
              "Craniometric as well as genetic studies were made to try to understand the workers' origin.",
              "According to Duan Qingbo, Head archaeologist and Director of excavations at the Mausoleum from 1998 to 2006, DNA analysis showed that the workers exhibited even larger genetic diversity than the modern Chinese population, combining ethnic Han profiles with a great proportion of workers who would be classified as \"ethnic minorities\" in modern China.",
              "[68] Most of the figures originally held real weapons, which would have increased their realism.",
              "The majority of these weapons were looted shortly after the creation of the army or have rotted away.",
              "Despite this, over 40,000 bronze items of weaponry have been recovered, including swords, daggers, spears, lances, battle-axes, scimitars, shields, crossbows, and crossbow triggers.",
              "Most of the recovered items are arrowheads, which are usually found in bundles of 100 units.",

              "[71] Some weapons were coated with a 10\u201315 micrometer layer of chromium dioxide before burial that was believed to have protected them from any form of decay for the last 2200 years.",
              "[72][73] However, research in 2019 indicated that the chromium was merely contamination from nearby lacquer, not a means of protecting the weapons.",

              "[76] In 2007, scientists at Stanford University and the Advanced Light Source facility in Berkeley, California, reported that powder diffraction experiments combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and micro-X-ray fluorescence analysis showed that the process of producing terracotta figures colored with Chinese purple dye consisting of barium copper silicate was derived from the knowledge gained by Taoist alchemists in their attempts to synthesize jade ornaments.",
              "[77][78] Since 2006, an international team of researchers at the UCL Institute of Archaeology have been using analytical chemistry techniques to uncover more details about the production techniques employed in the creation of the Terracotta Army.",
              "Using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry of 40,000 bronze arrowheads bundled in groups of 100, the researchers reported that the arrowheads within a single bundle formed a relatively tight cluster that was different from other bundles.",
              "In addition, the presence or absence of metal impurities was consistent within bundles.",
              "Based on the arrows' chemical compositions, the researchers concluded that a cellular manufacturing system similar to the one used in a modern Toyota factory, as opposed to a continuous assembly line in the early days of the automobile industry, was employed.",

              "When archaeologist Zhao Kangmin picked up the phone in April 1974, all he was told was that a group of farmers digging a well nearby had found some relics.",
              "Desperate for water amid a drought, the farmers had been digging about a metre down when they struck hard red earth.",
              "Underneath, they had found life-size pottery heads and several bronze arrowheads.",
              "It could be an important find, Zhao's boss said, so he should go and have a look as soon as possible.",
              "A local farmer-turned-museum curator in China's central Shaanxi province, Zhao - who died on 16 May at the age of 81 - had an inkling of what he might find.",
              "He knew figures had in the past been dug out of the earth in the area near the city of Xian, home to orchards of persimmon and pomegranate trees, and not far from the tomb of China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang.",
              "A decade earlier, he had personally uncovered three kneeling crossbowmen.",
              "But he had never been certain that they dated back to the rule of the emperor - who unified the Chinese nation for the first time under the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 BC).",
              "But what Zhao was about to find would surpass anything he could have imagined.",
              "The farmers, it would turn out, had stumbled upon one of the most stunning archaeological finds of the 20th Century: a terracotta army estimated at 8,000-strong, crafted on an industrial scale 2,200 years earlier to defend the emperor in the afterlife.",
              "A ghost army, complete with horses and chariots, hidden underground and never meant to be seen by the living.",
              "Zhao headed to the location of the find with a colleague.",
              "\"Because we were so excited, we rode on our bicycles so fast it felt as if we were flying,\" he would later write in a 2014 essay.",
              "As he arrived, Zhao told the British historian John Man: \"I saw seven or eight pieces - bits of legs, arms and two heads - lying near the well, along with some bricks.\"",
              "He said he immediately realised these were likely the remnants of Qin-era statues.",
              "The farmers - who had made the find weeks earlier and already sold some of the bronze arrowheads for scrap - were told to stop their work immediately.",
              "The relics were collected and brought to the museum on the back of trucks.",
              "Zhao began laboriously putting the fragments together.",
              "Some, he later said, were the size of a fingernail.",
              "Finally, after three days of work, two imposing terracotta warriors stood before him - each 1.",
              "78m tall.",
              "But while Zhao was buoyed by this incredible discovery, he was also nervous.",
              "China in 1974 was in the closing stages of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution - under which the fearsome Red Guards sought to destroy old traditions and ways of thinking to \"purify\" society.",
              "Zhao, as Man recounts in his book The Terracotta Army, had personally been subject to a \"self-criticism\" session in the late 1960s, as a person \"involved with old things\".",
              "So now although the worst excesses of that period were over, Zhao was worried what might become of the statues.",
              "He \"decided to keep it secret\", restore the artefacts, \"and then wait for the right opportunity to report it\".",
              "But those plans would be scuppered by a young journalist from state news agency Xinhua, who was visiting the area when he came across the statues.",
              "\"He asked: 'This is such a huge discovery.",
              "Why aren't you reporting it?'",
              "\" Zhao wrote.",
              "To which the archaeologist replied: \"Even I don't know how to make sense of this.",
              "How could I report it?\"",
              "Ignoring his pleas, the journalist publicised the find, and word made its way to the very top of the Communist Party leadership.",
              "Zhao's fears that the relics could be smashed for political reasons, however, proved unfounded.",
              "The authorities in Beijing decided to excavate the site and within a few months more than 500 warriors had been uncovered.",
              "As the work continued, the extraordinary scale of what the First Emperor - a ruthless man who defeated six warring states to unite China under an imperial system that continued until 1912 - had commissioned became clear.",
              "He is said to have ordered the subterranean project - which in total covers some 56 sq km - soon after ascending to the throne at 13 years old.",
              "The thousands of warriors were placed in battle formation, ready to defend their emperor from whatever might await in the afterlife.",
              "The workmanship was detailed, with dozens of different types of heads, and in the burial pits were 100 chariots and tens of thousands of bronze weapons.",
              "The actual tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang remains sealed.",
              "There could be thousands of precious artefacts inside but the risks of opening the tomb, and irreparably damaging what may lie inside, means the Chinese government has held off so far.",
              "In 1975, a year after the excavations began, a decision was made to open a museum at the site.",
              "And as digging continued in the coming years, word spread about the scale of what had been found.",
              "Foreign dignitaries and some tourists began to visit.",
              "Zhao was there and lapping up the attention, says Prof Dame Jessica Rawson of the University of Oxford, who specialises in Chinese art and archaeology and visited the sites in the early 1980s.",
              "\"By the time I met him everyone was showing him great respect and he was very much sort of enjoying the esteem associated with the terracotta warriors,\" she said.",
              "But the professor added: \"I'm not sure how he or the Chinese authorities viewed it at the time.",
              "They were probably not expecting the acclaim and success that it has later enjoyed.\"",
              "It did take some years for the site to receive widespread global recognition.",
              "It was given Unesco World Heritage status in 1987, with the UN cultural body describing the warriors as \"masterpieces of realism\".",
              "Today, the site is widely recognised as a Chinese national treasure.",
              "But there is a sense that Zhao's personal role in the discovery was never fully recognised.",
              "He is by no means well-known in China.",
              "Instead, one of the farmers - Yang Zhifa, whose shovel is said to have unearthed the first artefact - is described to visiting tourists as the person who discovered the warriors.",
              "For years he sat in the Museum of the Terracotta Warriors and Horses, quietly and unsmilingly signing books.",
              "It was he, not Zhao, who travelled abroad to tell his story.",
              "In 1998, when then US President Bill Clinton visited, it was Yang who shook his hand.",
              "A few years ago he admitted that he didn't go and see the restored army until 1995, when the museum gift shop manager asked him to sign books.",
              "\"He said he would pay me 300 yuan a month.",
              "I thought 'that's not bad', so I came,\" he told the China Daily.",
              "Three other farmers would later join him, and their pay was tripled.",
              "But all complained they were never rewarded properly for their find, and in fact had their land seized to make way for the museum.",
              "Three of the original group of seven farmers died in terrible circumstances.",
              "One hanged himself in 1997, and two others died in their early 50s, penniless and unable to pay for medical care, according to the South China Morning Post.",
              "A local guide who brings tourists to see the warriors, Liu Guoyang, had not even heard of Zhao Kangmin.",
              "But he said imposters posed for visitors, pretending to be Yang Zhifa or one of the other farmers.",
              "Zhao was furious when, in 2004, the four surviving farmers officially asked to be registered as the men who had discovered the warriors.",
              "They didn't receive a response.",
              "\"What they want is money,\" Zhao told the China Daily.",
              "\"Seeing doesn't mean discovering.",
              "The farmers saw the terracotta fragments, but they didn't know they were cultural relics, and they even broke them.",
              "\"It was me who stopped the damage, collected the fragments and reconstructed the first terracotta warrior,\" he said.",
              "If he hadn't have turned up, he told John Man, \"it would have been a disaster\".",
              "Wu Yongqi, head of the Museum of the Teracotta Warriors from 1998-2007, agreed that Zhao, who he described as a simple but kind man, was the person who \"recognised the significance and true value of those warriors\".",
              "Without him, Mr Wu said, the extraordinary find might have been delayed for years.",
              "Unlike the farmers, who signed books for hordes of tourists at the main warriors' museum, Zhao remained at the much smaller Lintong county museum.",
              "Even in his final years, he could be found sitting next to some warriors he had restored, wearing a trilby hat and chatting to curious visitors.",
              "Although he never achieved fame or fortune, Zhao seemed content with the recognition he did receive - proudly saying that during the initial excavation an envoy from Beijing had told him that he had \"made a very big contribution to the country\".",
              "In 1990, he was personally acknowledged by the State Council and given a special pension.",
              "He is survived by a wife and two sons.",
              "Zhao's view of his own position in Chinese history - no matter what others might say - was clear.",
              "At the Lintong museum, he would sign postcards and books for tourists with an extravagant description: \"Zhao Kangmin, the first discoverer, restorer, appreciator, name-giver and excavator of the terracotta warriors.\"",

              "[36] These, together with the missing weapons, have been taken as evidence of the reported looting by Xiang Yu and the subsequent burning of the site, which is thought to have caused the roof to collapse and crush the army figures below.",
              "The terracotta figures currently on display have been restored from the fragments.",
              "Other pits that formed the necropolis have also been excavated.",
              "[37] These pits lie within and outside the walls surrounding the tomb mound.",
              "They variously contain bronze carriages, terracotta figures of entertainers such as acrobats and strongmen, officials, stone armour suits, burial sites of horses, rare animals and labourers, as well as bronze cranes and ducks set in an underground park.",
              "[3] The terracotta figures are life-sized, typically ranging from 175 cm (5.",
              "74 ft) to about 200 cm (6.",
              "6 ft) (the officers are typically taller).",
              "They vary in height, uniform, and hairstyle in accordance with rank.",
              "Their faces appear to be different for each individual figure;",
              "scholars, however, have identified 10 basic face shapes.",
              "[38] The figures are of these general types: armored infantry;",
              "unarmored infantry;",
              "cavalrymen who wear a pillbox hat;",
              "helmeted drivers of chariots with more armor protection;",
              "spear-carrying charioteers;",
              "kneeling crossbowmen or archers who are armored;",
              "standing archers who are not;",
              "as well as generals and other lower-ranking officers.",
              "[39] There are, however, many variations in the uniforms within the ranks: for example, some may wear shin pads while others not;",
              "they may wear either long or short trousers, some of which may be padded;",
              "and their body armors vary depending on rank, function, and position in formation.",
              "[40] There are also terracotta horses placed among the warrior figures.",
              "Originally, the figures were painted with ground precious stones, intensely fired bones (white), pigments of iron oxide (dark red), cinnabar (red), malachite (green), azurite (blue), charcoal (black), cinnabar barium copper silicate mix (Chinese purple or Han purple), tree sap from a nearby source, (more than likely from the Chinese lacquer tree) (brown),[41] and other colors including pink, lilac, red, white,[42] and one unidentified color.",
              "[41] The colored lacquer finish and individual facial features would have given the figures a realistic feel, with eyebrows and facial hair in black and the faces done in pink.",
              "[43] However, in Xi'an's dry climate, much of the color coating would flake off in less than four minutes after removing the mud surrounding the army.",
              "[41] The Acrobats are a series of terracotta sculpture from pit K9901 displaying an advanced understanding of human anatomy.",
              "The original function of these statues remains unclear, but they are described as either acrobats or dancers.",
              "Their number was relatively few compared to the warriors in uniform, probably about a dozen.",
              "The figures are essentially naked, except for a loincloth.",
              "These figures are very vivid and less stereotypical than the soldiers, especially through the dynamic treatment of the musculature and bone joints.",
              "Some of the men are very lean, while others have massive bodies.",
              "Several of them are shown in the process of moving or making gestures.",
              "These terracotta statues demonstrate an advanced mastery of the depiction of the shapes and proportions of the human body.",
              "[44] Since the time of their discovery, the figures have been noted for their exceptional stylistic realism and individualism, with assessments having found that no two figures share the exact same features.",
              "[45][46] The earliest note on this aspect was that of 20th century art historian German Hafner who, in 1986, was the first to speculate on a possible Hellenistic link to these sculptures due to the unusual display of naturalism relative to general Qin era sculpture: \"the art of the terracotta army originated from Western contact, originated from knowledge of Alexander the Great and the splendor of Greek art\".",
              "[47] This idea was also generally supported by Duan Qingbo, Director of the excavation team at the First Emperor's necropolis from 1998 to 2006,[47] or by Professor Lukas Nickel of SOAS.",
              "[48][49] Duan Qingbo also noted the close similarity of the Terracoty Army with the Central Asian Khalchayan statuary, in style as well as in technique.",
              "[50] Li Xiuzhen, senior archaeologist from the Mausoleum Site Museum, acknowledged Western influence but insisted on Chinese authorship: \"We now think the Terracotta Army, the acrobats and the bronze sculptures found on site were inspired by ancient Greek sculptures and art\",[51] but although \"the terracotta warriors may be inspired by Western culture, they were uniquely made by the Chinese\" and \"we found no Greek names on the backs of Terracotta Warriors, which supports my idea that there was no Greek artisan training the local sculptors\".",
              "[52] Others have argued that such speculations rest on flawed and old \"Eurocentric\" ideas that assumed other civilizations were incapable of sophisticated artistry and thus foreign artistry must be seen through Western traditions.",
              "[53] Darryl Wilkinson of Dartmouth College has instead argued that the Qin era display of sculptural naturalism, alongside that of the pre-Columbian Moche culture in Peru, indicate that \"the Greeks did not invent naturalism\" and that \"naturalism is not the product of any one culture's civilizational 'genius.'",
              "\"[54] Raoul McLaughlin, an independent researcher on Roman trade, said there is no Greek influence on the Terracotta Army and emphasized the differences in artisanship, construction material, and symbology.",
              "[55] Only very few figurines are known from before the time of the terracotta army, so that its human and animal depictions must have appeared dramatically new to contemporaries.",
              "[56] Only rare and very small terracotta warrior figurines are known from the end of the Zhou dynasty in 4th-3rd century BCE, such as the Taerpo horserider, the first known representation of a cavalryman in China, from a military tomb in the Taerpo cemetery near Xianyang (Qin state of the Warring States period).",
              "[57][58] The rider wears Central Asian, Scythian-style clothing,[59] and his high pointed nose suggests he is a foreigner,[58] but these early statuettes lack the naturalistic and realistic quality of the Qin terracota army.",
              "[60] The terracotta army left some legacy however, as funeral terracotta armies are known from later dynasties, although in a less stern and militaristic style, and with much smaller statuettes, such as the Western Han Yangjiawan terracotta army (195 BCE) or Yangling terracotta army (141 BCE).",
              "[61] The human-sized monumental style of the Qin emperor was thus very short-lived, and would not reappear until the 4-6th centuries CE with the onset of monumental Buddhist sculpture in China.",
              "[62] The terracotta army figures were manufactured in workshops by government laborers and local craftsmen using local materials.",
              "Heads, arms, legs, and torsos were created separately and then assembled by luting the pieces together.",
              "When completed, the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty.",
              "[64] The faces were created using molds, and at least ten face molds may have been used.",
              "[38] Clay was then added after assembly to provide individual facial features to make each figure appear different.",
              "[65] Studies have shown that there is strong resemblance between the statues and the region's modern inhabitants, which led some scholars to theorize that the high level of stylistic realism stems from the figures being modelled on actual soldiers.",
              "[66][67] It is believed that the warriors' legs were made in much the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were manufactured at the time.",
              "This would classify the process as assembly line production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting a figure as one solid piece and subsequently firing it.",
              "In those times of tight imperial control, each workshop was required to inscribe its name on items produced to ensure quality control.",
              "This has aided modern historians in verifying which workshops were commandeered to make tiles and other mundane items for the terracotta army.",
              "A worker's grave pit was discovered and excavated in 2003.",
              "121 skeletons were retrieved.",
              "The individuals were mostly from 15 to 40 years old, with an average height of around 1.",
              "7 meters.",
              "Craniometric as well as genetic studies were made to try to understand the workers' origin.",
              "According to Duan Qingbo, Head archaeologist and Director of excavations at the Mausoleum from 1998 to 2006, DNA analysis showed that the workers exhibited even larger genetic diversity than the modern Chinese population, combining ethnic Han profiles with a great proportion of workers who would be classified as \"ethnic minorities\" in modern China.",
              "[68] Most of the figures originally held real weapons, which would have increased their realism.",
              "The majority of these weapons were looted shortly after the creation of the army or have rotted away.",
              "Despite this, over 40,000 bronze items of weaponry have been recovered, including swords, daggers, spears, lances, battle-axes, scimitars, shields, crossbows, and crossbow triggers.",
              "Most of the recovered items are arrowheads, which are usually found in bundles of 100 units.",
              "[31][69][70] Studies of these arrowheads suggest that they were produced by self-sufficient, autonomous workshops using a process referred to as cellular production or Toyotism.",
              "[71] Some weapons were coated with a 10\u201315 micrometer layer of chromium dioxide before burial that was believed to have protected them from any form of decay for the last 2200 years.",
              "[72][73] However, research in 2019 indicated that the chromium was merely contamination from nearby lacquer, not a means of protecting the weapons.",
              "The slightly alkaline pH and small particle size of the burial soil most likely preserved the weapons.",
              "[74] The swords contain an alloy of copper, tin, and other elements including nickel, magnesium, and cobalt.",
              "[75] Some carry inscriptions that date their manufacture to between 245 and 228 BCE, indicating that they were used before burial.",
              "[76] In 2007, scientists at Stanford University and the Advanced Light Source facility in Berkeley, California, reported that powder diffraction experiments combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and micro-X-ray fluorescence analysis showed that the process of producing terracotta figures colored with Chinese purple dye consisting of barium copper silicate was derived from the knowledge gained by Taoist alchemists in their attempts to synthesize jade ornaments.",
              "[77][78] Since 2006, an international team of researchers at the UCL Institute of Archaeology have been using analytical chemistry techniques to uncover more details about the production techniques employed in the creation of the Terracotta Army.",
              "Using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry of 40,000 bronze arrowheads bundled in groups of 100, the researchers reported that the arrowheads within a single bundle formed a relatively tight cluster that was different from other bundles.",
              "In addition, the presence or absence of metal impurities was consistent within bundles.",
              "Based on the arrows' chemical compositions, the researchers concluded that a cellular manufacturing system similar to the one used in a modern Toyota factory, as opposed to a continuous assembly line in the early days of the automobile industry, was employed.",
              "[79][80] Grinding and polishing marks visible under a scanning electron microscope provide evidence for the earliest industrial use of lathes for polishing.",
              "[79] The first exhibition of the figures outside of China was held at National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) in Melbourne in 1982.",
              "[81] A collection of 120 objects from the mausoleum and 12 terracotta warriors were displayed at the British Museum in London as its special exhibition \"The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Army\" from 13 September 2007 to April 2008.",
              "[82] This exhibition made 2008 the British Museum's most successful year and made the British Museum the United Kingdom's top cultural attraction between 2007 and 2008.",
              "[83][84] The exhibition brought the most visitors to the museum since the King Tutankhamun exhibition in 1972.",
              "[83] It was reported that the 400,000 advance tickets sold out so fast that the museum extended its opening hours until midnight.",
              "[85] According to The Times, many people had to be turned away, despite the extended hours.",
              "[86] During the day of events to mark the Chinese New Year, the crush was so intense that the gates to the museum had to be shut.",
              "[86] The Terracotta Army has been described as the only other set of historic artifacts (along with the remnants of the wreck of the RMS Titanic) that can draw a crowd by the name alone.",
              "[85] Warriors and other artifacts were exhibited to the public at the Forum de Barcelona in Barcelona between 9 May and 26 September 2004.",

              "Dating from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE,[1] the Dead Sea Scrolls are considered to be a keystone in the history of archaeology with great historical, religious, and linguistic significance because they include the oldest surviving manuscripts of entire books later included in the biblical canons, along with extra-biblical and deuterocanonical manuscripts that preserve evidence of the diversity of religious thought in late Second Temple Judaism.",
              "At the same time, they cast new light on the emergence of Christianity and of Rabbinic Judaism.",

              "What Is the Rosetta Stone? | HISTORY",
              "By: Elizabeth Nix Updated: August 8, 2023 | Original: April 1, 2015 The Rosetta Stone is a slab of granitoid stone featuring a written decree issued in 196 B.",
              "C.",
              "by a group of Egyptian clergy and Egypt\u2019s ruler, Ptolemy V, attesting to his generosity and devoutness.",
              "The decree is written in three ways: hieroglyphics, which were used mainly by priests;",
              "Demotic, a somewhat simpler script used for everyday purposes;",
              "and ancient Greek.",
              "The use of hieroglyphics died out after the 4th century and the writing system became an enigma to scholars, making the stone an essential tool in helping researchers understand the long-forgotten language.",
              "It wasn't until the 19th century\u2014two thousand years after its creation\u2014that the Rosetta Stone helped scholars crack the code of hieroglyphics.",
              "French army engineers who were part of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s Egypt campaign discovered the stone slab in 1799 while repairing a fort near the town of Rashid (Rosetta).",
              "The artifact was originally displayed in a temple, possibly near the ancient town of Sais.",
              "Centuries later, it was moved to Rosetta and was used in the construction of Fort Julien, where it was eventually uncovered by the French.",
              "The Rosetta Stone came into the possession of the British after they defeated the French in Egypt in 1801.",
              "British scientist Thomas Young, who began studying the Rosetta Stone\u2019s texts in 1814, made some initial progress in analyzing its hieroglyphic inscription.",
              "Young surmised that the cartouches\u2014hieroglyphs enclosed in ovals\u2014contained the phonetic spellings of royal names, including Ptolemy, referenced in the Greek inscription.",
              "Ultimately, it was French linguist Jean-Francois Champollion who deciphered the Rosetta Stone and cracked the hieroglyphic code.",
              "Between 1822 and 1824, Champollion showed that hieroglyphics were a combination of phonetic and ideographic signs rather than just symbolic picture writing that didn\u2019t also represent sounds of language, as earlier scholars had suspected.",
              "For his discoveries, Champollion is heralded as the founding father of Egyptology.",
              "Today, the Rosetta Stone, which measures about 44 inches tall and 30 inches wide, is housed in the British Museum in London, where it\u2019s been since 1802, except for a temporary re-location for safekeeping during World War I to an off-site, underground spot.",
              "There have been repeated calls for it to be repatriated to Egypt.",
