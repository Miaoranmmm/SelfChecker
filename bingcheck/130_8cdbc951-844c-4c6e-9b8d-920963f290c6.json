    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. That's a great question. Theme parks are fascinating places that offer a variety of attractions and entertainment for people of all ages.\n\nAccording to the search results, the inspiration behind the creation of the first theme park can be traced back to the concept of a **pleasure garden**, which was an area of public land set aside for recreation and entertainment purposes[^1^]. Pleasure gardens were popular in Europe since the medieval times, and they often featured outdoor open spaces, periodic fairs, concerts, zoos, and other amusements[^1^].\n\nThe first theme park in the United States was **Santa Claus Land** in Santa Claus, Indiana, which opened in 1946[^3^]. It was the first park to have a specific theme based on a holiday and to offer rides and attractions designed just for children[^3^]. The park also capitalized on the town's unique name and reputation as the home of Santa Claus[^3^].\n\nThe most influential theme park in history was **Disneyland**, which opened in 1955 in Anaheim, California[^4^]. It was created by Walt Disney, who wanted to build a place where families could enjoy together his animated characters and stories[^4^]. Disneyland revolutionized the theme park industry by introducing immersive lands, storytelling, animatronics, and high-quality standards[^4^]. Disneyland also inspired the creation of other Disney parks around the world, as well as many other theme parks that followed its model.\n\nTheme parks have evolved and expanded over time to become a significant aspect of the entertainment industry. They have diversified their themes, attractions, and audiences to cater to different tastes and preferences. They have also incorporated new technologies, such as virtual reality, interactive media, and special effects, to enhance their experiences. Some theme parks have also focused on social causes, such as accessibility, inclusion, and education. For example, **Morgan's Wonderland** in San Antonio, Texas, is the world's first ultra-accessible theme park designed with individuals with special needs in mind[^6^].\n\nI hope this answer helps you learn more about the history and development of theme parks.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "It\u2019s almost impossible to pinpoint the exact origins of modern-day amusement parks and fairs because there were multiple influences and a host of predecessors that date back centuries before Ferris wheels, electricity and heart-stopping roller coasters were invented.",

              "The concept of a permanent enclosed garden or park for amusement was a new concept and differed from fairs where the entrance was free.",
              "The entrance fee was usually a substantial amount for the average person, which theoretically guaranteed guests wouldn\u2019t have to rub shoulders with the lower class.",
              "This eventually changed over time and later attracted people from all social classes.",
              "These for-profit pleasure gardens often incorporated theatre, fountains, masquerade galas, opera, open-air concerts, fireworks, supper booths, modern art, menageries (captive wild animals), spaces for social interaction and paths for guests to promenade.",

              "In 1729, entrepreneur Jonathan Tyers, a pioneer of mass entertainment, saw the site\u2019s full commercial potential and transformed the run-down garden and its tavern into the leading venue for public entertainment that drew enormous crowds.",
              "The entrance was originally free, but Jonathan began charging one shilling to keep out the riff-raff.",
              "The real money was in the food and drink, which was notoriously expensive.",
              "There were no roller coaster rides or cotton candy, but there were circus acts, illusionists, fireworks, acrobats, Tightrope walkers, hot-air balloon ascents and shows.",
              "Central to the entertainment were musical performances and the large concert hall which hosted promenade concerts;",
              "which were like open-air concerts where the audience could listen to the music while strolling about the carefully landscaped gardens along windy paths past pavilions, fountains, grottos, cascades, temples and other gardens Folies Tyler had constructed.",

              "Folie Beaujon was the extravagant land and home of wealthy landowner Nicolas Beaujon in Paris.",
              "After he died in 1801, the land was passed down to his sons, who sold the land after which it was turned into a commercial pleasure park that people paid to enter.",

              "Rides were mechanical or hand-operated and primitive by today\u2019s standards.",
              "The Chinese ring game (la bague Chinois), for example, was very popular.",

              "Swings were also popular attractions.",
              "The biggest advancement to public amusement at pleasure parks in France arrived around 1817 when the first roller coaster ride with tracks and wheels was installed.",

              "Like Follie Beaujon, there was plenty of entertainment including a pantomime hall/theatre built in 1783 which was a very popular art form in those days and very successful.",
              "After Boutin was executed in 1794 during the reign of terror, it was officially named \u201cle Grand Tivoli,\u201d where fashionable and well-to-do Parisians and bourgeoisie gladly paid their entrance fee to unwind, promenade through the gardens, enjoy simple rides, entertainment and show off their wealth.",
              "By 1826 Tivoli had changed hands a couple of times, but now it had the makings of a true amusement park with its own roller coaster, pantomimes, Labrinths, illuminations, tightrope walking, firework shows, music and even pigeon shooting which was a game imported from England.",
              "There was also \u201cle Cerf Coco,\u201d a deer that could walk a tightrope.",

              "The theme park opened in 1946 and features rides, live entertainment, and games that are divided into four sections that celebrate Christmas, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and the Fourth of July.",
              "Holiday World features three wooden roller coasters, most notably The Voyage, which has consistently ranked in Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Awards as one of the best in the world.",
              "Holiday World also features 2 Steel Coasters.",
              "The water park, Splashin' Safari, opened in 1993 and features two of the longest water coasters in the world, Wildebeest and Guinness World Record Holder Mammoth.",
              "The water park also contains a launched water coaster, raft rides, water slides, and other family-friendly water attractions.",
              "[citation needed] Plans for Santa Claus Land were first conceived as a retirement project by Louis J.",
              "Koch, a retired industrialist from Evansville, Indiana.",
              "In 1941, Koch visited the town of Santa Claus, Indiana.",
              "Upset that children came to a town named Santa Claus only to be dismayed when Santa Claus wasn't there, Koch developed the idea for a park where children could have fun and visit Santa year-round.",
              "Although initial construction plans were delayed by World War II, construction of Santa Claus Land eventually began on August 4, 1945.",
              "[3][4] At this time, Indiana had only one amusement park which was Indiana Beach (at the time called Ideal Beach) that had opened in 1926, 20 years before Santa Claus Land opened.",
              "Santa Claus Land opened on August 3, 1946.",
              "At no cost, the park offered a Santa, a toy shop, toy displays, a restaurant and themed children's rides, one of which was The Freedom Train.",
              "With the park's success, Louis Koch's son, William A.",
              "\"Bill\" Koch, Sr.",
              ", took over as head of Santa Claus Land.",
              "In the following years, Bill Koch continued to add to the park, including the first Jeep-Go-Round ever manufactured, a new restaurant and a deer farm which was eventually home to fourteen European white fallow deer.",
              "[3][4][5] Beginning in 1955, Santa Claus Land charged admission for the first time;",
              "adults were charged 50 cents while children continued to be admitted for free.",
              "Despite the new cost of admission, attendance continued to grow with the park.",
              "The Pleasureland ride section, which exists today as Rudolph's Reindeer Ranch, debuted in 1955.",
              "In the early 1970s, additional children's rides, including Dasher's Seahorses, Comet's Rockets, Blitzen's Airplanes, and Prancer's Merry-Go-Round, were added to this section.",
              "From 1959 to 1961, the first live entertainment, the Willie Bartley Water Ski Thrill Show, performed on Lake Rudolph each summer.",
              "A Santa Claus Choir composed of local children also performed at the park in 1970 and 1971.",
              "[4] In 1960, Bill Koch married Patricia \"Pat\" Yellig, the daughter of Jim Yellig, the park's Santa Claus.",
              "Bill and Pat Koch would have five children: Will, Kristi, Daniel, Philip, and Natalie.",
              "[3] In 1976, Santa Claus Land shifted its focus along with its entrance, which was moved from State Road 162 to its present location on State Road 245.",
              "The park began to focus on families, rather than just children.",
              "The park added nine new rides by 1984, eight of which they hoped would appeal to older children and adults alike.",
              "Eagle's Flight, Rough Riders, Roundhouse, Virginia Reel, Scarecrow Scrambler, Lewis & Clark Trail, Paul Revere's Midnight Ride and Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay were all targeted towards families, while Dancer's Thunder Bumpers Junior was built for children who weren't quite ready for the larger version of the ride.",
              "[4] By 1984, the Koch Family had realized the theming possibilities beyond Christmas.",
              "Santa Claus Land soon saw the first major expansion in park history with the addition of a Halloween section and a Fourth of July section.",
              "With the inclusion of more than just Christmas, Santa Claus Land formally changed its name to Holiday World.",
              "In the following years, Frightful Falls and Banshee were added to the Halloween section, Raging Rapids was added to the Fourth of July section in 1990, and Kringle's Kafe\u0301 restaurant was built in the Christmas section.",
              "[3][4] It was also during this time period that Holiday World saw a change in leadership.",
              "Will Koch, the eldest of Bill Koch's children, took over as President of the park.",
              "Another of Bill Koch's children, Daniel \"Dan\" Koch, became chairman of the board.",
              "[6] In 1993, the water park Splashin' Safari opened.",
              "In its first year of operation, Splashin' Safari operated with Congo River, Crocodile Isle, AmaZOOM and Bamboo Chute.",
              "The Wave was added the following year.",
              "The park added the first of its three wooden roller coasters in 1995 with The Raven, built by Custom Coasters International.",
              "The Raven was named \"Ride of the Year\" and was voted as the world's second best wooden roller coaster.",
              "In 2000, The Raven was ranked as the #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by Amusement Today magazine, a distinction it held for 4 years.",
              "[4] As of the 2011 awards, The Raven has remained ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world.",
              "[7] Over the next four years, the park made only two additions.",
              "The first was the addition of Monsoon Lagoon in Splashin' Safari.",
              "The second was the replacement of Firecracker with Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area featuring Holidog's Treehouse, The Howler, Doggone Trail and Magic Waters.",
              "In 2000, Custom Coasters International added another wooden roller coaster.",
              "The Legend, based on Washington Irving's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\", was opened immediately adjacent to The Raven and is taller, longer, and faster than The Raven.",
              "The Legend's ranking reached its peak in 2002, when it was voted the fourth best wooden roller coaster in the world.",
              "[4] Much like The Raven, The Legend continues to be ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world, as of the 2011 awards.",
              "[7] In 2000, the park also began offering its guests free unlimited soft drinks, a service which brought international attention to the park.",
              "[8] Holiday World was the first park in the world to offer this service to its guests.",
              "[3] For the next five years, the park's additions grew steadily.",
              "In 2002, ZOOMbabwe, the world's largest enclosed water slide, was added to Splashin' Safari.",
              "[9] In 2003, Splashin' Safari added Zinga on top of The Legend's spiral drop, a ProSlide Tornado, while Holiday World replaced Banshee with Hallowswings and the Hall of Famous Americans wax museum with Liberty Launch.",
              "In 2004, the park continued to add onto the water park, adding Jungle Racer and Jungle Jets.",
              "Bahari Wave Pool was added in 2005, which marked the beginning of an expansion project that would double the size of Splashin' Safari.",
              "[4] Holiday World & Splashin' Safari received its most sought after award in 2004, when it earned the Applause Award from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.",
              "To win the award, awarded every two years, a park must show \"foresight, originality and creativity, plus sound business development and profitability.\"",
              "With an attendance of 883,000 that year, Holiday World was the smallest park to ever receive the award.",
              "[10] The 2006 season marked the 60th anniversary of Holiday World.",
              "The park marked it by adding a brand new section: Thanksgiving.",
              "To complement the section, the park added two new rides.",
              "The first was Gobbler Getaway, a Sally Corporation interactive dark ride.",
              "The anchor attraction was the park's third wooden roller coaster, The Voyage, built by The Gravity Group, successors of Custom Coasters International.",
              "The addition of The Voyage gained the park national attention once again, as the roller coaster claimed the record for most air-time of any wooden roller coaster at 24.",
              "2 seconds.",
              "[11] It is also the second longest wooden roller coaster in the world behind only The Beast at Kings Island.",
              "In its first year of operation, The Voyage was awarded the title of \"Best New Ride\" and #2 wooden roller coaster in the world.",
              "From 2007 to 2011, The Voyage was awarded the title of #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by the readers of Amusement Today magazine.",
              "[7] Also added in 2006 was Bahari River in Splashin' Safari.",
              "It was named the \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" by Amusement Today magazine.",
              "[4][12] Over the next three years, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari opened several new additions.",
              "Bakuli and Kima Bay were added to Splashin' Safari, Turkey Whirl and Plymouth Rock Cafe\u0301 were added to the Thanksgiving section, the Star Spangled Carousel replaced Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay in the Fourth of July section, and Reindeer Games replaced Kids Castle in the Christmas section.",
              "In 2009, Holiday World continued to break records by opening the world's tallest water ride, Pilgrims Plunge, in the Thanksgiving section of the park.",
              "Pilgrims Plunge deviated from the standard of using a sloped lift hill, instead opting for an open-air elevator system that takes riders to a height of 135 feet (41 m) before dropping them at a forty-five degree angle.",
              "[4] Pilgrims Plunge was renamed to Giraffica in 2013 when the boundaries between the Thanksgiving section and the water park were slightly altered.",
              "[13] Splashin' Safari broke another record in 2010, when Wildebeest was opened.",
              "When Wildebeest opened, it was the world's longest water coaster at 1,710 feet (520 m) long.",
              "It was also among the first water coasters to use linear induction motors, rather than water jets or conveyor belts, to propel riders up hills.",
              "Wildebeest was named \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, as well as \"Best Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, 2011 and 2012.",
              "[4][14] The park broke its own record just two years later, in 2012, when Mammoth opened.",
              "Mammoth, which was the most expensive ride added to the park until the addition of Thunderbird, is 1,763 feet (537 m) long, making it the longest water coaster in the world.",
              "[15] In February 2010, Holiday World's rival park, Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Kentucky, announced that it would be closing permanently and ending operations after park operator Six Flags could not reach a lease agreement for the property.",
              "Several members of the Koch family later expressed interest into reviving the park in 2012, but later backed out of the deal.",
              "This park would eventually reopen under different management in 2014.",
              "The park suffered a sudden loss in June 2010 when President and CEO Will Koch died while swimming at his home.",
              "Although the Spencer County coroner listed the official cause of death as drowning, family and park officials believe Koch's type 1 diabetes played a factor in his death.",
              "Soon after his death, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari named Will's younger brother Dan as the park's new president.",
              "[16] Dan Koch served as the park's president until late 2012, shortly after which the board of directors announced Matt Eckert as the new president, launching a bitter fight within the family for control of the park and its assets.",
              "Matt Eckert was previously one of the parks two general managers.",
              "Eckert is the first park President not related to the Koch family.",
              "Will Koch's widow Lori and their three children won primary ownership in the park after an ugly court battle and its parent company, Koch Development Corporation.",
              "Dan Koch, along with his sister Natalie, would go on in 2014 to form Koch Family Parks and buy Alabama Splash Adventure, a previously troubled theme park in Bessemer, Alabama.",
              "[17] In recent years, the park has replaced some of its older rides with newer rides.",
              "In Holiday World, Blitzen's Airplanes was replaced with Rudolph's Round-Up in 2011 and in 2012 Paul Revere's Midnight Ride was replaced with Sparkler, a 65 feet (20 m) tall Zamperla Vertical Swing ride.",
              "Due to limited vertical clearance for Sparkler, the park decided to relocate Star Spangled Carousel to the former location of Paul Revere's Midnight Ride and to place Sparkler in the carousel's place.",
              "[18] The following year, Holiday World removed part of Holidog's Treehouse to make room for a new tea cup ride called Kitty's Tea Party.",
              "In 2013, the park also removed the only original remaining ride, The Freedom Train, citing maintenance concerns;",
              "it was replaced by another train ride which the park named Holidog Express.",
              "[19] In Splashin' Safari, Jungle Jets was replaced with Safari Sam's SplashLand in 2011.",

              "Dissatisfied with their progress, Disney and Iwerks started a small studio of their own in 1922 and acquired a secondhand movie camera with which they made one and two-minute animated advertising films for distribution to local movie theatres.",
              "They also did a series of animated cartoon sketches called Laugh-O-grams and the pilot film for a series of seven-minute fairy tales that combined both live action and animation, Alice in Cartoonland.",
              "A New York film distributor cheated the young producers, and Disney was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1923.",
              "He moved to California to pursue a career as a cinematographer, but the surprise success of the first Alice film compelled Disney and his brother Roy\u2014a lifelong business partner\u2014to reopen shop in Hollywood.",
              "With Roy as business manager, Disney resumed the Alice series, persuading Iwerks to join him and assist with the drawing of the cartoons.",
              "They invented a character called Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, contracted for distribution of the films at $1,500 each, and propitiously launched their small enterprise.",
              "In 1927, just before the transition to sound in motion pictures, Disney and Iwerks experimented with a new character\u2014a cheerful, energetic, and mischievous mouse called Mickey.",
              "They had planned two shorts, called Plane Crazy and Gallopin\u2019 Gaucho, that were to introduce Mickey Mouse when The Jazz Singer, a motion picture with the popular singer Al Jolson, brought the novelty of sound to the movies.",
              "Fully recognizing the possibilities for sound in animated-cartoon films, Disney quickly produced a third Mickey Mouse cartoon equipped with voices and music, entitled Steamboat Willie, and cast aside the other two soundless cartoon films. When it appeared in 1928, Steamboat Willie was a sensation.",
              "The following year Disney started a new series called Silly Symphonies with a picture entitled The Skeleton Dance, in which a skeleton rises from the graveyard and does a grotesque, clattering dance set to music based on classical themes.",
              "Original and briskly syncopated, the film ensured popular acclaim for the series, but, with costs mounting because of the more complicated drawing and technical work, Disney\u2019s operation was continually in peril.",
              "The growing popularity of Mickey Mouse and his girlfriend, Minnie, however, attested to the public\u2019s taste for the fantasy of little creatures with the speech, skills, and personality traits of human beings.",
              "(Disney himself provided the voice for Mickey until 1947.)",
              "This popularity led to the invention of other animal characters, such as Donald Duck and the dogs Pluto and Goofy.",
              "In 1933 Disney produced a short, The Three Little Pigs, which arrived in the midst of the Great Depression and took the country by storm.",
              "Its treatment of the fairy tale of the little pig who works hard and builds his house of brick against the huffing and puffing of a threatening wolf suited the need for fortitude in the face of economic disaster, and its song \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?",
              "\u201dwas a happy taunting of adversity.",
              "It was in this period of economic hard times in the early 1930s that Disney fully endeared himself and his cartoons to audiences all over the world, and his operation began making money in spite of the Depression.",
              "Disney had by that time gathered a staff of creative young people, who were headed by Iwerks.",
              "Colour was introduced in the Academy Award-winning Silly Symphonies film Flowers and Trees (1932), while other animal characters came and went in films such as The Grasshopper and the Ants (1934) and The Tortoise and the Hare (1935).",
              "Roy franchised tie-in sales with the cartoons of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck\u2014watches, dolls, shirts, and tops\u2014and reaped more wealth for the company."

              "Jake, a weathered orange and white robot, was tested by navigating the crowds and greeting people in front of Star Wars Launch Bay in Tomorrowland at Disneyland.",
              "While autonomous robots were not rolling around the parks when Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge opened at Disneyland in May 2019, Jake\u2019s advancement is the new hope forging the future for AI and autonomous robot experiences.",
              "WDI was involved in the AI and autonomous robot space before Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge was ever proposed.",
              "AI is a \u201cpretty squishy term,\u201d explains Michael Honeck, senior R&D Imagineer.",
              "It can range anywhere from something that is the very basic definition of AI, which is simply a computer using input to make decisions.",
              "There is also the much more emerging machine-learning space of being able to feed a computer fuzzy data and have it produce a human-like decision.",
              "What has catapulted the fields forward is the current affordability of sensors that provide robust, high-fidelity information at the scale that Imagineers require, says Honeck, \u201cNow we are in a place where sensors are going through another evolution,\u201d he explains.",
              "\u201cThings like lidar, for example, are beginning to be certified to international industrial standards.",
              "So we can be sure that we\u2019re getting quality data and hardware that will perform in the field.",

              "We do the same thing with this autonomous system.",
              "Its head moves to look to where it\u2019s going to walk, just like a human would.",
              "That both makes it seem alive and intelligent, and it also gives humans a subconscious cue about how this thing is going to behave and how you might want to adjust your behavior relative to it.",
              "A good example is how humans interact with their pets.",
              "Those relationships are going to tell you quite a bit about how humans are going to successfully communicate with an autonomous system.",
              "\u201d Personality and emotion are essential to such a project, but the robots must also be robust, maintainable, and able to survive interactions with throngs of people who are treating them as living and \u201cbreathing\u201d things.",

              "Batteries with appropriately safe chemistry and long life are available, although fitting them into the limited space of a robot can be a bit of a challenge, Honeck admits.",
              "In his day-to-day experiences, Honeck says the team spends as much time on regulatory challenges as they do on the technical and creative aspects of robot building.",
              "Imagineers are out on the bleeding edge of what is available as far as sensors, batteries, and components go, and many of the companies that produce such evolved technologies just haven\u2019t walked down the regulatory pathways that WDI \u00adrequires.",

              "The app started with queue-based games and \u00admusic \u00adintegration throughout the parks.",
              "But Galaxy\u2019s Edge goes beyond the queue to allow guests to build a reputation and let their story unfold throughout the land, if they choose to opt in.",
              "For example, in Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run, your participation and interaction within the attraction not only impacts the story as you play through it but also the other stories that you will experience throughout the land.",
              "If you do really well piloting the Falcon and depart with a lot of fanfare, credits, and success, that result will follow you throughout the land.",
              "If you perform poorly and, say, make your way over to the Cantina, people may have some choice words for you for banging up the ship.",
              "Creating this new \u201cliving land\u201d from the ground up allowed Imagineers to create a hardware ecosystem throughout the area, utilizing various technologies, including innovative use of Bluetooth, that essentially allow the land to be a platform to sense different activities that you have done throughout it.",
              "\u201cOne of the challenges of creating these systems of technology that talk and communicate with each other is creating a team,\u201d states Producer Rachel Sherbill.",
              "\u201cIt took a huge number of people with incredible expertise in everything from networking solutions to electrical engineering to scheduling to building construction, because all of these things need to be maintainable for all of the years that this land will be around.",
              "It requires input from architects, technology designers, engineers, and software developers, who have been a huge part of figuring this thing out.",
              "These people and the systems that they are creating all need to talk to each other and have a seamlessness to them.",
              "\u201d Since the content is driven through individuals\u2019 smartphones rather than singular installations throughout the outpost, the land can have multiple people experiencing the same thing at the same time or enjoying different things at the same time in different ways.",
              "Leveraging smartphones helps with bearing the load of the thousands of people that will explore Galaxy\u2019s Edge.",
              "The project included the platform team and software developers to ensure that the different systems put in place understand the correct load so everyone who wants to participate in the interaction can do so.",
              "\u201cTraditionally, we build these attractions to last a very long time,\u201d Ging adds.",
              "\u201cThe difference here is that we are building a platform that needs to be flexible to match the velocity of technology.",
              "Technology changes, particularly on cell phones, a lot faster than it ever has.",
              "So, a big challenge is building something that is flexible enough to still be relevant\u2014not just six months but 5\u201310 years down the line when technology is almost unpredictable at that stage.",
              "We work with some of the best technologists around, just listening to their vision and understanding their view of the future and how technology is going to change over time.",
              "That impacts the way that we think about these experiences.",
              "\u201d For the first time since the original film was released in theaters in 1977, fans now have the opportunity to live their own Star Wars \u00adadventure as they explore the Black Spire \u00adOutpost.",

              "There is also a series of missions available for guests who want to completely dig into their own personalized narrative and get involved with deeper storytelling.",
              "There are items that people can collect digitally\u2014seeing the land, looking through it, and discovering items. For example, Ging explains, there are many crates \u00adlocated all through the area.",
              "Guests can scan them, discover what\u2019s inside, learn where they are supposed to go, and collect some of the digital items. Each task furthers the in-land story.",

              "\u201cYou\u2019re not just experiencing Star Wars on an attraction, you are experiencing it walking down the street and discovering what\u2019s in that crate or looking at a drawing or a sketch on a wall,\u201d says Sherbill.",
              "\u201cThrough leveraging technology, you can actually go up to a droid and, using your phone, receive content that helps you understand that droid\u2019s history.",

              "All of these sorts of details expand as you are walking around throughout your day.",
              "One of the things about this type of content existing digitally is that we can update, change things, and add more stories.",

              "they are smart and charming but don\u2019t have the luxury of human speech to convey their thoughts and feelings.",
              "Consequently, the dream of filling Disney parks with engaging, interactive, autonomous simple creatures was born.",
              "\u201cEssentially, we had to start out by making a choice: Are we going to build a familiar Disney character, or are we going to build a unique creation?",
              "\u201d recounts Leslie Evans, R&D Imagineer manager.",
              "\u201cIn this case, we decided to build a unique creation because we wanted to explore how we can approach our animatronic characters as actors.",
              "We want to be able to teach each of our animatronic characters a unique personality\u2014you\u2019re shy, and you\u2019re outgoing, and you\u2019re really sleepy\u2014and then let them use their programmed thinking patterns to interact with the world.",
              "Because we knew we wanted to explore a breadth of personalities, we recognized it was more important to be flexible than to represent a specific character.",
              "So we decided to invent our own unique creations.",
              "\u201d Development of the Vyloo started with puppets.",
              "Evans, who worked on the project with Executive R&D Imagineer Alexis Wieland, created a simple rod puppet from spare parts and materials from other WDI projects and used it to explore personality types.",
              "How would an introvert say hello to someone?",
              "If you are shy and see a new face, how do you move?",
              "Imagineers filmed and recorded these experimental sessions and analyzed what each motion meant and how they could distill those motions down into something simple, yet autonomous.",
              "The result was a creature with no human in the loop.",
              "The Vyloo were programmed, told their personalities, and left to run all day, every day, making their own choices.",
              "There is no behind-the-scenes puppeteering;",
              "it\u2019s AI, and the characters go about each day doing their own thing.",
              "There is some universal design in the Vyloo.",
              "Evans learned which motions were really compelling and helped convey the emotion of the character.",
              "Vyloo have eight functions, and through playing with them, she realized that body squash and stretch were important.",
              "However, any universality should not encroach on the uniqueness of each character.",
              "\u201cThey are all a little bit different, and each has its own agenda,\u201d Evans explains.",
              "\u201cWe believe passionately that play-testing is important.",
              "You build a thing, but you have to get people in front of it to really understand how people perceive it, and then you can make tweaks based on that.",
              "We had done some early testing at Imagineering, but when we installed the Vyloo in the park and shared them with guests, we learned some new things.",
              "What was important in our technology was retaining flexibility in the system, so as we learned, we could quickly make changes.",
              "When we first turned them all on, it was like they were real animals\u2014they were very overstimulated.",
              "So we had to dial things down.",
              "We made those changes, got them back running again, and watched how guests interacted with them.",
              "\u201d The design of the Vyloo culminated in a demonstration of the three original characters to introduce them to people across the Walt Disney Company.",

              "Working in an advanced development group, Evans notes, often results in physical projects and ideas that do not leave the building in the form in which they were realized.",
              "Pieces of technology may move to other projects, or the experience will inspire other teams to incorporate it into their work.",
              "But the diversity of tasks\u2014including app-based experiences, drones, character experiences, and robotics\u2014allows Imagineers to tackle these new problems that all have a backbone of trying to use new technology to bring experiences to life.",

              "Today\u2019s consumers expect fantastic, immersive, quality experiences when they come to theme parks \u2013 whether it\u2019s a destination operated by a top international owner such as Disney, Universal, Chimelong Group, or Merlin Entertainments, or a smaller regional park.",
              "In what is anticipated to be a $70-plus billion market by 2025, as the industry expands and consumer demand grows, developers and operators naturally think they are required to place an increasing amount of capital into their projects to stay competitive and on the pulse of emerging trends.",
              "However, the smartest players can respond to today\u2019s trends without breaking the bank.",
              "Below, we discuss a few of the top trends impacting the theme park industry and provide strategies for developers and owners to adapt to these shifts \u2013 within their budgets: Today\u2019s guests want more than attractions that are loosely tied together with a brand or idea \u2013 or represented by a name that doesn\u2019t reflect the actual experience.",
              "Consumers want a fully immersive experience, which stems from the complete integration of the facility, creative, and the IP \u2013 and they are sophisticated enough to know the difference.",
              "Using a strong brand to create a sense of place \u2013 so that when guests walk into an environment, they feel they are actually there \u2013 can provide the unique sensation of being transported to a magical destination.",
              "Universal\u2019s Wizarding World of Harry Potter and Disney\u2019s upcoming Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge are two major examples of this trend.",
              "For many theme park developers, this type of immersive environment is achieved through first securing a high-level IP or IPs.",
              "For any but the top brands, the spend on these is generally not feasible.",
              "So how can developers compete in a world where guests have the option to visit Hogwarts or a Galaxy Far, Far Away?",
              "There are several lower cost options that have proven extremely successful when selecting a theme for an immersive destination.",
              "One way that some developers have found success is through creatively integrating a familiar yet underutilized IP in a fresh way.",
              "An older IP can still serve as a central theme around which the park can be concepted.",
              "This will save the exorbitant up-front IP cost, yet deliver a theme that guests can imagine prior to their first visit to the park.",
              "In other cases, no IP is necessary \u2013 the park can build its own brand.",
              "We\u2019ve found this path is most lucrative when the theme is unique to the area and culture where it is located.",
              "An example could be a paradise-themed park in a tropical location.",
              "In addition to utilizing a lower-cost IP, or no IP at all, strategic design and construction methodology can also save costs while still building a strong, immersive experience.",
              "For instance, scaling down some elements to two-thirds the size, or less, can create essentially the same environment \u2013 especially when combined with visualization tricks \u2013 at significantly lower costs.",
              "Another strategy includes focusing the fully-immersive environment on certain points of the experience, and utilizing landscaping to complement that environment where applicable, as it tends to have a lower capital expenditure.",
              "For example, our sister company Nassal recently worked with the Jacksonville Zoo on its African Forest Exhibit.",
              "The goal was to create an enrichment-focused habitat that directly related to the animals, without having to create an entirely new \u2018land\u2019 within the zoo.",
              "This was achieved through utilizing an existing containment wall and remodeling the structure to feature scenic and themed elements \u2013 including waterfalls, branches, rockwork, and artificial trees \u2013 in turn, telling the story of conservation in an immersive, meaningful way.",
              "In the increasingly immersive environments of themed destinations, guests long for a total experience.",
              "One of the major components of this is cuisine.",
              "Guests are finding this in places like the Wizarding World of Harry Potter \u2013 in the form of smoked turkey legs and butterbeer \u2013 adding to the complete experience.",
              "In turn, this raises the expectations at other attractions and destination.",
              "Operators are getting smarter about their food offerings and are recognizing that creative cuisine \u2013 alongside regional staples \u2013 is increasingly important.",
              "While people rarely expect the best meal of their lives at a theme park, operators are finding success with good quality that isn\u2019t taken too seriously.",
              "According to our frequent collaborator Mike Oswald, Managing Partner, Management Services of leading theme park operator MR-ProFun, destinations in the western world are still selling more traditional food like hamburgers, pizza, fries, and hot dogs than anything else.",
              "That said, the firm is not only seeing an increase in food quality overall, but the introduction of unique food options mixed into the offering.",
              "Oswald cites Universal\u2019s Volcano Bay water park in Orlando as an example, where the menu at Whakawaiwai Eats includes footlong hot dogs and pizza \u2013 featuring both the classic cheese and pepperoni as well as island-inspired toppings such as caramelized pineapple and mango BBQ sauce \u2013 alongside pan-seared shrimp pasta.",
              "As another example, we recently visited a theme park in South Korea and experienced a significant improvement in the food quality over just a few years prior.",
              "The items were cooked perfectly and tailored to the region \u2013 which both locals and tourists appreciate.",
              "\u201c[In destinations in the Western world, we are] seeing an increase in food quality overall, but the introduction of unique food options mixed into the offering.",
              "\u201d Food can also be a unique way to engage kids and provide an experience.",
              "However, this doesn\u2019t always require that an entire meal be part of the totally immersive experience.",
              "Something as simple as fun shaped candies \u2013 say, insects for a bug-themed world \u2013 can often make a strong impact.",
              "Further, theme park developers are finding that they can reduce capital costs without compromising food quality by designing food preparation dining environments that are operationally smart.",
              "For example, the co-utilization of kitchens for multiple eateries keeps costs down.",
              "To a similar effect, having one outdoor eating area for multiple restaurants maximizes investment and use of space.",
              "Another factor in theme park trends is the utilization of ever-evolving technologies.",
              "Today, new technology advancements are enhancing the theme park experience and adding entirely new types of attractions.",
              "While the new technology is attractive to visitors who have often not otherwise experienced it, it is also a new experience for the theme park operator who must consider how these different experiences function in terms of operations costs and guest capacity.",
              "For example, a theme park client we work with is currently considering parkwide gamification.",
              "The challenge for the involved stakeholders is that they must weigh the appeal of introducing such a unique experience with the capital cost, as well as how doing so will affect schedule, since the park is already under construction.",
              "As another example, virtual reality and augmented reality, both in standalone destinations like The VOID and incorporated into existing theme parks, are gaining popularity.",
              "These attractions require additional staff and time to help guests through the experience, in and out of suits or equipment, as well as to sanitize and hang items. Further, return-on-investment can be lowered as the number of people is greatly constrained based on the space and time of the experience.",
              "The good news is, AR technology is smaller and not as heavy, so we will see more and more AR devices that guests can wear throughout the day at theme parks, eliminating some of these issues.",
              "That said, it is important that theme park operators not jump in until the finances make sense.",
