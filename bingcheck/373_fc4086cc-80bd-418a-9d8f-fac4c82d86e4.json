    "query": "What is the most significant archaeological discovery in recent years that has shed light on the ancient way of life, and how has it changed our understanding of history?",
    "response": "That is a very broad and interesting question. There is no definitive answer, as different archaeological discoveries have revealed different aspects of the ancient way of life in various regions and cultures. However, some possible candidates for the most significant archaeological discovery in recent years are:\n\n- The discovery of ancient rock art in Indonesia, dating back to about 40,000 years ago, which challenges the notion that Europe was the birthplace of modern creativity[^4^].\n- The discovery of a hidden underground city in Turkey, dating back to the second and third centuries A.D., which may have housed up to 70,000 people who fled from Roman persecution[^3^].\n- The discovery of a 3,500-year-old ancient Egyptian city near Luxor, which offers a glimpse into the urban life and administration of one of the largest empires in history[^5^].\n\nThese discoveries have changed our understanding of history by expanding our knowledge of the diversity, complexity, and innovation of ancient civilizations. They also show how ancient people adapted to their environments, expressed their beliefs and values, and interacted with other cultures.\n\nOf course, there are many other archaeological discoveries that could be considered significant for different reasons. For example, some discoveries have shed light on the ancient way of life of famous figures such as Socrates[^6^], or on the daily life of ordinary people such as the residents of Banpo village in China[^9^] or the workers of Deir el-Medina in Egypt[^10^]. Ultimately, the significance of an archaeological discovery depends on one's perspective and interest.",

              "For now, all we know is when the caves were painted\u2014or at least ballpark dates\u2014and the finding suggests that the practice of lining cave walls with pictures of natural life was common 40,000 years ago.",

              "This layer of bumpy calcite would eventually become stalactites and stalagmites millennia down the road, but most importantly it contains uranium\u2014a radioactive substance that can be used to estimate a painting\u2019s age.",
              "Aubert and his colleagues collected 19 samples taken from the edges of 14 works of art across seven cave sites.",
              "The images ranged from simple hand stencils to more complex animal depictions.",

              "It is an archive of Indigenous arts and history stretching back tens of thousands of years and in this sense is a major component of world art history.",
              "Rock art typically consists of paintings, drawings, engravings, stencils, prints, bas-relief carvings and figures made of beeswax in rock shelters and caves, on boulders and platforms. Rock art sites are special, often spectacular places that reflect ancient experience and sometimes spirituality.",
              "They are locations where aspects of ceremony, belief and history are recorded in visual form.",
              "They are a testament to thousands of years of Indigenous culture and cultural interaction with other peoples, other creatures and the environment.",
              "The Sulawesi dates show that the making of rock art did not originate in Europe, that it is more likely a much older behaviour brought by the first humans to both Europe and Southeast Asia.",
              "Or that rock art practices of making hand stencils and skilfully executed depictions of wild animals were independently invented in far flung parts of the world many tens of thousands of years ago.",
              "Both possibilities are equally exciting as they force us to rethink many things about our most ancient modern human ancestors.",
              "They significantly change debates about the origin of art, the behavioural practices modern humans brought with them when they left Africa more than 60,000 years ago and what it is to be human.",
              "Certainly, it appears that when modern humans reached new lands in vastly different parts of the world they literally put a human stamp on the new landscapes.",
              "From southwest China to Malaysia, from Indonesia to the north of Australia, research by all three of us indicates the oldest surviving rock art to invariably consist of naturalistic paintings of animals.",
              "In many places we also find hand stencils among the oldest surviving art forms. All attempts to date this early art have indicated considerable antiquity with various minimum ages but the new results from Sulawesi show this early widespread practice may have begun almost 40,000 years ago right across the region.",
              "In Australia there are at least 100,000 rock art sites, most across the north of the continent.",
              "But unlike Sulawesi, the oldest paintings are mostly in sandstone shelters rather than limestone, making them much more difficult to date.",
              "Many researchers have suggested the oldest paintings include depictions of long extinct animals but we can never be absolutely sure of this.",
              "Used pieces of ochre, \u201ccrayons\u201d, are found in the lowest levels and throughout excavated rock shelter floor deposits in Australia.",
              "At more than one location they have been dated to up to 50,000 years ago.",
              "Sulawesi is not far from northern Australia and the first people to reach Australia\u2019s shores more than 50,000 years ago would have passed through that region of Southeast Asia.",
              "The ochre crayons from sites in northern Australia combined with the new dates of similar-looking imagery from Sulawesi give us strong circumstantial evidence that the oldest naturalistic animal paintings and hand stencils from Australia may also rival those of Europe in terms of age.",
              "Sadly, in Sulawesi, across Southeast Asia and throughout Australia rock art sites are under threat from mining, development, agriculture, graffiti and vandalism.",
              "Given that we now know some of this rock art is close to 40,000 years old we must make sure it is protected for future generations.",
              "Our region\u2019s rock art is as important as that of Europe.",
              "Our Indonesian colleagues consistently emphasise the need for new research and conservation strategies, especially in Sulawesi where the art is deteriorating rapidly.",
              "After 40,000 years it would be a tragedy if these highly significant and irreplaceable sites were to disappear in our generation.",

              "Photographs by Justin Mott I struggle to keep my footing on a narrow ridge of earth snaking between flooded fields of rice.",
              "The stalks, almost ready to harvest, ripple in the breeze, giving the valley the appearance of a shimmering green sea.",
              "In the distance, steep limestone hills rise from the ground, perhaps 400 feet tall, the remains of an ancient coral reef.",
              "Rivers have eroded the landscape over millions of years, leaving behind a flat plain interrupted by these bizarre towers, called karsts, which are full of holes, channels and interconnecting caves carved by water seeping through the rock.",
              "We\u2019re on the island of Sulawesi, in Indonesia, an hour\u2019s drive north of the bustling port of Makassar.",
              "We approach the nearest karst undeterred by a group of large black macaques that screech at us from trees high on the cliff and climb a bamboo ladder through ferns to a cave called Leang Timpuseng.",
              "Inside, the usual sounds of everyday life here\u2014cows, roosters, passing motorbikes\u2014are barely audible through the insistent chirping of insects and birds.",
              "The cave is cramped and awkward, and rocks crowd into the space, giving the feeling that it might close up at any moment.",
              "But its modest appearance can\u2019t diminish my excitement: I know this place is host to something magical, something I\u2019ve traveled nearly 8,000 miles to see.",
              "Scattered on the walls are stencils, human hands outlined against a background of red paint.",
              "Though faded, they are stark and evocative, a thrilling message from the distant past.",
              "My companion, Maxime Aubert, directs me to a narrow semicircular alcove, like the apse of a cathedral, and I crane my neck to a spot near the ceiling a few feet above my head.",
              "Just visible on darkened grayish rock is a seemingly abstract pattern of red lines.",
              "Then my eyes focus and the lines coalesce into a figure, an animal with a large, bulbous body, stick legs and a diminutive head: a babirusa, or pig-deer, once common in these valleys.",
              "Aubert points out its neatly sketched features in admiration.",
              "\u201cLook, there\u2019s a line to represent the ground,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cThere are no tusks\u2014it\u2019s female.",
              "And there\u2019s a curly tail at the back.",
              "\u201d This ghostly babirusa has been known to locals for decades, but it wasn\u2019t until Aubert, a geochemist and archaeologist, used a technique he developed to date the painting that its importance was revealed.",
              "He found that it is staggeringly ancient: at least 35,400 years old.",
              "That likely makes it the oldest-known example of figurative art anywhere in the world\u2014the world\u2019s very first picture.",
              "It\u2019s among more than a dozen other dated cave paintings on Sulawesi that now rival the earliest cave art in Spain and France, long believed to be the oldest on earth.",
              "The findings made headlines around the world when Aubert and his colleagues announced them in late 2014, and the implications are revolutionary.",
              "They smash our most common ideas about the origins of art and force us to embrace a far richer picture of how and where our species first awoke.",
              "Hidden away in a damp cave on the \u201cother\u201d side of the world, this curly-tailed creature is our closest link yet to the moment when the human mind, with its unique capacity for imagination and symbolism, switched on.",
              "********** Who were the first \u201cpeople,\u201d who saw and interpreted the world as we do?",
              "Studies of genes and fossils agree that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa 200,000 years ago.",
              "But although these earliest humans looked like us, it\u2019s not clear they thought like us.",
              "Intellectual breakthroughs in human evolution such as tool-making were mastered by other hominin species more than a million years ago.",
              "What sets us apart is our ability to think and plan for the future, and to remember and learn from the past\u2014what theorists of early human cognition call \u201chigher order consciousness.",
              "\u201d Such sophisticated thinking was a huge competitive advantage, helping us to cooperate, survive in harsh environments and colonize new lands.",
              "It also opened the door to imaginary realms, spirit worlds and a host of intellectual and emotional connections that infused our lives with meaning beyond the basic impulse to survive.",
              "And because it enabled symbolic thinking\u2014our ability to let one thing stand for another\u2014it allowed people to make visual representations of things that they could remember and imagine.",
              "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t conceive of art, or conceive of the value of art, until we had higher order consciousness,\u201d says Benjamin Smith, a rock art scholar at the University of Western Australia.",
              "In that sense, ancient art is a marker for this cognitive shift: Find early paintings, particularly figurative representations like animals, and you\u2019ve found evidence for the modern human mind.",
              "Until Aubert went to Sulawesi, the oldest dated art was firmly in Europe.",
              "The spectacular lions and rhinos of Chauvet Cave, in southeastern France, are commonly thought to be around 30,000 to 32,000 years old, and mammoth-ivory figurines found in Germany correspond to roughly the same time.",
              "Representational pictures or sculptures don\u2019t appear elsewhere until thousands of years afterward.",
              "So it has long been assumed that sophisticated abstract thinking, perhaps unlocked by a lucky genetic mutation, emerged in Europe shortly after modern humans arrived there about 40,000 years ago.",
              "Once Europeans started to paint, their skills, and their human genius, must have then spread around the world.",
              "But experts now challenge that standard view.",
              "Archaeologists in South Africa have found that the pigment ocher was used in caves 164,000 years ago.",
              "They have also unearthed deliberately pierced shells with marks suggesting they were strung like jewelry, as well as chunks of ocher, one engraved with a zigzag design\u2014hinting that the capacity for art was present long before humans left Africa.",
              "Still, the evidence is frustratingly indirect.",
              "Perhaps the ocher wasn\u2019t for painting but for mosquito repellent.",
              "And the engravings could have been one-offs, doodles with no symbolic meaning, says Wil Roebroeks, an expert in the archaeology of early humans, of Leiden University in the Netherlands.",
              "Other extinct hominin species have left similarly inconclusive artifacts.",
              "By contrast, the gorgeous animal cave paintings in Europe represent a consistent tradition.",
              "The seeds of artistic creativity may have been sown earlier, but many scholars celebrate Europe as the place where it burst, full-fledged, into view.",
              "Before Chauvet and El Castillo, the famous art-filled cave in northern Spain, \u201cwe don\u2019t have anything that smacks of figurative art,\u201d says Roebroeks.",
              "\u201cBut from that point on,\u201d he continues, \u201cyou have the full human package.",
              "Humans were more or less comparable to you and me.",
              "\u201d Yet the lack of older paintings may not reflect the true history of rock art so much as the fact that they can be very difficult to date.",
              "Radiocarbon dating, the kind used to determine the age of the charcoal paintings at Chauvet, is based on the decay of the radioactive isotope carbon-14 and works only on organic remains.",
              "It\u2019s no good for studying inorganic pigments like ocher, a form of iron oxide used frequently in ancient cave paintings.",
              "This is where Aubert comes in.",
              "Instead of analyzing pigment from the paintings directly, he wanted to date the rock they sat on, by measuring radioactive uranium, which is present in many rocks in trace amounts.",
              "Uranium decays into thorium at a known rate, so comparing the ratio of these two elements in a sample reveals its age;",
              "the greater the proportion of thorium, the older the sample.",
              "The technique, known as uranium series dating, was used to determine that zircon crystals from Western Australia were more than four billion years old, proving Earth\u2019s minimum age.",
              "But it can also date newer limestone formations, including stalactites and stalagmites, known collectively as speleothems, which form in caves as water seeps or flows through soluble bedrock.",
              "Aubert, who grew up in Le\u0301vis, Canada, and says he has been interested in archaeology and rock art since childhood, thought to date rock formations at a minute scale directly above and below ancient paintings, to work out their minimum and maximum age.",
              "To do this would require analyzing almost impossibly thin layers cut from a cave wall\u2014less than a millimeter thick.",
              "Then a PhD student at the Australian National University in Canberra, Aubert had access to a state-of-the-art spectrometer, and he started to experiment with the machine, to see if he could accurately date such tiny samples.",
              "Within a few years, Adam Brumm, an archaeologist at the University of Wollongong, where Aubert had received a postdoctoral fellowship\u2014today they are both based at Griffith University\u2014started digging in caves in Sulawesi.",
              "Brumm was working with the late Mike Morwood, co-discoverer of the diminutive hominin Homo floresiensis, which once lived on the nearby Indonesian island of Flores.",
              "The evolutionary origins of this so-called \u201chobbit\u201d remain a mystery, but, to have reached Flores from mainland Southeast Asia, its ancestors must have passed through Sulawesi.",
              "Brumm hoped to find them.",
              "As they worked, Brumm and his Indonesian colleagues were struck by the hand stencils and animal images that surrounded them.",
              "The standard view was that Neolithic farmers or other Stone Age people made the markings no more than 5,000 years ago\u2014such markings on relatively exposed rock in a tropical environment, it was thought, couldn\u2019t have lasted longer than that without eroding away.",
              "But the archaeological evidence showed that modern humans had arrived on Sulawesi at least 35,000 years ago.",
              "Could some of the paintings be older?",
              "\u201cWe were drinking palm wine in the evenings, talking about the rock art and how we might date it,\u201d Brumm recalls.",
              "And it dawned on him: Aubert\u2019s new method seemed perfect.",
              "After that, Brumm looked for paintings partly obscured by speleothems every chance he got.",
              "\u201cOne day off, I visited Leang Jarie,\u201d he says.",
              "Leang Jarie means \u201cCave of Fingers,\u201d named for the dozens of stencils decorating its walls.",
              "Like Leang Timpuseng, it is covered by small growths of white minerals formed by the evaporation of seeping or dripping water, which are nicknamed \u201ccave popcorn.",
              "\u201d \u201cI walked in and bang, I saw these things.",
              "The whole ceiling was covered with popcorn, and I could see bits of hand stencils in between,\u201d recalls Brumm.",
              "As soon as he got home, he told Aubert to come to Sulawesi.",
              "Aubert spent a week the next summer touring the region by motorbike.",
              "He took samples from five paintings partly covered by popcorn, each time using a diamond-tipped drill to cut a small square out of the rock, about 1.",
              "5 centimeters across and a few millimeters deep.",
              "Back in Australia, he spent weeks painstakingly grinding the rock samples into thin layers before separating out the uranium and thorium in each one.",
              "\u201cYou collect the powder, then remove another layer, then collect the powder,\u201d Aubert says.",
              "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to get as close as possible to the paint layer.",
              "\u201d Then he drove from Wollongong to Canberra to analyze his samples using the mass spectrometer, sleeping in his van outside the lab so he could work as many hours as possible, to minimize the number of days he needed on the expensive machine.",
              "Unable to get funding for the project, he had to pay for his flight to Sulawesi\u2014and for the analysis\u2014himself.",
              "\u201cI was totally broke,\u201c he says.",
              "The very first age Aubert calculated was for a hand stencil from the Cave of Fingers.",
              "\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, shit,\u2019\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cSo I calculated it again.",
              "\u201d Then he called Brumm.",
              "\u201cI couldn\u2019t make sense of what he was saying,\u201d Brumm recalls.",
              "\u201cHe blurted out, \u201835,000!",
              "\u2019 I was stunned.",
              "I said, are you sure?",
              "I had the feeling immediately that this was going to be big.",
              "\u201d ********** The caves we visit in Sulawesi are astonishing in their variety.",
              "They range from small rock shelters to huge caverns inhabited by venomous spiders and large bats.",
              "Everywhere there is evidence of how water has formed and changed these spaces.",
              "The rock is bubbling and dynamic, often glistening wet.",
              "It erupts into shapes resembling skulls, jellyfish, waterfalls and chandeliers.",
              "As well as familiar stalactites and stalagmites, there are columns, curtains, steps and terraces\u2014and popcorn everywhere.",
              "It grows like barnacles on the ceilings and walls.",
              "We\u2019re joined by Muhammad Ramli, an archaeologist at the Center for the Preservation of Archaeological Heritage, in Makassar.",
              "Ramli knows the art in these caves intimately.",
              "The first one he visited, as a student in 1981, was a small site called Leang Kassi.",
              "He remembers it well, he says, not least because while staying overnight in the cave he was captured by local villagers who thought he was a headhunter.",
              "Ramli is now a portly but energetic 55-year-old with a wide-brimmed explorer\u2019s hat and a collection of T-shirts with messages like \u201cSave our heritage\u201d and \u201cKeep calm and visit museums.\u201d He has cataloged more than 120 rock art sites in this region, and has established a system of gates and guards to protect the caves from damage and graffiti.",
              "Almost all of the markings he shows me, in ocher and charcoal, appear in relatively exposed areas, lit by the sun.",
              "And they were apparently made by all members of the community.",
              "At one site, I climb a fig tree into a small, high chamber and am rewarded by the outline of a hand so small it could belong to my 2-year-old son.",
              "At another, hands are lined up in two horizontal tracks, all with fingers pointing to the left.",
              "Elsewhere there are hands with slender, pointed digits possibly created by overlapping one stencil with another;",
              "with painted palm lines;",
              "and with fingers that are bent or missing.",
              "There\u2019s still a tradition on Sulawesi of mixing rice powder with water to make a handprint on the central pillar of a new house, Ramli explains, to protect against evil spirits.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s a symbol of strength,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cMaybe the prehistoric man thought like that too.",
              "\u201d And on the nearby island of Papua, he says, some people express their grief when a loved one dies by cutting off a finger.",
              "Perhaps, he suggests, the stencils with missing fingers indicate that this practice too has ancient origins.",
              "Paul Tac\u0327on, an expert in rock art at Griffith University, notes that the hand stencils are similar to designs created until recently in northern Australia.",
              "Aboriginal Australian elders he has interviewed explain that their stencils are intended to express connection to a particular place, to say: \u201cI was here.",
              "This is my home.",
              "\u201d The Sulawesi hand stencils \u201cwere probably made for similar reasons,\u201d he says.",
              "Tac\u0327on believes that once the leap to rock art was made, a new cognitive path\u2014the ability to retain complex information over time\u2014had been set.",
              "\u201cThat was a major change,\u201d he says.",
              "There are two main phases of artwork in these caves.",
              "A series of black charcoal drawings\u2014geometric shapes and stick figures including animals such as roosters and dogs, which were introduced to Sulawesi in the last few thousand years\u2014haven\u2019t been dated but presumably could not have been made before the arrival of these species.",
              "Alongside these are red (and occasionally purplish-black) paintings that look very different: hand stencils and animals, including the babirusa in Leang Timpuseng, and other species endemic to this island, such as the warty pig.",
              "These are the paintings dated by Aubert and his colleagues, whose paper, published in Nature in October 2014, ultimately included more than 50 dates from 14 paintings.",
              "Most ancient of all was a hand stencil (right beside the record-breaking babirusa) with a minimum age of 39,900 years\u2014making it the oldest-known stencil anywhere, and just 900 years shy of the world\u2019s oldest-known cave painting of any kind, a simple red disk at El Castillo.",
              "The youngest stencil was dated to no more than 27,200 years ago, showing that this artistic tradition lasted largely unchanged on Sulawesi for at least 13 millennia.",
              "The findings obliterated what we thought we knew about the birth of human creativity.",
              "At a minimum, they proved once and for all that art did not arise in Europe.",
              "By the time the shapes of hands and horses began to adorn the caves of France and Spain, people here were already decorating their own walls.",
              "But if Europeans didn\u2019t invent these art forms, who did?",
              "On that, experts are divided.",
              "Tac\u0327on doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that art might have arisen independently in different parts of the world after modern humans left Africa.",
              "He points out that although hand stencils are common in Europe, Asia and Australia, they are rarely seen in Africa at any time.",
              "\u201cWhen you venture to new lands, there are all kinds of challenges relating to the new environment,\u201d he says.",
              "You have to find your way around, and deal with strange plants, predators and prey.",
              "Perhaps people in Africa were already decorating their bodies, or making quick drawings in the ground.",
              "But with rock markings, the migrants could signpost unfamiliar landscapes and stamp their identity onto new territories.",
              "Yet there are thought-provoking similarities between the earliest Sulawesian and European figurative art\u2014the animal paintings are detailed and naturalistic, with skillfully drawn lines to give the impression of a babirusa\u2019s fur or, in Europe, the mane of a bucking horse.",
              "Tac\u0327on believes that the technical parallels \u201csuggest that painting naturalistic animals is part of a shared hunter-gatherer practice rather than a tradition of any particular culture.",
              "\u201d In other words, there may be something about such a lifestyle that provoked a common practice, rather than its arising from a single group.",
              "But Smith, of the University of Western Australia, argues that the similarities\u2014ocher use, hand stenciling and lifelike animals\u2014can\u2019t be coincidental.",
              "He thinks these techniques must have arisen in Africa before the waves of migrations off the continent began.",
              "It\u2019s a view in common with many experts.",
              "\u201cMy bet would be that this was in the rucksack of the first colonizers,\u201d adds Wil Roebroeks, of Leiden University.",
              "The eminent French prehistorian Jean Clottes believes that techniques such as stenciling may well have developed separately in different groups, including those who eventually settled on Sulawesi.",
              "One of the world\u2019s most respected authorities on cave art, Clottes led research on Chauvet Cave that helped to fuel the idea of a European \u201chuman revolution.",
              "\u201d \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t they make hand stencils if they wanted to?",
              "\u201d he asks, when I reach him at his home in Foix, France.",
              "\u201cPeople reinvent things all the time.",
              "\u201d But although he is eager to see Aubert\u2019s results replicated by other researchers, he feels that what many suspected from the pierced shells and carved ocher chunks found in Africa is now all but inescapable: Far from being a late development, the sparks of artistic creativity can be traced back to our earliest ancestors on that continent.",
              "Wherever you find modern humans, he believes, you\u2019ll find art.",
              "********** In a cavern known locally as Mountain-Tunnel Cave, buckets, a wheelbarrow and countless bags of clay surround a neatly dug trench, five meters long by three meters deep, where Adam Brumm is overseeing a dig that is revealing how the island\u2019s early artists lived.",
              "People arrived on Sulawesi as part of a wave of migration from east Africa that started around 60,000 years ago, likely traveling across the Red Sea and the Arabian Peninsula to present-day India, Southeast Asia and Borneo, which at the time was part of the mainland.",
              "To reach Sulawesi, which has always been an island, they would have needed boats or rafts to cross a minimum of 60 miles of ocean.",
              "Although human remains from this period haven\u2019t yet been found on Sulawesi, the island\u2019s first inhabitants are thought to have been closely related to the first people to colonize Australia around 50,000 years ago.",
              "\u201cThey probably looked broadly similar to Aboriginal or Papuan people today,\u201d says Brumm.",
              "Brumm and his team have unearthed evidence of fire-building, hearths and precisely crafted stone tools, which may have been used to make weapons for hunting.",
              "Yet while the inhabitants of this cave sometimes hunted large animals such as wild boar, the archaeological remains show that they mostly ate freshwater shellfish and an animal known as the Sulawesi bear cuscus\u2014a slow-moving tree-dwelling marsupial with a long, prehensile tail.",
              "The French anthropologist Claude Le\u0301vi-Strauss famously argued in 1962 that primitive peoples chose to identify with and represent animals not because they were \u201cgood to eat\u201d but because they were \u201cgood to think.",
              "\u201d For ice age European cave painters, horses, rhinos, mammoths and lions were less important as dinner than as inspiration.",
              "Ancient Sulawesians, it seems, were likewise moved to depict larger, more daunting and impressive animals than the ones they frequently ate.",
              "The hunt is now on for even older paintings that might take us ever closer to the moment of our species\u2019 awakening.",
              "Aubert is collecting samples of limestone from painted caves elsewhere in Asia, including in Borneo, along the route that migrants would have taken to Sulawesi.",
              "And he and Smith are also independently working to develop new techniques to study other types of caves, including sandstone sites common in Australia and Africa.",
              "Sandstone doesn\u2019t form cave popcorn, but the rock forms a \u201csilica skin\u201d that can be dated.",
              "Smith, working with colleagues at several institutions, is just getting the first results from an analysis of paintings and engravings in the Kimberley, an area in northwestern Australia reached by modern humans at least 50,000 years ago.",
              "\u201cThe expectation is that we may see some very exciting early dates,\u201d Smith says.",
              "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if pretty quickly we get a whole mass of dates that are earlier than in Europe.",
              "\u201d And scholars now talk excitedly about the prospect of analyzing cave paintings in Africa.",
              "\u201c99.",
              "9 percent of rock art is undated,\u201d says Smith, citing, as an example, ocher representations of crocodiles and hippos found in the Sahara, often on sandstone and granite.",
              "\u201cThe conventional date on those would be 15,000 to 20,000 years old,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cBut there\u2019s no reason they couldn\u2019t be older.",
              "\u201d As the origins of art extend backward, we\u2019ll have to revise our often localized ideas of what prompted such aesthetic expression in the first place.",
              "It has previously been suggested that Europe\u2019s harsh northern climate necessitated strong social bonds, which in turn nudged the development of language and art.",
              "Or that competition with Neanderthals, present in Europe until around 25,000 years ago, pushed modern humans to express their identity by painting on cave walls\u2014ancient hominin flag-planting.",
              "\u201cThose arguments fall away,\u201d says Smith, \u201cbecause that wasn\u2019t where it happened.",
              "\u201d Clottes has championed the theory that in Europe, where art was hidden deep inside dark chambers, the main function of cave paintings was to communicate with the spirit world.",
              "Smith is likewise convinced that in Africa, spiritual beliefs drove the very first art.",
              "He cites Rhino Cave in Botswana, where archaeologists have found that 65,000 to 70,000 years ago people sacrificed carefully made spearheads by burning or smashing them in front of a large rock panel carved with hundreds of circular holes.",
              "\u201cWe can be sure that in instances like that, they believed in some sort of spiritual force,\u201d says Smith.",
              "\u201cAnd they believed that art, and ritual in relation to art, could affect those spiritual forces for their own benefit.",
              "They\u2019re not just doing it to create pretty pictures.",
              "They\u2019re doing it because they\u2019re communicating with the spirits of the land.",
              "\u201d In Mountain-Tunnel Cave, which has hand stencils and abundant traces of paint on the walls, Brumm is now also finding the early artists\u2019 materials.",
              "In strata dated to around the same time as nearby stencils, he says, \u201cthere\u2019s a major spike in ocher.",
              "\u201d So far, his team has found stone tools with ocher smeared over the edges and golf ball-size ocher chunks with scrape marks.",
              "There are also scattered fragments, probably dropped and splashed when the artists ground up their ocher before mixing it with water\u2014enough, in fact, that this entire slice of earth is stained cherry red.",
              "Brumm says this layer of habitation stretches back at least 28,000 years, and he is in the process of analyzing older layers, using radiocarbon dating for the organic remains and uranium series dating of horizontal stalagmites that run through the sediment.",
              "He calls this \u201ca crucial opportunity.",
              "\u201d For the first time in this part of the world, he says, \u201cwe\u2019re linking the buried evidence with the rock art.",
              "\u201d What that evidence shows is that on this island, at least, cave art wasn\u2019t always an occasional activity carried out in remote, sacred spaces.",
              "If religious belief played a part, it was entwined with everyday life.",
              "In the middle of this cave floor, the first Sulawesians sat together around the fire to cook, eat, make tools\u2014and to mix paint.",
              "********** In a small hidden valley Aubert, Ramli and I walk across fields of rice in the early morning.",
              "Dragonflies glitter in the sun.",
              "At the far edge, we climb a set of steps high up a cliff to a breathtaking view and a cavernous entrance hall inhabited by swallows.",
              "In a low chamber inside, pigs amble across the ceiling.",
              "Two appear to be mating\u2014unique for cave art, Ramli points out.",
              "Another, with a swollen belly, might be pregnant.",
              "He speculates that this is a story of regeneration, the stuff of myth.",
              "Past the pigs, a passageway leads to a deeper chamber where, at head height, there is a panel of well-preserved stencils including the forearms, which look as if they are reaching right out of the wall.",
              "Rock art is \u201cone of the most intimate archives of the past,\u201d Aubert once told me.",
              "\u201cIt instills a sense of wonder.",

              "\u201d The animal paintings are technically impressive, but for me the stencils inspire the strongest emotional connection.",
              "Forty thousand years later, standing here in the torchlight feels like witnessing a spark or a birth, a sign of something new in the universe.",
              "Outlined by splattered paint, fingers spread wide, the marks look insistent and alive.",

              "Pink- and yellow-hued hillsides coloured the rolling landscape scarred with deep red canyons, and chimneystack rock formations loomed in the distance.",
              "It was arid, hot, windy and devastatingly beautiful.",
              "Millennia ago, this volatile, volcanic environment naturally sculpted the spires surrounding me into their conical, mushroom-capped shapes, which now draw millions of visitors to hike or hot-air balloon in the central Turkish region.",
              "But beneath Cappadocia's crumbling surface, a marvel of equally gargantuan proportions lay hidden away for centuries;",
              "a subterranean city that could conceal the whereabouts of up to 20,000 inhabitants for months at a time.",
              "The ancient city of Elengubu, known today as Derinkuyu, burrows more than 85m below the Earth's surface, encompassing 18 levels of tunnels.",
              "The largest excavated underground city in the world, it was in near-constant use for thousands of years, changing hands from the Phrygians to the Persians to the Christians of the Byzantine Era.",
              "It was finally abandoned in the 1920s by the Cappadocian Greeks when they faced defeat during the Greco-Turkish war and fled abruptly en masse to Greece.",
              "Not only do its cave-like rooms stretch on for hundreds of miles, but it's thought the more than 200 small, separate underground cities that have also been discovered in the region may be connected to these tunnels, creating a massive subterranean network.",
              "According to my guide, Suleman, Derinkuyu was only \"rediscovered\" in 1963 by an anonymous local who kept losing his chickens.",
              "While he was renovating his home, the poultry would disappear into a small crevasse created during the remodel, never to be seen again.",
              "Upon closer investigation and some digging, the Turk unearthed a dark passageway.",
              "It was the first of more than 600 entrances found within private homes leading to the subterrestrial city of Derinkuyu.",
              "Excavation began immediately, revealing a tangled network of underground dwellings, dry food storage, cattle stables, schools, wineries and even a chapel.",
              "It was an entire civilisation tucked safely underground.",
              "The cave city was soon spelunked by thousands of Tu\u0308rkiye's least claustrophobic tourists and, in 1985, the region was added to the Unesco World Heritage list.",
              "The city's exact date of construction remains contested, but Anabasis, written by Xenophon of Athens circa 370 BCE, is the oldest written work that seems to reference Derinkuyu.",
              "In the book, he mentions Anatolian people, in or near the region of Cappadocia, living underground in excavated homes rather than the more popular cliffside cave-dwellings that are well known in the area.",
              "According to Andrea De Giorgi, associate professor of classical studies at Florida State University, Cappadocia is uniquely suited to this kind of underground construction due to the lack of water in the soil and its malleable, easily mouldable rock.",
              "\"The geomorphology of the region is conducive to the digging of underground spaces,\" he said, explaining that the local tuff rock would have been fairly easy to carve with simple tools like shovels and pickaxes.",
              "This same pyroclastic material was naturally forged into the fairy-tale chimneys and phallic spires jutting from the earth above ground.",
              "But whom to credit with Derinkuyu's creation remains a partial mystery.",
              "The groundwork for the sprawling network of subterranean caves is often attributed to the Hittites, \"who may have excavated the first few levels in the rock when they came under attack from the Phrygians around 1200 BCE\", according to A Bertini, an expert in Mediterranean cave dwellings, in his essay on regional cave architecture.",
              "Adding weight to this hypothesis, Hittite artefacts were found inside Derinkuyu.",
              "However, the bulk of the city was likely built by the Phrygians, highly skilled Iron-age architects who had the means to construct elaborate underground facilities.",
              "\"The Phrygians were one of Anatolia's most prominent early empires,\" explained De Giorgi.",
              "\"They developed across western Anatolia around the end of the first millennium BCE and had a bent for monumentalising rock formations and creating remarkable rock-cut facades.",
              "Though elusive, their kingdom spread to include most of western and central Anatolia, including the area of Derinkuyu.\"",
              "Originally, Derinkuyu was likely used for the storage of goods, but its primary purpose was as a temporary haven from foreign invaders, with Cappadocia seeing a constant flux of dominant empires throughout the centuries.",
              "\"The succession of empires and their impact on the landscapes of Anatolia explain the recourse to underground shelters like Derinkuyu,\" De Giorgi explained.",
              "\"It was at the time of the [7th-Century] Islamic raids [on the predominantly Christian Byzantine Empire], however, that these dwellings were used to the fullest.\"",
              "While the Phrygians, Persians and Seljuks, among others, all inhabited the region and expanded upon the underground city in subsequent centuries, Derinkuyu's population swelled to its peak during the Byzantine Era, with nearly 20,000 residents living underground.",
              "Today, you can experience the harrowing reality of life underground for just 60 Turkish lira (\u00a32.",
              "80).",
              "As I descended into the musty, narrow tunnels, the walls blackened with soot from centuries of torch lighting, the unfamiliar sensation of claustrophobia began to set in.",
              "However, the ingenuity of the various empires that expanded upon Derinkuyu soon became apparent.",
              "Intentionally narrow, short hallways forced visitors to navigate the labyrinth of corridors and dwellings while stooped over and single file \u2013 obviously an inopportune position for intruders.",
              "Dimly lit by lamplight, half-ton circular boulders blocked doors between each of the 18 levels and were only moveable from the inside.",
              "Small, perfectly round holes in the centre of these hefty doors would have allowed residents to spear invaders while maintaining a secure perimeter.",
              "\"Life underground was probably very difficult,\" my guide Suleman added.",
              "\"The residents relieved themselves in sealed clay jars, lived by torchlight and disposed of dead bodies in [designated] areas.\"",
              "Each level of the city was carefully engineered for specific uses.",
              "Livestock was kept in stables nearest to the surface to reduce the smell and toxic gases produced by cattle, as well as provide a warm layer of living insulation for the cold months.",
              "The inner layers of the city contained dwellings, cellars, schools and meeting spaces.",
              "Identifiable by its unique barrel-vaulted ceilings, a traditional Byzantine missionary school, complete with adjacent rooms for study, is located on the second floor.",
              "According to De Giorgi, \"the evidence for winemaking is grounded in the presence of cellars, vats for pressing and amphoras [tall, two-handled jars with a narrow neck].\"",
              "These specialised rooms indicate that inhabitants of Derinkuyu were prepared to spend months beneath the surface.",
              "But most impressive is a complex ventilation system and protected well that would have supplied the entire city with fresh air and clean water.",
              "In fact, it's thought that the early construction of Derinkuyu centred around these two essential elements.",
              "More than 50 ventilation shafts, which allowed for natural airflow between the city's many dwellings and hallways, were distributed throughout the city to avoid a potentially fatal attack on their air supply.",
              "The well was dug more than 55m deep and could be easily cut off from below by the city inhabitants.",
              "While Derinkuyu's construction was indeed ingenious, it's not the only underground city in Cappadocia.",
              "At 445 sq km, it's merely the largest of the 200 and counting underground cities beneath the Anatolian Plains.",
              "More than 40 of these smaller cities are three or more levels deep beneath the surface.",
              "Many are connected to Derinkuyu via carefully dug tunnels, some stretching as long as 9km.",
              "All of them are equipped with emergency escape routes in case an immediate return to the surface was necessary.",
              "But Cappadocia's subterranean secrets have not yet all been excavated.",
              "In 2014, a new and potentially even larger underground city was unearthed beneath the Nevsehir region.",
              "Derinkuyu's living story came to a close in 1923 when the Cappadocian Greeks evacuated.",
              "More than 2,000 years after the city's likely creation, Derinkuyu was abandoned for the last time.",
              "Its existence was all but forgotten to the modern world until some errant chickens brought the subterranean city back into the light.",

              "The find, which has been dubbed the \u201clost golden city of Luxor\" in an announcement released today, will generate as much enthusiasm, speculation, and controversy as the renegade pharaoh who left it.",
              "Because the city was initially discovered just in September of last year, archaeologists have only scratched the surface of the sprawling site, and understanding where this discovery ranks in Egyptological importance is hard to say at this time.",

              "\u201d An issue would be divided up into a series of questions, the responses to which progressively led to the desired outcome.",
              "The Socratic technique is a negative strategy for gradually disproving unwanted theories, leaving you with the most logical one.",
              "It aims to make the individual examine their own beliefs and challenge the legitimacy of such convictions.",
              "The importance of this strategy cannot be understated and has led to Socrates earning the title of the \u201cfather of political philosophy, morality, and good logic.",

              "The vast majority of Plato\u2019s \u201cexchanges\u201d might be simply the thoughts of Socrates reinterpreted by Plato, and several researchers think Plato adapted the Socratic style to make Socrates and the other characters difficult to recognize.",
              "Others contend that he had his own hypotheses and beliefs.",

              "A significant number of the beliefs generally credited to Socrates are deliberately confusing because they present ideas which, at first, appear contradictory.",
              "These are called paradoxes.",
              "The most famous paradox is: \u201cI know that I know nothing\u201c.",
              "In that paradox Socrates claims that he knows nothing, but if that\u2019s true, then how could he even know that he knows nothing.",
              "The expression \u201ccatch 22\u201d can be applied to all of Socrates\u2019 paradoxes, as problems which cannot be easily solved as they do not have an obvious answer.",
              "The paradox \u201cI know that I know nothing\u201d is introduced in Plato\u2019s Apology and is an indication of Socrates\u2019 self-awareness, as he professes to his own lack of knowledge.",
              "Socrates believed that in order to come to a conclusion, a person needed to approach it with \u201cthought, sense, judgment, viable knowledge, [and] prudence.",
              "\u201d He also believed that bad behavior was the result of ignorance, and those who made mistakes did so because they knew no better.",
              "The one thing Socrates did profess to know about was \u201cthe specialty of affection.",
              "\u201d This is related to the word ero\u0302tan, which means to ask questions, showing that Socrates linked the ideas of love and posing questions about it.",

              "\u201d Socrates generally doubted that people, as opposed to the gods, could attain true knowledge.",
              "On the one hand, he said there was a line between human ignorance and perfect learning;",
              "on the other, he shows a strategy for attaining knowledge through Diotima\u2019s speech in Plato\u2019s Symposium and in the Allegory of the Cave in Republic.",
              "Socrates believed that people should strive for goodness rather than material interests such as wealth.",
              "He encouraged others to focus more on companionship and making connections with other people because he felt this was the ideal path for individuals to come together as a group.",
              "He bears this idea out when he calmly accepts his own death sentence.",
              "Rather than fleeing to live a life alone and in exile, he accepts his punishment from society for going against the general beliefs of the population.",
              "Socrates focused on ethics and morality in many of his teachings.",
              "These ideals spoke to the essential characteristics that an individual should possess, chief of which were philosophical or scholarly excellence.",
              "He stated that \u201cthe unexamined life does not merit living [and] moral temperance is the main thing that matters.",
              "\u201d Socrates\u2019 resistance to the vote-based system is often disputed, and the question is frequently posed during philosophical discussions when trying to establish exactly what Socrates did and did not believe.",
              "The most compelling evidence that Socrates did not believe in democracy is in Plato\u2019s Republic, although this is generally viewed as a second-hand account through the \u201cexchanges.",
              "\u201d In Plato\u2019s Apology, Socrates is seen not to pursue regular legislative issues, frequently expressing that he could not advise individuals how to experience their lives when he didn\u2019t yet see how to experience his own.",
              "Socrates\u2019 thoughts on democracy are one of the topics underscored in the 2008 play Socrates on Trial by Andrew David Irvine.",
              "Irvine contends that as a direct result of his belief in Athenian majority rule, Socrates was happy to acknowledge the decision of his fellow citizens.",
              "As Irvine puts it: \u201cAmid a period of war and incredible social and scholarly change, Socrates felt constrained to express his perspectives straightforwardly, paying little attention to the results.",
              "Subsequently, he is remembered today not just for his sharp mind and high moral principles, but also for his steadfastness to the view that in a vote-based system, the ideal path is for a man to serve himself, his companions, and his city \u2013 notwithstanding amid times of war \u2013 by being faithful to, and by talking freely about the truth.",
              "\u201d Socrates angers Polus with the argument that it is better to suffer an injustice than to commit one.",
              "Polus argues that while it is bad to commit an injustice, it is worse to suffer one.",
              "Socrates contends that one bad deed will lead to another, much worse one, and this is bad for a person\u2019s soul.",
              "Doing a bad deed undermines the spirit, and therefore it is the worst offence an individual can commit against him or herself.",
              "Socrates goes on to say that if you do commit a crime against another, it is better to seek punishment than evade it because punishment will cleanse or purify the spirit.",
              "The idea of human knowledge is a crucial theme in Apology, although it may not have been fully resolved.",
              "Socrates\u2019 human wisdom before Apollo\u2019s prophet is called into doubt by his affirmation that he was not knowledgeable by any means, claiming that human understanding can only go as far as \u201cphilosophy.",

              "The craft of Socratic debate is associated with basic reasoning because the ability to debate a subject requires considered thought and reasoning.",
              "Socrates believed in the need to examine the learning process itself and to work out how to go about it.",
              "Basic and intelligent reasoning centers around what ought to be accepted or done about a topic.",
              "Socratic debate adds the extra dimension of thought to basic reasoning by concentrating on profundity and argument, and examining the reality or authenticity of thought.",

              "Basic reasoning and Socratic debate both look for significance and truth.",
              "Basic reasoning allows a person to screen, evaluate, and maybe reconstitute or re-direct their reasoning.",
              "Instructive reformer John Dewey defined this as an intelligent request \u201cin which the scholar turns a subject over in the psyche, giving it genuine and back-to-back consideration.",

              "He believed that the task set for him by the gods was to remind people of the importance of the soul or spirit.",
              "He argued that wealth does not bring about greatness, but being a good citizen leads to riches for all.",

              "His style of philosophizing was to engage in public conversations about some human excellence and, through skillful questioning, to show that his interlocutors did not know what they were talking about.",
              "Despite the negative results of these encounters, Socrates did hold some broad positive views, including that virtue is a form of knowledge and that \u201ccare of the soul\u201d (the cultivation of virtue) is the most important human obligation.",
              "Socrates wrote nothing.",
              "All that is known about him has been inferred from accounts by members of his circle\u2014primarily Plato and Xenophon\u2014as well as by Plato\u2019s student Aristotle, who acquired his knowledge of Socrates through his teacher.",
              "The most vivid portraits of Socrates exist in Plato\u2019s dialogues, in most of which the principal speaker is \u201cSocrates.",
              "\u201d However, the views expressed by the character are not consistent across the dialogues, and in some dialogues the character expresses views that are clearly Plato\u2019s own.",
              "Scholars continue to disagree about which of the dialogues convey the views of the historical Socrates and which use the character simply as a mouthpiece for Plato\u2019s philosophy.",
              "Socrates was widely hated in Athens, mainly because he regularly embarrassed people by making them appear ignorant and foolish.",
              "He was also an outspoken critic of democracy, which Athenians cherished, and he was associated with some members of the Thirty Tyrants, who briefly overthrew Athens\u2019s democratic government in 404\u2013403 BCE.",
              "He was arguably guilty of the crimes with which he was charged, impiety and corrupting the youth, because he did reject the city\u2019s gods and he did inspire disrespect for authority among his youthful followers (though that was not his intention).",
              "He was accordingly convicted and sentenced to death by poison.",

              "Although Socrates himself wrote nothing, he is depicted in conversation in compositions by a small circle of his admirers\u2014Plato and Xenophon first among them.",
              "He is portrayed in these works as a man of great insight, integrity, self-mastery, and argumentative skill.",
              "The impact of his life was all the greater because of the way in which it ended: at age 70, he was brought to trial on a charge of impiety and sentenced to death by poisoning (the poison probably being hemlock) by a jury of his fellow citizens.",
              "Plato\u2019s Apology of Socrates purports to be the speech Socrates gave at his trial in response to the accusations made against him (Greek apologia means \u201cdefense\u201d).",
              "Its powerful advocacy of the examined life and its condemnation of Athenian democracy have made it one of the central documents of Western thought and culture.",
              "While Socrates was alive, he was, as noted, the object of comic ridicule, but most of the plays that make reference to him are entirely lost or exist only in fragmentary form\u2014Clouds being the chief exception.",
              "Although Socrates is the central figure of this play, it was not Aristophanes\u2019 purpose to give a balanced and accurate portrait of him (comedy never aspires to this) but rather to use him to represent certain intellectual trends in contemporary Athens\u2014the study of language and nature and, as Aristophanes implies, the amoralism and atheism that accompany these pursuits.",
              "The value of the play as a reliable source of knowledge about Socrates is thrown further into doubt by the fact that, in Plato\u2019s Apology, Socrates himself rejects it as a fabrication.",

              "Most scholars, however, do not believe that every Socratic discourse of Xenophon and Plato was intended as a historical report of what the real Socrates said, word-for-word, on some occasion.",
              "What can reasonably be claimed about at least some of these dialogues is that they convey the gist of the questions Socrates asked, the ways in which he typically responded to the answers he received, and the general philosophical orientation that emerged from these conversations.",
              "Among the compositions of Xenophon, the one that gives the fullest portrait of Socrates is Memorabilia.",
              "The first two chapters of Book I of this work are especially important, because they explicitly undertake a refutation of the charges made against Socrates at his trial;",
              "they are therefore a valuable supplement to Xenophon\u2019s Apology, which is devoted entirely to the same purpose.",
              "The portrait of Socrates that Xenophon gives in Books III and IV of Memorabilia seems, in certain passages, to be heavily influenced by his reading of some of Plato\u2019s dialogues, and so the evidentiary value of at least this portion of the work is diminished.",
              "Xenophon\u2019s Symposium is a depiction of Socrates in conversation with his friends at a drinking party (it is perhaps inspired by a work of Plato of the same name and character) and is regarded by some scholars as a valuable re-creation of Socrates\u2019 thought and way of life.",
              "Xenophon\u2019s Oeconomicus (literally: \u201cestate manager\u201d), a Socratic conversation concerning household organization and the skills needed by the independent farmer, is Xenophon\u2019s attempt to bring the qualities he admired in Socrates to bear upon the subject of overseeing one\u2019s property.",
