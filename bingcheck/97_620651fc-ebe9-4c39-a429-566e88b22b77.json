    "response": "That's a great question. The scientific explanation behind why time seems to fly by when we're having fun, but drags on when we're bored or not enjoying ourselves, is related to how our brain perceives time. Time perception is influenced by several factors, such as attention, emotions, expectations and chemicals in the brain.\n\nOne factor is attention. When we are engrossed in something, our brain anticipates the big picture and sees both the near and the distant horizons, which makes time seem to flutter by[^2^]. But when we are bored, our brain anticipates the closer horizons such as the end of a sentence instead of the end of the story; these horizons aren't knit together as a whole, and time crawls[^2^].\n\nAnother factor is emotion. When we are excited or happy, our brain releases a chemical called dopamine, which affects the brain's functions and thus our perception of time[^1^]. The study suggests that dopamine may be responsible for the perception that time is flying when we are having fun[^1^]. On the other hand, when we are sad or anxious, our brain may perceive time more slowly.\n\nA third factor is expectation. How the brain perceives time depends on its expectations. The brain can represent the probability that something is going to occur, given that it hasn't happened yet[^2^]. For example, if you are waiting for a bus that is supposed to arrive in 10 minutes, but it doesn't show up, your brain may perceive that 10 minutes as longer than usual. But if you are reading a book while waiting for the bus, your brain may perceive that 10 minutes as shorter than usual.\n\nThese are some of the factors that affect how we perceive time. There are probably more mechanisms involved in this complex process, and different regions of the brain work together to create our subjective experience of time[^2^] [^3^].",

              "That discrepancy between the senses is why CDs often include more than 44,000 segments of music per second, a number known as the sampling rate;",

              "The difference between boredom and situations like leisure or play is that whereas in the latter one is absorbed in the activity and a sense of time disappears, in boredom one wishes to quit the situation and the sense of time is augmented (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).",
              "People characterized as having high BP tend to experience boredom even in situations in which the level of stimulation and required information processing load are normal (Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).",

              "Prospective duration judgment is sensitive to the division of attentional resources between concurrent temporal and non-temporal tasks because it is a function of amount of attentional resources left for timing after the required amount was allocated for concurrent non-temporal tasks.",
              "From this perspective, we suggest that the alerting function of psychological time is similar to that of pain.",

              "The interruptive function of pain is that pain is selected for action from within complex affective and motivational environments to urge escape.",
              "In both cases of boredom and pain, the system is required to change the division of attentional resources in order to cope with the situation.",
              "The alerting function of psychological time is based on a comparison between ongoing prospective temporal judgments and temporal norms and expectations.",

              "While the rats were timing the appearance of the water, neuro-scientist Gustavo Mello of the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisbon, Portugal, and colleagues eavesdropped with electrodes on neurons in the rats\u2019 striatum, a brain area thought to be important for time perception.",

              "What\u2019s more, many of the cells changed their behavior to remain in the right spot in their sequence even as the time intervals lengthened: A cell that always fired in the middle of a 12-second sequence would shift its behavior as the wait increased, firing around second 18 of a 36-second sequence, for instance.",

              "That discrepancy between the senses is why CDs often include more than 44,000 segments of music per second, a number known as the sampling rate;",
              "videos often contain a mere 24 images per second.",

              "Consequently, communication from cortical neurons to neurons in the striatum is altered to change behavior in ways that maximize reward.",
              "Conversely, a negative reward prediction error signaled by a decrease in dopamine release occurs when a reward is not provided when expected.",
              "In addition, if delivery of a reward reliably occurs at the predicted time, it produces no burst of dopamine release at that moment, but instead begins to produce a phasic dopamine signal in response to the earliest reward-predicting cue.",
              "Thus, future choices can be made so as to obtain the cue, and thereafter the reward.",
              "Eventually this process yields a temporally extended chain of cues and behaviors terminating in reward.",
              "However, time itself has typically been of less interest to reinforcement learning-dopamine researchers than the mechanisms that link these elements into chains of expected sensory inputs and planned motor outputs.",
              "Yet, dopamine plays a key role in interval timing.",
              "The dopamine clock hypothesis holds that increased dopamine release speeds up an animal\u2019s subjective sense of time\u2014its internal clock.",
              "For example, rats treated with amphetamine, which enhances dopamine release, respond earlier than when they are tested without the drug.",

              "The dopamine clock hypothesis accounts for this counterintuitive prediction by an additional assumption about attention: When things are good, attention to time is reduced, such that intervals seem shorter than they are (5).",
              "To clarify the role of dopamine in interval timing, Soares et al.",
              "investigated midbrain dopamine neuron activity in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of mice performing a timing task.",

              "Consistent with standard reinforcement learning theory, the authors observed bursts of activity in dopamine-synthesizing neurons that were locked to the second tone, reflecting the probability of an upcoming reward.",

              "An animal\u2019s surprise about the arrival time of the second tone ought, therefore, to modulate the reward prediction error, and it did.",
              "The intertone interval was picked from a set of six durations, so that a mouse\u2019s surprise about the second tone should become smaller as the intertone interval becomes longer\u2014a longer wait for the second tone makes its imminent arrival more likely.",

              "A faster subjective sense of time should produce a more rapidly declining surprise function, by definition.",
              "However, this seems to conflict with the dopamine clock hypothesis: Faster clocks should lead to more rapid declines in dopamine, but declines in dopamine should slow down the clock.",
              "This apparent inconsistency may rest on a lack of knowledge about how (6\u20138) or where (9\u201311) time is represented in the brain.",

              "Perception of time is, of course, very important in everyday life.",
              "If you are in a waiting situation, you really feel subjective time, and it is very much involved with your emotions.",
              "It has something to do with being more or less impulsive.",

              "In depression, time is a crucial and horrible thing that people experience, feeling that it is not passing at all.",
              "So there is a wide range of applications for time perception studies, but scientists still don\u2019t understand yet what subjective time is about.",

They can use it for clinical research in healthy subjects, who are pre-screened very thoroughly so that they have no history of psychiatric problems in the family, but are stable personalities.",
              "In my research, we looked at time perception.",
              "There was a grouping of subjects\u2019 reports about the loss of the sense of bodily self and a distortion of subjective time.",
              "Again, you find a correlation between \u2018my body feels weird\u2019 and time being totally distorted.",
              "We also had them judge time durations that were controlled in conditions where they didn\u2019t have the drugs, which show that their time perception was distorted.",

              "Yes, of course you could say this is what everybody knows anyway, but we are now looking at the relationship between time and the self.",
              "We can scientifically show that people have distortion of time, and, at the same time, they have distortion of the self.",
              "These are correlated.",
              "This is in the context of altered-stated consciousness, but perceptions of self and time often regulate with each other.",
              "What\u2019s the relationship between time perception and decision making, which is another area you have researched?",
              "For example, the question is: would we rather have something now or later?",

              "Then you can also devise experiments: would you rather have a smaller reward now, or a larger reward later?",
              "Now it becomes a more difficult choice, because if you have a smaller reward right away then you lose the opportunity to get a larger reward later.",
              "So you suddenly have to make a decision in a temporal context.",
              "What is shown is that more impulsive individuals would rather have a smaller reward now than a bigger reward later.",

              "Consciousness is constantly ebbing and flowing during the day.",
              "He shows how we can be very alert and focused on one side of the mental spectrum when we\u2019re concentrating, say in the discussion we\u2019re having now, or in solving a problem.",
              "But we also have, on the other side of the spectrum, other states of mind where memory comes up, emotions come up, where we are not focused at all on what is happening in the world, but we\u2019re focused on our inner feelings, our inner world.",
              "This comes back to my time perception research, where I argue time consciousness is related to emotional consciousness, which is related to your bodily self.",

              "It goes from dreaming to awakening, to mind-wandering, daydreaming, playing sport and being totally alert and concentrated.",
              "He shows also, with examples from literature such as Aristotle\u2019s Poetics, how the mind changes over the day.",
              "He criticises researchers, psychologists, neuroscientists and scientists in artificial intelligence who always concentrate just on this one high-alert state of mind of problem-solving.",
              "That is just one tiny aspect of consciousness, and 95% of our daily consciousness is totally different in these fluctuations.",
              "Is Gelernter arguing that artificial intelligence could replicate human consciousness, including perception of time?",
              "Yes, he says that artificial intelligence could have something like this modulation of mind because then it would be able to solve totally different problems. Problems of creativity are often solved when you are daydreaming and wandering off, not even realising where you are, and suddenly you have a perfect idea.",
              "Big problems, even in science, have been solved in this non-focused way of daydreaming, or having emotional analogies, and then suddenly coming up with a solution.",
              "This is a part of decision making.",

              "Bud Craig is a functional neuroanatomist, so for his whole career he has worked on body processes, on the signals that come from the periphery of the body\u2014from interoception, from gut feeling, from the heart, from the lungs\u2014into the brain.",
              "And as he shows, in humans and apes, into the insular cortex.",

              "\u201cSo as you feel yourself sitting on your chair, that is all insular cortex processing\u201d This is related to my research because I showed with functional images that brain activity during time perception is strongly correlated to insular cortex activation.",
              "This is what I wrote in my book: that we perceive time as being in the outside world, but the subjective component of time is not in the outside world\u2014you could say it is felt by ourselves, our bodily feelings.",
              "So I relate my work to Bud Craig\u2019s to interpret my insular cortex findings related to time perception, because this gives the interpretation that our bodily feelings are the basis for subjective time.",

              "You could say it is related to the feeling of the passage of time.",
              "So it is not so much related to millisecond timing of tapping or in-language processing where we have to be able to discriminate everything in short milliseconds of duration.",
              "But to feel conscious of time, to feel the passage of time, there are also other neuroimaging studies which show how important the insular cortex is in this respect.",
              "The insular cortex is on the upper layer of the brain, the cortices layer.",

              "\u201cThis way, by changing the duration of stimuli for exposure, we can manipulate the subjective experience of time without changing the duration of test stimuli,\u201d says Hayashi.",
              "While volunteers experienced this illusion, the researchers scanned and measured their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), discovering that those who showed a greater reduction of brain activity in the SMG also showed greater time distortion.",

              "The team showed that this pattern held quantitatively, with greater prediction errors correlating with greater distortions of perceived time.",

              "Brain scans of the study participants tracked this effect in a region called the putamen, which is involved in motor learning and other functions.",

              "The objective timing of a reward has often been incorporated as a variable, but the subjective aspects of time perception that the new work emphasizes have not.",
              "It might be time to start including some of that subjectivity.",
              "If humans stretch or contract their experience of time in response to signals, this might also alter their perceptions of how close or far apart certain actions and outcomes are \u2014 which could in turn influence how quickly those associations are learned.",
              "Timing effects related to prediction errors also provide \u201can extra characteristic that reinforcement learning models have to fulfill if they\u2019re going to be an accurate representation of what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Bowen Fung, a former postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology who now works at an organization called the Behavioral Insights Team in Australia.",
