    "query": "How do different musical genres affect brain activity and emotional responses, and what impact can this have on mental health and well-being?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. Music is a powerful stimulus that can affect our brain activity and emotional responses in various ways. According to some studies[^1^] [^2^], different musical genres can activate different brain regions related to perception, action, emotion and learning. For example, classical music may engage the auditory cortex and the prefrontal cortex, which are involved in processing complex sounds and abstract reasoning[^1^]. Rock music may stimulate the motor cortex and the cerebellum, which are responsible for coordinating movements and rhythm[^1^]. Jazz music may activate the temporal lobe and the amygdala, which are involved in memory and emotion[^1^].\n\nMusic can also trigger positive or negative emotions in listeners, depending on their personal preferences, musical features and contextual factors[^2^] [^4^]. Music can induce feelings of pleasure, joy, sadness, anger, fear or surprise by manipulating elements such as melody, harmony, rhythm, tempo, pitch, dynamics and timbre[^2^]. Music can also elicit physiological responses such as chills, thrills, goosebumps, heart rate changes and skin conductance changes[^2^] [^4^]. These emotional responses are mediated by brain regions such as the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala and the cerebellum, which are part of the reward system and the limbic system[^1^] [^2^].\n\nThe impact of music on mental health and well-being can be positive or negative, depending on how music is used and what effects it has on the listener[^4^]. Music can have beneficial effects such as reducing stress, enhancing mood, improving cognitive performance, increasing creativity, promoting social bonding and facilitating self-expression[^4^]. Music can also have detrimental effects such as inducing anxiety, depression, aggression, addiction or hearing loss[^4^]. The impact of music on mental health and well-being may depend on factors such as the type of music, the volume of music, the duration of exposure, the listener's personality, mood, expectations and goals[^4^].\n\nIn summary, music can affect our brain activity and emotional responses in complex and diverse ways. The impact of music on mental health and well-being can be positive or negative depending on how we use it and what we experience from it. Music is a powerful tool that can influence our thoughts, feelings and behaviors.",

              "Since the ancient Greeks, it has been known that the physical properties of sounds, such as the \u2018roughness\u2019 of chords, are uniquely determined by the integer relationships between the fundamental frequencies of these notes, leading to a differentiation in Western harmony between consonant and dissonant intervals and chords.",
              "The smaller this integer relationship is, the more likely the notes are to be misperceived as one single sound, and this trend has been observed also in musically distant cultures58.",
              "This is tied to the experience of sound roughness59, which is thought to be related to the bandwidths of critical auditory bands linked to the inability of the basilar membrane in the cochlea to separate notes that are very close in pitch60,61.",

              "Even though musical improvisation involves predictive brain processes246, there is an apparent paradox: although the primary purpose of the brain is to minimize prediction error, the primary purpose of improvisation is to create something new but aesthetically and emotionally appealing, which will then necessarily create prediction error.",
              "The improviser\u2019s difficult task is therefore to balance novelty and predictability in a way that generates pleasure responses in listeners7 or stimulates their cognitive curiosity, in the same way that the dance music producer tries to hit the sweet spot of groove.",
              "Because of the array of skills that are necessary to improvise at a high level, jazz musicians have been shown to outperform other types of musicians in domain-specific tasks such as ear training task performance and in quantitative brain measurements with regard to melodic expectancy violation12.",
              "This is coupled with findings from resting-state fMRI that show that improvising musicians exhibit more distributed, globally connected cortical networks than classical musicians, who instead show higher within-network connectivity than the former247, and morphometric findings of structural differences between these different groups of musicians248,249.",
              "In a recent study, the amplitudes of event-related potentials in response to chords that varied in expectancy were significantly correlated with behavioural measures of fluency and originality on a divergent thinking task, indicating a putative transfer effect of music skills to more domain-general processes250.",

              "Some of these studies controlled only for the familiarity of the stimuli, while others relied on pleasantness ratings, and others still on musical preferences.",
              "With a listening test and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, we wished to clarify the role of familiarity in the brain correlates of music appreciation by controlling, in the same study, for both familiarity and musical preferences.",
              "First, we conducted a listening test, in which participants rated the familiarity and liking of song excerpts from the pop/rock repertoire, allowing us to select a personalized set of stimuli per subject.",
              "Then, we used a passive listening paradigm in fMRI to study music appreciation in a naturalistic condition with increased ecological value.",
              "Brain activation data revealed that broad emotion-related limbic and paralimbic regions as well as the reward circuitry were significantly more active for familiar relative to unfamiliar music.",
              "Smaller regions in the cingulate cortex and frontal lobe, including the motor cortex and Broca's area, were found to be more active in response to liked music when compared to disliked one.",
              "Hence, familiarity seems to be a crucial factor in making the listeners emotionally engaged with music, as revealed by fMRI data.",
              "Listening to music is one of the most pleasurable human experiences, and one in which we invest a considerable amount of time and money.",
              "In a survey study [1], most subjects stated that their investment in this activity derives from the ability of music to convey emotions.",
              "For this reason, a better knowledge of how and why emotions are generated when listening to music will contribute to our understanding of why music is so important to our species.",
              "With the present study, we investigated whether familiarity and aesthetic preferences in music have a role in determining the emotional involvement of the listener, and which of the two factors contributes the most to the recruitment of the limbic and reward centres of the brain.",
              "We aimed to do this by separating and individually analysing the role of these two factors in the enjoyment of music, therefore clarifying some of the questions raised by previous studies, in which one or both of these factors were not satisfactorily controlled.",
              "Most studies investigating the psychological and neural basis for the impact of music on our emotions have focused on perception, induction, and recognition of basic emotions, such as happiness and sadness.",
              "For instance, converging evidence shows that acoustic features such as melody and tempo are relevant in determining the happy and sad emotional connotations of music (see, for example, [2], [3]).",
              "Happy music is usually characterized by fast tempo and major mode, while sadness in music is expressed by slow tempo and minor mode [2], [4], [5].",
              "It has been proposed that basic emotions are the immediate affective responses to music, likely mainly originating from the brainstem, which derive from the association or mimicking of acoustic cues present in the music with those residing in emotional (human or animal) vocalizations [6]-[9].",
              "A slower emotional response is musical enjoyment, which refers to an aesthetic emotion originating from the appraisal of the acoustic and formal properties of the music.",
              "Enjoyment is strongly modulated by individual factors, such as familiarity with the music, personality, current mood, and taste [8], [9].",
              "The aesthetic emotion of enjoyment leads to conscious judgements of liking, i.",
              "e., the positive or negative judgement about a musical piece, and hence, the degree of enjoyment can be measured by liking ratings.",
              "In some rare occasions in which musical enjoyment is particularly strong and intense, physiological responses, namely frissons (including chills and goose bumps;",
              "for a review, see [10]), also occur.",
              "Frissons can be measured with the polygraph.",
              "Those body changes, however, cannot be considered as the sole measure of musical enjoyment as they are triggered in only a small percentage of subjects (mainly musicians), typically with familiar music and in correspondence of abrupt harmonic or timbral variations, hence not just when listening to any favourite musical piece [10], [11].",
              "Capitalizing on the established theoretical model of basic emotions developed in the visual domain [12], perception, recognition and induction of basic emotions in music have been repeatedly studied, e.",
              "g., with questionnaires [13], by testing brain-lesioned patients [5], by recording autonomic nervous system reactions [14], [15], and by measuring central nervous system responses [16], [17].",
              "In contrast, very little is known about music enjoyment, and the research regarding pleasurable feelings derived from music has been largely confined to studying neural and physiological correlates of chills, and contrasts between consonant and dissonant wrongly-sounding music [18]-[21].",
              "Music-induced chills and consonant music activated brain areas known to be involved in reward and positive emotions, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the orbitofrontal cortex, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex [18], [21].",
              "In turn, the subjective decision of consciously liking a piece of music, and the related joyful, pleasurable feelings associated with it, have only started to be explored by our group (for a review, cf.",
              "[22]), also prompted by the powerful effects of exposure to favourite pop/rock songs on cognitive recovery and mood improvement after middle cerebral artery stroke [23].",
              "For instance, brain regions previously associated with affective processing and evaluative judgements, such as the insula, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, were associated with conscious liking of music, whereas recognition of happy or sad emotional connotations in music activated mainly auditory regions and the insula (Brattico et al.",
              ", in preparation).",
              "An important individual factor determining the variation of musical enjoyment and liking, as well as the occurrence of frissons in response to music, is familiarity: becoming more familiar with a particular piece of music increases the subject's liking ratings for it [5], [24], [25].",
              "This phenomenon, known in the literature as the mere exposure effect, suggests that familiarity might play an important role in the emotional engagement of listeners with the music.",
              "The neural mechanisms governing this mere exposure effect are, however, still unrevealed.",
              "Furthermore, several imaging experiments looking for brain activations to familiar/unfamiliar music have been performed, but the use of different techniques, stimuli and tasks have yielded somewhat different results.",
              "Using positron emission tomography (PET), Satoh and collaborators [26] reported activations in the anterior portion of bilateral temporal lobes, posterior portion of superior temporal gyri, anterior and posterior portion of medial frontal lobes, bilateral cingulate gyri, left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and middle portion of the left superior temporal gyrus (STG).",
              "The described regions were obtained by subtracting a familiarity task (judging whether melodies were familiar or not) and an alteration-detection task (detecting altered notes), in a set of melodies played with a synthesizer.",
              "In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study [27], the neural basis of familiarity was analysed using classical music excerpts and odours, showing activations for familiar over unfamiliar music in left frontal regions, namely in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and precentral gyrus (pCG), and also in the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) and parietal regions, such as the posterior part of the left cingulate gyrus, the right angular gyrus (AG) and the left supramarginal gyrus.",
              "Additionally, the authors described a vast network of overlapping left hemisphere activations for familiar over unfamiliar music and odours, including the SFG, IFG, AG, precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus, suggesting that there might be a multimodal neural system for the feeling of familiarity, which is independent of the sensory modality.",
              "Another recent fMRI study [28] showed that familiar monophonic melodies over acoustically balanced unfamiliar melodies (consisting in the reversed versions of the familiar ones) activated bilateral STS with a bias to the right, and that familiar music over random tones recruited the right supplementary motor area (SMA), the planum temporale and the IFG.",
              "Interestingly, in both these contrasts, the authors observed sub-threshold activations in the ventral striatum and precuneus.",
              "The ventral striatum activation is of particular interest to our study since it includes the NAc, which receives projections from the dopaminergic neurons of the VTA and is therefore a central structure of the reward/pleasure system (cf.",
              "[29]).",
              "Although below threshold, this activation is consistent with our hypothesis that familiarity is an important factor for the emotional engagement and/or induction of pleasurable feelings in the listener.",
              "Music fruition is a highly subjective experience, which varies widely across individuals.",
              "While listening to music, we can be moved by the melody, or we may find ourselves focusing on a timbre of an instrument or combination of instruments, or else we can be emotionally engaged by abrupt changes in the harmony or rhythm.",
              "Hence, in order to mimic the naturalistic situation in which music appreciation occurs, we discarded the manipulation of a single music dimension, and rather used expressive music from the pop/rock music genre, as it is the most ubiquitous in Western world (and also very diffuse in non-Western populations;",
              "for a similar approach in neuroimaging research, see [30]).",
              "In addition, appreciation of pop/rock music does not require formal musical training, and it is consequently the most available and important instance of aesthetic enjoyment of music.",
              "In order to further enhance the experience of musical enjoyment and of familiarity with music, subjects performed a listening test prior to the fMRI measurements, from which a unique set of musical stimuli per participant was chosen.",
              "The naturalistic approach adopted here has been used before us by Janata [30].",
              "In that study, fMRI and pop/rock music that extended to subjects' childhood time to evoke autobiographical memories were used.",
              "The analyses of the parametric variation (the areas of activation for the independent effects) of familiarity, autobiographical salience and valence showed that the most widespread activations were observed for the familiarity regressor.",
              "These activations included the IFG, medial frontal gyrus (MFG), pre-SMA, medial prefrontal cortex, STG, AG, medial temporal gyrus (MTG), cerebellum, caudate nucleus and ventro-lateral thalamic nucleus.",
              "A series of cortical and subcortical activations correlated with the degree of experienced positive affect were also reported, namely in the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS), right STG, left ventral anterior cingulate cortex, left substantia nigra and left ventral lateral thalamic nucleus.",
              "That study [30], however, focused on testing if the medial prefrontal cortex has a role in the association of musical features with autobiographical memories and emotions, rather than studying the brain areas recruited by familiarity and liking of music.",
              "For instance, the ratings of valence and pleasantness do not allow to tackle the subjective liking of music, since they might be driven by acoustic features and sensory processing.",
              "Moreover, since the participants classified each song during the fMRI recordings, the number of stimuli obtained for each condition was different, and had, therefore, different statistical weights in the final model.",
              "In sum, with this study, we examined the role of familiarity and aesthetic preferences in music enjoyment and in the activation of limbic and reward centres in the brain, using commercially available pop/rock songs.",

              "Although it was not emphasized, the pieces of music used were highly familiar to the participants, since they were given the chance to choose the ones that consistently elicited intense pleasure and chills.",
              "In turn, Brown and collaborators [39] used unfamiliar though pleasurable music, and described activations in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, the hippocampus, anterior insula and also the nucleus accumbens.",

              "In our study, instead, no neural activity in the ventral striatum was obtained in response to liked music, even after using a more liberal statistical threshold without correction.",
              "One possible reason for the discrepancy with the results obtained between Browns' [39] and our study is that, although the exact time of the stimulus duration in their study is not specified, it was probably much more than the thirty seconds we used.",
              "Moreover, they had only two functional scans, each one with a different song (probably the entire song), allowing the subjects to have more time to get emotionally engaged with the unfamiliar song.",
              "It may then be hypothesized that a longer exposure to unfamiliar (and liked) music in our study would have generated stronger responses in the limbic system too.",
              "In a series of studies [40], [41], however, it was found that musical excerpts of 1 sec only were enough to allow the recognition of basic emotions of happiness and sadness in the participants, and that this effect is weakly influenced by musical expertise and excerpt duration.",
              "Another experiment [42] showed that the time that participants required to initiate an emotional judgement is shorter for familiar than for unfamiliar music, which may indicate that also the emotional involvement (i.",
              "e. the feeling of emotions, which is different from the identification of emotions) can be modulated by familiarity.",
              "Nevertheless, the time course of emotional responses during music listening has not been investigated in neuroimaging studies, and hence, should be the focus of future investigations.",
              "The two studies addressing the pleasurable feelings derived from music that we discussed so far have used PET, and it is possible that this technique lacks the resolution to accurately locate small structures like the nucleus accumbens.",
              "A more recent study [19] used fMRI and functional and effective connectivity to show that listening to music has a strong effect in mesolimbic structures of the reward circuitry like the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area, but also in the hypothalamus and the insula.",
              "Another very recent paper [29] clearly shows the release of dopamine in the mesolimbic reward system in correlation with intense pleasurable experiences elicited by music.",
              "Even more interesting, it shows that, in anticipation of these peak emotional responses, the caudate nucleus was more active, while during the experience of the peaks themselves, increased activity was found in the right nucleus accumbens.",
              "It happens that, in this study, the authors used music that was highly familiar to the participants, but did not satisfactorily control for the familiarity of the neutral musical stimuli, leaving open the possibility that this factor might have contributed to the described activations.",
              "Moreover, only 8 out of about 200 subjects showed a consistent peak emotional response to music and were thus selected for the study, making it difficult to generalize these results to the overall population.",
              "In our study, we also found increased BOLD response in the right nucleus accumbens, curiously with the local maxima in the same coordinates as in Salimpoor et al.",
              "[29], but only for familiar music.",
              "This means that, in previous studies where familiarity was not properly controlled, the activations of this brain structure might have been wrongly attributed to the sole feeling of liking, discarding the crucial role of familiarity.",
              "We also obtained, with familiar songs, strong bilateral activations in the amygdala and the subcallosal cingulate cortex.",
              "Both these regions have been previously correlated with the emotional responses to musical stimuli.",
              "Amygdala activations were associated with sad music [17], unpleasant music [18] and both familiar and unfamiliar music [43].",
              "The subcallosal part of the anterior cingulate cortex has also been shown to be active, especially with pleasant/consonant music (see [18], [21], [39]).",
              "Also the putamen showed bilateral increased activity for familiar music, which can be accounted for the motor synchronization to the rhythm of the pop/rock excerpts;",
              "the same function can also be attributed to the activations observed in the thalamus (for a review, see [44]).",
              "Similar to our results, Brown and collaborators [45] further showed the recruitment of the putamen, with emphasis on the right side, while subjects were watching dancers moving to a regular, metric rhythm.",
              "Of course, people can synchronize to rhythm and dance to unfamiliar music as well, but possibly the activation of the basal ganglia structures might indicate that familiarity with the musical stimulus is a prominent factor in engaging the listeners also motorically, besides emotionally.",
              "Another cluster of activation for familiar over unfamiliar music was located in the SMA.",
              "Our interpretation of these activations is that the participants might have silently sung the familiar tunes.",
              "This is consistent with the proposal by Halpern and Zatorre [46] and Halpern [47] that this particular region is activated during musical imagery, or the act of imaging music in our minds, something that is likely to happen when you know a song and can predict what comes next.",
              "Several behavioural studies (namely [5]) confirmed what has been previously described by Meyer [24], which is the positive effect of prior exposure on music liking, also called the mere exposure effect.",
              "These results were also reproduced in our listening test, where we observed that within the group of songs that fitted the aesthetic preferences of each participant, the ones that were familiar were the most highly rated in terms of liking (figure 2).",
              "Accordingly, the brain results showed that familiar songs, including those that were liked and those that were disliked, were efficient in activating the network of brain regions known to respond to emotional stimuli.",
              "Another experiment [25] reported an effect similar to the mere exposure effect, this time also considering the valence (happy and sad) of the musical stimuli and the quality of the listening method (focused or incidental).",
              "They found that the effects of exposure on liking are different for focused and incidental listening, namely that liking ratings were higher for happy songs, but only in the focused listening condition.",
              "They also observed that liking ratings increased linearly as a consequence of exposure, but only in the incidental listening condition.",
              "In the focused listening condition, liking ratings were represented by an inverted U in function of exposure, meaning that the repeated exposure initially increases the ratings of the songs, but it then tends to cause an \u201cover-familiarity\u201d effect, reflected in the decreasing of the ratings.",
              "These studies suggest that the mere repetition of melodies is sufficient to increase the affective responses to these melodies, at least in an initial stage.",
              "To our knowledge, we provide the first functional neuroanatomical evidence for a strong effect of familiarity in the way listeners' get emotional engaged with the music, at least within an experimental setting.",
              "Our results not only strengthen the body of evidence showing that music is very efficient in recruiting emotional centres of the brain, but also clearly provide evidence that familiarity with a particular piece of music is an extremely important factor for emotional engagement, and thus furnishes \u201cdirect access\u201d to these emotional centres of the brain.",
              "We would also expect that, besides familiarity, musical preferences would also be an important factor to determine the emotional involvement of listeners, but, in our study, the aesthetical preferences of the participants generated only focal activations in brain regions, including limbic ones.",
              "In particular, liked songs (compared with disliked ones) activated the supplementary motor cortex, the right anterior cingulate cortex and a network of frontal regions.",
              "The anterior cingulate has been implicated in aesthetic judgement processes by studies in the visual domain [48], [49].",
              "In Kawabata's paper [48], the anterior cingulate was recruited when the subjects viewed and judged beautiful stimuli (in contrast to neutral stimuli), which is consistent with the activation we found in this structure for liked, more than disliked, music.",
              "Also the inferior frontal gyrus, another region that we found to be active in this condition, was implicated in the aesthetic judgements of beauty with visual stimuli (see [50]).",
              "Furthermore, the activation on the frontal pole/frontal medial cortex is also consistent with studies of the neural basis of evaluative judgements, namely [51], [52].",
              "It seems likely, then, that although participants were instructed to just listen to the music and not to perform any active task, involuntary aesthetic judgements happened, and reflected subject's positive appreciation of the songs presented in this condition.",
              "Despite the fact that, in this experiment, we obtained only few activations in limbic regions and absence of activity in the reward system regions for liked music (more than disliked one), we know from our own private experiences that listening to a loved song is drastically different from listening to a disliked one.",
              "Nonetheless, when listening to only thirty second extracts of songs inside an MRI machine, the effect of the aesthetical preferences most likely gets diminished, and familiar songs have an advantage in emotionally engaging the listener.",
              "A more risky explanation for this result might be the assumption that one thing is our aesthetical taste, and another thing is what we are hardwired to like, which may be even difficult to admit in public for social reasons.",
              "In other words, subjects could have classified part of the songs based on their aesthetical construct and not on the \u201creal\u201d feelings elicited by the music.",
              "A recent study [53] showed that, in adolescents, song popularity had a significant effect on the participants' likeability ratings of the songs, showing that conscious knowledge of the song popularity may influence people to switch their choices towards the consensus.",
              "In that study [53] it was further suggested that such a switch might occur to minimize the anxiety generated by the mismatch between individual and group preferences.",
              "Such findings raise the question whether similar social constraints come into play every time an individual is asked to make an aesthetical judgement, including in the laboratory setting.",
              "In the opposite contrast, disliked songs versus liked ones, we obtained no evidence of brain activations related to affective or cognitive processing, since only auditory-cortex regions were active, namely the left planum polare and STG.",
              "These regions are known to be recruited for perceptual integration of sound features into auditory objects, timbral processing, and musical scale rule extraction [54]-[57].",
              "The regions found to be more active for unfamiliar songs rather than familiar ones included rolandic/parietal operculum areas, as well as occipital cortex areas.",
              "Plailly and collaborators [27] have previously reported two clusters in the vicinity of ours, namely the ones in the left postcentral gyrus and left parietal operculum, for unfamiliar minus familiar music.",
              "We think these activations may be related either with the attempt to recall the songs or to the detection of novelty, although the latter action has been described to activate more medial parietal and temporal lobe regions (see, for example, [58]).",
              "Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the activations for unfamiliar versus familiar songs were observed only after a more liberal threshold was applied, and that this overall pattern of activation is significantly more reduced than that of the opposite contrast.",
              "It is worth noting that our results are consistent with the role proposed by Rauschecker and Scott [59] for the dorsal stream of their dual stream model.",
              "A further development on the role of this dorsal auditory pathway was recently accomplished by Rauschecker [60].",
              "This model postulates that when incoming sounds match expectations based on previous learning, the premotor cortex and basal ganglia are recruited.",
              "Parietal cortex regions may have a special role in comparing the incoming sounds with those expectations and they most likely are activated when the expectations are not matched, what happens when the sounds are unfamiliar.",
              "In our data, we found activations of the supplementary motor cortex and putamen (basal ganglia) for familiar sounds and of parietal rolandic operculum for unfamiliar sounds, thus supporting the role of this dorsal stream for processing sensorimotor sound events and matching (or unmatching) them with learned ones.",
              "Finally, our results also show that it is possible to use complex acoustic stimuli in the form of commercially available music, and still find highly consistent activations across subjects, in contrast to the trend of using unexpressive, controlled stimuli, quite distant from the real music listened to in everyday life.",

              "Rather than focusing on the link to language \u2014 and clinical applications \u2014 we focus on the basic neuroscience of music processing in the brain and requisite prediction-based brain mechanisms. Finally, we consider generalizations of the PCM model to encompass musical interaction and communication in interpersonal relationships and hierarchical organization in groups.",

              "Theories of predictive processing offer explanations for how specialized brain networks can identify and recognize the causes of their sensory inputs, integrate information with other networks and adapt to new stimuli.",
              "Recently, active inference, an influential theory of predictive processing6, has proposed that perception, action and learning constitute a recursive Bayesian process by which the brain attempts to minimize the prediction error between sensory input and top-down predictions of that input (Box 1).",
              "For many years it has been clear that music can be fully understood only in the light of prediction7,8,9.",

              "Accordingly, the processes underlying music perception and action are coupled, such that perception minimizes prediction error by updating the predictions, while action reduces prediction error by generating predicted sensory signals.",
              "Emotion, attention and motivation act as Bayes optimal biases to contextualize prediction, thereby guiding behaviour, action and learning.",
              "The notion of the brain as a hierarchical prediction machine \u2014 in which sensory input is constantly held up against the brain\u2019s beliefs about the causes of this input \u2014 is consistent with music processing, which is not just passive and bottom-up but rests on top-down predictive processes, as demonstrated for melody, harmony and rhythm later herein.",
              "In the case of ambiguous musical stimuli, the listener may \u2014 depending on musical training \u2014 make the active decision to listen attentively to the same piece of music with different metres or tonalities (Fig.",
              "3).",
              "Hence, a Bayesian formulation of predictive coding applies naturally to processes that involve the inference of hidden or latent causes \u2014 such as metre and tonality \u2014 from the music.",

              "for example, here C major versus A minor.",
              "The melody is compatible with both C major and A minor, and an individual\u2019s perception of harmonic context relies on top-down processes that depend on prior experience, culture, competence, context, the current state, personal traits or an active decision to listen from a certain viewpoint (for example, major or minor).",
              "This may lead to quite different experiences of this melody, rendering the melody, for example, happy (major) or sad (minor).",
              "b | Similarly, a polyrhythm may equally well be heard from the point of view of a 3/4 or 4/4 metre as the metrical predictive model.",
              "The temporal predictions in these two cases will be very different, and the rhythm can thus be experienced as a waltz (3/4) or a march (4/4) even by the same individual.",
              "When one is listening to music, attentional selection of which prediction errors to resolve rests on predicting not just the content of sensory streams but also their predictability or precision.",
              "Put simply, prediction errors are useful only when things are predictable.",
              "The Bayesian belief updating inherent in the PCM model is literally precision engineered, in the sense that it rests on predictions of predictability.",
              "A crucial concept in predictive coding is the notion that prediction errors are weighted by their expected precision or predictability.",
              "In short, the brain has to select the prediction errors that drive Bayesian belief updating and the ensuing top-down predictions.",
              "This selection can be regarded as a kind of mental or covert action that equips standard predictive coding schemes with an enactive and attentional aspect.",
              "The requisite synaptic mechanisms are thought to depend on neuromodulatory synaptic gain control that underwrites sensory attention and attenuation.",
              "The importance of precision for predictive processing has been shown in studies of auditory perception, where the mismatch negativity (MMN) to an oddball is modulated by its predictability19.",
              "In music perception, the finding that the amplitude of the MMN \u2014 a preattentive marker of prediction error \u2014 is reduced (to rhythmic deviations and mistuned pitches) in less predictable contexts offers a clear example of so-called precision-weighted prediction errors20,21.",
              "These studies demonstrate the scope of the PCM model for explaining the fundamental aspects of music processing.",
              "Learning can be cast as minimizing precision-weighted (that is, predictable) prediction errors over time, via experience-dependent plasticity.",
              "This is equally true for implicit and explicit learning.",
              "An example of implicit learning is how melodic singing ability or tonality perception schema are learned during repeated exposure \u2014 as evinced by the early right anterior negativity (ERAN) responses, which are markers of harmonic expectation violation in non-musicians and musicians alike22,23.",
              "Learning to play an instrument involves implicit learning but introduces additional top-down effects on perception and action.",
              "Hence, explicit learning often implies altered processing of musical structure violations \u2014 compared with that in non-musicians \u2014 as reflected in enhanced ERAN or MMN responses that could be regarded as reporting precision-weighted prediction errors for melody, harmony and rhythm (see later).",
              "Importantly, experiments have shown that the brain architecture subserving precision-weighted prediction errors differs depending on which musical phenomenon \u2014 for example, melody, harmony or rhythm \u2014 is being studied.",
              "For example, a predictive coding-based analysis of the effective connectivity in a melodic oddball functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm revealed that mismatch responses are best explained by a fully connected bilateral auditory network comprising the primary auditory cortices and the planum temporale24.",
              "Here, the observed increase in excitatory connectivity from the left primary auditory cortex to the planum temporale has been interpreted as the passing of a precise prediction error from lower to higher areas of the hierarchical processing network25,26, and the observed decrease in inhibitory connectivity within the left primary auditory cortex has been viewed as a precision-related increase in the gain of the superficial pyramidal cells encoding prediction error27,28.",
              "By contrast, as discussed later, studies of the pleasurable experience of musical harmony have revealed predictive coding mechanisms including precision-weighted prediction errors29 related to emotion and reward brain networks29, whereas studies of musical groove have implicated additional motor-related areas.",
              "In the following sections, we review music perception, action, emotion and learning in the light of the PCM model.",
              "We begin by summarizing the significant progress in our understanding of music perception of melody, harmony and rhythm.",
              "Predictive processing (also known as active inference) is a general theory of neural processing inspired by research in artificial intelligence, statistical physics and systems neuroscience6,255,256.",
              "The basic idea can be traced from the students of Plato, through to Kant and Helmholtz257, and to theories of perception as hypothesis testing258.",
              "Enactive versions of predictive processing offer integrative accounts of action and perception259,260,261,262,263 by formalizing how specialized brain networks identify and categorize causes of sensory inputs, integrate information with other networks and actively sample new stimuli256.",
              "In brief, active inference proposes that perception, action and learning are Bayesian processes by which the brain attempts to minimize hierarchical prediction errors.",
              "The figure shows a schematic illustration of the computational architecture of neuronal message passing that underlies predictive coding in the brain.",
              "As predictive processing is a generic theory of brain function, the precise architecture will vary depending on the functional anatomy in question.",
              "Part a of the figure shows the basic motif of connections, via which prediction errors are formed by comparing bottom-up input with top-down predictions.",
              "Crucially, these predictions can be of either the input or the precision (that is, the predictability) of that input.",
              "These are designated first-order and second-order predictions, respectively.",
              "Part b of the figure describes the resulting hierarchical message passing implicit in predictive coding, in which forward or ascending connections convey prediction errors to higher levels, while backward or descending connections supply the predictions that enable the computation of prediction errors in the lower level.",
              "Black arrows indicate forward connections and grey arrows indicate backward connections.",
              "In this example, unpredicted auditory input is passed forward to the auditory cortex in the form of ascending prediction errors (for example, from the medial geniculate body).",
              "These prediction errors (black arrows) drive posterior expectations (for example, encoded by deep pyramidal neurons) that return descending predictions (grey arrows) to resolve \u2014 or explain away \u2014 lower-level prediction errors.",
              "At the same time, high-level expectations about the context generate predictions of precision (blue arrows) that modulate the gain of cells encoding prediction errors at the lower level (for example, superficial pyramidal cells).",
              "This enables high levels to select the prediction errors that convey the most precise or predictable information (compare with attentional selection).",
              "In short, there are two kinds of descending predictions in predictive coding: first-order prediction of content (grey arrows) and second-order predictions of context (blue arrows).",
              "Here, context is simply the precision or predictability of prediction errors.",
              "The resulting precision-weighted prediction errors therefore mediate the selection of certain lower-level features that are consistent with higher-level constructs.",
              "This allows the predictive coding of music model to explain figure-ground phenomena in music, such as selecting between different metrical interpretations of a 3 against 4 polyrhythm.",
              "In most musical styles, melody \u2014 that is, the patterns of pitched sounds unfolding over time \u2014 is an important part of what defines and distinguishes one piece from another.",
              "Sing the first eight notes with any rhythm and you will immediately identify Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony.",
              "When you press a key on a piano keyboard, the resulting note comprises a fundamental frequency defining its pitch30 and a series of overtones that contributes to its tone quality (timbre), which distinguishes it from other instruments31,32.",
              "A large corpus of research has been devoted to the study of musical pitch, and it is now widely accepted that the brain can extract a single pitch percept from complex tones, even in the absence of the fundamental33,34.",
              "Pitch perception can be separated into pitch height and pitch chroma.",
              "Two different piano notes may have different pitch heights but still be perceived as having the same chroma (for example, the note C in different octaves).",
              "The auditory cortices are central to pitch processing: fMRI suggests that pitch height is processed in the planum temporale posterior to the primary auditory cortex, whereas chroma change is processed in the planum polare, anterior to the primary auditory cortex35.",
              "In general, the recognition of pitch from spectrally complex sounds is thought to be handled by a ventral stream, projecting from primary auditory areas along middle and anterior regions to the inferior frontal gyrus (Fig.",
              "1d).",
              "A dorsal stream, projecting from primary areas via the planum temporale over the parietal cortex to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex36, is supposed to support sensory\u2013motor integration, articulation and memory functions37 and thereby link the neural apparatus for melody perception and action38.",
              "Once musical pitches are combined into melodies, global properties emerge, such as melodic contour39, melodic expectations and tonality40.",
              "Most melodies point to a certain tonality, even though 12-tone composers such as Arnold Schoenberg often try to avoid it.",
              "In its simplest form, a melody such as \u2018Fre\u0300re Jacques\u2019 is confined to a subset of pitches \u2014 a scale \u2014 with a tonal centre, such as a C-major scale, which corresponds to seven white keys on a piano keyboard and excludes the associated black keys.",
              "The tonality is not necessarily expressed directly in the auditory input to the ears5 but is an endogenously generated hierarchical predictive framework that underwrites the perception of melody and harmony (Fig.",
              "3).",
              "Listeners, even without explicit musical training, have implicit knowledge of the statistical regularities of melodies of their own culture.",
              "This knowledge41 is constantly applied to form musical expectations by comparing a given note to the given statistical distribution42,43.",
              "The tonality is an example of one predictive model, which underlies melodic expectations.",
              "Importantly, it is possible to model melodic expectation and uncertainty mathematically.",
              "Several models exist44,45, including the information dynamics of music model, which assigns measures of information content (contextual unexpectedness: see prediction error) and entropy (uncertainty) to each note of a scale using short-term and long-term statistical regularities46.",
              "Mathematical modelling has the advantage that it allows the study of perception of \u2018real\u2019 music and obviates the need for tailored musical excerpts, as traditionally used in many experiments.",
              "Recently, such models have been used to study the neural processing of melodic expectations47 in particular using the MMN response48,49 (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "Importantly, in unpredictable compared with predictable melodic contexts (as modelled by the information dynamics of music model21), the MMN amplitude is reduced, and behavioural deviant detection is impaired with regard to mistuned pitches.",

              "Since the ancient Greeks, it has been known that the physical properties of sounds, such as the \u2018roughness\u2019 of chords, are uniquely determined by the integer relationships between the fundamental frequencies of these notes, leading to a differentiation in Western harmony between consonant and dissonant intervals and chords.",
              "The smaller this integer relationship is, the more likely the notes are to be misperceived as one single sound, and this trend has been observed also in musically distant cultures58.",
              "This is tied to the experience of sound roughness59, which is thought to be related to the bandwidths of critical auditory bands linked to the inability of the basilar membrane in the cochlea to separate notes that are very close in pitch60,61.",
              "Importantly, however, roughness may be perceived differently according to musical style and culture62.",
              "Chord progressions establish musical expectations and typically a sense of tonality.",
              "Whereas tonality is known in music from all cultures studied63, neuroscientific studies have concentrated mainly on Western harmony40,64,65, which follows a specific set of rules, for example, in different types of harmonic cadences.",

              "5Department of Education, Psychology, Communication, University of Bari Aldo Moro, 70122 Bari, Italy The last decades have seen a proliferation of music and brain studies, with a major focus on plastic changes as the outcome of continuous and prolonged engagement with music.",
              "Thanks to the advent of neuroaesthetics, research on music cognition has broadened its scope by considering the multifarious phenomenon of listening in all its forms, including incidental listening up to the skillful attentive listening of experts, and all its possible effects.",
              "These latter range from objective and sensorial effects directly linked to the acoustic features of the music to the subjectively affective and even transformational effects for the listener.",
              "Of special importance is the finding that neural activity in the reward circuit of the brain is a key component of a conscious listening experience.",
              "We propose that the connection between music and the reward system makes music listening a gate towards not only hedonia but also eudaimonia, namely a life well lived, full of meaning that aims at realizing one\u2019s own \u201cdaimon\u201d or true nature.",
              "It is argued, further, that music listening, even when conceptualized in this aesthetic and eudaimonic framework, remains a learnable skill that changes the way brain structures respond to sounds and how they interact with each other.",
              "Music listening is an experience that has been operationalized by psychologists and neuroscientists in recent decades as mainly concerning the auditory system and cognitive and affective functions.",
              "Research has for the most part focused on the perceptual and cognitive consequences of listening, linking it with the phenomenon of neuroplasticity or neural changes deriving from adaptation to new environmental demands as in the case of sensory deprivation or repeated exercise (see [1,2,3] for an overview).",
              "Consequently, music and musicians have been identified as a promising model for neuroplasticity [4], as the result of intense repeated exercise focused on the improvement of domain-specific skills.",
              "These neuroplastic changes, however, are not limited to the yearlong physical acts of motor practice with an instrument, as in the case of professional musicians.",
              "Merely listening to music in the course of days, or even hours and minutes, can result in modifications of the functioning of the brain [1,2,3,5].",
              "In the context of the predictive coding theory of music, music listening is an active process of prediction and updating those predictions, which occurs at any exposure to new sounds over all temporal courses, from seconds up to an entire life [6,7].",
              "This never-ending process is well exemplified by the famous cellist Pablo Casals who, when asked why he continued to practice at age 90, replied \u201cBecause I think I\u2019m making progress\u201d.",
              "Listening to music, by definition, refers to the sensorial act of processing acoustic features by the auditory system.",
              "Hence, a description in terms of the objective acoustic characteristics may help to tackle some of the elusive aspects of possible causal relationships between music and its effects by describing at least the stimulus side of the music processing chain (input).",
              "Using neural correlates of stimulus processing could do the same for measuring also objectively the responses of each individual listener (output).",
              "For this, psychoacoustic research and computational developments are essential.",
              "Music listening, though, does not restrict itself to the sensorial act of processing objective features of sounds that act as triggers for passive recipients.",
              "It may be described also as an aesthetic experience, which, when referring specifically to music listening, is defined by Brattico & Pearce as \u201c[an experience] in which the individual immerses herself in the music, dedicating her attention to perceptual, cognitive, and affective interpretation based on the formal properties of the perceptual experience\u201d [8] (p.",
              "49).",
              "Following this view, listening can be conceived as a sequence of \u201cstates\u201d induced by active engagement with the music and by processes which can be labeled as \u201ccoping\u201c with the sounds [9,10].",
              "Such definition of a musical aesthetic experience is strongly founded on empirical research but it is also in line with previous philosophical/phenomenological accounts aiming to describe the nature of the human relation to art in general as a subjective experience.",
              "Ingarden pointed to the role of the subject-driven experience, as a teleological experience to be instantiated in the concept of an encounter between the artist/performer and observer, holding a dynamic tension between the artwork as an ultimate, finished and fixed source (Ergon) and the experience as an individual process of apprehending and knowing (Energeia) [11,12] (see also [13]).",
              "Dewey, on the other hand, revoked the idea of the aesthetic experience as a question of mere knowledge and moved gradually in the direction of humans craving meaning in the sense of lived, embodied experiences with full involvement with the world.",
              "An experience, for Dewey, is a synonym for consummatory experience with the felt underlying quality of emotionally pervading the whole and giving it a sense of closure or resolution [14,15].",
              "Mead stated that aesthetic experiences enhance the power to catch the enjoyment of the actual consummation of that experience;",
              "they are the basis for the development of self-consciousness through subjective sensations, emotions, and imagination, and are even necessary for understanding social life [16].",
              "Dufrenne, one of the most distinguished researchers on the relationship among art, aesthetics, and phenomenology, presented three distinct categories of aesthetic perception\u2014presence, representation and feeling\u2014, thus providing a vast description of the essential aspects of the aesthetic experience with the aim to understand them also within the totality of the human experience [17,18].",
              "Besides these philosophical definitions of the aesthetic experience, more operational definitions conceived in relation to visual art and stemming directly from empirical research were proposed by Markovic\u0301, Pelowski, and Leder: according to them, the aesthetic experience brings together the biological basis of aesthetic preference and attraction and the neuroscientific study of awareness and special states of consciousness [19,20,21].",
              "In line with this, our approach focused on the musical aesthetic experience identifies three major outcomes of aesthetic music listening: the experience of aesthetic emotions, such as, e.",
              "g., enjoyment, chills, nostalgia, awe, and being moved;",
              "aesthetic judgments as in the conscious evaluation of the beauty of the music, based on its formal properties;",
              "and a verdict of liking or preference, involving both the conscious liking/disliking of the music [8].",
              "Intermediary processes between input and output, further, can substantially bias and modulate the final aesthetic responses to sounds.",
              "Among those, personality factors may have a critical role in eliciting emotional and physiological reactions, such as the propensity to experience aesthetic chills and thrills [22], though it can be questioned to which extent these personality characteristics act as dispositional traits that function as causal factors for the elicitation of a typical response.",
              "All these processes and modulating factors, finally, constitute a genuine aesthetic listening situation [23,24,25].",
              "In sum, new research within the neuroaesthetic framework, besides focusing on perceptual and cognitive aspects of music listening in relation to prolonged sound exposure and practice in musicians, reaches out to capture the vast complexity of the music listening phenomenon.",
              "Here, we aim to provide a narrative overview of the recent research on music listening, with an effort to provide the latest organized and systematically structured knowledge on music listening as an aesthetic experience.",
              "For doing so, we will answer the following questions: (1) how does listening produce effects that go beyond the auditory system?",
              "(2) what is the relation between the style of music, its life-long exposure time, and the resultant effects on brain activity?",
              "(3) what is the role of the individual differences between listeners with their personality traits and individual listening history?",
              "and, (4) can modes of listening and strategies be reduced to their corresponding neural correlates?",
              "Our final goal is to determine whether musical styles and listening modes have an effect, both in the real-time situation of actual listening and by considering the lasting effects on the brain, and on allostatic loads and homeostatic regulation (see below for definitions of the terms).",

First, an association between electrophysiological brain oscillations at narrow frequency bands and the time course of acoustic features has been identified and replicated.",

              "Yet, it remains tempting to conceive of music listening in terms of the axiom of psychobiological equivalence, which addresses the central question of whether there is some lawfulness in the coordination between sounding stimuli and the response of music listeners in general [71].",
              "It invites us to argue for an operational approach, which contains three elements: an objective description of the acoustic features of the music and their possible role as elicitors, a description of the possible modulating factors\u2014both external/exogenous and internal/endogenous ones\u2014, and a continuous and real-time description of the responses by the listener, both in terms of their psychological reactions and their physiological correlates.",

              "It consists of two distinctive elements, coined as the affective and cognitive element, which can trigger emotional reactions, which are evoked by observed emotions of others (affective empathy) or entail a cognitive recognition or understanding without necessarily experiencing them (cognitive empathy) [76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83].",
              "As to the ontogenetic development, accumulating exposure to sounds is the first factor at play: listeners who can draw on a lifetime\u2019s experience can make sense of music in ways that children or teenagers cannot.",
              "There is, in this regard, the importance of each individual learning history, which may be driven by internal or external forces such as innate curiosity, the tendency to invest in exploratory behavior, and the urge to master (intrinsic motivation) or to comply with the demands of parents and/or educational institutions (external motivation).",
              "The cumulative effect of these forces may result in levels of sophistication that outreach those of simple natural maturation.",
              "Directly in relation to the individual lifetime experience with sounds, one way of listening is what could be termed skillful, namely the listening skills acquired by exposure towards achieving expertise.",
              "While motor advances in \u201cskill acquisition\u201d of professional musicians, who learn fine motoric abilities specific to their instrument, are obvious in executive expert behavior, as in virtuoso performing, advances of experts are less obvious in internalized forms of behavior, such as listening to music.",
              "Musicians, though, are better at psychoacoustic processing.",
              "They show better pitch acuity than nonmusicians, and a better capacity to understand speech in a noisy environment or to extract the prosody contour of speech [84].",
              "In terms of brain mechanisms that underlie skillful listening in music experts, meta-analyses demonstrate an enlarged volume of the gray matter for primary and non-primary auditory regions in the temporal lobes [85].",
              "Neurophysiological measures also demonstrate the faster and stronger synchronization of neuronal assemblies when responding to sounds and to errors of sounds in musicians as opposed to nonmusicians.",
              "Related to such skillful listening is cognitive mastering, a crucial stage of information processing that leads to the aesthetic outcomes of judgments and emotions as the outcome of knowledge and understanding [86,87].",
              "Professional musicians, e.",
              "g., have access to different cognitive strategies and auxiliary representations of music in comparison with musical laymen.",
              "They show auxiliary mental representations of music as the result of training and practice and use larger and more complex neuronal networks than non-professionals with, among others, left hemisphere activation, attributed to the recruitment of inner speech by naming pitches and harmonies more or less automatically while listening.",
              "This points in the direction of brain substrates of music processing that are the outcome of ways of listening rather than being amenable to fixed music centers [88].",
              "A further step of the journey into the music listening experience occurs with an intensification of the engagement with the sounds.",
              "It is somewhat related to the transition from mere hedonic pleasure to eudaimonic experience, with a shift from mere reactivity to auditory stimuli to a full-fledged aesthetic listening experience.",

              "Neuroimaging studies confirm the qualitative nature of the differences between incidental or even skillful listening and aesthetic listening, with a gradually enhanced functional connectivity between important perceptual-cognitive, attentional and reward networks of the brain and more in particular between mesolimbic and orbitofrontal reward circuits, the auditory cortex and the prefrontal cortex ([1,2], for a review of findings also related to the aesthetic experience of figurative arts, see [92]).",
              "The concept of reward, however, can take on different forms, as aesthetic rewards are highly abstract in nature.",
              "They are mostly culture-dependent and involve cognitive components with a critical role for learning and social influences, thus recruiting higher-order and more complex regions of the evolved brain [93,94].",

              "Positive affect, in particular, has consequences for the expansion of cognitive and emotional resources, which are not merely subjectively felt, but which can be measured also by objective means [95].",
              "As such, it is possible to conceive of music in terms of biologically rewarding stimuli and to link music listening with the findings from stress research\u2014both its positive/rewarding and negative/aversive aspects\u2014, and its connections between life experience, emotion, and health outcomes.",
              "On the positive side, there is, first and foremost, the empowering impact of music\u2014both in the short and long term\u2014, besides its curative and protective effect.",

              "While the power of music to elicit emotional reactions and regulate the subjective emotional state is widely acknowledged, this power is highly variable across individuals with their distinct dispositional traits.",
              "For instance, in one of our previous studies [97], listening to a relaxing music track (vs. a control noise track balanced in amplitude modulations with the music) was more effective in individuals with higher scores in anxiety trait and lower scores in emotional control trait from the Big Five personality model.",
              "Several attempts have been made to link aesthetic chills to another Big Five personality trait, namely \u201copenness to experience\u201d\u2014broadly characterized as comfort with novelty and motivation for cognitive exploration\u2014[50] or to the reinstatement of social contact after separation or loss, in the case of cold chills\u2014as a kind of thermoregulatory underpinning of social motivation [22,98].",
              "In general, it has been found that a distinction can be made among listeners between chill responders and non-responders [99].",
              "Chill responders seem to show a preference for less intensive stimuli, they like approval and positive emotional input from their environment rather than seeking thrill and adventure, and they listen to music mostly alone and separated from their surroundings rather than in social settings [46].",
              "The neural basis of these individual differences between emotional and non-emotional responders, however, is not yet totally understood [5].",
              "Even if it has been postulated that warm and cold chills are pursued and sought after by specific populations [46].",
              "The whole discussion, however, can be better contextualized within the corresponding distinction between two kinds of listeners which can be classified as empathizers vs. systematizers, with the former focusing on the affective aspects of the music by identifying emotions and responding emotionally, and the latter tending to find structures and organization behind the music such as formal structures, regularities, patterns and rule systems [53,100].",
              "Besides traits that should predispose to specific ways of listening, there seems to be also a modulation of perceptual and affective responses to music by psychological states, as exemplified in specific listening modes.",

              "Non-evaluative listening increased connectivity in the auditory-limbic brain network.",
              "In turn, the evaluative judgment strengthened intercommunication only between areas related to auditory processing and action observation, and between higher-order structures involved with visual processing.",

              "In contrast, dorsomedial prefrontal, and occipital areas, previously associated with emotion recognition and cognitive processing of music, were active during a listening mode focused on explicitly judging the musical emotions expressed in the clips.",
              "In conclusion, evidence shows that aesthetic music listening, contrasted with incidental or even skillful listening, is characterized by attentional focus, namely the act of paying attention to the music with the aim to reach an evaluation [104].",
              "This attentive internal state allows for the first initial fast reactions to sounds to become available for conscious appraisal and evaluation [25,70].",

              "Though it is possible to conceptually distinguish both perspectives, they are quite intertwined with the neurological level being the ultimate explaining mechanism for the generation of the aesthetic emotion of enjoyment.",
              "This is clear from recent studies within the emerging field of neuroaesthetics and neuroaesthetics of music, which try to understand the neural modulating factors that underlie aesthetic experiences in general and positive emotional responses to the music [8,58,92,105,106,107,108,109,110].",

              "Several topics, however, are still under discussion, such as the role of neurotransmitters as dopamine in the occurrence of arousal peaks, the relation between pleasure and aesthetic reactions, the claim that all aesthetic-related reactions can be ultimately reduced to biological origins [111] and the distinction between aesthetic pleasure as a core pleasure evoked in subcortical brain processes as against conscious liking that involves also evaluating judgments which originate in higher-order cortical structures [25].",
              "Much is to be expected here from a naturalistic approach to musical sense-making and a conception of listening in terms of \u201ccoping\u201d with the sounds [10,112] with the aim to explore how an ordinary sensory experience can be transformed into an aesthetic experience.",
              "Two components of core affect seem to be involved in this transition, namely arousal and valence, both of which are triggered by the visceral and peripheral sensory systems. They can be defined as mental representations of bodily changes that can be valued as hedonic pleasure or displeasure with some degree of arousal [87,113] by considering the empowering impact of music, its role in arousal enhancement, and its function in stress regulation and reduction, either in a positive or negative sense.",
              "Neuroscience has provided major insights into the positive effects of aesthetic music listening by focusing on the localization and connectivity of so-called hedonic hotspots in cortical and subcortical regions of the brain, and by examining the role of neurotransmitters in the modulation of the physical and physiological responses to the music.",

              "The subcortical hedonic hotspots are responsible for the simple and spontaneous core liking reactions to pleasurable stimuli, whereas the involvement of cortical prefrontal structures is needed for the conscious feelings of wanting or incentive salience during the appetitive phase [95,116], this network shows an interplay between more evolved neocortical areas and evolutionary older areas of the brain.",

              "These older levels are important, however, in the sense that a distinction has been proposed between fast and slow routes of affective evaluative processes: the fast route is a primary route to the positive or negative appraisal or evaluation of stimuli, relying on quick and automatic brain responses, mostly below the level of consciousness and originating mainly in the brainstem, the primary sensory cortices, and the limbic system;",
              "the slow route, on the contrary, involves the evolutionary more evolved structures of the brain, such as the prefrontal cortex with outcomes such as the conscious liking or appraisal of a piece of art or music [118,119,120].",

              "Studies with ligand-based position emission tomography\u2014using radioligand raclopride that binds with dopamine\u2014have shown that strong emotional responses to music lead to dopamine release in the mesolimbic striatal system together with sensory regions for auditory reception while listening to highly pleasurable music [93,94].",
              "Some findings have been even more ground-breaking, with an unforeseen functional dissociation between the \u201canticipatory phase\u201d of peak emotional experiences with dopaminergic activity in the caudate nucleus, and the \u201cconsummatory phase\u201d of the actual experience with activity in the nucleus accumbens.",
              "This dopamine release, immediately before the climax of emotional experiences, in the caudate, is of considerable importance, as this region is highly interconnected with limbic regions such as the amygdalae, hippocampus, cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which all mediate emotional responses.",
              "The findings point also to the direction of two distinct anatomical pathways that play different but complementary roles in the emotional experience of music, mapping somewhat onto the \u201cwanting\u201d and \u201cliking\u201d dimension of music appreciation ([121], see also [92]).",
              "Care should be taken, however, not yet to generalize too much about the role of dopamine release.",
              "Even if it underlies both the appetitive and consummatory phases of reward, the peak of the pleasure experience and the hedonic properties or subjective pleasure that is associated with obtaining a reward may depend on the release of other neurotransmitters such as endogenous opioid peptide releases in the hedonic hotspots in the nucleus accumbens, which is a region that is implicated also in the euphoric components of psychostimulants such as, e.",

              "This could challenge the common view that dopamine is causally related to music-evoked pleasure through the engagement of the hedonic hotspots in favor of a milder claim that it should arise from motivational signals and cognitive appraisal so as to increase the attractiveness of the surrounding environment and to strengthen the efficacy of rewarding stimuli [125].",
              "As such, it should intervene in the processing of diverse types of pleasures, as is the case in aesthetic experiences [65,115].",
              "Somewhat generalizing, it can thus be stated that listening to pleasurable music is associated with activation of the NAcc and its interactions with brain structures that regulate autonomic, emotional, and cognitive functions.",
              "There is, as such, a strong link between emotional and cognitive systems which link the orbitofrontal cortex with mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic circuitry (NAcc and VTA) [65].",
              "Music, as a candidate elicitor, does not always contribute to pleasure.",
              "As a vibrational phenomenon, it may put stress on the body and the brain, it can have a role in maintaining, restoring, or even disrupting the homeostatic balance, and can, in the worst case, even become a source of allostatic load.",
              "It makes sense, therefore, to conceive of music listening in terms of \u201ccoping behavior\u201d (see above) with a major distinction between adaptive and maladaptive ways of listening [10,126].",
              "The concept of adaptation, first, is very useful.",
              "According to Selye\u2014a pioneer in the study of stress\u2014, life is a process of adaptation to the circumstances in which we exist, and health and happiness depend on the successful adjustments to the ever-changing conditions of this environmental surrounding world [127,128].",
              "Healthy functioning, in this view, requires ongoing adjustments and alternations of the internal physiological milieu through physiological systems that exhibit fluctuating levels of activity to respond and adapt to the solicitations of the environment [129].",
              "Stress research, however, has traditionally focused on failures in this process, emphasizing the role of allostatic load, which, in its etymological sense, means \u201cstability through change\u201d, thus emphasizing the constant dynamism of our internal physiology [130].",
              "It can be defined as the cumulative wear and tear of the strain of physiological effects of multiple forms of adversity on several organs and tissues, due to the overactive or inefficient management of the stress responses.",
              "Allostasis, then, reflects the consequences for risk of pathology, such as organ system breakdown, compromised immune response, cardiovascular dysfunction and disease, elevated cortisol and insulin secretion, accumulation of abdominal fat, loss of bone minerals, reproductive impairments, decreased neurogenesis, increased neuronal cell death and associated atrophy in the limbic system ([131], see also [132]).",
              "Two major kinds of allostatic load have been identified thus far: \u201cphysiological reactivity\u201d, as in the case of acute shifts and elevations in physiological activity in response to threatening stimuli, and \u201cchronic elevations\u201d beyond the basal operating ranges, operating mainly in the absence of challenging stimuli.",
              "Conditions as hypertension and diabetes are typical examples.",
              "The picture, however, is not exclusively negative as it is also possible to conceive of optimal allostasis.",
              "It is a challenging approach that has marked a kind of paradigm shift in stress research by focusing not exclusively on failures in the adaptation process [129].",
              "An operational approach to such optimal allostasis, therefore, should include not only the maintenance of load indicators in normal operating ranges but also the measurement of selected brain opioids such as \u03b2-Endorphins and leucine and methionine enkephalins, which have powerful effects in counteracting negative emotions and favoring positive ones [133,134].",
              "The release of dopamine from the catecholamine systems, the central nervous system opioid peptides, and oxytocin are also of particular importance in this regard (see [129] for an overview).",
              "The effects of allostatic load, further, are reflected in biological stress responses, such as the neuroendocrine, autonomic, and immune system responses, which put high strains on the mobilization from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [65], with a corresponding cascade of hormone secretions, going from the hypothalamic-driven release of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), to the pituitary-driven release of corticotropin to the adrenal-driven release of cortisol [129,135].",
              "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system by stress-inducing stimuli, further, results in the release of catecholamines such as norepinephrine and epinephrine, driven by the medulla of the adrenal gland.",
              "The immune function, finally, can be compromised by the workings of these hormones and transmitters.",
              "The above-described neurotransmitter-mediated neural activity within the reward pathways, on the other hand, regulates emotions and mood through changes in autonomic and physiological responses during music listening.",
              "This often leads to a relaxed smoothened state through psychological processes of decentering and non-attachment, so as to decouple the \u201csensory\u201d and \u201caffective\u201d components of stressors with a resulting reduction of the sympathetic tone and suppression of mobilization by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",
              "The aim of such decentering is to decrease stress responses to innocuous cues and to foster a rapid return to physiological and emotional baseline situations in response to real threats.",
              "Such reductions should then be visible across physiological mediators such as the adrenomedullary catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), adrenocortical glucocorticoids (cortisol), pituitary hormones (ACTH, prolactin, and growth hormones), and cytokines from cells of the immune system (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) [136].",
              "Hence, music can have a mediating role in the interactions between these physiological organ systems with a possible regulation of systemic stress hormone levels.",
              "Two markers of the HPA axis\u2014\u00df-endorphin and cortisol\u2014, have been found to decrease as the result of engaging with music, but not all findings point in the direction of lowering levels of activation.",
              "Stimulating music, e.",
              "g., can induce increased levels of plasma cortisol, ACTH, prolactin, growth hormone, and norepinephrine [65].",
              "Generalizing a little, it can be stated that music can regulate stress, arousal, and emotions by initiating reflexive brainstem-mediated responses, which include heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, and muscle tension [137].",
              "A distinction should be made, however, between those levels of stress that are perceived as harmful or annoying and those that are experienced as being beneficial for better coping behavior.",
              "It is a conception that is related to the psychobiological model of arousal, which states that enjoyment is optimal at intermediate arousal levels.",
              "Applied to music, this means that it makes sense to attune ourselves to sound environments and sonic landscapes, including music, that provides stimulation in the optimal arousal zone [10,138,139], allowing us to cultivate positive adaptive reactions to beneficial stressors as well as to avoid possible distress triggered by harmful stimuli.",
              "It brings us to Selye\u2019s concept of eustress, which he contrasted with distress, as the syndrome that is triggered by unspecific harmful stimuli or activities [127,128,140].",
              "Eustress represents the pleasant stress of fulfillment, including both the properties of the stressor, considered to be beneficial in that case, the effort that is valued in terms of positive valence, and the effects that guarantee no damaging outcomes.",
              "Stressors, then, can be considered beneficial when they do not exceed the capacity for the maintenance or restoration of homeostasis [141].",
              "Both negative-aversive and positive-rewarding stress, however, is associated with increased activation of the HPA axis.",
              "It means, finally, that aesthetic engagement with music reveals a unique neural architecture that connects physiological responses typical of stress to the combination of positive and negative affect, which leads ultimately to an expansion of our cognitive-emotional states.",
              "This is exemplified most typically in the experience of awe and aesthetic chills, which are characterized by vastness and the need for accommodation [142,143].",
              "In this paper, we have focused on how certain individual, cultural, and acoustic factors affect music listening with a special focus on their neurobiological underpinnings, somewhat in line with a very recent meta-analysis on music listening and imagery (see Figure 3), which conceives of music mainly as a sensorimotor and cognitive process, but leaving out most of the affective and even more the aesthetic aspects of the experience, such as judgment and eudaimonia [117].",
              "Starting from recent developments for the acoustic description of music and ways of listening, we have elaborated on the possible effects of music, which may be modulated or even biased considerably by the personality and learning history of each individual listener.",
              "By stressing the role of ontogenetic development, we have pointed out the malleability and learnability of listening as a skill.",
              "A distinction should be made, however, between skillful listening, as exemplified in expert listeners with formal musical training, and aesthetic listening, which adds some additional level of musical engagement to this level of sophistication.",
              "As such, the musical-aesthetic experience is considered a privileged and target example of musical engagement, in the sense that it combines empathic/emotional listening with aesthetic valuing and high-level cognitive processing.",
              "In neurological terms, this combines both cortical and subcortical processing of the musical stimuli with major connections between three regions, namely the auditory cortex, the prefrontal cortex involved in moral judgment, and the limbic and paralimbic regions of the emotional brain.",
              "It has been argued, moreover, that continuous and ongoing engagement with music with an aesthetic attitude can induce neuroplastic changes, both in the short and long term, with structural and functional modification of the brain as a possible outcome.",
              "The picture that emerges, finally, is a new approach to music listening that ties together arguments from distinct disciplines, but which all converge in the direction of a comprehensive aesthetic approach that maneuvers elegantly between biological and cultural perspectives (see also [19,20,21]).",

              "It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion.",
              "Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, neurology, neuroanatomy, psychology, music theory, computer science, and other relevant fields.",
              "The cognitive neuroscience of music represents a significant branch of music psychology, and is distinguished from related fields such as cognitive musicology in its reliance on direct observations of the brain and use of brain imaging techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).",
              "Sounds consist of waves of air molecules that vibrate at different frequencies.",
              "These waves travel to the basilar membrane in the cochlea of the inner ear.",
              "Different frequencies of sound will cause vibrations in different locations of the basilar membrane.",
              "We are able to hear different pitches because each sound wave with a unique frequency is correlated to a different location along the basilar membrane.",
              "This spatial arrangement of sounds and their respective frequencies being processed in the basilar membrane is known as tonotopy.",
              "When the hair cells on the basilar membrane move back and forth due to the vibrating sound waves, they release neurotransmitters and cause action potentials to occur down the auditory nerve.",
              "The auditory nerve then leads to several layers of synapses at numerous clusters of neurons, or nuclei, in the auditory brainstem.",
              "These nuclei are also tonotopically organized, and the process of achieving this tonotopy after the cochlea is not well understood.",
              "[1] This tonotopy is in general maintained up to primary auditory cortex in mammals.",
              "[2] A widely postulated mechanism for pitch processing in the early central auditory system is the phase-locking and mode-locking of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus.",
              "Phase-locking to stimulus frequencies has been shown in the auditory nerve,[3][4] the cochlear nucleus,[3][5] the inferior colliculus,[6] and the auditory thalamus.",
              "[7] By phase- and mode-locking in this way, the auditory brainstem is known to preserve a good deal of the temporal and low-passed frequency information from the original sound;",
              "this is evident by measuring the auditory brainstem response using EEG.",
              "[8] This temporal preservation is one way to argue directly for the temporal theory of pitch perception, and to argue indirectly against the place theory of pitch perception.",
              "The right secondary auditory cortex has finer pitch resolution than the left.",
              "Hyde, Peretz and Zatorre (2008) used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in their study to test the involvement of right and left auditory cortical regions in the frequency processing of melodic sequences.",
              "[9] As well as finding superior pitch resolution in the right secondary auditory cortex, specific areas found to be involved were the planum temporale (PT) in the secondary auditory cortex, and the primary auditory cortex in the medial section of Heschl's gyrus (HG).",
              "Many neuroimaging studies have found evidence of the importance of right secondary auditory regions in aspects of musical pitch processing, such as melody.",
              "[10] Many of these studies such as one by Patterson, Uppenkamp, Johnsrude and Griffiths (2002) also find evidence of a hierarchy of pitch processing.",
              "Patterson et al.",
              "(2002) used spectrally matched sounds which produced: no pitch, fixed pitch or melody in an fMRI study and found that all conditions activated HG and PT.",
              "Sounds with pitch activated more of these regions than sounds without.",
              "When a melody was produced activation spread to the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and planum polare (PP).",
              "These results support the existence of a pitch processing hierarchy.",
              "Absolute pitch (AP) is defined as the ability to identify the pitch of a musical tone or to produce a musical tone at a given pitch without the use of an external reference pitch.",
              "[11][12] Neuroscientific research has not discovered a distinct activation pattern common for possessors of AP.",
              "Zatorre, Perry, Beckett, Westbury and Evans (1998) examined the neural foundations of AP using functional and structural brain imaging techniques.",
              "[13] Positron emission tomography (PET) was utilized to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in musicians possessing AP and musicians lacking AP.",
              "When presented with musical tones, similar patterns of increased CBF in auditory cortical areas emerged in both groups.",
              "AP possessors and non-AP subjects demonstrated similar patterns of left dorsolateral frontal activity when they performed relative pitch judgments.",
              "However, in non-AP subjects activation in the right inferior frontal cortex was present whereas AP possessors showed no such activity.",
              "This finding suggests that musicians with AP do not need access to working memory devices for such tasks.",
              "These findings imply that there is no specific regional activation pattern unique to AP.",
              "Rather, the availability of specific processing mechanisms and task demands determine the recruited neural areas.",
              "Studies suggest that individuals are capable of automatically detecting a difference or anomaly in a melody such as an out of tune pitch which does not fit with their previous music experience.",
              "This automatic processing occurs in the secondary auditory cortex.",
              "Brattico, Tervaniemi, Naatanen, and Peretz (2006) performed one such study to determine if the detection of tones that do not fit an individual's expectations can occur automatically.",
              "[14] They recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in nonmusicians as they were presented unfamiliar melodies with either an out of tune pitch or an out of key pitch while participants were either distracted from the sounds or attending to the melody.",

              "[43] When auditory feedback is experimentally manipulated by delays or distortions,[44] motor performance is significantly altered: asynchronous feedback disrupts the timing of events, whereas alteration of pitch information disrupts the selection of appropriate actions, but not their timing.",

              "4).",
              "Importantly, this model explains the observed inverted U-shaped relationship between the degree of syncopation in and the experience of groove132,133, where rhythm excerpts with medium levels of syncopations are rated as more pleasurable \u2014 and movement inducing \u2014 than low and high levels of syncopations.",
              "According to the PCRI model, these medium-level syncopated rhythms optimize what the system treats as precision-weighted prediction error, in that both the prediction error and the precision of the prediction are at intermediate levels in the processing hierarchy.",
              "In intermediate-level syncopated rhythms, the brain may, according to active inference, resolve prediction error either by revising predictions or through action \u2014 for example, by moving the body.",
              "Actively resolving prediction errors may explain our drive to reinforce the metre \u2014 by moving in time with the beat \u2014 while attenuating the precision of proprioceptive and auditory prediction errors.",
              "By contrast, rhythms with lower levels of syncopation evince little prediction error and less incentive to move.",
              "Conversely, for the highest levels of syncopations our mental model of the metre is less precise than the sensory evidence, precluding sensory attenuation and movement.",
              "The inverted U-shaped relationship between syncopation and groove experience has been replicated independently of culture and rhythmic proficiency128 and using physiological measurements such as pupillometry134.",
              "It has been tested for rhythm and groove in a within-culture and between-culture approach128,132,135 and is influenced by musical expertise135.",
              "Optimal levels of the pleasurable sensation of wanting to move have been linked recently to neural activity in the brain\u2019s motor and pleasure networks136 (Fig.",
              "4), and can thus be seen as a result of precision-weighted prediction error arising from a discrepancy between the syncopation in the auditory input and the motor system\u2019s propensity towards isochronism16,102.",
              "Importantly, optimal groove experience has been linked to activity in the NAcc and the orbitofrontal cortex, which are key regions of the reward network that are particularly sensitive to the predictability of the consequences of action136.",
              "It is important to note that the relationship between the rhythmic sensory input and the schematic expectations of the metre is only one of several interacting predictive processes occurring contemporaneously.",
              "When rhythm section patterns are repeated over and over again, the brain forms short-term rhythmic expectations that \u2014 after repeated listening \u2014 may turn into veridical expectations about the time course of a specific piece of music55,137,138.",
              "It is equally important to note that the repeated patterns in many non-Western grooves, such as the Afro-Cuban tumbao, still support a stable metre sensation in experienced listeners, even though they contain few onsets on the most salient metrical positions139.",
              "There is therefore an ongoing debate as to what extent the metre \u2014 which arguably is a construct based on a Western musical tradition, where there is a strong correlation between note frequency and metrical accentuation \u2014 can be considered the most important predictive reference structure in other styles of music140.",
              "In summary, the PCM model proposes that the pleasurable wanting to move is mediated by prediction-based brain mechanisms that optimize the syncopation-related precision-weighted prediction error, thereby engaging the brain\u2019s motor and reward systems. The right level of syncopation offers the opportunity to actively resolve uncertainty by moving \u2014 which can lead to the experience of \u2018pleasure\u2019.",
              "A defining feature of music, closely related to theories of its evolutionary origin141, is its ability to evoke a range of feelings and emotions, which may be similar to everyday emotions, such as happiness, sadness, surprise and nostalgia, or may provide music-specific experiences, such as the sensation of groove described earlier herein.",
              "Even though music is clearly able to give rise to everyday emotions142,143, and adults listen to music partly to regulate their affective state144, it is not possible to equate valence and liking.",
              "A negatively valenced emotion such as sadness is the eighth most commonly reported emotion induced by music145,146.",

              "The different ways in which the human brain might conduct the translational process from music to emotion can be explained by several psychological mechanisms150, which typically fall into three categories: hardwired responses, evoking universal survival-related responses such as when brainstem responses to loud sounds trigger fear responses;",

              "Whereas hardwired responses and extramusical mechanisms in principle can be elicited by sounds alone, anticipation depends on the organization of sounds into a meaningful succession of events \u2014 a defining characteristic of music that is closely connected to predictive coding.",
              "Since the publication of a seminal book by Meyer8, it has become increasingly clear that music anticipation may induce various complex emotional responses such as awe, surprise and discomfort and evoke laughter, foot tapping, humming, tears and a lump in the throat10.",

              "Functional neuroimaging studies of music and emotion show that music perception engages emotion-related brain networks and that music can modulate activity in limbic and paralimbic brain structures such as the amygdala, NAcc, hypothalamus, hippocampus, insula, cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex4.",
              "An outstanding question is to what extent the emotion-related networks involved in processing of music are mediated by universal, cultural or individual factors: that is, which aspects of music perception are developed only after exposure to a specific musical culture?",
              "One pioneering study86 comparing Western listeners with participants from the African Mafa people pointed towards the above chance level recognition of basic emotions \u2014 such as happy, sad and scared or fearful emotions \u2014 when they were listening to the other culture\u2019s music.",
              "Importantly, though, Mafa individuals, who have been culturally isolated from Western music, showed much lower emotion recognition performance with regard to Western music than Western listeners.",
              "Furthermore, in a recent large-scale Internet study, US and Chinese listeners identified 13 distinct types of subjective experience associated with music from both cultures152.",
              "It is, however, unclear to what extent music emotions can be universally recognized153, or how much they are a result of statistical learning caused by increasingly globalized music listening behaviours154.",

              "Predictive coding has therefore become a hot topic in the study of music-related emotions.",
              "A particularly interesting example of predictive processing of music is the link between musical anticipation and pleasure, similar to the well-established difference between wanting and liking157.",
              "Music pleasure was originally proposed to be linked to positive reward prediction errors, which arise when what is heard proves to be better than expected.",

              "These individuals show reduced NAcc responses and decreased functional connectivity between the right auditory cortex and the ventral striatum \u2014 including the NAcc \u2014 compared with their responses on a monetary gambling task and compared with other participants with normal or greater than average pleasure responses to music164.",
              "On the basis of active inference formulations of predictive coding models, Gebauer et al.",

              "They found optimal pleasure to be associated with surprising chords in predictable sequences (high precision, high surprise) and predictable chords in unpredictable sequences (low precision, low surprise) and that this interaction corresponded to activity in the amygdala and hippocampus, whereas activity in the NAcc reflected only precision.",
              "This is consistent with the optimal zones of predictability and uncertainty in musical pleasure that are found in modelling studies167.",

              "The improviser\u2019s difficult task is therefore to balance novelty and predictability in a way that generates pleasure responses in listeners7 or stimulates their cognitive curiosity, in the same way that the dance music producer tries to hit the sweet spot of groove.",
              "Because of the array of skills that are necessary to improvise at a high level, jazz musicians have been shown to outperform other types of musicians in domain-specific tasks such as ear training task performance and in quantitative brain measurements with regard to melodic expectancy violation12.",
              "This is coupled with findings from resting-state fMRI that show that improvising musicians exhibit more distributed, globally connected cortical networks than classical musicians, who instead show higher within-network connectivity than the former247, and morphometric findings of structural differences between these different groups of musicians248,249.",
              "In a recent study, the amplitudes of event-related potentials in response to chords that varied in expectancy were significantly correlated with behavioural measures of fluency and originality on a divergent thinking task, indicating a putative transfer effect of music skills to more domain-general processes250.",

              "As there would be no sensory information with which to compare the internal metre model, the PCM model would hypothesize that it would be difficult to generate precise prediction errors at least for lower-level predictions, but this is an empirical question that could be tested.",
              "Furthermore, only a few studies have considered the influence of the different predictive frameworks in which musical events are embedded.",
              "It remains for future studies to clarify the interaction between melody, harmony and rhythm \u2014 for example, the influence of shifting tonalities or metrical displacement of a given melody \u2014 as well as the interaction between lyrics and melody.",
              "Whereas this Review has focused mainly on predictive coding related to expectations in melody, rhythm and harmony, there are presumably also predictive mechanisms at work associated with voice leading, instrumentation, timbre, soundscapes or musical events such as when there is the so-called drop in electronic dance music.",

              "The oscillator approach gives greater weight to stimulus properties than to the top-down effects of learned musical experience.",
              "As a result, it will have difficulties in accounting for the range of musical phenomena that can be accounted for by the PCM model or other prediction-based approaches, such as the action simulation for auditory prediction hypothesis, which proposes that the motor system contributes to the accuracy of auditory predictions by providing a periodic temporal framework through these connections215,253.",
              "However, the two accounts could usefully be combined given their different levels of processing, with the oscillator-based approach providing the basis for internal or generative models the brain uses to elaborate probabilistic predictions (see Box 2 for an example).",

              "Specifically, the team wanted to identify whether or not a musician's specific emotional motivation would influence which brain systems were involved in her or his creative process.",
              "To accomplish this, the research team showed 12 professional jazz pianists three separate photographs representing a positive, negative, or ambiguous emotion and asked them to improvise separate musical compositions for each.",

              "Since the DLPFC is the brain region linked to planning and monitoring behavior, the researchers believe greater deactivation likely indicates a musician getting into a 'groove' or 'zone.'",
              "Interestingly, the sad improvisations recruited areas of the brain related to reward, suggesting the motivation to express unhappiness through art may follow from a different, though still gratifying impulse.",
              "The supplementary motor area (SMA) was also less active during the positive improvisation than during either the negative or the ambiguous improv.",
              "\"The SMA is often active during tasks involving continuous monitoring of the appropriateness of motor output, including rhythmic tapping,\" wrote the authors, who added the lack of SMA activity \"may indicate that positive improvisation induces a deeper state of flow than negative and ambiguous improvisation.\"",
              "Importantly, the researchers said decreased SMA activity did not simply relate to the level of motor activity, since, on average, the musicians were playing more notes during the positive improvisation compared to either negative or ambiguous.",

              "As a result, most of the research in this area conceptualizes preferences as trait-like constructs and assume that preferences reflect the types of music people listen to most of the time.",
              "However, as Sloboda and O\u2019Neill (2001) noted, music is always heard in context, so it is necessary to consider contextual forces and state-preferences in addition to trait-preferences.",
              "Indeed, trait variables necessarily interact with specific situations and a type of fundamental attribution error (Ross, 1977) may be at work in judgments about music preferences.",
              "Weddings, funerals, sporting events or relaxation, for example, constrain musical choices, and individual preferences operate within those constraints.",
              "One may prefer a particular piece or style of music (e.",
              "g., Chopin\u2019s Polonaises) in a particular context (at home reading leisurely) but never want to hear it in another context (during a Pilates workout).",
              "A complete theory of musical preferences must necessarily focus on the functions of music, and reflect situational constraints in interaction with personality traits.",
              "A growing body of research has begun to identify some of the social psychological processes and roles of the environment that link people to their music preferences.",
              "For instance, in a study in which different styles of new-age music were played (low, moderate, and highly complex) in a dining area, participants reported preferring low and moderately complex music (North & Hargreaves, 1996a).",
              "Further, when individuals were in unpleasant arousal-provoking situations (e.",
              "g., driving in busy traffic), they preferred relaxing music, whereas in pleasant arousal-provoking situations (e.",
              "g., exercising), they preferred stimulating music (North & Hargreaves, 1996b;",
              "1997).",
              "Thus, it would appear as though music preferences are, to some degree, moderated by situational goals.",
              "Further exploration of music preferences in context should consider the emotional state of the individual prior to listening to music.",
              "Numerous studies have shown that music can elicit certain emotional reactions in listeners (see Scherer & Zentner, 2001) but there is considerably less information about how mood might influence our music selections or how we respond to the music that we hear.",
              "For instance, do people in a sad mood prefer listening to happy music in order to change their mood?",
              "Or do they prefer listening to mood-consistent music?",
              "Or do some kinds of individuals prefer one of those and others prefer the other?",
              "One potentially fruitful direction would be to expand research on music attributes to focus more on the affective aspects of music preferences.",
              "It is obvious that in any one genre there are a variety of different moods expressed in the music;",
              "even one album could run the gamut of emotions.",
              "Thus, future research could further examine individual differences in preferences for musical attributes and whether certain attributes are preferred more in some situations over others.",
              "It goes without saying that music is important to people.",
              "Curiously, however, we know very little about why it is so important.",
              "To shed some light on this issue, we need a sturdy framework for conceptualizing and measuring musical preferences.",
              "The present research provides a foundation on which to develop such a framework.",
              "Future research can build on this foundation by including a wider array of music from various genres and exploring music preferences across generations, cultures, and social contexts.",
              "Such work will serve to inform our understanding of the nature of music preferences and its importance in people\u2019s lives.",

              "While music philosophers, musicologists, and aestheticians have written a lot about musical emotions, psychologists have been slow to catch up due to both conceptual and methodological problems. Hence, the article focuses mainly on research carried out during the last decade.",
              "The study of music and emotions is fraught with considerable controversy and disagreement.",
              "Current debates in the field revolve around such questions as which emotions music induces, whether there are uniquely musical emotions, and what the relationship is between perceived and induced emotions.",
              "An important direction for future research is to consider how emotions might be one of several features of an aesthetic response to music \u2013 the appreciation of music as \u2018art\u2019.",
              "Music has been linked to the emotions at least since Ancient Greece, and emotions do figure prominently in people's reported motives for listening to music.",
              "People use music to change emotions, to release emotions, to match their current emotion, to enjoy or comfort themselves, and to relieve stress.",
              "Yet, despite the ubiquity of music in everyday life today (see Chapter 40 this volume), emotional responses to music are still regarded as elusive.",
              "Why does music touch us so deeply?",
              "In this chapter, I will consider the best possible answers to this question that the psychology of music can currently provide.",
              "While music philosophers, musicologists, and aestheticians have written a lot about musical emotions (Budd 1985), psychologists have been slow to catch up due to both conceptual and methodological problems (Juslin and Sloboda 2001).",
              "Hence, this chapter will focus mainly on research carried out during the last decade.",
              "It is important to make a distinction between perception and induction of emotions.",
              "We may simply perceive an emotion in the music, or we may actually feel an emotion in response to the music.",
              "This distinction is often, but not always, made in modern research.",
              "It is important to make the distinction for two reasons.",
              "First, the underlying mechanisms may be different depending on the process involved.",
              "Secondly, the types of emotions usually induced by music may be different from the types of emotions usually perceived in music.",
              "This chapter focuses on induction of emotions, whereas perception of emotions is discussed in Chapters 13 and 35.",
              "A natural point of departure is to define the concept of emotion.",
              "Emotions belong to the field of affect.",
              "Based on an emerging consensus in the affective sciences (e.",
              "g. Davidson et al.",
              "2003), affect is regarded as an umbrella term, which includes various affective phenomena such as preference, emotion, and mood.",
              "Affect simply refers to the fact that these phenomena are valenced\u2014events are evaluated as positive or negative by the individual.",
              "Although researchers do not agree on a precise definition of emotions, they agree about the characteristics.",
              "Emotions are described as brief (lasting minutes to a few hours) but intense responses to potentially important events or changes in the external or internal environment that involve certain subcomponents: cognitive appraisal (e.",
              "g., you appraise a situation as \u2018dangerous\u2019), subjective feeling (e.",
              "g., you feel \u2018afraid\u2019), physiological response (e.",

              "g., you run away), and regulation (e.",
              "g., you try to calm yourself).",
              "In principle, each of these six components can be used to measure emotions, though researchers debate the extent to which the components are \u2018synchronized\u2019 during an emotional response.",
              "Many researchers assume that people are always in some affective state.",
              "When the states are intense and involve salient stimuli, we tend to call them \u2018emotions', whereas when the same states are less intense, and their causes are not immediately apparent, we tend to call them \u2018moods\u2019.",
              "The states have been conceptualized both as discrete categories and as dimensions such as valence and arousal.",
              "The fundamental issues to address in the study of music and emotion are: does music induce emotions?",
              "If so, which emotions does music typically induce?",
              "Under what circumstances do musical emotions commonly occur?",
              "How does music induce emotions?",
              "Are musical emotions different from other emotions?",
              "Could musical emotions have implications for our health?",
              "It is fair to say that music psychologists are only beginning to answer most of these questions.",
              "There are several methods that may be used to investigate musical emotions, such as listening experiments (Waterman 1996), questionnaire studies (Juslin and Laukka 2004), diary studies (Sloboda et al.",
              "2001), qualitative interviews (DeNora 2000) and brain imaging (Blood and Zatorre 2001).",
              "Since each method has both advantages and disadvantages, the best overall approach might be to combine various methods in a kind of \u2018method triangulation\u2019.",
              "In addition, the componential approach to measurement of emotions is slowly gaining ground in music psychology;",
              "that is, music researchers increasingly realize the need to measure several emotion components to be able to draw valid conclusions about emotional responses (Scherer and Zentner 2001).",
              "However, such approaches are still available mainly in the laboratory.",
              "Field studies continue to rely mostly on self-report, even though there are techniques for ambulatory measurement of physiological responses that could be used (Fahrenberg and Myrtek 1996).",
              "As observed already by William James (1884), the physiological response may be the aspect that gives emotions their distinct phenomenological feeling, providing the \u2018heat\u2019 of the emotions: \u2018What kind of an emotion of fear would be left, if the feelings neither of quickened heartbeats nor of shallow breathing .",

              "Evidence suggests that more intense emotions to music tend to involve more pronounced physiological reactions (Rickard 2004), including \u2018chills\u2019 (Panksepp 1995).",

              "It is therefore promising that several studies have found effects of musically induced emotions on so-called implicit measures such as writing speed, word association, and decision time, which may be less sensitive to demand characteristics (Va\u0308stfja\u0308ll 2002).",
              "The continued exploration and use of such indirect measures is recommended.",
              "Measuring emotions in the voice as a response to music is another hitherto unexplored approach (Juslin and Scherer 2005).",
              "To estimate the prevalence of musical emotions (i.",
              "e., the relative frequency of occurrence in the population of interest), it is necessary to capture the emotions as they spontaneously occur in daily life.",

              "Findings suggested that music was heard during 44 per cent of the recorded episodes, that few of these episodes involved music listening as the main focus, and that music experiences tended to make the listeners more positive, more alert, and more focused in the present\u2014particularly when personal choice over the music was involved.",

              "Music occurred in 37 per cent of the sampled episodes.",
              "In 64 per cent of the episodes that featured music, the participants reported that the music influenced how they felt.",
              "This is roughly similar to the retrospective, aggregated estimate provided in a survey study by Juslin and Laukka (2004), in which participants reported that they experienced emotions on average 55 per cent of the time they listened to music.",
              "Musical emotions were most frequent in the evening and during weekends.",
              "Overall, the results suggest that, although emotional responses to music are common, the occurrence of music does not itself necessarily guarantee that a listener will be moved by the music.",
              "A much debated but little investigated issue is which emotions music can induce.",
              "Can music induce the full range of human emotions in listeners?",
              "In principle, depending on the specific music, the person listening, and the situation, it would indeed appear possible that music can induce just about any emotion that may be felt in other realms of human life.",

              "However, given the rare nature of such experiences, a more interesting question is perhaps which emotions music commonly evokes in listeners.",
              "A handful of survey studies have provided preliminary estimates of the prevalence of particular emotions (Juslin and Laukka 2004 Table 4;",
              "Sloboda 1992 Table 1;",
              "Wells and Hakanen 1991 Table 1) and suggest that happiness, love, calm, sadness, excitement and nostalgia are relatively frequent emotional responses to music.",
              "However, these studies share two problems: they rely on retrospective and aggregated self-reports that may not be reliable and they do not directly compare musical with non-musical emotions, so that the \u2018uniqueness\u2019 of musical emotions can be assessed.",
              "The previously mentioned ESM study by Juslin et al.",

              "As can be seen, emotions such as calm\u2014contentment, happiness\u2014elation, and interest\u2014expectancy were generally common, whereas emotions such as disgust\u2014contempt were not so common.",
              "A comparison of musical with non-musical emotion episodes indicated that happiness\u2014elation and nostalgia\u2014longing were significantly more frequent in episodes with musical emotions, whereas anger\u2014irritation, boredom\u2014indifference, and anxiety\u2014fear were significantly more frequent in episodes with non-musical emotions.",

              "Whereas the musical features involved in the expression and perception of different emotions are fairly well mapped by now (see Chapters 13 and 35), the features that induce emotions have been less investigated (though there might be some overlap depending on the induction mechanism, see later this chapter).",
              "I predict that it will be difficult to find direct and simple links between musical features and emotions.",
              "The musical features must rather be related to possible induction mechanisms. An excellent example is Sloboda's (1991) attempt to link emotional reactions to music to specific events in the music: 83 participants, aged 16\u201370, most of them performers, were asked to specify particular pieces of music to which they could recall having experienced various physical manifestations frequently associated with an emotion.",
              "Having identified such pieces, which came mainly from classical music, they were then asked to specify the exact location within the music that provoked these reactions.",
              "Most participants reported whole pieces, movements, or sections of movements, which suggests an emotional response to the \u2018overall\u2019 character of the music (Table 3 in Sloboda 1991).",
              "Such a response might reflect \u2018emotional contagion\u2019 based on the emotional expression of the piece (Juslin and Va\u0308stfja\u0308ll in press).",
              "However, roughly a third of the participants were able to locate their reaction within a theme or smaller unit.",
              "The data showed that musical events associated with \u2018tears\u2019 (i.",
              "e., crying, lump in the throat) commonly contained melodic appoggiaturas and melodic or harmonic sequences;",

              "In addition to the cognitive appraisal, emotions are also widely acknowledged to be multidimensional, yielding changes in subjective feeling, physiological arousal, and behavioral response (Scherer, 2009).",

              "Rickard (2004) also observed coherent subjective and physiological (chills and skin conductance) responses to music selected by participants as emotionally powerful, which was interpreted as support for the emotivist perspective on music-induced emotions.",
              "It appears then that the evidence supporting music evoked emotions being \u2018real\u2019 is substantive, despite no obvious goal implications, or need for action, of this primarily aesthetic stimulus.",

              "Any unexpected change in acoustic feature, whether it be in pitch, timbre, loudness, or tempo, in music could therefore fundamentally be worthy of special attention, and therefore trigger an arousal response (Gabrielsson and Lindstrom, 2010;",

              "In this study, subjective and physiological measures of experienced emotion were obtained continuously from 18 participants (12 females, 6 males;",
              "18\u201338 years) who listened to four stimuli\u2014pleasant music, unpleasant music (dissonant manipulations of their own music), neutral music, and no music, in a counter-balanced order.",
              "Each stimulus was presented twice: electroencephalograph (EEG) data were collected during the first, while participants continuously subjectively rated the stimuli during the second presentation.",
              "Frontal asymmetry (FA) indices from frontal and temporal sites were calculated, and peak periods of bias toward the left (indicating a shift toward positive affect) were identified across the sample.",
              "The music pieces were also examined to define the temporal onset of key musical features.",
              "Subjective reports of emotional experience averaged across the condition confirmed participants rated their music selection as very positive, the scrambled music as negative, and the neutral music and silence as neither positive nor negative.",
              "Significant effects in FA were observed in the frontal electrode pair FC3\u2013FC4, and the greatest increase in left bias from baseline was observed in response to pleasurable music.",
              "These results are consistent with findings from previous research.",
              "Peak FA responses at this site were also found to co-occur with key musical events relating to change, for instance, the introduction of a new motif, or an instrument change, or a change in low level acoustic factors such as pitch, dynamics or texture.",
              "These findings provide empirical support for the proposal that change in basic musical features is a fundamental trigger of emotional responses in listeners.",

              "\u2019 Various authorities have argued that music is one of the most powerful means of inducing emotions, from Tolstoy\u2019s mantra that \u201cmusic is the shorthand of emotion,\u201d to the deeply researched and influential reference texts of Leonard Meyer (\u201cEmotion and meaning in music\u201d;",

              "Emotions are therefore triggered by events that are appraised as relevant to one\u2019s survival, and help prepare us to respond, for instance via fight or flight.",
              "In addition to the cognitive appraisal, emotions are also widely acknowledged to be multidimensional, yielding changes in subjective feeling, physiological arousal, and behavioral response (Scherer, 2009).",
              "The absence of clear goal implications of music listening, or any need to become \u2018action ready,\u2019 however, challenges the claim that music-induced emotions are real (Kivy, 1990;",

              "A growing body of \u2018emotivist\u2019 music psychology research has nonetheless demonstrated that music does elicit a response in multiple components, as observed with non-aesthetic (or \u2018utilitarian\u2019) emotions.",
              "The generation of an emotion in subcortical regions of the brain (such as the amygdala) lead to hypothalamic and autonomic nervous system activation and release of arousal hormones, such as noradrenaline and cortisol.",
              "Sympathetic nervous system changes associated with physiological arousal, such as increased heart rate and reduced skin conductance, are most commonly measured as peripheral indices of emotion.",
              "A large body of work now illustrates, under a range of conditions and with a variety of music genres, that emotionally exciting or powerful music impacts on these autonomic measures of emotion (see Bartlett, 1996;",

              "The observed changes in these measures differed according to the emotion category of the music, and was similar (although not identical) to that observed for non-musical stimuli.",
              "Rickard (2004) also observed coherent subjective and physiological (chills and skin conductance) responses to music selected by participants as emotionally powerful, which was interpreted as support for the emotivist perspective on music-induced emotions.",
              "It appears then that the evidence supporting music evoked emotions being \u2018real\u2019 is substantive, despite no obvious goal implications, or need for action, of this primarily aesthetic stimulus.",
              "Scherer and Coutinho (2013) have argued that music may induce a particular \u2018kind\u2019 of emotion \u2013 aesthetic emotions \u2013 that are triggered by novelty and complexity, rather than direct relevance to one\u2019s survival.",
              "Novelty and complexity are nonetheless features of goal relevant stimuli, even though in the case of music, there is no significance to the listener\u2019s survival.",
              "In the same way that secondary reinforcers appropriate the physiological systems of primary reinforcers via association, it is possible then that music may also hijack the emotion system by sharing some key features of goal relevant stimuli.",

              "This is because these acoustic events are associated with events that do in fact signal relevance for survival for real events (such as a nearby loud noise, or a rapidly approaching predator).",
              "Any unexpected change in acoustic feature, whether it be in pitch, timbre, loudness, or tempo, in music could therefore fundamentally be worthy of special attention, and therefore trigger an arousal response (Gabrielsson and Lindstrom, 2010;",

              ", 2010).",

              "In seminal work in this field, Sloboda (1991) asked participants to identify music passages which evoked strong, physical emotional responses in them, such as tears or chills.",
              "The most frequent musical events coded within these passages were new or unexpected harmonies, or appoggiaturas (which delay an expected principal note), supporting the proposal that unexpected musical events, or substantial changes in music features, were associated with physiological responses.",

              "(2002) rated musical structure and acoustic features as more important in determining emotional reactions than the listener\u2019s mood, affective involvement, personality or contextual factors.",
              "Importantly, because music events can elicit emotions via both expectation of an upcoming event and experience of that event, physiological markers of peak emotional responses may occur prior to, during or after a music event.",
              "This proposal has received some empirical support via research demonstrating physiological peak responses to psychoacoustic \u2018events\u2019 in music (see Table 1).",
              "On the whole, changes in physiological arousal \u2013 primarily, chills, heart rate or skin conductance changes \u2013 coincided with sudden changes in acoustic features (such as changes in volume or tempo), or novel musical events (such as entry of new voices, or harmonic changes).",

              "Importantly, brain regions associated with emotion and reward have been shown to also respond to emotionally powerful music.",
              "For instance, Blood and Zatorre (2001) found that pleasant music activated the dorsal amygdala (which connects to the \u2018positive emotion\u2019 network comprising the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex), while reducing activity in central regions of the amygdala (which appear to be associated with unpleasant or aversive stimuli).",

              "Further, the release was higher in the dorsal striatum during the anticipation of the peak emotional period of the music, but higher in the ventral striatum during the actual peak experience of the music.",

              "This phenomenon, known in the literature as the mere exposure effect, suggests that familiarity might play an important role in the emotional engagement of listeners with the music.",
              "The neural mechanisms governing this mere exposure effect are, however, still unrevealed.",
              "Furthermore, several imaging experiments looking for brain activations to familiar/unfamiliar music have been performed, but the use of different techniques, stimuli and tasks have yielded somewhat different results.",
              "Using positron emission tomography (PET), Satoh and collaborators [26] reported activations in the anterior portion of bilateral temporal lobes, posterior portion of superior temporal gyri, anterior and posterior portion of medial frontal lobes, bilateral cingulate gyri, left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and middle portion of the left superior temporal gyrus (STG).",
              "The described regions were obtained by subtracting a familiarity task (judging whether melodies were familiar or not) and an alteration-detection task (detecting altered notes), in a set of melodies played with a synthesizer.",
              "In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study [27], the neural basis of familiarity was analysed using classical music excerpts and odours, showing activations for familiar over unfamiliar music in left frontal regions, namely in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and precentral gyrus (pCG), and also in the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) and parietal regions, such as the posterior part of the left cingulate gyrus, the right angular gyrus (AG) and the left supramarginal gyrus.",
              "Additionally, the authors described a vast network of overlapping left hemisphere activations for familiar over unfamiliar music and odours, including the SFG, IFG, AG, precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus, suggesting that there might be a multimodal neural system for the feeling of familiarity, which is independent of the sensory modality.",
              "Another recent fMRI study [28] showed that familiar monophonic melodies over acoustically balanced unfamiliar melodies (consisting in the reversed versions of the familiar ones) activated bilateral STS with a bias to the right, and that familiar music over random tones recruited the right supplementary motor area (SMA), the planum temporale and the IFG.",
              "Interestingly, in both these contrasts, the authors observed sub-threshold activations in the ventral striatum and precuneus.",
              "The ventral striatum activation is of particular interest to our study since it includes the NAc, which receives projections from the dopaminergic neurons of the VTA and is therefore a central structure of the reward/pleasure system (cf.",
              "[29]).",
              "Although below threshold, this activation is consistent with our hypothesis that familiarity is an important factor for the emotional engagement and/or induction of pleasurable feelings in the listener.",
              "Music fruition is a highly subjective experience, which varies widely across individuals.",
              "While listening to music, we can be moved by the melody, or we may find ourselves focusing on a timbre of an instrument or combination of instruments, or else we can be emotionally engaged by abrupt changes in the harmony or rhythm.",
              "Hence, in order to mimic the naturalistic situation in which music appreciation occurs, we discarded the manipulation of a single music dimension, and rather used expressive music from the pop/rock music genre, as it is the most ubiquitous in Western world (and also very diffuse in non-Western populations;",
              "for a similar approach in neuroimaging research, see [30]).",
              "In addition, appreciation of pop/rock music does not require formal musical training, and it is consequently the most available and important instance of aesthetic enjoyment of music.",
              "In order to further enhance the experience of musical enjoyment and of familiarity with music, subjects performed a listening test prior to the fMRI measurements, from which a unique set of musical stimuli per participant was chosen.",
              "The naturalistic approach adopted here has been used before us by Janata [30].",
              "In that study, fMRI and pop/rock music that extended to subjects' childhood time to evoke autobiographical memories were used.",
              "The analyses of the parametric variation (the areas of activation for the independent effects) of familiarity, autobiographical salience and valence showed that the most widespread activations were observed for the familiarity regressor.",
              "These activations included the IFG, medial frontal gyrus (MFG), pre-SMA, medial prefrontal cortex, STG, AG, medial temporal gyrus (MTG), cerebellum, caudate nucleus and ventro-lateral thalamic nucleus.",
              "A series of cortical and subcortical activations correlated with the degree of experienced positive affect were also reported, namely in the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS), right STG, left ventral anterior cingulate cortex, left substantia nigra and left ventral lateral thalamic nucleus.",
              "That study [30], however, focused on testing if the medial prefrontal cortex has a role in the association of musical features with autobiographical memories and emotions, rather than studying the brain areas recruited by familiarity and liking of music.",
              "For instance, the ratings of valence and pleasantness do not allow to tackle the subjective liking of music, since they might be driven by acoustic features and sensory processing.",
              "Moreover, since the participants classified each song during the fMRI recordings, the number of stimuli obtained for each condition was different, and had, therefore, different statistical weights in the final model.",
              "In sum, with this study, we examined the role of familiarity and aesthetic preferences in music enjoyment and in the activation of limbic and reward centres in the brain, using commercially available pop/rock songs.",
              "In an initial phase, candidates participated in a listening test, in which they listened to song extracts and decided if each song was familiar or unfamiliar and if they liked it or not.",
              "Based on this test, a unique set of stimuli to be presented during an fMRI session was selected for each participant, containing music in four different conditions: familiar liked, familiar disliked, unfamiliar liked and unfamiliar disliked.",
              "With this procedure, we were able to obtain the same number of stimuli for each condition, which, in turn, allowed us to determine the brain structures associated with familiarity and liking of music.",
              "Based on previous literature on the mere exposure effect [5], [24], [25], we expected to find that familiarity has an important role in the pleasurable emotions derived from music listening.",
              "In particular, we expected that familiar songs would elicit strong activations in limbic and reward system regions of the brain.",

              "Another very recent paper [29] clearly shows the release of dopamine in the mesolimbic reward system in correlation with intense pleasurable experiences elicited by music.",
              "Even more interesting, it shows that, in anticipation of these peak emotional responses, the caudate nucleus was more active, while during the experience of the peaks themselves, increased activity was found in the right nucleus accumbens.",
              "It happens that, in this study, the authors used music that was highly familiar to the participants, but did not satisfactorily control for the familiarity of the neutral musical stimuli, leaving open the possibility that this factor might have contributed to the described activations.",
              "Moreover, only 8 out of about 200 subjects showed a consistent peak emotional response to music and were thus selected for the study, making it difficult to generalize these results to the overall population.",

              "[29], but only for familiar music.",
              "This means that, in previous studies where familiarity was not properly controlled, the activations of this brain structure might have been wrongly attributed to the sole feeling of liking, discarding the crucial role of familiarity.",

              "Similar to our results, Brown and collaborators [45] further showed the recruitment of the putamen, with emphasis on the right side, while subjects were watching dancers moving to a regular, metric rhythm.",
              "Of course, people can synchronize to rhythm and dance to unfamiliar music as well, but possibly the activation of the basal ganglia structures might indicate that familiarity with the musical stimulus is a prominent factor in engaging the listeners also motorically, besides emotionally.",
              "Another cluster of activation for familiar over unfamiliar music was located in the SMA.",
              "Our interpretation of these activations is that the participants might have silently sung the familiar tunes.",
              "This is consistent with the proposal by Halpern and Zatorre [46] and Halpern [47] that this particular region is activated during musical imagery, or the act of imaging music in our minds, something that is likely to happen when you know a song and can predict what comes next.",
              "Several behavioural studies (namely [5]) confirmed what has been previously described by Meyer [24], which is the positive effect of prior exposure on music liking, also called the mere exposure effect.",
              "These results were also reproduced in our listening test, where we observed that within the group of songs that fitted the aesthetic preferences of each participant, the ones that were familiar were the most highly rated in terms of liking (figure 2).",
              "Accordingly, the brain results showed that familiar songs, including those that were liked and those that were disliked, were efficient in activating the network of brain regions known to respond to emotional stimuli.",
              "Another experiment [25] reported an effect similar to the mere exposure effect, this time also considering the valence (happy and sad) of the musical stimuli and the quality of the listening method (focused or incidental).",
              "They found that the effects of exposure on liking are different for focused and incidental listening, namely that liking ratings were higher for happy songs, but only in the focused listening condition.",
              "They also observed that liking ratings increased linearly as a consequence of exposure, but only in the incidental listening condition.",
              "In the focused listening condition, liking ratings were represented by an inverted U in function of exposure, meaning that the repeated exposure initially increases the ratings of the songs, but it then tends to cause an \u201cover-familiarity\u201d effect, reflected in the decreasing of the ratings.",
              "These studies suggest that the mere repetition of melodies is sufficient to increase the affective responses to these melodies, at least in an initial stage.",
              "To our knowledge, we provide the first functional neuroanatomical evidence for a strong effect of familiarity in the way listeners' get emotional engaged with the music, at least within an experimental setting.",
              "Our results not only strengthen the body of evidence showing that music is very efficient in recruiting emotional centres of the brain, but also clearly provide evidence that familiarity with a particular piece of music is an extremely important factor for emotional engagement, and thus furnishes \u201cdirect access\u201d to these emotional centres of the brain.",
              "We would also expect that, besides familiarity, musical preferences would also be an important factor to determine the emotional involvement of listeners, but, in our study, the aesthetical preferences of the participants generated only focal activations in brain regions, including limbic ones.",
              "In particular, liked songs (compared with disliked ones) activated the supplementary motor cortex, the right anterior cingulate cortex and a network of frontal regions.",
              "The anterior cingulate has been implicated in aesthetic judgement processes by studies in the visual domain [48], [49].",
              "In Kawabata's paper [48], the anterior cingulate was recruited when the subjects viewed and judged beautiful stimuli (in contrast to neutral stimuli), which is consistent with the activation we found in this structure for liked, more than disliked, music.",
              "Also the inferior frontal gyrus, another region that we found to be active in this condition, was implicated in the aesthetic judgements of beauty with visual stimuli (see [50]).",
              "Furthermore, the activation on the frontal pole/frontal medial cortex is also consistent with studies of the neural basis of evaluative judgements, namely [51], [52].",
              "It seems likely, then, that although participants were instructed to just listen to the music and not to perform any active task, involuntary aesthetic judgements happened, and reflected subject's positive appreciation of the songs presented in this condition.",
              "Despite the fact that, in this experiment, we obtained only few activations in limbic regions and absence of activity in the reward system regions for liked music (more than disliked one), we know from our own private experiences that listening to a loved song is drastically different from listening to a disliked one.",
              "Nonetheless, when listening to only thirty second extracts of songs inside an MRI machine, the effect of the aesthetical preferences most likely gets diminished, and familiar songs have an advantage in emotionally engaging the listener.",
              "A more risky explanation for this result might be the assumption that one thing is our aesthetical taste, and another thing is what we are hardwired to like, which may be even difficult to admit in public for social reasons.",
              "In other words, subjects could have classified part of the songs based on their aesthetical construct and not on the \u201creal\u201d feelings elicited by the music.",
              "A recent study [53] showed that, in adolescents, song popularity had a significant effect on the participants' likeability ratings of the songs, showing that conscious knowledge of the song popularity may influence people to switch their choices towards the consensus.",
              "In that study [53] it was further suggested that such a switch might occur to minimize the anxiety generated by the mismatch between individual and group preferences.",
              "Such findings raise the question whether similar social constraints come into play every time an individual is asked to make an aesthetical judgement, including in the laboratory setting.",
              "In the opposite contrast, disliked songs versus liked ones, we obtained no evidence of brain activations related to affective or cognitive processing, since only auditory-cortex regions were active, namely the left planum polare and STG.",
              "These regions are known to be recruited for perceptual integration of sound features into auditory objects, timbral processing, and musical scale rule extraction [54]-[57].",
              "The regions found to be more active for unfamiliar songs rather than familiar ones included rolandic/parietal operculum areas, as well as occipital cortex areas.",
              "Plailly and collaborators [27] have previously reported two clusters in the vicinity of ours, namely the ones in the left postcentral gyrus and left parietal operculum, for unfamiliar minus familiar music.",
              "We think these activations may be related either with the attempt to recall the songs or to the detection of novelty, although the latter action has been described to activate more medial parietal and temporal lobe regions (see, for example, [58]).",
              "Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the activations for unfamiliar versus familiar songs were observed only after a more liberal threshold was applied, and that this overall pattern of activation is significantly more reduced than that of the opposite contrast.",
              "It is worth noting that our results are consistent with the role proposed by Rauschecker and Scott [59] for the dorsal stream of their dual stream model.",
              "A further development on the role of this dorsal auditory pathway was recently accomplished by Rauschecker [60].",
              "This model postulates that when incoming sounds match expectations based on previous learning, the premotor cortex and basal ganglia are recruited.",
              "Parietal cortex regions may have a special role in comparing the incoming sounds with those expectations and they most likely are activated when the expectations are not matched, what happens when the sounds are unfamiliar.",
              "In our data, we found activations of the supplementary motor cortex and putamen (basal ganglia) for familiar sounds and of parietal rolandic operculum for unfamiliar sounds, thus supporting the role of this dorsal stream for processing sensorimotor sound events and matching (or unmatching) them with learned ones.",
              "Finally, our results also show that it is possible to use complex acoustic stimuli in the form of commercially available music, and still find highly consistent activations across subjects, in contrast to the trend of using unexpressive, controlled stimuli, quite distant from the real music listened to in everyday life.",

              "21, 2016).",
              "After the third and fourth years in the program, they also began to perform better on tasks unrelated to music, including on executive function tasks involving working memory and delayed gratification\u2014likely because of the discipline required to patiently learn pieces of music, Habibi says.",
              "In addition, youth involved in YOLA showed greater development in brain areas related to language and auditory processing, and greater neuronal connectivity in the corpus callosum, the nerve bundle that connects the brain\u2019s right and left hemispheres (Cerebral Cortex, Vol.",
