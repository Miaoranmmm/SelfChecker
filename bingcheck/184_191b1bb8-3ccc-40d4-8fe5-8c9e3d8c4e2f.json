    "query": "What is the history and significance behind the different types of traditional masks used in cultural performances and celebrations around the world, and how do they reflect the values and beliefs of the communities that create and utilize them?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and broad question. Traditional masks are used in various cultural performances and celebrations around the world, and they have different meanings and functions depending on the context and the history of the people who create and use them. Here are some examples of traditional masks and their significance:\n\n- In **Africa**, masks are often used in rituals or ceremonies with varied purposes like ensuring a good harvest, addressing tribal needs in times of peace or war, or conveying spiritual presences in initiation rituals or burial ceremonies[^6^]. Masks usually represent supernatural beings, ancestors, or fabled characters, and they are worn with costumes that complete the identity of the mask[^2^]. Some masks are also used to admonish or discipline wrongdoers or to protect the wearer from evil spirits[^7^].\n- In **Japan**, masks are used in various forms of traditional theater, such as noh, kyogen, and kabuki. Japanese masks are used to portray characters' emotions and identities, and they are often highly stylized and exaggerated. Actors apply their own makeup to create their characters, and they use different techniques of movement and voice to bring the masks to life. Masks are also used to represent gods, demons, animals, or ghosts[^3^].\n- In **Mexico**, masks have been worn since the pre-Columbian era in various fully-scripted performances, known as bailes or danzas. These tell stories both historical and mythical. They are performed at indigenous festivals and Catholic feasts and often depict animals, saints, conquistadors or Mayan warriors[^1^]. Masks are also used in the famous Day of the Dead celebration, where people wear masks of skulls or skeletons to honor their deceased relatives and friends.\n- In **Korea**, masks are used in folk dramas called talchum or sandae. These dramas are satirical and humorous, and they often criticize social issues or mock authority figures. Masks are also used to perform ancestral rites or to drive away evil spirits by wearing a mask. Typically one sees the following some of which are designated as national cultural properties. The Hahoe, Sandae and Talchum are all traditional Korean mask dramas of ritual and religious significance[^5^].\n\nThese are just some examples of how traditional masks reflect the values and beliefs of the communities that create and utilize them. Masks are not only artistic expressions, but also cultural symbols that convey complex meanings and messages.",

              "Recently, it has become a wildly popular tourist destination, with tourism-related activities making up the most of its economy.",
              "Although its well-studied and documented culture seems to transcend time and space, numerous changes have been underway since Bali\u2019s first contacts with the West (XVI century), to the extent that the issue of how their identity has been impacted by tourism can get very controversial.",
              "The unique Balinese Hindu culture is so embedded within the long historical development of the society that local communities were clustered as non-political entities which developed in accordance with the Hindu worldview and philosophy.",
              "Agama Hindu Dharma (Balinese form of Hinduism) is a mixture of Indian philosophy, indigenous practices and reverence for Buddhist deities.",
              "Indigenous beliefs, such as animism and the famous ancestor worship, are the backbone of Balinese thinking.",
              "Spirits and ancestors are feted with offerings and housed in shrines or natural elements.",
              "They may affect every aspect of life, and, therefore, a complex apparatus of rituals and taboos is necessary to prevent an outbreak of calamities, diseases, deaths, and any other kind of adversity.",
              "On the whole, the Indonesian archipelago is characterized by folk tales, encounters with giants and terrible creatures.",
              "No real distinctions between the living and the dead exist, and ever-present evil spirits inhabit even the bright green rice paddies of the islands.",
              "A stunning example of the Balinese cultural richness is the wayang, a form of puppet theatre art found also in other parts of Southeast Asia.",
              "In the Wayang Bali the stories, drawn from the Mahabharata myth cycle, are narrated through puppets\u2019 shadows manipulated by rods against a screen lit from behind.",
              "The light, usually an oil lamp, represents the sun, the shadow master (dalang) is the spiritual leader and the \u201ccreator\u201d, the screen symbolizes the world, while the wayangs (puppets) are all the creatures.",
              "Thus, the performance becomes a representation of the cosmos.",
              "The story is accompanied by a special music called gender wayang, a style of gamelan distinctive of the Balinese tradition.",
              "Spirits can be effective solutions to disturbing questions, offering a cultural victory over the unalterable nature.",
              "They can upset the social order, and, to avoid this, the victory over them needs to be reiterative and ritualized.",
              "There are many types of receptacles for spirits (including puppets, bowls of water, and even human beings), and, in general, Balinese create comfortable \u201chomes\u201d for the spirits to dwell in.",
              "Balinese masks, for example, have interesting functions and roles.",
              "They are used in several situations such as dance dramas, ritualistic performances but also weddings and funeral rites.",
              "Masks help Balinese to display the divine power and provide them with a material manifestation of that power.",
              "During the ritual dances, the Balinese believe that the masks can inspire the dancers, who in turn entertain the masks.",
              "There are human, animal and demon masks.",
              "This last type can be deemed to be rather scary, with stretched and widened mouths, protruding eyes and sharpened teeth.",
              "There is, for example, the child-eating Rangda, demon queen of the leak (wicked witches of the Balinese tradition), the epitome of evil who symbolizes fears.",
              "Her servant (or daughter) is Rarung who can bring people back from the dead.",
              "She appears as a beautiful woman, but can immediately turn into a terrifying creature.",
              "The king of the spirits is Barong, a lion-like creature, and enemy of Rangda.",
              "Their battle symbolizes the eternal conflict between good and evil, and it is performed in the Barong dance, a unique tradition of the island.",
              "The Indonesian strong focus on animism results in a countless number of forces which interfere not only with religious practices but also with daily activities.",
              "The memedi, for example, are humanoid ghosts who live in big trees close to villages.",
              "They can play dirty tricks but are not dangerous.",
              "Naughty child spirits are called tuyul.",
              "They are typical figures in Malay mythology and can be friendly or spiteful.",
              "In the Javanese mythology, an individual who owns a tuyul is said to become rich instantly, but in exchange, he or she will die slowly and painfully.",
              "Another mysterious creature is the jenglot which is described as a living human-like doll.",
              "It has dark skin and a resemblance to mummies.",
              "It is believed that jenglot, fed by their keepers, consume blood as nourishment.",

              "Eventually, all these features establish a colorful connection between the Balinese and unearthly beings which is a peculiarity of their continuously changing identity, and it undoubtedly livens up their exclusive culture.",

              "Unusual among Mexican dances - the large numbers involved, including women, performances commonly held in major cities, unique hybrid instrumentation (the conchas, large vertical Aztec drums played aggressively with beaters rather than hands as in pre-Hispanic days.",

              "There\u2019s little doubt that the majority of their participants are mestizo (mixed-descent).",
              "In recent years - Aguilar says since the 1940s, though the process has accelerated dramatically since the 1980s - the Danza Azteca movement has become much more politicised, with some dancers moving to reject elements of their tradition containing Spanish antecedents: as a result, concha guitars are losing popularity in favour of percussion-only accompaniment, dancers are opting for more simple garb - at times just loincloths and feathers - and a new style is emerging, seeking to (re-)discover a \u2018pure Aztec\u2019 heritage, even though, as we noted before, quite how the Mexica danced no-one really knows today.",
              "The fervent, almost militant, character of Concheros ceremony has led some researchers, such as leading ethnomusicologist and archaeologist Arnd Adje Both, to suggest a link to the cultural resistance of the Nahua in the face of heavy-handed Spanish repression:-\u2019The Conquerors managed to destroy Aztec dance and song traditions, during the first half of the 16th century.",
              "There was a short phase of transition, in which even playing pre-Columbian musical instruments and dancing in temple worship was tolerated, as a means of conversion.",
              "Although soon forbidden, the tradition held very strong.",
              "Throughout the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century there are reports that forbidden dances were held.",
              "Maybe the tradition of the Concheros can be traced back to the time when music and dance practices could only be performed underground.",
              "\u2019 One thing we can be sure of: the general structure of Concheros dances, in a circle, with the musicians placed in the centre (to which the vital energy of the dancers is focussed), sometimes with pre-dance processions, is very much the same as those described in the 16th century and depicted in the codices.",
              "Significantly, following part of the legend referred to above, a cross has always played a key role in the symbolism (indeed in the steps) of Danza Azteca.",
              "But as Momprade\u0301 and Gutie\u0301rrez point out, the participants appear to be paying homage at the same time to the ancient Mesoamerican cross representing the four sacred directions of the world and the four winds.",
              "Concheros ceremonies have traditionally taken place at sites around Mexico City - Tepeyac (north), Chalma (south), El Sacromonte (east), Los Remedios (west) and Ixtapalapa (centre) - that were important ritual sites in pre-Hispanic times.",
              "Mario Aguilar raises the question: \u2018Who conquered who in the end?",
