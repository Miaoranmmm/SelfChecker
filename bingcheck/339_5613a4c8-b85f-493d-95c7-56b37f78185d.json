              "[citation needed] One of the most important practices in classical Arnis was dueling, without any form of protection.",

              "Arnis students start their instruction by learning to fight with weapons, and only advance to empty-hand training once the stick and knife techniques have been sufficiently mastered.",
              "This is in contrast to most other well-known Asian martial arts but it is justified by the principle that bare-handed moves are acquired naturally through the same exercises as the weapon techniques, making muscle memory an important aspect of the teaching.",
              "It is also based on the obvious fact that an armed person who is trained has the advantage over a trained unarmed person, and serves to condition students to fight against armed assailants.",
              "Most systems of Arnis apply a single set of techniques for the stick, knife, and empty hands, a concept sometimes referred to as motion grouping.",
              "Since the weapon is seen as simply an extension of the body, the same angles and footwork are used either with or without a weapon.",
              "The reason for this is probably historical, because tribal warriors went into battle armed and only resorted to bare-handed fighting after losing their weapons.",
              "Many systems begin training with two weapons, either a pair of sticks or a stick and a wooden knife.",
              "These styles emphasise keeping both hands full and never moving them in the same direction, and trains practitioners to become ambidextrous.",
              "For example, one stick may strike the head while the other hits the arm.",
              "Such training develops the ability to use both limbs independently, a valuable skill, even when working with a single weapon.",
              "A core concept and distinct feature of Filipino martial arts is the Live Hand.",
              "Even when as a practitioner wields only one weapon, the extra hand is used to control, trap or disarm an opponent's weapon and to aid in blocking, joint locking and manipulation of the opponent or other simultaneous motions such as bicep destruction with the live hand.",
              "The most basic and common weapon in Arnis is the baston or yantok.",
              "They are typically constructed from rattan, an inexpensive stem from a type of Southeast Asian vine.",
              "Hard and durable yet lightweight, it shreds only under the worst abuse and does not splinter like wood, making it a safer training tool.",

              "The participants are skilled enough to parry and counterstrike, showing respect in not intentionally hitting the training partner.",
              "In modern times, many Arnis practitioners have also come to wear head and hand protection while sparring with rattan sticks, or otherwise use padded bastons.",
              "Some modern schools also use sticks made out of aluminium or other metals, or modern high-impact plastics.",
              "Baraw is a Cebuano term used in eskrima that means knife or dagger.",
              "The term Baraw is more commonly used on the Cebu Island in the Visayan region whereas other islands and regions more commonly use the term Daga but both terms are often interchangeable within the Filipino martial arts community.",
              "The terms Baraw and Daga can be used either as Solo Baraw or Solo Daga associated with single knife fighting and defense systems, Doble Baraw or Doble Daga associated with the double knife fighting systems or even with a combination of long and short weapons e.",

              "Practitioners are screened by the rank promotion committee to determine their rank in the grading system.",
              "Most systems recognize that the technical nature of combat changes drastically as the distance between opponents changes, and generally classify the ranges into at least three categories.",
              "Each range has its characteristic techniques and footwork.",
              "Of course, some systems place more emphasis on certain ranges than others, but almost all recognize that being able to work in and control any range is essential.",
              "The Balintawak style for example, uses long-, medium- and short-range fighting techniques, but focuses on the short-range.",
              "To control the range, and for numerous other purposes, good footwork is essential.",
              "Most eskrima systems explain their footwork in terms of triangles: normally when moving in any direction two feet occupy two corners of the triangle and the step is to the third corner such that no leg crosses the other at any time.",
              "The shape and size of the triangle must be adapted to the particular situation.",
              "The style of footwork and the standing position vary greatly from school to school and from practitioner to practitioner.",
              "For a very traditional school, conscious of battlefield necessities, stances are usually very low, often with one knee on the ground, and footwork is complex, involving many careful cross-steps to allow practitioners to cope with multiple opponents.",
              "The Villabrille and San Miguel styles are usually taught in this way.",
              "Systems that have been adapted to duels or sporting matches generally employ simpler footwork, focusing on a single opponent.",
              "North American schools tend to use much more upright stances, as this puts less stress on the legs, but there are some exceptions.",
              "Many systems, including the Inosanto/Lacosta system of escrima/kali recognize and teach 3 basic ranges: long range (largo), medium range (medio) and short range (corto).",
              "The long range is typically defined as being able to hit the opponents lead/weapon hand with your weapon/stick only.",
              "Medium range is where you are able to strike the opponent's body/head with your weapon/stick while also checking/monitoring the opponent's lead hand with your rear/live hand.",
              "And the short range is when you can strike the opponent's body/head with your rear/live hand or being able to strike the opponent's head/body with the hilt/punyo end of the weapon/stick.",
              "Some styles or systems may also define a closer range for elbows to the head or body, or grappling.",
              "Many Filipino systems focus on defending against and/or reacting to angles of attack rather than particular strikes.",
              "The theory behind this is that virtually all types of hand-to-hand attacks (barehanded or with a weapon) hit or reach a combatant via these angles of attack and the reasoning is that it is more efficient to learn to defend against different angles of attack rather than learn to defend against particular styles, particular techniques or particular weapons.",
              "For instance, the technique for defending against an attack angle that comes overhead from the right is very similar whether the attacker uses bare fists, a knife, a sword or a spear.",
              "Older styles gave each angle a name, but more recent systems tend to simply number them.",
              "Many systems have twelve standard angles, though some have as few as 5, and others as many as 72.",
              "Although the exact angles, the order they are numbered in (numerado), and the way the player executes moves vary from system to system, most are based upon Filipino cosmology.",
              "These standard angles describe exercises.",
              "To aid memorization, player often practise a standard series of strikes from these angles, called an abecedario (Spanish for \"alphabet\").",
              "These are beginner strikes or the \"ABC's\" of Arnis.",
              "While most systems do incorporate a numbering system for the angles of attack, not all use the same numbering system, so always get clarification before training in a new system or style.",
              "Additionally, while the angles are numbered for ease of discussion, the numbers do not generally define how the attack is thrown.",
              "That is to say, usually (excluding thrusts) a #1 angle, means an attack that starts on the right side of the practitioner and comes down at about a 45\u00b0 from right to left.",
              "But, it does not matter whether this is done with the right or left hand (forehand or backhand) or if the hit continues through the target or returns back along the same line.",
              "Some angles of attack and some strikes have characteristic names: Many Arnis techniques have Spanish names, because Spanish was the lingua franca spoken during colonial times among the natives, who spoke over 170 languages across 7,600 islands.",
              "Arnis techniques are generally based on the assumption that both student and opponent are very highly trained and well prepared.",
              "Thus, Arnis tends to favour extreme caution, always considering the possibility of a failed technique or an unexpected knife.",
              "On the other hand, the practitioner is assumed to be capable of quick, precise strikes.",
              "The general principle is that an opponent's ability to attack should be destroyed rather than trying to injure and convince them to stop.",
              "Many strikes are therefore aimed at the hands and arms, hoping to break the hand holding the weapon, or cut the nerves and tendons controlling it (the concept of \"defanging the snake\").",
              "Strike to the eyes and legs are also important.",
              "This is summed up in a popular mnemonic: \"Stick seeks bone, blade seeks flesh\".",
              "Mano Mano is the empty-hand component of Filipino martial arts, particularly Arnis.",
              "The term translates as \"hands\" or \"hand-[to]-hand\" and comes from the Spanish mano (\"hand\").",
              "It is also known as suntukan or panununtukan in Luzon and pangamot in the Visayas, as well as De Cadena, Cadena de Mano or Arnis de Mano in some FMA systems. American colonists referred to it as \"combat judo\" or \"Filipino boxing\".",
              "Mano mano moves include kicking, punching, locking, throwing, and dumog (grappling).",
              "Filipino martial artists regard empty hands as another weapon, and all movements of Mano Mano are directly based on weapon techniques.",
              "In Arnis, weapons are seen as extensions of the body, so training with weapons naturally leads to proficiency in bare-handed combat.",
              "For this reason, Mano Mano is often taught in higher grades after weapons training has been mastered, as advanced students are expected to be able to apply experience with weapons to unarmed fighting.",
              "This not always the case though, as some systems of Arnis start with (and at times only consist of) empty hands fighting.",
              "Some notable masters of Mano Mano include: Paninipa, Pagsipa, Pananadiyak, Pagtadiyak, and Sikaran (all terms for \"kicking\" in various regions, dialects and styles) are components of eskrima that focus on knees, tripping, low-line kicks, and stomps.",
              "Pananjakman is also a term used in Filipino-American-developed and Western FMA systems, usually referring to the system from the Lucky Lucaylucay, Floro Villabrille and Dan Inosanto blend lineage.",
              "Except for the distinct style of Sikaran from the Baras area of the province of Rizal, which also uses high kicks, kicking as a separate art is never taught by itself in the Philippines, and this practice is only done in the West with Pananjakman.",
              "Pananjakman is usually taught together with Panantukan.",
              "Paninipa can be regarded as the study of leg muscles and bones and how they are connected, with the goal of either inflicting pain or outright breaking or dislocating the bones.",
              "Most striking techniques involve applying pressure to bend the target areas in unnatural ways so as to injure or break them.",
              "Such pressure may be delivered in the form of a heel smash, a toe kick, a stomp, or a knee.",
              "Targets include the groin, thighs, knees, shins, ankles, feet and toes.",
              "The upper body is used only for defensive maneuvers, making pananadiyak ideal for when combatants are engaged in a clinch.",
              "When used effectively, the strikes can bring an opponent to the ground or otherwise end an altercation by making them too weak to stand.",
              "Fundamental techniques include kicking or smashing the ankle to force it either towards or away from the opposite foot (severe supination or pronation, respectively), heel-stomping the top of the foot where it meets the lower leg so as to break or crush the numerous bones or otherwise disrupt the opponent's balance, and smashing the opponents knee from the side to break the knee (with severe supination and pronation as the desired result).",
              "Several classes of exercises, such as sombrada, contrada, sinawali, hubud-lubud and sequidas, initially presented to the public as a set of organized drills by the Inosanto school, are expressly designed to allow partners to move quickly and experiment with variations while remaining safe.",
              "For example, in a sumbrada drill, one partner feeds an attack, which the other counters, flowing into a counterattack, which is then countered, flowing into a counterattack, and so on.",
              "The hubud-lubud or hubad-lubad from Doce Pares is frequently used as a type of \"generator\" drill, where one is forced to act and think fast.",
              "Initially, students learn a specific series of attacks, counters, and counter-attacks.",
              "As they advance they can add minor variations, change the footwork, or switch to completely different attacks;",
              "eventually the exercise becomes almost completely free-form.",
              "Palakaw, from the Balintawak style, are un-choreographed and random defensive and offensive moves.",
              "Palakaw in Cebuano means a walk-through or rehearsing the different strike angles and defenses.",
              "It may be known as corridas, or striking without any order or pattern.",
              "Disarms, take-downs, and other techniques usually break the flow of such a drill, but they are usually initiated from such a sequence of movements to force the student to adapt to a variety of situations.",
              "A common practice is to begin a drill with each student armed with two weapons.",
              "Once the drill is flowing, if a student sees an opportunity to disarm their opponent, they do, but the drill continues until both students are empty-handed.",
              "Some drills use only a single weapon per pair, and the partners take turns disarming each other.",
              "Seguidas drills, taken from the San Miguel system, are sets of hitting and movement patterns usually involving stick and dagger.",
              "Rhythm, while an essential part of eskrima drills, is emphasized more in the United States and Europe, where a regular beat serves a guide for students to follow.",
              "To ensure safety, participants perform most drills at a constant pace, which they increase as they progress.",
              "The rhythm, together with the southern Filipino attire of a vest and sashed pants, is commonly mistaken for some sort of tradition when practising eskrima in the Philippines \u2013 perhaps incorrectly derived from traditional rhythm-based dances or an attempt to add a sense of ethnicity.",
              "Eskrima is usually practised in the Philippines without a rhythm, off-beat or out of rhythm.",
              "The diversity of Filipino martial arts means that there is no officially established standard uniform in eskrima.",
              "The live hand (or alive hand) is the opposite hand of the practitioner that does not contain the main weapon.",
              "The heavy usage of the live hand is an important concept and distinguishing hallmark of eskrima.",
              "Even (or especially) when empty, the live hand can be used as a companion weapon by eskrima practitioners.",
              "As opposed to most weapon systems like fencing where the off-hand is hidden and not used to prevent it from being hit, eskrima actively uses the live hand for trapping, locking, supporting weapon blocks, checking, disarming, striking and controlling the opponent.",
              "The usage of the live hand is one of the most evident examples of how Eskrima's method of starting with weapons training leads to effective empty hand techniques.",
              "Because of Doble Baston (double weapons) or Espada y Daga (sword and parrying dagger) ambidextrous weapon muscle memory conditioning, Eskrima practitioners find it easy to use the off-hand actively once they transition from using it with a weapon to an empty hand.",
              "Doble baston, and less frequently doble olisi, are common names for a group of techniques involving two sticks.",
              "The art is more commonly known around the world as Sinawali meaning \"to weave\".",
              "The term Sinawali is taken from a matting called sawali that is commonly used in the tribal Nipa Huts.",
              "It is made up of woven pieces of palm leaf and used for both flooring and walls.",
              "This technique requires the user to use both left and right weapons in an equal manner;",
              "many co-ordination drills are used to help the practitioner become more ambidextrous.",
              "It is the section of the art that is taught mainly at the intermediate levels and above and is considered one of the most important areas of learning in the art.",
              "Sinawali refers to the activity of \"weaving\", as applied Eskrima with reference to a set of two-person, two-weapon exercises.",
              "The term comes from \"Sawali\", the woven material that typically forms the walls of nipa huts.",
              "Sinawali exercises provide eskrima practitioners with basic skills and motions relevant to a mode of two-weapon blocking and response method called Doblete.",
              "Sinawali training is often introduced to novices to help them develop certain fundamental skills \u2013 including: body positioning and distance relative to an opponent, rotation of the body and the proper turning radius, recognition of one's center of gravity, eye\u2013hand coordination, target perception and recognition, increased ambidexterity, recognition and performance of rhythmic structures for upper body movement, and muscular developments important to the art, especially, the wrist and forearm regions.",
              "It helps teach the novice eskrimador proper positioning while swinging a weapon.",
              "The Chinese and Malay communities of the Philippines have practiced eskrima together with Kuntaw and Silat for centuries, so much so that many North Americans mistakenly believe silat to have originated in the Philippines.",
              "Some of the modern styles, particularly doce pares and Modern Arnis contain some elements of Japanese Martial Arts such as joint locks, throws, blocks, strikes, and groundwork, taken from: Jujutsu, Judo, Aikido and Karate as some of the founders obtained black belt Dan grades in some of these systems. Some eskrima styles are complementary with Chinese Wing Chun because of the nervous system conditioning and body mechanics when striking, twirling or swinging sticks.",
              "In Western countries, it is common to practice eskrima in conjunction with other martial arts, particularly Wing Chun, Jeet Kune Do and silat.",
              "As a result, there is some confusion between styles, systems, and lineage, because some people cross-train without giving due credit to the founders or principles of their arts.",
              "For example, American Kenpo and Kajukenbo cross-training traces back to the interactions between Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants in territorial/pre-statehood Hawaii, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the United States.",
              "In the United States the cross-training between eskrima and Jeet Kune Do Concepts as headed by Dan Inosanto of the Inosanto Academy in Marina del Rey, California, goes according to the maxim \"Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless\".",
              "Proponents of such training say the arts are very similar in many aspects and complement each other well.",
              "It has become marketable to offer eskrima classes in other traditional Asian martial arts studios in America but some practitioners of other eskrima styles often dismiss these lessons as debased versions of original training methods."

              "Triangular Footwork.",
              "The triangular footwork came from the stick\u2019s dynamics of movement as a weapon.",
              "One way to best illustrate is to draw the triangle footwork is a square-shaped box marked with an \u201cX\u201d inside it thus dividing the box into four joined triangles.",

              "The top diagonal lines that resemble a \u201cV\u201d will represent the directions to take on the left side or right side of the enemy.",
              "If the enemy is performing a forehand horizontal strike using a stick from right to left, then moving forward left of the \u201cV\u201d indicates jamming the weapon, thus discontinuing it on its track before gaining momentum.",
              "However, moving forward right of the \u201cV\u201d would indicate flowing along with the movement of the weapon until it reached in a zero-pressure area where it had already released much of the force.",
              "The lower diagonal lines that resemble an upside-down of the \u201cV\u201d will represent evasion, thus avoiding destruction by evading the business end of the stick of your opponent.",

              "[citation needed] One of the most important practices in classical Arnis was dueling, without any form of protection.",
              "The matches were preceded by cock-fighting and could be held in any open space, sometimes in a specially constructed enclosure.",
              "Arnisadores believe this tradition pre-dates the colonial period, pointing to similar practices of kickboxing matches in mainland Indochina as evidence.",
              "Spanish records tell of such dueling areas where cock-fights took place.",
              "The founders of most of the popular Arnis systems were famous duelists and legends circulate about how many opponents they killed.",

              "The most common system used internationally is that of the WEKAF (World Eskrima Kali Arnis Federation), established 1989.",
              "The earlier Arnis Philippines[73] (ARPI) system, established in 1986, was most prominently used during the 2005 Southeast Asian Games.",
              "Arnis students start their instruction by learning to fight with weapons, and only advance to empty-hand training once the stick and knife techniques have been sufficiently mastered.",
              "This is in contrast to most other well-known Asian martial arts but it is justified by the principle that bare-handed moves are acquired naturally through the same exercises as the weapon techniques, making muscle memory an important aspect of the teaching.",
              "It is also based on the obvious fact that an armed person who is trained has the advantage over a trained unarmed person, and serves to condition students to fight against armed assailants.",
              "Most systems of Arnis apply a single set of techniques for the stick, knife, and empty hands, a concept sometimes referred to as motion grouping.",
              "Since the weapon is seen as simply an extension of the body, the same angles and footwork are used either with or without a weapon.",
              "The reason for this is probably historical, because tribal warriors went into battle armed and only resorted to bare-handed fighting after losing their weapons.",
              "Many systems begin training with two weapons, either a pair of sticks or a stick and a wooden knife.",
              "These styles emphasise keeping both hands full and never moving them in the same direction, and trains practitioners to become ambidextrous.",
              "For example, one stick may strike the head while the other hits the arm.",
              "Such training develops the ability to use both limbs independently, a valuable skill, even when working with a single weapon.",
              "A core concept and distinct feature of Filipino martial arts is the Live Hand.",
              "Even when as a practitioner wields only one weapon, the extra hand is used to control, trap or disarm an opponent's weapon and to aid in blocking, joint locking and manipulation of the opponent or other simultaneous motions such as bicep destruction with the live hand.",
              "The most basic and common weapon in Arnis is the baston or yantok.",
              "They are typically constructed from rattan, an inexpensive stem from a type of Southeast Asian vine.",
              "Hard and durable yet lightweight, it shreds only under the worst abuse and does not splinter like wood, making it a safer training tool.",
              "This aspect makes it useful in defense against blades.",
              "Kamagong (ironwood or ebony) and bahi (heart of the palm) are sometimes used after being charred and hardened.",
              "These hardwoods are generally not used for sparring, however, as they are dense enough to cause serious injury, but traditional sparring does not include weapon to body contact.",
              "The participants are skilled enough to parry and counterstrike, showing respect in not intentionally hitting the training partner.",
              "In modern times, many Arnis practitioners have also come to wear head and hand protection while sparring with rattan sticks, or otherwise use padded bastons.",
              "Some modern schools also use sticks made out of aluminium or other metals, or modern high-impact plastics.",
              "Baraw is a Cebuano term used in eskrima that means knife or dagger.",
              "The term Baraw is more commonly used on the Cebu Island in the Visayan region whereas other islands and regions more commonly use the term Daga but both terms are often interchangeable within the Filipino martial arts community.",
              "The terms Baraw and Daga can be used either as Solo Baraw or Solo Daga associated with single knife fighting and defense systems, Doble Baraw or Doble Daga associated with the double knife fighting systems or even with a combination of long and short weapons e.",
              "g. stick and dagger fighting systems Olisi Baraw or sword and dagger fighting systems Espada y Daga.",
              "The practitioners must conform to criteria based on the number of years of training and level of proficiency in technical skills.",
              "Practitioners are screened by the rank promotion committee to determine their rank in the grading system.",
              "Most systems recognize that the technical nature of combat changes drastically as the distance between opponents changes, and generally classify the ranges into at least three categories.",
              "Each range has its characteristic techniques and footwork.",
              "Of course, some systems place more emphasis on certain ranges than others, but almost all recognize that being able to work in and control any range is essential.",
              "The Balintawak style for example, uses long-, medium- and short-range fighting techniques, but focuses on the short-range.",
              "To control the range, and for numerous other purposes, good footwork is essential.",
              "Most eskrima systems explain their footwork in terms of triangles: normally when moving in any direction two feet occupy two corners of the triangle and the step is to the third corner such that no leg crosses the other at any time.",
              "The shape and size of the triangle must be adapted to the particular situation.",
              "The style of footwork and the standing position vary greatly from school to school and from practitioner to practitioner.",
              "For a very traditional school, conscious of battlefield necessities, stances are usually very low, often with one knee on the ground, and footwork is complex, involving many careful cross-steps to allow practitioners to cope with multiple opponents.",
              "The Villabrille and San Miguel styles are usually taught in this way.",
              "Systems that have been adapted to duels or sporting matches generally employ simpler footwork, focusing on a single opponent.",
              "North American schools tend to use much more upright stances, as this puts less stress on the legs, but there are some exceptions.",
              "Many systems, including the Inosanto/Lacosta system of escrima/kali recognize and teach 3 basic ranges: long range (largo), medium range (medio) and short range (corto).",
              "The long range is typically defined as being able to hit the opponents lead/weapon hand with your weapon/stick only.",
              "Medium range is where you are able to strike the opponent's body/head with your weapon/stick while also checking/monitoring the opponent's lead hand with your rear/live hand.",
              "And the short range is when you can strike the opponent's body/head with your rear/live hand or being able to strike the opponent's head/body with the hilt/punyo end of the weapon/stick.",
              "Some styles or systems may also define a closer range for elbows to the head or body, or grappling.",
              "Many Filipino systems focus on defending against and/or reacting to angles of attack rather than particular strikes.",
              "The theory behind this is that virtually all types of hand-to-hand attacks (barehanded or with a weapon) hit or reach a combatant via these angles of attack and the reasoning is that it is more efficient to learn to defend against different angles of attack rather than learn to defend against particular styles, particular techniques or particular weapons.",
              "For instance, the technique for defending against an attack angle that comes overhead from the right is very similar whether the attacker uses bare fists, a knife, a sword or a spear.",
              "Older styles gave each angle a name, but more recent systems tend to simply number them.",
              "Many systems have twelve standard angles, though some have as few as 5, and others as many as 72.",
              "Although the exact angles, the order they are numbered in (numerado), and the way the player executes moves vary from system to system, most are based upon Filipino cosmology.",
              "These standard angles describe exercises.",
              "To aid memorization, player often practise a standard series of strikes from these angles, called an abecedario (Spanish for \"alphabet\").",
              "These are beginner strikes or the \"ABC's\" of Arnis.",
              "While most systems do incorporate a numbering system for the angles of attack, not all use the same numbering system, so always get clarification before training in a new system or style.",
              "Additionally, while the angles are numbered for ease of discussion, the numbers do not generally define how the attack is thrown.",
              "That is to say, usually (excluding thrusts) a #1 angle, means an attack that starts on the right side of the practitioner and comes down at about a 45\u00b0 from right to left.",
              "But, it does not matter whether this is done with the right or left hand (forehand or backhand) or if the hit continues through the target or returns back along the same line.",
              "Some angles of attack and some strikes have characteristic names: Many Arnis techniques have Spanish names, because Spanish was the lingua franca spoken during colonial times among the natives, who spoke over 170 languages across 7,600 islands.",
              "Arnis techniques are generally based on the assumption that both student and opponent are very highly trained and well prepared.",
              "Thus, Arnis tends to favour extreme caution, always considering the possibility of a failed technique or an unexpected knife.",
              "On the other hand, the practitioner is assumed to be capable of quick, precise strikes.",
              "The general principle is that an opponent's ability to attack should be destroyed rather than trying to injure and convince them to stop.",
              "Many strikes are therefore aimed at the hands and arms, hoping to break the hand holding the weapon, or cut the nerves and tendons controlling it (the concept of \"defanging the snake\").",
              "Strike to the eyes and legs are also important.",
              "This is summed up in a popular mnemonic: \"Stick seeks bone, blade seeks flesh\".",
              "Mano Mano is the empty-hand component of Filipino martial arts, particularly Arnis.",
              "The term translates as \"hands\" or \"hand-[to]-hand\" and comes from the Spanish mano (\"hand\").",
              "It is also known as suntukan or panununtukan in Luzon and pangamot in the Visayas, as well as De Cadena, Cadena de Mano or Arnis de Mano in some FMA systems. American colonists referred to it as \"combat judo\" or \"Filipino boxing\".",
              "Mano mano moves include kicking, punching, locking, throwing, and dumog (grappling).",
              "Filipino martial artists regard empty hands as another weapon, and all movements of Mano Mano are directly based on weapon techniques.",
              "In Arnis, weapons are seen as extensions of the body, so training with weapons naturally leads to proficiency in bare-handed combat.",
              "For this reason, Mano Mano is often taught in higher grades after weapons training has been mastered, as advanced students are expected to be able to apply experience with weapons to unarmed fighting.",
              "This not always the case though, as some systems of Arnis start with (and at times only consist of) empty hands fighting.",
              "Some notable masters of Mano Mano include: Paninipa, Pagsipa, Pananadiyak, Pagtadiyak, and Sikaran (all terms for \"kicking\" in various regions, dialects and styles) are components of eskrima that focus on knees, tripping, low-line kicks, and stomps.",
              "Pananjakman is also a term used in Filipino-American-developed and Western FMA systems, usually referring to the system from the Lucky Lucaylucay, Floro Villabrille and Dan Inosanto blend lineage.",
              "Except for the distinct style of Sikaran from the Baras area of the province of Rizal, which also uses high kicks, kicking as a separate art is never taught by itself in the Philippines, and this practice is only done in the West with Pananjakman.",
              "Pananjakman is usually taught together with Panantukan.",
              "Paninipa can be regarded as the study of leg muscles and bones and how they are connected, with the goal of either inflicting pain or outright breaking or dislocating the bones.",
              "Most striking techniques involve applying pressure to bend the target areas in unnatural ways so as to injure or break them.",
              "Such pressure may be delivered in the form of a heel smash, a toe kick, a stomp, or a knee.",
              "Targets include the groin, thighs, knees, shins, ankles, feet and toes.",
              "The upper body is used only for defensive maneuvers, making pananadiyak ideal for when combatants are engaged in a clinch.",
              "When used effectively, the strikes can bring an opponent to the ground or otherwise end an altercation by making them too weak to stand.",
              "Fundamental techniques include kicking or smashing the ankle to force it either towards or away from the opposite foot (severe supination or pronation, respectively), heel-stomping the top of the foot where it meets the lower leg so as to break or crush the numerous bones or otherwise disrupt the opponent's balance, and smashing the opponents knee from the side to break the knee (with severe supination and pronation as the desired result).",
              "Several classes of exercises, such as sombrada, contrada, sinawali, hubud-lubud and sequidas, initially presented to the public as a set of organized drills by the Inosanto school, are expressly designed to allow partners to move quickly and experiment with variations while remaining safe.",
              "For example, in a sumbrada drill, one partner feeds an attack, which the other counters, flowing into a counterattack, which is then countered, flowing into a counterattack, and so on.",
              "The hubud-lubud or hubad-lubad from Doce Pares is frequently used as a type of \"generator\" drill, where one is forced to act and think fast.",
              "Initially, students learn a specific series of attacks, counters, and counter-attacks.",
              "As they advance they can add minor variations, change the footwork, or switch to completely different attacks;",
              "eventually the exercise becomes almost completely free-form.",
              "Palakaw, from the Balintawak style, are un-choreographed and random defensive and offensive moves.",
              "Palakaw in Cebuano means a walk-through or rehearsing the different strike angles and defenses.",
              "It may be known as corridas, or striking without any order or pattern.",
              "Disarms, take-downs, and other techniques usually break the flow of such a drill, but they are usually initiated from such a sequence of movements to force the student to adapt to a variety of situations.",
              "A common practice is to begin a drill with each student armed with two weapons.",
              "Once the drill is flowing, if a student sees an opportunity to disarm their opponent, they do, but the drill continues until both students are empty-handed.",
              "Some drills use only a single weapon per pair, and the partners take turns disarming each other.",
              "Seguidas drills, taken from the San Miguel system, are sets of hitting and movement patterns usually involving stick and dagger.",
              "Rhythm, while an essential part of eskrima drills, is emphasized more in the United States and Europe, where a regular beat serves a guide for students to follow.",
              "To ensure safety, participants perform most drills at a constant pace, which they increase as they progress.",
              "The rhythm, together with the southern Filipino attire of a vest and sashed pants, is commonly mistaken for some sort of tradition when practising eskrima in the Philippines \u2013 perhaps incorrectly derived from traditional rhythm-based dances or an attempt to add a sense of ethnicity.",
              "Eskrima is usually practised in the Philippines without a rhythm, off-beat or out of rhythm.",
              "The diversity of Filipino martial arts means that there is no officially established standard uniform in eskrima.",
              "The live hand (or alive hand) is the opposite hand of the practitioner that does not contain the main weapon.",
              "The heavy usage of the live hand is an important concept and distinguishing hallmark of eskrima.",
              "Even (or especially) when empty, the live hand can be used as a companion weapon by eskrima practitioners.",
              "As opposed to most weapon systems like fencing where the off-hand is hidden and not used to prevent it from being hit, eskrima actively uses the live hand for trapping, locking, supporting weapon blocks, checking, disarming, striking and controlling the opponent.",
              "The usage of the live hand is one of the most evident examples of how Eskrima's method of starting with weapons training leads to effective empty hand techniques.",
              "Because of Doble Baston (double weapons) or Espada y Daga (sword and parrying dagger) ambidextrous weapon muscle memory conditioning, Eskrima practitioners find it easy to use the off-hand actively once they transition from using it with a weapon to an empty hand.",
              "Doble baston, and less frequently doble olisi, are common names for a group of techniques involving two sticks.",
              "The art is more commonly known around the world as Sinawali meaning \"to weave\".",
              "The term Sinawali is taken from a matting called sawali that is commonly used in the tribal Nipa Huts.",
              "It is made up of woven pieces of palm leaf and used for both flooring and walls.",
              "This technique requires the user to use both left and right weapons in an equal manner;",
              "many co-ordination drills are used to help the practitioner become more ambidextrous.",
              "It is the section of the art that is taught mainly at the intermediate levels and above and is considered one of the most important areas of learning in the art.",
              "Sinawali refers to the activity of \"weaving\", as applied Eskrima with reference to a set of two-person, two-weapon exercises.",
              "The term comes from \"Sawali\", the woven material that typically forms the walls of nipa huts.",
              "Sinawali exercises provide eskrima practitioners with basic skills and motions relevant to a mode of two-weapon blocking and response method called Doblete.",
              "Sinawali training is often introduced to novices to help them develop certain fundamental skills \u2013 including: body positioning and distance relative to an opponent, rotation of the body and the proper turning radius, recognition of one's center of gravity, eye\u2013hand coordination, target perception and recognition, increased ambidexterity, recognition and performance of rhythmic structures for upper body movement, and muscular developments important to the art, especially, the wrist and forearm regions.",
              "It helps teach the novice eskrimador proper positioning while swinging a weapon.",
              "The Chinese and Malay communities of the Philippines have practiced eskrima together with Kuntaw and Silat for centuries, so much so that many North Americans mistakenly believe silat to have originated in the Philippines.",
              "Some of the modern styles, particularly doce pares and Modern Arnis contain some elements of Japanese Martial Arts such as joint locks, throws, blocks, strikes, and groundwork, taken from: Jujutsu, Judo, Aikido and Karate as some of the founders obtained black belt Dan grades in some of these systems. Some eskrima styles are complementary with Chinese Wing Chun because of the nervous system conditioning and body mechanics when striking, twirling or swinging sticks.",
              "In Western countries, it is common to practice eskrima in conjunction with other martial arts, particularly Wing Chun, Jeet Kune Do and silat.",
              "As a result, there is some confusion between styles, systems, and lineage, because some people cross-train without giving due credit to the founders or principles of their arts.",
              "For example, American Kenpo and Kajukenbo cross-training traces back to the interactions between Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants in territorial/pre-statehood Hawaii, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the United States.",
              "In the United States the cross-training between eskrima and Jeet Kune Do Concepts as headed by Dan Inosanto of the Inosanto Academy in Marina del Rey, California, goes according to the maxim \"Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless\".",
              "Proponents of such training say the arts are very similar in many aspects and complement each other well.",
              "It has become marketable to offer eskrima classes in other traditional Asian martial arts studios in America but some practitioners of other eskrima styles often dismiss these lessons as debased versions of original training methods."

              "We can\u2019t promise any martial arts, but there\u2019s plenty of exciting physical activities to test your mettle.",
              "Arnis was developed by the indigenous populations of the Philippines, who used an assorted range of weaponry for combat and self-defense.",
              "Encompassing both simple impact and edged weapons, arnis traditionally involved rattan, swords, daggers and spears.",
              "In 1521, equipped with nothing more than bladed weapons and their fearsome arnis abilities, Filipino islanders defeated Ferdinand Magellan\u2019s armored, musket-bearing Spanish conquistador forces when they tried to invade.",
              "See privacy policy.",
              "When the Spanish eventually returned and successfully conquered parts of the Philippines, the traditions of arnis were preserved, despite its prohibition, in the forms of ritual dance, performance and mock battles.",
              "While earlier Filipino martial arts were influenced by Spanish colonization, the modern forms have been affected by the country\u2019s contact with both the United States and Japan after gaining independence in 1898.",
              "Just over a century later, in 2009, the government of the Philippines declared arnis to be the martial art and national sport of the Philippines.",
              "Arnis is otherwise known as eskrima, kali and garrote, and by even more names in different Filipino regional languages.",
              "Although Spanish influence had a pacifying effect on Filipino martial culture, the original warrior ethos has persisted and remains on the fringes of the art.",

              "Wiley explains in Filipino Martial Culture, they still take place in private today.",
              "The Philippine government\u2019s declaration of arnis as the national sport has codified a clear martial culture.",
              "This should begin to develop an accessible story of Filipino cultural heritage that the outside world can grasp, like Japan did during the Edo period (1603-1868) and as post-cultural revolution China has done with Wushu.",
              "While we\u2019re not yet travelling to the Philippines, if the idea of summiting mountains, and trekking through the jungles of northern Thailand sound like your thing, you\u2019re in luck.",
              "Our 10-day Northern Thailand Epic Trip delivers jaw-dropping landscapes, heart-racing activities and authentic eats.",
              "Like all martial arts, arnis is primarily defensive, encompassing hand-to-hand combat, grappling and disarming techniques.",
              "However, the fighting style also includes the use of bladed weapons and sticks, in addition to improvised weapons.",
              "A baton-like cane is the primary melee tool employed and the weapon used in officiated arnis competitions.",
              "Competitive Arnis generally takes one of two forms: the performance-based anyo model or the combative leban.",
              "Anyo competitions are judged on the basis of the overall choreography of the performances, including the gracefulness, strength and force employed.",
              "Meanwhile, the leban form tests participants\u2019 agility and reactions, as competitions are judged based on the number of strikes inflicted.",
              "Although most leban competitions exclude body contact, such as grappling, blocks and disarming an opponent using the hands or feet, there are some exceptions where full contact is permitted.",
              "Close-quartered, fast-paced fights look great on screen and no martial style involves quite the combative speed of arnis\u2014no wonder it\u2019s so popular with Hollywood directors.",
              "The Bourne Identity (2002) features a kali/jeet kune do hybrid fight style when Jason Bourne encounters Jarda, the only other living agent of the terminated \u2018Treadstone\u2019 program.",

              "Arnis, also known as kali or eskrima/escrima, is the national martial art of the Philippines.",
              "[3] The three are roughly interchangeable umbrella terms for the traditional martial arts of the Philippines (\"Filipino Martial Arts\", or FMA), which emphasize weapon-based fighting with sticks, knives, bladed weapons, and various improvised weapons, as well as \"open hand\" techniques without weapons.",
              "There have been campaigns for arnis to be nominated in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, along with other Philippine martial arts.",
              "As of 2018, UNESCO has inscribed nine martial-arts\u2013related intangible heritages.",
              "[4] Arnis comes from arne\u0301s,[5] the Old Spanish for \"armour\" (harness is an archaic English term from same root).",
              "It is said to derive from the armour costumes used in traditional Moro-moro stage plays, where actors fought mock battles with wooden swords.",
              "[6][unreliable source?]",
              "Arnes is also an archaic Spanish term for weapon, used as early as 1712.",
              "[7] Eskrima (also spelled escrima) is a derived from the Spanish word for fencing, esgrima.",
              "[8][9] Their cognate in French is escrime and is related to the English term 'skirmish'.",
              "The name kali is most likely derived from the pre-Hispanic Filipino term for blades and fencing, kalis (Spanish spelling: \"calis\"),[10] documented by Ferdinand Magellan's expedition chronicler Antonio Pigafetta during their journey through the Visayas and in old Spanish to Filipino Mother Tongue dictionaries and vocabulary books dating from 1612 to the late 1800s, such as in Vocabulario de Lengua Tagala by Fr.",
              "Pedro de San Buenaventura.",
              "[11] The term calis in various forms was present in these old Spanish documents in Ilocano,[12] Ibanag (calli-t;",

              "[21] In some of these dictionaries, the term calis refers to a sword or knife kris or keris, while in others it refers to both swords and knives and their usage as well as a form of esgrima stick fighting.",
              "[14][15] While Mirafuente posits that the original term was kali and that the letter \"S\" was added later, the late Grandmaster Remy Presas suggests that the \"S\" was dropped in modern times and became presently more known as kali in FMA circles.",
              "There exist numerous similar terms of reference for martial arts such as kalirongan, kaliradman, and pagkalikali.",
              "[22] These may be the origin of the term kali or they may have evolved from it.",

              "Ned Nepangue and Celestino Macachor contend that the term kali in reference to Filipino martial arts did not exist until the Buenaventura Mirafuente wrote in the preface of the first known published book on arnis, Mga Karunungan sa Larong Arnis by Placido Yambao, the term kali as the native mother fighting art of the Philippine islands.",
              "[24] Practitioners of the arts are called arnisador (male, plural arnisadores) and arnisadora (female, plural arnisadoras) for those who call theirs arnis, eskrimador (male, plural eskrimadores) or eskrimadora (female, plural eskrimadoras) for those who call their art eskrima, and kalista or mangangali for those who practise kali.",

              "The havoc caused by the arquebuse, and their own lack of honor, make them seek refuge in flight, and give obedience to our orders.",
              "As arnis was an art usually practiced by the poor or commoner class (as opposed to nobility or warrior classes), most practitioners lacked the scholarly education to create any kind of written record.",
              "While the same can be said of many martial arts, this is especially true for arnis because almost all of its history is anecdotal, oral or promotional.",
              "The origin of arnis can be traced back to native \"Pintados\" or then \"Tintadus\" fighting techniques during conflicts among the various Prehispanic Filipino tribes or kingdoms, though the current form has Spanish influence from old fencing which originated in Spain in the 15th century.",
              "It has other influences as well, as settlers and traders travelling through the Malay Archipelago brought the influence of silat as well as Chinese and Indian martial arts.",
              "[27][page needed][28][page needed] Some of the population still practise localized Chinese fighting methods known as kuntaw.",
              "It has also been theorized that the Filipino art of arnis may have roots in India and came to the Philippines via people who traveled through Indonesia and Malaysia to the Philippine islands.",
              "Silambam, a stick/staff-based ancient martial art of India influenced many martial arts in Asia like silat.",
              "As such, arnis may share ancestry with these systems \u2013 some arnis moves are similar to the short stick (kali or kaji) and other weapon based fighting styles of Silambam.",
              "When the Spaniards first arrived in the Philippines, they already observed weapons-based martial arts practised by the natives, which may or may not be related to present-day Arnis.",
              "The earliest written records of Filipino culture and life, including martial arts, come from the first Spanish explorers.",
              "Some early expeditions fought native tribesmen armed with sticks and knives.",
              "[29] In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan was killed in Cebu at the Battle of Mactan by the forces of Datu Lapulapu, the chief of Mactan.",
              "Some Arnisadors hold that Lapulapu's men killed Magellan in a sword-fight, though historical evidence proves otherwise.",
              "The only eyewitness account of the battle by chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, tells that Magellan was stabbed in the face and the arm with spears and overwhelmed by multiple warriors who hacked and stabbed at him: The natives continued to pursue us, and picking up the same spear four or six times, hurled it at us again and again.",
              "Recognizing the captain, so many turned upon him that they knocked his helmet off his head twice, but he always stood firmly like a good knight, together with some others.",
              "Thus did we fight for more than one hour, refusing to retire farther.",
              "An Indian hurled a bamboo spear into the captain's face, but the latter immediately killed him with his lance, which he left in the Indian's body.",
              "Then, trying to lay hand on sword, he could draw it out but halfway, because he had been wounded in the arm with a bamboo spear.",
              "When the natives saw that, they all hurled themselves upon him.",
              "One of them wounded him on the left leg with a large cutlass, which resembles a scimitar, only being larger.",
              "That caused the captain to fall face downward, when immediately they rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their cutlasses, until they killed our mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true guide.",
              "When they wounded him, he turned back many times to see whether we were all in the boats.",
              "Thereupon, beholding him dead, we, wounded, retreated, as best we could, to the boats, which were already pulling off.",
              "[30] Due to the conflict-ridden nature of the Philippine archipelago, where port-kingdoms (Kedatuans, Rajahnates and Sultanates) were often at war with one another or raiding each other, warriors were forged in the many wars in the islands, thus during the precolonial era, the geographical area acquired a reputation for its capable mercenaries, which were soon employed all across South, Southeast and East Asia.",
              "Lucoes (warriors from Luzon) aided the Burmese king in his invasion of Siam in 1547 AD.",
              "At the same time, Lusung warriors fought alongside the Siamese king and faced the same elephant army of the Burmese king in the defense of the Siamese capital at Ayuthaya.",
              "[31] The former sultan of Malacca decided to retake his city from the Portuguese with a fleet of ships from Lusung in 1525 AD.",
              "[32] Lucoes influence even manifested in East Asia at Japan where Lucoes sailors initially guided Portuguese ships to the Shogunate[33] and even South Asia in Sri Lanka where Lungshanoid pottery from Luzon were found in burials there.",
              "[34] Pinto noted that there were a number of them in the Islamic fleets that went to battle with the Portuguese in the Philippines during the 16th century.",
              "The Sultan of Aceh as well as Suleiman, the Ottoman Commander who was brother of the Viceroy of Cairo, gave one of them (Sapetu Diraja) the task of ruling and holding Aru (northeast Sumatra) in 1540.",
              "Pinto also says one was named leader of the Malays remaining in the Moluccas Islands after the Portuguese conquest in 1511.",
              "[35] Pigafetta notes that one of them was in command of the Brunei fleet in 1521.",
              "[31] One famous Lucoes is Regimo de Raja, who was appointed by the Portuguese at Malacca as Temenggung (Jawi: \u062a\u0645\u06a0\u0762\u0648\u06a0 [36]) or Supreme Governor and Chief General.",
              "The Luzones were so commercially and militarily influential that the Portuguese soldier Joao de Barros considered them, \"the most warlike and valiant of these parts.\"",
              "[37] Opinions differ on the degree to which Spanish rule in the Philippines affected Arnis.",
              "The fact that a large number of techniques and the names of the arts themselves (arnis/arnes, eskrima/esgrima, garrote, estoque, etc.)",
              "have Spanish names suggest an influence.",
              "Some argue though that Spanish names in the martial art simply reflect the fact that Spanish was the lingua franca of the Philippines until the early 20th century, and that actual Spanish martial influence was limited.",
              "What is certain is that the Spaniards brought with them and used their bladed weapon arts (including the system of Destreza developed by Carranza) when they started colonizing the archipelago in the 16th century.",
              "What is also known is that the Spaniards recruited soldiers from Mexico[38] and Peru[39] and sent them to fortify the Philippines and they had also trained mercenaries and warriors from local people like the Pangasinenses, Kapampangans, Tagalogs, Ilonggos, Cebuanos and Warays to pacify regions and put down revolts.",
              "Of the Kapampangans, Fray Casimiro Di\u0301az relates in 1718: Los primeros que se decidieron a\u0301 experimentar fortuna fueron los pampangos, nacio\u0301n la ma\u0301s belicosa y noble de estas Islas, y cercana a\u0301 Manila.",
              "Y era lo peor hallarse ejercitada en el arte militar en nuestras escuelas en los presidios de Ternate, Zamboanga, Jolo\u0301, Caraga y otras partes, donde se conocio\u0301 bien su valor;",
              "pero este necesita del abrigo del nuestro, y asi\u0301 deci\u0301an que un espan\u0303ol y tres pampangos, vali\u0301an por cuatro espan\u0303oles.",
              "[40] The first who decided to experiment with their fortune (revolt) were the Pampangos, the most warlike and prominent people of these islands, and close to Manila.",
              "And it was all the worse because these people had been trained in the military art in our own schools in the presidios (fortified outposts) of Ternate, Zamboanga, Jolo, Caraga and other places where their valor was well known;",
              "but this needs the help of ours, and so they say that a Spaniard plus three Pampangos equal four Spaniards.",
              "[41] Logic dictates that these native warriors and foreign soldiers would have passed on to very close friends and family members these newly learned skills to augment already existing and effective local ones.",
              "They would have also shared tactics and techniques with each other when placed in the same military group and fighting on the same side in foreign regions such as Formosa, Mindanao, the Moluccas[40] and the Marianas.",
              "[42] One of the more prominent features of Arnis that point to possible Spanish influence is the Espada y Daga (Spanish for \"sword and dagger\") method, a term also used in Spanish fencing.",
              "Filipino espada y daga differs somewhat from European rapier and dagger techniques;",
              "the stances are different as weapons used in Arnis are typically shorter than European swords.",
              "[43] According to Grandmaster Federico Lazo\u2020 (1938\u20132010), unlike in European historical fencing, there is no lunging in the Northern Ilocano Kabaroan style of Arnis \u2013 it is more of an evasive art.",
              "On the other hand, it is present in some Visayan styles documented by FMA researchers Celestino Macachor and Ned Nepangue such as Yasay Sable Estocada from Bago.",
              "[44] Having done comparative studies, Kalis Ilustrisimo archivist Romeo Macapagal also estimates that 40% of the blade-oriented style of Antonio \"Tatang\" Ilustrisimo\u2020 (1904\u20131997) descends from European styles, brought by the Spanish.",
              "[45] After the Spanish colonized the Philippines, a decree was set that prohibited civilians from carrying full-sized swords (such as the Kris and the Kampilan).",
              "Despite this, the practitioners found ways to maintain and keep the arts alive, using sticks made out of rattan rather than swords, as well as small knives wielded like swords.",
              "Some of the arts were passed down from one generation to the other.",
              "Sometimes the art took the form choreographed dances such as the Sakuting stick dance[46] or during mock battles at Moro-moro (Moros y Cristianos) stage plays.",
              "Also as a result, a unique and complex stick-based technique evolved in the Visayas and Luzon regions.",
              "The southern Mindanao retains almost exclusively blade-oriented techniques, as the Spaniards and Americans never fully conquered the southern parts of this island.",
              "[47] Although Arnis combines native fighting techniques with old Spanish fencing and other influences, a degree of systematization was achieved over time, resulting in a distinguishable Philippine martial art.",
              "With time, a system for the teaching of the basics also evolved.",
              "However, with the exception of a few older and more established systems, it was previously common to pass the art from generation to generation in an informal approach.",
              "This has made attempts to trace the lineage of a practitioner difficult.",
              "For example, aside from learning from their family members like his uncle Regino Ilustrisimo, Antonio Ilustrisimo seemed to have learned to fight while sailing around the Philippines, while his cousin and student Floro Villabrille claimed to have been also taught by a blind Moro princess in the mountains;",
              "a claim later refuted by the older Ilustrisimo.",
              "Both have since died.",
              "The Philippines has what is known as a blade culture.",
              "[48][49] Unlike in the West where Medieval and Renaissance combative and self-defense blade arts have gone almost extinct (having devolved into sport fencing with the advent of firearms),[50] blade fighting in the Philippines is a living art.",
              "Local folk in the Philippines are much more likely to carry knives than guns.",
              "They are commonly carried as tools by farmers, used by street vendors to prepare coconuts, pineapples, watermelons, other fruits and meats, and balisongs are cheap to procure in the streets as well as being easily concealed.",
              "In fact, in some areas in the countryside, carrying a farming knife like the itak or bolo was a sign that one was making a living because of the nature of work in those areas.",
              "[51] In the country of Palau, the local term for Filipino is chad ra oles, which literally means \"people of the knife\" because of Filipinos' reputation for carrying knives and using them in fights.",
              "[52] Soldiers and mercenaries trained in the Philippines which were recruited by France which was then in an alliance with Spain, had fought in Cambodia and Vietnam justified by defending newly converted Catholic populations from persecutions and had assisted France in establishing French Cochinchina centered in Saigon.",
              "[53] Also in Asia, at China, during the Taiping Rebellion, Filipinos who were described as Manilamen and were 'Reputed to be brave and fierce fighters' and 'were plentiful in Shanghai and always eager for action' were employed by the Foreign forces as mercenaries to successfully quell the Taiping Rebellion.",
              "[54][55][56][57] In the opposite side of the world at the Americas, descendants of Filipinos were active in the Anti-Imperialist Wars in the Americas.",
              "Filipinos living in Louisiana at the independent settlement of Saint Malo were recruited to be soldiers commanded by Jean Lafitte in the defense of New Orleans during the War of 1812 against a Britain attempting to reconquer a rebel America.",
              "[58] \"Manilamen\" recruited from San Blas together with the Argentinian of French descent, Hypolite Bouchard, joined other nationalities living nearby such as Frenchmen, Mexicans and Americans in the assault of Spanish California during the Argentinian War of Independence.",

              "Isidoro Montes de Oca was a celebrated war hero famous for the battle action of the Treasury of Tamo, in Michoaca\u0301n on September 15, 1818, in which the opposing forces numbered four times greater, yet they were totally destroyed.",
              "[61] Contrary to the view of some modern historians that it was only guns that won the Philippine revolutionaries against the Spaniards, blades also played a large part.",

              "It has a case of five cartridges, which have to be all used before any others can be inserted.",
              "That is, to say, if a soldier has occasion to fire three cartridges he must go on and waste the other two, or else leave himself to meet a possible sudden rush with only two rounds in his rifle.",
              "Perhaps it may be the fault of the men, or their misfortune in being undrilled, but they are often knifed while in the act of reloading their rifles.",
              "Whatever be the explanation there is something wrong in troops with rifles and bayonets being driven steadily back by natives armed with knives.",

              "Americans were first exposed to Arnis during the Philippine\u2013American War in events such as the Balangiga massacre where most of an American company was hacked to death or seriously injured by bolo-wielding guerillas in Balangiga, Eastern Samar \u2013 and in battles in Mindanao, where an American serviceman was decapitated by a Moro warrior even after he emptied his .",

              "It was said that to proclaim a student a \"master\" was considered ridiculous and a virtual death warrant as the individual would become challenged left and right to potentially lethal duels by other Arnisadores looking to make names for themselves.",
              "Belt ranking was a recent addition adopted from Japanese arts such as karate and judo, which had become more popular with Filipinos.",
              "They were added to give structure to the systems, and to be able to compete for the attention of students.",
              "With regards to its spread outside the Philippines, Arnis was brought to Hawaii and California as far back as the 1920s by Filipino migrant workers.",
              "[72] Its teaching was kept strictly within Filipino communities until the late 1960s when masters such as Angel Cabales began teaching it to others.",
              "Even then, instructors teaching Arnis in the 1960s and 70s were often reprimanded by their elders for publicly teaching a part of their culture that had been preserved through secrecy.",
              "The spread of Arnis was helped in Australia through brothers Jeff and Chris Traish, Richard Marlin and Terry Lim (founder of Loong Fu Pai martial arts academy) who also holds a 4th Dan in International Philippine Martial Arts Federation.",
              "In recent years, there has been increased interest in Arnis for its usefulness when defending against knives in street encounters.",
              "As a result, many systems of Arnis have been modified in varying degrees to make them more marketable to a worldwide audience.",
              "Usually this involves increased emphasis on locking, controls, and disarms, focusing mainly on aspects of self-defense.",
              "However, most styles follow the philosophy that the best defense is a good offense.",
              "Modern training methods tend to de-emphasize careful footwork and low stances, stressing the learning of techniques in favor of more direct (and often lethal) tactics designed to instantly end an encounter.",

              "The earlier Arnis Philippines[73] (ARPI) system, established in 1986, was most prominently used during the 2005 Southeast Asian Games.",
              "Arnis students start their instruction by learning to fight with weapons, and only advance to empty-hand training once the stick and knife techniques have been sufficiently mastered.",
              "This is in contrast to most other well-known Asian martial arts but it is justified by the principle that bare-handed moves are acquired naturally through the same exercises as the weapon techniques, making muscle memory an important aspect of the teaching.",
              "It is also based on the obvious fact that an armed person who is trained has the advantage over a trained unarmed person, and serves to condition students to fight against armed assailants.",
              "Most systems of Arnis apply a single set of techniques for the stick, knife, and empty hands, a concept sometimes referred to as motion grouping.",
              "Since the weapon is seen as simply an extension of the body, the same angles and footwork are used either with or without a weapon.",
              "The reason for this is probably historical, because tribal warriors went into battle armed and only resorted to bare-handed fighting after losing their weapons.",
              "Many systems begin training with two weapons, either a pair of sticks or a stick and a wooden knife.",
              "These styles emphasise keeping both hands full and never moving them in the same direction, and trains practitioners to become ambidextrous.",
              "For example, one stick may strike the head while the other hits the arm.",
              "Such training develops the ability to use both limbs independently, a valuable skill, even when working with a single weapon.",
              "A core concept and distinct feature of Filipino martial arts is the Live Hand.",
              "Even when as a practitioner wields only one weapon, the extra hand is used to control, trap or disarm an opponent's weapon and to aid in blocking, joint locking and manipulation of the opponent or other simultaneous motions such as bicep destruction with the live hand.",
              "The most basic and common weapon in Arnis is the baston or yantok.",
              "They are typically constructed from rattan, an inexpensive stem from a type of Southeast Asian vine.",
              "Hard and durable yet lightweight, it shreds only under the worst abuse and does not splinter like wood, making it a safer training tool.",
              "This aspect makes it useful in defense against blades.",
              "Kamagong (ironwood or ebony) and bahi (heart of the palm) are sometimes used after being charred and hardened.",
              "These hardwoods are generally not used for sparring, however, as they are dense enough to cause serious injury, but traditional sparring does not include weapon to body contact.",
              "The participants are skilled enough to parry and counterstrike, showing respect in not intentionally hitting the training partner.",
              "In modern times, many Arnis practitioners have also come to wear head and hand protection while sparring with rattan sticks, or otherwise use padded bastons.",
              "Some modern schools also use sticks made out of aluminium or other metals, or modern high-impact plastics.",
              "Baraw is a Cebuano term used in eskrima that means knife or dagger.",
              "The term Baraw is more commonly used on the Cebu Island in the Visayan region whereas other islands and regions more commonly use the term Daga but both terms are often interchangeable within the Filipino martial arts community.",
              "The terms Baraw and Daga can be used either as Solo Baraw or Solo Daga associated with single knife fighting and defense systems, Doble Baraw or Doble Daga associated with the double knife fighting systems or even with a combination of long and short weapons e.",
              "g. stick and dagger fighting systems Olisi Baraw or sword and dagger fighting systems Espada y Daga.",
              "The practitioners must conform to criteria based on the number of years of training and level of proficiency in technical skills.",
              "Practitioners are screened by the rank promotion committee to determine their rank in the grading system.",
              "Most systems recognize that the technical nature of combat changes drastically as the distance between opponents changes, and generally classify the ranges into at least three categories.",
              "Each range has its characteristic techniques and footwork.",
              "Of course, some systems place more emphasis on certain ranges than others, but almost all recognize that being able to work in and control any range is essential.",
              "The Balintawak style for example, uses long-, medium- and short-range fighting techniques, but focuses on the short-range.",
              "To control the range, and for numerous other purposes, good footwork is essential.",
              "Most eskrima systems explain their footwork in terms of triangles: normally when moving in any direction two feet occupy two corners of the triangle and the step is to the third corner such that no leg crosses the other at any time.",
              "The shape and size of the triangle must be adapted to the particular situation.",
              "The style of footwork and the standing position vary greatly from school to school and from practitioner to practitioner.",
              "For a very traditional school, conscious of battlefield necessities, stances are usually very low, often with one knee on the ground, and footwork is complex, involving many careful cross-steps to allow practitioners to cope with multiple opponents.",
              "The Villabrille and San Miguel styles are usually taught in this way.",
              "Systems that have been adapted to duels or sporting matches generally employ simpler footwork, focusing on a single opponent.",
              "North American schools tend to use much more upright stances, as this puts less stress on the legs, but there are some exceptions.",
              "Many systems, including the Inosanto/Lacosta system of escrima/kali recognize and teach 3 basic ranges: long range (largo), medium range (medio) and short range (corto).",
              "The long range is typically defined as being able to hit the opponents lead/weapon hand with your weapon/stick only.",
              "Medium range is where you are able to strike the opponent's body/head with your weapon/stick while also checking/monitoring the opponent's lead hand with your rear/live hand.",
              "And the short range is when you can strike the opponent's body/head with your rear/live hand or being able to strike the opponent's head/body with the hilt/punyo end of the weapon/stick.",
              "Some styles or systems may also define a closer range for elbows to the head or body, or grappling.",
              "Many Filipino systems focus on defending against and/or reacting to angles of attack rather than particular strikes.",
              "The theory behind this is that virtually all types of hand-to-hand attacks (barehanded or with a weapon) hit or reach a combatant via these angles of attack and the reasoning is that it is more efficient to learn to defend against different angles of attack rather than learn to defend against particular styles, particular techniques or particular weapons.",
              "For instance, the technique for defending against an attack angle that comes overhead from the right is very similar whether the attacker uses bare fists, a knife, a sword or a spear.",
              "Older styles gave each angle a name, but more recent systems tend to simply number them.",
              "Many systems have twelve standard angles, though some have as few as 5, and others as many as 72.",
              "Although the exact angles, the order they are numbered in (numerado), and the way the player executes moves vary from system to system, most are based upon Filipino cosmology.",
              "These standard angles describe exercises.",
              "To aid memorization, player often practise a standard series of strikes from these angles, called an abecedario (Spanish for \"alphabet\").",
              "These are beginner strikes or the \"ABC's\" of Arnis.",
              "While most systems do incorporate a numbering system for the angles of attack, not all use the same numbering system, so always get clarification before training in a new system or style.",
              "Additionally, while the angles are numbered for ease of discussion, the numbers do not generally define how the attack is thrown.",
              "That is to say, usually (excluding thrusts) a #1 angle, means an attack that starts on the right side of the practitioner and comes down at about a 45\u00b0 from right to left.",
              "But, it does not matter whether this is done with the right or left hand (forehand or backhand) or if the hit continues through the target or returns back along the same line.",
              "Some angles of attack and some strikes have characteristic names: Many Arnis techniques have Spanish names, because Spanish was the lingua franca spoken during colonial times among the natives, who spoke over 170 languages across 7,600 islands.",
              "Arnis techniques are generally based on the assumption that both student and opponent are very highly trained and well prepared.",
              "Thus, Arnis tends to favour extreme caution, always considering the possibility of a failed technique or an unexpected knife.",
              "On the other hand, the practitioner is assumed to be capable of quick, precise strikes.",
              "The general principle is that an opponent's ability to attack should be destroyed rather than trying to injure and convince them to stop.",
              "Many strikes are therefore aimed at the hands and arms, hoping to break the hand holding the weapon, or cut the nerves and tendons controlling it (the concept of \"defanging the snake\").",
              "Strike to the eyes and legs are also important.",
              "This is summed up in a popular mnemonic: \"Stick seeks bone, blade seeks flesh\".",
              "Mano Mano is the empty-hand component of Filipino martial arts, particularly Arnis.",
              "The term translates as \"hands\" or \"hand-[to]-hand\" and comes from the Spanish mano (\"hand\").",
              "It is also known as suntukan or panununtukan in Luzon and pangamot in the Visayas, as well as De Cadena, Cadena de Mano or Arnis de Mano in some FMA systems. American colonists referred to it as \"combat judo\" or \"Filipino boxing\".",
              "Mano mano moves include kicking, punching, locking, throwing, and dumog (grappling).",
              "Filipino martial artists regard empty hands as another weapon, and all movements of Mano Mano are directly based on weapon techniques.",
              "In Arnis, weapons are seen as extensions of the body, so training with weapons naturally leads to proficiency in bare-handed combat.",
              "For this reason, Mano Mano is often taught in higher grades after weapons training has been mastered, as advanced students are expected to be able to apply experience with weapons to unarmed fighting.",
              "This not always the case though, as some systems of Arnis start with (and at times only consist of) empty hands fighting.",
              "Some notable masters of Mano Mano include: Paninipa, Pagsipa, Pananadiyak, Pagtadiyak, and Sikaran (all terms for \"kicking\" in various regions, dialects and styles) are components of eskrima that focus on knees, tripping, low-line kicks, and stomps.",
              "Pananjakman is also a term used in Filipino-American-developed and Western FMA systems, usually referring to the system from the Lucky Lucaylucay, Floro Villabrille and Dan Inosanto blend lineage.",
              "Except for the distinct style of Sikaran from the Baras area of the province of Rizal, which also uses high kicks, kicking as a separate art is never taught by itself in the Philippines, and this practice is only done in the West with Pananjakman.",
              "Pananjakman is usually taught together with Panantukan.",
              "Paninipa can be regarded as the study of leg muscles and bones and how they are connected, with the goal of either inflicting pain or outright breaking or dislocating the bones.",
              "Most striking techniques involve applying pressure to bend the target areas in unnatural ways so as to injure or break them.",
              "Such pressure may be delivered in the form of a heel smash, a toe kick, a stomp, or a knee.",
              "Targets include the groin, thighs, knees, shins, ankles, feet and toes.",
              "The upper body is used only for defensive maneuvers, making pananadiyak ideal for when combatants are engaged in a clinch.",
              "When used effectively, the strikes can bring an opponent to the ground or otherwise end an altercation by making them too weak to stand.",
              "Fundamental techniques include kicking or smashing the ankle to force it either towards or away from the opposite foot (severe supination or pronation, respectively), heel-stomping the top of the foot where it meets the lower leg so as to break or crush the numerous bones or otherwise disrupt the opponent's balance, and smashing the opponents knee from the side to break the knee (with severe supination and pronation as the desired result).",
              "Several classes of exercises, such as sombrada, contrada, sinawali, hubud-lubud and sequidas, initially presented to the public as a set of organized drills by the Inosanto school, are expressly designed to allow partners to move quickly and experiment with variations while remaining safe.",
              "For example, in a sumbrada drill, one partner feeds an attack, which the other counters, flowing into a counterattack, which is then countered, flowing into a counterattack, and so on.",
              "The hubud-lubud or hubad-lubad from Doce Pares is frequently used as a type of \"generator\" drill, where one is forced to act and think fast.",
              "Initially, students learn a specific series of attacks, counters, and counter-attacks.",
              "As they advance they can add minor variations, change the footwork, or switch to completely different attacks;",
              "eventually the exercise becomes almost completely free-form.",
              "Palakaw, from the Balintawak style, are un-choreographed and random defensive and offensive moves.",
              "Palakaw in Cebuano means a walk-through or rehearsing the different strike angles and defenses.",
              "It may be known as corridas, or striking without any order or pattern.",
              "Disarms, take-downs, and other techniques usually break the flow of such a drill, but they are usually initiated from such a sequence of movements to force the student to adapt to a variety of situations.",
              "A common practice is to begin a drill with each student armed with two weapons.",
              "Once the drill is flowing, if a student sees an opportunity to disarm their opponent, they do, but the drill continues until both students are empty-handed.",
              "Some drills use only a single weapon per pair, and the partners take turns disarming each other.",
              "Seguidas drills, taken from the San Miguel system, are sets of hitting and movement patterns usually involving stick and dagger.",
              "Rhythm, while an essential part of eskrima drills, is emphasized more in the United States and Europe, where a regular beat serves a guide for students to follow.",
              "To ensure safety, participants perform most drills at a constant pace, which they increase as they progress.",
              "The rhythm, together with the southern Filipino attire of a vest and sashed pants, is commonly mistaken for some sort of tradition when practising eskrima in the Philippines \u2013 perhaps incorrectly derived from traditional rhythm-based dances or an attempt to add a sense of ethnicity.",
              "Eskrima is usually practised in the Philippines without a rhythm, off-beat or out of rhythm.",
              "The diversity of Filipino martial arts means that there is no officially established standard uniform in eskrima.",
              "The live hand (or alive hand) is the opposite hand of the practitioner that does not contain the main weapon.",
              "The heavy usage of the live hand is an important concept and distinguishing hallmark of eskrima.",
              "Even (or especially) when empty, the live hand can be used as a companion weapon by eskrima practitioners.",
              "As opposed to most weapon systems like fencing where the off-hand is hidden and not used to prevent it from being hit, eskrima actively uses the live hand for trapping, locking, supporting weapon blocks, checking, disarming, striking and controlling the opponent.",
              "The usage of the live hand is one of the most evident examples of how Eskrima's method of starting with weapons training leads to effective empty hand techniques.",
              "Because of Doble Baston (double weapons) or Espada y Daga (sword and parrying dagger) ambidextrous weapon muscle memory conditioning, Eskrima practitioners find it easy to use the off-hand actively once they transition from using it with a weapon to an empty hand.",
              "Doble baston, and less frequently doble olisi, are common names for a group of techniques involving two sticks.",
              "The art is more commonly known around the world as Sinawali meaning \"to weave\".",

              "The earlier Arnis Philippines[73] (ARPI) system, established in 1986, was most prominently used during the 2005 Southeast Asian Games.",
              "Arnis students start their instruction by learning to fight with weapons, and only advance to empty-hand training once the stick and knife techniques have been sufficiently mastered.",
              "This is in contrast to most other well-known Asian martial arts but it is justified by the principle that bare-handed moves are acquired naturally through the same exercises as the weapon techniques, making muscle memory an important aspect of the teaching.",
              "It is also based on the obvious fact that an armed person who is trained has the advantage over a trained unarmed person, and serves to condition students to fight against armed assailants.",
              "Most systems of Arnis apply a single set of techniques for the stick, knife, and empty hands, a concept sometimes referred to as motion grouping.",
              "Since the weapon is seen as simply an extension of the body, the same angles and footwork are used either with or without a weapon.",
              "The reason for this is probably historical, because tribal warriors went into battle armed and only resorted to bare-handed fighting after losing their weapons.",
              "Many systems begin training with two weapons, either a pair of sticks or a stick and a wooden knife.",
              "These styles emphasise keeping both hands full and never moving them in the same direction, and trains practitioners to become ambidextrous.",
              "For example, one stick may strike the head while the other hits the arm.",
              "Such training develops the ability to use both limbs independently, a valuable skill, even when working with a single weapon.",
              "A core concept and distinct feature of Filipino martial arts is the Live Hand.",
              "Even when as a practitioner wields only one weapon, the extra hand is used to control, trap or disarm an opponent's weapon and to aid in blocking, joint locking and manipulation of the opponent or other simultaneous motions such as bicep destruction with the live hand.",
              "The most basic and common weapon in Arnis is the baston or yantok.",
              "They are typically constructed from rattan, an inexpensive stem from a type of Southeast Asian vine.",
              "Hard and durable yet lightweight, it shreds only under the worst abuse and does not splinter like wood, making it a safer training tool.",
              "This aspect makes it useful in defense against blades.",
              "Kamagong (ironwood or ebony) and bahi (heart of the palm) are sometimes used after being charred and hardened.",
              "These hardwoods are generally not used for sparring, however, as they are dense enough to cause serious injury, but traditional sparring does not include weapon to body contact.",
              "The participants are skilled enough to parry and counterstrike, showing respect in not intentionally hitting the training partner.",
              "In modern times, many Arnis practitioners have also come to wear head and hand protection while sparring with rattan sticks, or otherwise use padded bastons.",
              "Some modern schools also use sticks made out of aluminium or other metals, or modern high-impact plastics.",
              "Baraw is a Cebuano term used in eskrima that means knife or dagger.",
              "The term Baraw is more commonly used on the Cebu Island in the Visayan region whereas other islands and regions more commonly use the term Daga but both terms are often interchangeable within the Filipino martial arts community.",
              "The terms Baraw and Daga can be used either as Solo Baraw or Solo Daga associated with single knife fighting and defense systems, Doble Baraw or Doble Daga associated with the double knife fighting systems or even with a combination of long and short weapons e.",

              "The practitioners must conform to criteria based on the number of years of training and level of proficiency in technical skills.",
              "Practitioners are screened by the rank promotion committee to determine their rank in the grading system.",
              "Most systems recognize that the technical nature of combat changes drastically as the distance between opponents changes, and generally classify the ranges into at least three categories.",
              "Each range has its characteristic techniques and footwork.",
              "Of course, some systems place more emphasis on certain ranges than others, but almost all recognize that being able to work in and control any range is essential.",
              "The Balintawak style for example, uses long-, medium- and short-range fighting techniques, but focuses on the short-range.",
              "To control the range, and for numerous other purposes, good footwork is essential.",
              "Most eskrima systems explain their footwork in terms of triangles: normally when moving in any direction two feet occupy two corners of the triangle and the step is to the third corner such that no leg crosses the other at any time.",
              "The shape and size of the triangle must be adapted to the particular situation.",
              "The style of footwork and the standing position vary greatly from school to school and from practitioner to practitioner.",
              "For a very traditional school, conscious of battlefield necessities, stances are usually very low, often with one knee on the ground, and footwork is complex, involving many careful cross-steps to allow practitioners to cope with multiple opponents.",
              "The Villabrille and San Miguel styles are usually taught in this way.",
              "Systems that have been adapted to duels or sporting matches generally employ simpler footwork, focusing on a single opponent.",
              "North American schools tend to use much more upright stances, as this puts less stress on the legs, but there are some exceptions.",
              "Many systems, including the Inosanto/Lacosta system of escrima/kali recognize and teach 3 basic ranges: long range (largo), medium range (medio) and short range (corto).",
              "The long range is typically defined as being able to hit the opponents lead/weapon hand with your weapon/stick only.",
              "Medium range is where you are able to strike the opponent's body/head with your weapon/stick while also checking/monitoring the opponent's lead hand with your rear/live hand.",
              "And the short range is when you can strike the opponent's body/head with your rear/live hand or being able to strike the opponent's head/body with the hilt/punyo end of the weapon/stick.",
              "Some styles or systems may also define a closer range for elbows to the head or body, or grappling.",
              "Many Filipino systems focus on defending against and/or reacting to angles of attack rather than particular strikes.",
              "The theory behind this is that virtually all types of hand-to-hand attacks (barehanded or with a weapon) hit or reach a combatant via these angles of attack and the reasoning is that it is more efficient to learn to defend against different angles of attack rather than learn to defend against particular styles, particular techniques or particular weapons.",
              "For instance, the technique for defending against an attack angle that comes overhead from the right is very similar whether the attacker uses bare fists, a knife, a sword or a spear.",
              "Older styles gave each angle a name, but more recent systems tend to simply number them.",
              "Many systems have twelve standard angles, though some have as few as 5, and others as many as 72.",
              "Although the exact angles, the order they are numbered in (numerado), and the way the player executes moves vary from system to system, most are based upon Filipino cosmology.",
              "These standard angles describe exercises.",
              "To aid memorization, player often practise a standard series of strikes from these angles, called an abecedario (Spanish for \"alphabet\").",
              "These are beginner strikes or the \"ABC's\" of Arnis.",
              "While most systems do incorporate a numbering system for the angles of attack, not all use the same numbering system, so always get clarification before training in a new system or style.",
              "Additionally, while the angles are numbered for ease of discussion, the numbers do not generally define how the attack is thrown.",
              "That is to say, usually (excluding thrusts) a #1 angle, means an attack that starts on the right side of the practitioner and comes down at about a 45\u00b0 from right to left.",
              "But, it does not matter whether this is done with the right or left hand (forehand or backhand) or if the hit continues through the target or returns back along the same line.",
              "Some angles of attack and some strikes have characteristic names: Many Arnis techniques have Spanish names, because Spanish was the lingua franca spoken during colonial times among the natives, who spoke over 170 languages across 7,600 islands.",
              "Arnis techniques are generally based on the assumption that both student and opponent are very highly trained and well prepared.",
              "Thus, Arnis tends to favour extreme caution, always considering the possibility of a failed technique or an unexpected knife.",
              "On the other hand, the practitioner is assumed to be capable of quick, precise strikes.",
              "The general principle is that an opponent's ability to attack should be destroyed rather than trying to injure and convince them to stop.",
              "Many strikes are therefore aimed at the hands and arms, hoping to break the hand holding the weapon, or cut the nerves and tendons controlling it (the concept of \"defanging the snake\").",
              "Strike to the eyes and legs are also important.",
              "This is summed up in a popular mnemonic: \"Stick seeks bone, blade seeks flesh\".",
              "Mano Mano is the empty-hand component of Filipino martial arts, particularly Arnis.",
              "The term translates as \"hands\" or \"hand-[to]-hand\" and comes from the Spanish mano (\"hand\").",
              "It is also known as suntukan or panununtukan in Luzon and pangamot in the Visayas, as well as De Cadena, Cadena de Mano or Arnis de Mano in some FMA systems. American colonists referred to it as \"combat judo\" or \"Filipino boxing\".",
              "Mano mano moves include kicking, punching, locking, throwing, and dumog (grappling).",
              "Filipino martial artists regard empty hands as another weapon, and all movements of Mano Mano are directly based on weapon techniques.",
              "In Arnis, weapons are seen as extensions of the body, so training with weapons naturally leads to proficiency in bare-handed combat.",
              "For this reason, Mano Mano is often taught in higher grades after weapons training has been mastered, as advanced students are expected to be able to apply experience with weapons to unarmed fighting.",
              "This not always the case though, as some systems of Arnis start with (and at times only consist of) empty hands fighting.",
              "Some notable masters of Mano Mano include: Paninipa, Pagsipa, Pananadiyak, Pagtadiyak, and Sikaran (all terms for \"kicking\" in various regions, dialects and styles) are components of eskrima that focus on knees, tripping, low-line kicks, and stomps.",
              "Pananjakman is also a term used in Filipino-American-developed and Western FMA systems, usually referring to the system from the Lucky Lucaylucay, Floro Villabrille and Dan Inosanto blend lineage.",
              "Except for the distinct style of Sikaran from the Baras area of the province of Rizal, which also uses high kicks, kicking as a separate art is never taught by itself in the Philippines, and this practice is only done in the West with Pananjakman.",
              "Pananjakman is usually taught together with Panantukan.",
              "Paninipa can be regarded as the study of leg muscles and bones and how they are connected, with the goal of either inflicting pain or outright breaking or dislocating the bones.",
              "Most striking techniques involve applying pressure to bend the target areas in unnatural ways so as to injure or break them.",
              "Such pressure may be delivered in the form of a heel smash, a toe kick, a stomp, or a knee.",
              "Targets include the groin, thighs, knees, shins, ankles, feet and toes.",
              "The upper body is used only for defensive maneuvers, making pananadiyak ideal for when combatants are engaged in a clinch.",
              "When used effectively, the strikes can bring an opponent to the ground or otherwise end an altercation by making them too weak to stand.",
              "Fundamental techniques include kicking or smashing the ankle to force it either towards or away from the opposite foot (severe supination or pronation, respectively), heel-stomping the top of the foot where it meets the lower leg so as to break or crush the numerous bones or otherwise disrupt the opponent's balance, and smashing the opponents knee from the side to break the knee (with severe supination and pronation as the desired result).",
              "Several classes of exercises, such as sombrada, contrada, sinawali, hubud-lubud and sequidas, initially presented to the public as a set of organized drills by the Inosanto school, are expressly designed to allow partners to move quickly and experiment with variations while remaining safe.",
              "For example, in a sumbrada drill, one partner feeds an attack, which the other counters, flowing into a counterattack, which is then countered, flowing into a counterattack, and so on.",
              "The hubud-lubud or hubad-lubad from Doce Pares is frequently used as a type of \"generator\" drill, where one is forced to act and think fast.",
              "Initially, students learn a specific series of attacks, counters, and counter-attacks.",
              "As they advance they can add minor variations, change the footwork, or switch to completely different attacks;",
              "eventually the exercise becomes almost completely free-form.",
              "Palakaw, from the Balintawak style, are un-choreographed and random defensive and offensive moves.",
              "Palakaw in Cebuano means a walk-through or rehearsing the different strike angles and defenses.",
              "It may be known as corridas, or striking without any order or pattern.",
              "Disarms, take-downs, and other techniques usually break the flow of such a drill, but they are usually initiated from such a sequence of movements to force the student to adapt to a variety of situations.",
              "A common practice is to begin a drill with each student armed with two weapons.",
              "Once the drill is flowing, if a student sees an opportunity to disarm their opponent, they do, but the drill continues until both students are empty-handed.",
              "Some drills use only a single weapon per pair, and the partners take turns disarming each other.",
              "Seguidas drills, taken from the San Miguel system, are sets of hitting and movement patterns usually involving stick and dagger.",
              "Rhythm, while an essential part of eskrima drills, is emphasized more in the United States and Europe, where a regular beat serves a guide for students to follow.",
              "To ensure safety, participants perform most drills at a constant pace, which they increase as they progress.",
              "The rhythm, together with the southern Filipino attire of a vest and sashed pants, is commonly mistaken for some sort of tradition when practising eskrima in the Philippines \u2013 perhaps incorrectly derived from traditional rhythm-based dances or an attempt to add a sense of ethnicity.",
              "Eskrima is usually practised in the Philippines without a rhythm, off-beat or out of rhythm.",
              "The diversity of Filipino martial arts means that there is no officially established standard uniform in eskrima.",
              "The live hand (or alive hand) is the opposite hand of the practitioner that does not contain the main weapon.",
              "The heavy usage of the live hand is an important concept and distinguishing hallmark of eskrima.",
              "Even (or especially) when empty, the live hand can be used as a companion weapon by eskrima practitioners.",
              "As opposed to most weapon systems like fencing where the off-hand is hidden and not used to prevent it from being hit, eskrima actively uses the live hand for trapping, locking, supporting weapon blocks, checking, disarming, striking and controlling the opponent.",
              "The usage of the live hand is one of the most evident examples of how Eskrima's method of starting with weapons training leads to effective empty hand techniques.",
              "Because of Doble Baston (double weapons) or Espada y Daga (sword and parrying dagger) ambidextrous weapon muscle memory conditioning, Eskrima practitioners find it easy to use the off-hand actively once they transition from using it with a weapon to an empty hand.",
              "Doble baston, and less frequently doble olisi, are common names for a group of techniques involving two sticks.",
              "The art is more commonly known around the world as Sinawali meaning \"to weave\".",
              "The term Sinawali is taken from a matting called sawali that is commonly used in the tribal Nipa Huts.",
              "It is made up of woven pieces of palm leaf and used for both flooring and walls.",
              "This technique requires the user to use both left and right weapons in an equal manner;",
              "many co-ordination drills are used to help the practitioner become more ambidextrous.",
              "It is the section of the art that is taught mainly at the intermediate levels and above and is considered one of the most important areas of learning in the art.",
              "Sinawali refers to the activity of \"weaving\", as applied Eskrima with reference to a set of two-person, two-weapon exercises.",
              "The term comes from \"Sawali\", the woven material that typically forms the walls of nipa huts.",
              "Sinawali exercises provide eskrima practitioners with basic skills and motions relevant to a mode of two-weapon blocking and response method called Doblete.",
              "Sinawali training is often introduced to novices to help them develop certain fundamental skills \u2013 including: body positioning and distance relative to an opponent, rotation of the body and the proper turning radius, recognition of one's center of gravity, eye\u2013hand coordination, target perception and recognition, increased ambidexterity, recognition and performance of rhythmic structures for upper body movement, and muscular developments important to the art, especially, the wrist and forearm regions.",
              "It helps teach the novice eskrimador proper positioning while swinging a weapon.",
              "The Chinese and Malay communities of the Philippines have practiced eskrima together with Kuntaw and Silat for centuries, so much so that many North Americans mistakenly believe silat to have originated in the Philippines.",
              "Some of the modern styles, particularly doce pares and Modern Arnis contain some elements of Japanese Martial Arts such as joint locks, throws, blocks, strikes, and groundwork, taken from: Jujutsu, Judo, Aikido and Karate as some of the founders obtained black belt Dan grades in some of these systems. Some eskrima styles are complementary with Chinese Wing Chun because of the nervous system conditioning and body mechanics when striking, twirling or swinging sticks.",
              "In Western countries, it is common to practice eskrima in conjunction with other martial arts, particularly Wing Chun, Jeet Kune Do and silat.",
              "As a result, there is some confusion between styles, systems, and lineage, because some people cross-train without giving due credit to the founders or principles of their arts.",
              "For example, American Kenpo and Kajukenbo cross-training traces back to the interactions between Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants in territorial/pre-statehood Hawaii, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the United States.",
              "In the United States the cross-training between eskrima and Jeet Kune Do Concepts as headed by Dan Inosanto of the Inosanto Academy in Marina del Rey, California, goes according to the maxim \"Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless\".",
              "Proponents of such training say the arts are very similar in many aspects and complement each other well.",
              "It has become marketable to offer eskrima classes in other traditional Asian martial arts studios in America but some practitioners of other eskrima styles often dismiss these lessons as debased versions of original training methods."

              "What is certain is that the Spaniards brought with them and used their bladed weapon arts (including the system of Destreza developed by Carranza) when they started colonizing the archipelago in the 16th century.",
              "What is also known is that the Spaniards recruited soldiers from Mexico[38] and Peru[39] and sent them to fortify the Philippines and they had also trained mercenaries and warriors from local people like the Pangasinenses, Kapampangans, Tagalogs, Ilonggos, Cebuanos and Warays to pacify regions and put down revolts.",
              "Of the Kapampangans, Fray Casimiro Di\u0301az relates in 1718: Los primeros que se decidieron a\u0301 experimentar fortuna fueron los pampangos, nacio\u0301n la ma\u0301s belicosa y noble de estas Islas, y cercana a\u0301 Manila.",

              "And it was all the worse because these people had been trained in the military art in our own schools in the presidios (fortified outposts) of Ternate, Zamboanga, Jolo, Caraga and other places where their valor was well known;",
              "but this needs the help of ours, and so they say that a Spaniard plus three Pampangos equal four Spaniards.",
              "[41] Logic dictates that these native warriors and foreign soldiers would have passed on to very close friends and family members these newly learned skills to augment already existing and effective local ones.",
              "They would have also shared tactics and techniques with each other when placed in the same military group and fighting on the same side in foreign regions such as Formosa, Mindanao, the Moluccas[40] and the Marianas.",
              "[42] One of the more prominent features of Arnis that point to possible Spanish influence is the Espada y Daga (Spanish for \"sword and dagger\") method, a term also used in Spanish fencing.",
              "Filipino espada y daga differs somewhat from European rapier and dagger techniques;",
              "the stances are different as weapons used in Arnis are typically shorter than European swords.",

              "[45] After the Spanish colonized the Philippines, a decree was set that prohibited civilians from carrying full-sized swords (such as the Kris and the Kampilan).",
              "Despite this, the practitioners found ways to maintain and keep the arts alive, using sticks made out of rattan rather than swords, as well as small knives wielded like swords.",
              "Some of the arts were passed down from one generation to the other.",
              "Sometimes the art took the form choreographed dances such as the Sakuting stick dance[46] or during mock battles at Moro-moro (Moros y Cristianos) stage plays.",
              "Also as a result, a unique and complex stick-based technique evolved in the Visayas and Luzon regions.",
              "The southern Mindanao retains almost exclusively blade-oriented techniques, as the Spaniards and Americans never fully conquered the southern parts of this island.",
              "[47] Although Arnis combines native fighting techniques with old Spanish fencing and other influences, a degree of systematization was achieved over time, resulting in a distinguishable Philippine martial art.",
              "With time, a system for the teaching of the basics also evolved.",
              "However, with the exception of a few older and more established systems, it was previously common to pass the art from generation to generation in an informal approach.",
              "This has made attempts to trace the lineage of a practitioner difficult.",
              "For example, aside from learning from their family members like his uncle Regino Ilustrisimo, Antonio Ilustrisimo seemed to have learned to fight while sailing around the Philippines, while his cousin and student Floro Villabrille claimed to have been also taught by a blind Moro princess in the mountains;",

              "They are commonly carried as tools by farmers, used by street vendors to prepare coconuts, pineapples, watermelons, other fruits and meats, and balisongs are cheap to procure in the streets as well as being easily concealed.",

              "Practitioners are screened by the rank promotion committee to determine their rank in the grading system.",
              "Most systems recognize that the technical nature of combat changes drastically as the distance between opponents changes, and generally classify the ranges into at least three categories.",
              "Each range has its characteristic techniques and footwork.",
              "Of course, some systems place more emphasis on certain ranges than others, but almost all recognize that being able to work in and control any range is essential.",
              "The Balintawak style for example, uses long-, medium- and short-range fighting techniques, but focuses on the short-range.",
              "To control the range, and for numerous other purposes, good footwork is essential.",
              "Most eskrima systems explain their footwork in terms of triangles: normally when moving in any direction two feet occupy two corners of the triangle and the step is to the third corner such that no leg crosses the other at any time.",
              "The shape and size of the triangle must be adapted to the particular situation.",
              "The style of footwork and the standing position vary greatly from school to school and from practitioner to practitioner.",
              "For a very traditional school, conscious of battlefield necessities, stances are usually very low, often with one knee on the ground, and footwork is complex, involving many careful cross-steps to allow practitioners to cope with multiple opponents.",
              "The Villabrille and San Miguel styles are usually taught in this way.",
              "Systems that have been adapted to duels or sporting matches generally employ simpler footwork, focusing on a single opponent.",
              "North American schools tend to use much more upright stances, as this puts less stress on the legs, but there are some exceptions.",
              "Many systems, including the Inosanto/Lacosta system of escrima/kali recognize and teach 3 basic ranges: long range (largo), medium range (medio) and short range (corto).",
              "The long range is typically defined as being able to hit the opponents lead/weapon hand with your weapon/stick only.",
              "Medium range is where you are able to strike the opponent's body/head with your weapon/stick while also checking/monitoring the opponent's lead hand with your rear/live hand.",
              "And the short range is when you can strike the opponent's body/head with your rear/live hand or being able to strike the opponent's head/body with the hilt/punyo end of the weapon/stick.",
              "Some styles or systems may also define a closer range for elbows to the head or body, or grappling.",
              "Many Filipino systems focus on defending against and/or reacting to angles of attack rather than particular strikes.",
              "The theory behind this is that virtually all types of hand-to-hand attacks (barehanded or with a weapon) hit or reach a combatant via these angles of attack and the reasoning is that it is more efficient to learn to defend against different angles of attack rather than learn to defend against particular styles, particular techniques or particular weapons.",
              "For instance, the technique for defending against an attack angle that comes overhead from the right is very similar whether the attacker uses bare fists, a knife, a sword or a spear.",
              "Older styles gave each angle a name, but more recent systems tend to simply number them.",
              "Many systems have twelve standard angles, though some have as few as 5, and others as many as 72.",
              "Although the exact angles, the order they are numbered in (numerado), and the way the player executes moves vary from system to system, most are based upon Filipino cosmology.",
              "These standard angles describe exercises.",
              "To aid memorization, player often practise a standard series of strikes from these angles, called an abecedario (Spanish for \"alphabet\").",
              "These are beginner strikes or the \"ABC's\" of Arnis.",
              "While most systems do incorporate a numbering system for the angles of attack, not all use the same numbering system, so always get clarification before training in a new system or style.",
              "Additionally, while the angles are numbered for ease of discussion, the numbers do not generally define how the attack is thrown.",
              "That is to say, usually (excluding thrusts) a #1 angle, means an attack that starts on the right side of the practitioner and comes down at about a 45\u00b0 from right to left.",
              "But, it does not matter whether this is done with the right or left hand (forehand or backhand) or if the hit continues through the target or returns back along the same line.",
              "Some angles of attack and some strikes have characteristic names: Many Arnis techniques have Spanish names, because Spanish was the lingua franca spoken during colonial times among the natives, who spoke over 170 languages across 7,600 islands.",
              "Arnis techniques are generally based on the assumption that both student and opponent are very highly trained and well prepared.",
              "Thus, Arnis tends to favour extreme caution, always considering the possibility of a failed technique or an unexpected knife.",
              "On the other hand, the practitioner is assumed to be capable of quick, precise strikes.",
              "The general principle is that an opponent's ability to attack should be destroyed rather than trying to injure and convince them to stop.",
              "Many strikes are therefore aimed at the hands and arms, hoping to break the hand holding the weapon, or cut the nerves and tendons controlling it (the concept of \"defanging the snake\").",
              "Strike to the eyes and legs are also important.",
              "This is summed up in a popular mnemonic: \"Stick seeks bone, blade seeks flesh\".",
              "Mano Mano is the empty-hand component of Filipino martial arts, particularly Arnis.",
              "The term translates as \"hands\" or \"hand-[to]-hand\" and comes from the Spanish mano (\"hand\").",
              "It is also known as suntukan or panununtukan in Luzon and pangamot in the Visayas, as well as De Cadena, Cadena de Mano or Arnis de Mano in some FMA systems. American colonists referred to it as \"combat judo\" or \"Filipino boxing\".",
              "Mano mano moves include kicking, punching, locking, throwing, and dumog (grappling).",
              "Filipino martial artists regard empty hands as another weapon, and all movements of Mano Mano are directly based on weapon techniques.",
              "In Arnis, weapons are seen as extensions of the body, so training with weapons naturally leads to proficiency in bare-handed combat.",
              "For this reason, Mano Mano is often taught in higher grades after weapons training has been mastered, as advanced students are expected to be able to apply experience with weapons to unarmed fighting.",
              "This not always the case though, as some systems of Arnis start with (and at times only consist of) empty hands fighting.",
              "Some notable masters of Mano Mano include: Paninipa, Pagsipa, Pananadiyak, Pagtadiyak, and Sikaran (all terms for \"kicking\" in various regions, dialects and styles) are components of eskrima that focus on knees, tripping, low-line kicks, and stomps.",
              "Pananjakman is also a term used in Filipino-American-developed and Western FMA systems, usually referring to the system from the Lucky Lucaylucay, Floro Villabrille and Dan Inosanto blend lineage.",
              "Except for the distinct style of Sikaran from the Baras area of the province of Rizal, which also uses high kicks, kicking as a separate art is never taught by itself in the Philippines, and this practice is only done in the West with Pananjakman.",
              "Pananjakman is usually taught together with Panantukan.",
              "Paninipa can be regarded as the study of leg muscles and bones and how they are connected, with the goal of either inflicting pain or outright breaking or dislocating the bones.",
              "Most striking techniques involve applying pressure to bend the target areas in unnatural ways so as to injure or break them.",
              "Such pressure may be delivered in the form of a heel smash, a toe kick, a stomp, or a knee.",
              "Targets include the groin, thighs, knees, shins, ankles, feet and toes.",
              "The upper body is used only for defensive maneuvers, making pananadiyak ideal for when combatants are engaged in a clinch.",
              "When used effectively, the strikes can bring an opponent to the ground or otherwise end an altercation by making them too weak to stand.",
              "Fundamental techniques include kicking or smashing the ankle to force it either towards or away from the opposite foot (severe supination or pronation, respectively), heel-stomping the top of the foot where it meets the lower leg so as to break or crush the numerous bones or otherwise disrupt the opponent's balance, and smashing the opponents knee from the side to break the knee (with severe supination and pronation as the desired result).",
              "Several classes of exercises, such as sombrada, contrada, sinawali, hubud-lubud and sequidas, initially presented to the public as a set of organized drills by the Inosanto school, are expressly designed to allow partners to move quickly and experiment with variations while remaining safe.",
              "For example, in a sumbrada drill, one partner feeds an attack, which the other counters, flowing into a counterattack, which is then countered, flowing into a counterattack, and so on.",
              "The hubud-lubud or hubad-lubad from Doce Pares is frequently used as a type of \"generator\" drill, where one is forced to act and think fast.",
              "Initially, students learn a specific series of attacks, counters, and counter-attacks.",
              "As they advance they can add minor variations, change the footwork, or switch to completely different attacks;",
              "eventually the exercise becomes almost completely free-form.",
              "Palakaw, from the Balintawak style, are un-choreographed and random defensive and offensive moves.",
              "Palakaw in Cebuano means a walk-through or rehearsing the different strike angles and defenses.",
              "It may be known as corridas, or striking without any order or pattern.",
              "Disarms, take-downs, and other techniques usually break the flow of such a drill, but they are usually initiated from such a sequence of movements to force the student to adapt to a variety of situations.",
              "A common practice is to begin a drill with each student armed with two weapons.",
              "Once the drill is flowing, if a student sees an opportunity to disarm their opponent, they do, but the drill continues until both students are empty-handed.",
              "Some drills use only a single weapon per pair, and the partners take turns disarming each other.",
              "Seguidas drills, taken from the San Miguel system, are sets of hitting and movement patterns usually involving stick and dagger.",
              "Rhythm, while an essential part of eskrima drills, is emphasized more in the United States and Europe, where a regular beat serves a guide for students to follow.",
              "To ensure safety, participants perform most drills at a constant pace, which they increase as they progress.",
              "The rhythm, together with the southern Filipino attire of a vest and sashed pants, is commonly mistaken for some sort of tradition when practising eskrima in the Philippines \u2013 perhaps incorrectly derived from traditional rhythm-based dances or an attempt to add a sense of ethnicity.",
              "Eskrima is usually practised in the Philippines without a rhythm, off-beat or out of rhythm.",
              "The diversity of Filipino martial arts means that there is no officially established standard uniform in eskrima.",
              "The live hand (or alive hand) is the opposite hand of the practitioner that does not contain the main weapon.",
              "The heavy usage of the live hand is an important concept and distinguishing hallmark of eskrima.",
              "Even (or especially) when empty, the live hand can be used as a companion weapon by eskrima practitioners.",
              "As opposed to most weapon systems like fencing where the off-hand is hidden and not used to prevent it from being hit, eskrima actively uses the live hand for trapping, locking, supporting weapon blocks, checking, disarming, striking and controlling the opponent.",
              "The usage of the live hand is one of the most evident examples of how Eskrima's method of starting with weapons training leads to effective empty hand techniques.",
              "Because of Doble Baston (double weapons) or Espada y Daga (sword and parrying dagger) ambidextrous weapon muscle memory conditioning, Eskrima practitioners find it easy to use the off-hand actively once they transition from using it with a weapon to an empty hand.",
              "Doble baston, and less frequently doble olisi, are common names for a group of techniques involving two sticks.",
              "The art is more commonly known around the world as Sinawali meaning \"to weave\".",
              "The term Sinawali is taken from a matting called sawali that is commonly used in the tribal Nipa Huts.",
              "It is made up of woven pieces of palm leaf and used for both flooring and walls.",
              "This technique requires the user to use both left and right weapons in an equal manner;",
              "many co-ordination drills are used to help the practitioner become more ambidextrous.",

              "Sinawali refers to the activity of \"weaving\", as applied Eskrima with reference to a set of two-person, two-weapon exercises.",
              "The term comes from \"Sawali\", the woven material that typically forms the walls of nipa huts.",
              "Sinawali exercises provide eskrima practitioners with basic skills and motions relevant to a mode of two-weapon blocking and response method called Doblete.",
              "Sinawali training is often introduced to novices to help them develop certain fundamental skills \u2013 including: body positioning and distance relative to an opponent, rotation of the body and the proper turning radius, recognition of one's center of gravity, eye\u2013hand coordination, target perception and recognition, increased ambidexterity, recognition and performance of rhythmic structures for upper body movement, and muscular developments important to the art, especially, the wrist and forearm regions.",
              "It helps teach the novice eskrimador proper positioning while swinging a weapon.",
              "The Chinese and Malay communities of the Philippines have practiced eskrima together with Kuntaw and Silat for centuries, so much so that many North Americans mistakenly believe silat to have originated in the Philippines.",
              "Some of the modern styles, particularly doce pares and Modern Arnis contain some elements of Japanese Martial Arts such as joint locks, throws, blocks, strikes, and groundwork, taken from: Jujutsu, Judo, Aikido and Karate as some of the founders obtained black belt Dan grades in some of these systems. Some eskrima styles are complementary with Chinese Wing Chun because of the nervous system conditioning and body mechanics when striking, twirling or swinging sticks.",
              "In Western countries, it is common to practice eskrima in conjunction with other martial arts, particularly Wing Chun, Jeet Kune Do and silat.",
              "As a result, there is some confusion between styles, systems, and lineage, because some people cross-train without giving due credit to the founders or principles of their arts.",
              "For example, American Kenpo and Kajukenbo cross-training traces back to the interactions between Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants in territorial/pre-statehood Hawaii, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the United States.",
              "In the United States the cross-training between eskrima and Jeet Kune Do Concepts as headed by Dan Inosanto of the Inosanto Academy in Marina del Rey, California, goes according to the maxim \"Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless\".",
              "Proponents of such training say the arts are very similar in many aspects and complement each other well.",
              "It has become marketable to offer eskrima classes in other traditional Asian martial arts studios in America but some practitioners of other eskrima styles often dismiss these lessons as debased versions of original training methods."

              "In the Indonesian language the term bela-diri (lit.",
              "self-defense) is used to mean martial art, and in essence the Indonesian fighting arts are meant as one's defence against perceived threat and assault.",

              "Some parts of the archipelagic realm that is today Indonesia was the scene of warfare among the native populace for much of its long history, and the people of the region naturally developed effective methods of combat and self-defense.",
              "[1] Archaeological findings dating from prehistoric times have uncovered a variety of stone and metal weaponry such as axes, arrows and spearheads.",
              "These implements would have doubled as hunting tools and weapons of combat between and among tribes.",
              "Tribal warfare, although often motivated by resources, lands and slave grabbing, was also a solution to settling disputes, as well as a component of coming of age rituals.",
              "The practice of headhunting developed the martial skills of some tribes to a high level such as the Dayak, Batak, and Nias people.",
              "Warriors from militaristic tribes were appreciated by other factions, and were recruited by developed kingdoms and polities as mercenaries.",
              "Traditional war dances were used both to reenact battles and as a form of training, a precursor to the preset forms or jurus of later fighting systems. Displaced Baiyue from present-day China and Vietnam (particularly the Dong Son culture) during the first centuries of the common era introduced bronze-casting to the Nusantara and resulted in the development of native edged weapons such as the parang, klewang, mandau, badik, kujang, golok and kris.",

              "In comparison to the country's tribal fighting systems, pencak silat shows decidedly more influence from the Asian mainland, specifically China and the Indian subcontinent.",
              "Pencak silat tied the art of combat with practices of meditation and spiritual development, adding a new layer to the martial arts aside from merely being used to fight or kill so that it was used consistently throughout Indonesia's history.",
              "[3] The wide geographical area in which pencak silat was practiced is naturally reflected in its diversity of techniques and weaponry, some indigenous and some adopted from outside through maritime trade.",
              "Chinese communities continued to establish themselves, their native kuntao influencing the local martial arts.",
              "Gunpowder technology in cannons and muskets allowed many kingdoms and polities in Indonesia to be conquered and subjugated by European power.",
              "A further influx of Chinese were brought in as labourers, increasing the proliferation of kuntao styles.",

              "Many of the more violent martial practices such as headhunting and duels to the death either fell out of popularity or were banned.",
              "A number of fighting styles have managed to survive by adapting.",
              "In some cases they became less lethal like pasola, or at times by being promoted as a dance for the entertainment of tourists.",
              "The following are complete martial arts designed for fighting or self-defense.",
              "Pencak silat is a compound of the two most commonly used words for martial arts in Indonesia.",
              "Pencak was the term used in central and east Java, while silat was used in Sumatra and Borneo.",
              "In modern usage, pencak and silat are seen as being two aspects of the same practice.",
              "Pencak is the essence of training, the outward aspect of the art.",
              "Silat is the internal essence of combat and self-defense, the true fighting application of the techniques.",
              "[4] The earliest evidence of pencak silat is in 6th-century Riau from where it saw further development under Indian and Chinese influence in the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Sumatra and Java.",
              "The art gradually spread throughout most of what is now Indonesia and reached its peak in the medieval Majapahit kingdom.",
              "Generalizations of silat techniques are difficult due to the diversity of systems. Any part of the body is used and subject to attack.",

              "Every Chinese community in Indonesia either has or historically had some style of kuntao, but they were not taught openly until the latter half of the 20th century.",
              "Northern and southern Chinese martial arts are represented in kuntao, both from the external and internal schools.",
              "Some systems were directly imported from China and underwent little or no changes, such as thaikek (tai chi), pakua (baguazhang or eight-trigram palm) and peh-ho (baihequan or white crane fist).",
              "Other popular systems originate from the same states as the Chinese communities who practice them, so that Fujian, Shandong, Kongfu and Guangdong styles dominate.",
              "Caci (pronounced \"chachi\") is a form of fighting with a whip or stick.",
              "[5] It appears to be indigenous to Flores in East Nusa Tenggara, but it is also practiced in Bali and Lombok.",

              "The term caci is said to derive from the Manggarai words ca meaning one and ci meaning test, indicating a one-on-one test between the fighters.",
              "According to local folklore, caci during festivals began with two brothers who owned a buffalo.",
              "When the younger brother fell into a deep hole, the older brother had to slaughter the buffalo to get its skin to help his sibling escape from the hole.",
              "[6] The community celebrated this act of love with a festival in which caci matches were held.",

              "In Bali and Ngada Regency, only the stick form exists.",
              "In a caci match, the two fighters (who are always male) take turns alternately attacking and defending.",
              "The attacker is permitted three blows to any part of the anatomy, while the defender attempts to block with his shield.",
              "The defender is not allowed to attack while defending, but in the case of whip-fighting the defender may spin the whip above his head to prevent the attacker from closing in.",

              "Arnis students start their instruction by learning to fight with weapons, and only advance to empty-hand training once the stick and knife techniques have been sufficiently mastered.",
              "This is in contrast to most other well-known Asian martial arts but it is justified by the principle that bare-handed moves are acquired naturally through the same exercises as the weapon techniques, making muscle memory an important aspect of the teaching.",
              "It is also based on the obvious fact that an armed person who is trained has the advantage over a trained unarmed person, and serves to condition students to fight against armed assailants.",
              "Most systems of Arnis apply a single set of techniques for the stick, knife, and empty hands, a concept sometimes referred to as motion grouping.",
              "Since the weapon is seen as simply an extension of the body, the same angles and footwork are used either with or without a weapon.",
              "The reason for this is probably historical, because tribal warriors went into battle armed and only resorted to bare-handed fighting after losing their weapons.",
              "Many systems begin training with two weapons, either a pair of sticks or a stick and a wooden knife.",
              "These styles emphasise keeping both hands full and never moving them in the same direction, and trains practitioners to become ambidextrous.",
              "For example, one stick may strike the head while the other hits the arm.",
              "Such training develops the ability to use both limbs independently, a valuable skill, even when working with a single weapon.",
              "A core concept and distinct feature of Filipino martial arts is the Live Hand.",
              "Even when as a practitioner wields only one weapon, the extra hand is used to control, trap or disarm an opponent's weapon and to aid in blocking, joint locking and manipulation of the opponent or other simultaneous motions such as bicep destruction with the live hand.",
              "The most basic and common weapon in Arnis is the baston or yantok.",
              "They are typically constructed from rattan, an inexpensive stem from a type of Southeast Asian vine.",
              "Hard and durable yet lightweight, it shreds only under the worst abuse and does not splinter like wood, making it a safer training tool.",
              "This aspect makes it useful in defense against blades.",
              "Kamagong (ironwood or ebony) and bahi (heart of the palm) are sometimes used after being charred and hardened.",
              "These hardwoods are generally not used for sparring, however, as they are dense enough to cause serious injury, but traditional sparring does not include weapon to body contact.",
              "The participants are skilled enough to parry and counterstrike, showing respect in not intentionally hitting the training partner.",
              "In modern times, many Arnis practitioners have also come to wear head and hand protection while sparring with rattan sticks, or otherwise use padded bastons.",
              "Some modern schools also use sticks made out of aluminium or other metals, or modern high-impact plastics.",
              "Baraw is a Cebuano term used in eskrima that means knife or dagger.",
              "The term Baraw is more commonly used on the Cebu Island in the Visayan region whereas other islands and regions more commonly use the term Daga but both terms are often interchangeable within the Filipino martial arts community.",
              "The terms Baraw and Daga can be used either as Solo Baraw or Solo Daga associated with single knife fighting and defense systems, Doble Baraw or Doble Daga associated with the double knife fighting systems or even with a combination of long and short weapons e.",

              "The practitioners must conform to criteria based on the number of years of training and level of proficiency in technical skills.",
              "Practitioners are screened by the rank promotion committee to determine their rank in the grading system.",
              "Most systems recognize that the technical nature of combat changes drastically as the distance between opponents changes, and generally classify the ranges into at least three categories.",
              "Each range has its characteristic techniques and footwork.",
              "Of course, some systems place more emphasis on certain ranges than others, but almost all recognize that being able to work in and control any range is essential.",
              "The Balintawak style for example, uses long-, medium- and short-range fighting techniques, but focuses on the short-range.",
              "To control the range, and for numerous other purposes, good footwork is essential.",
              "Most eskrima systems explain their footwork in terms of triangles: normally when moving in any direction two feet occupy two corners of the triangle and the step is to the third corner such that no leg crosses the other at any time.",
              "The shape and size of the triangle must be adapted to the particular situation.",
              "The style of footwork and the standing position vary greatly from school to school and from practitioner to practitioner.",
              "For a very traditional school, conscious of battlefield necessities, stances are usually very low, often with one knee on the ground, and footwork is complex, involving many careful cross-steps to allow practitioners to cope with multiple opponents.",
              "The Villabrille and San Miguel styles are usually taught in this way.",
              "Systems that have been adapted to duels or sporting matches generally employ simpler footwork, focusing on a single opponent.",
              "North American schools tend to use much more upright stances, as this puts less stress on the legs, but there are some exceptions.",
              "Many systems, including the Inosanto/Lacosta system of escrima/kali recognize and teach 3 basic ranges: long range (largo), medium range (medio) and short range (corto).",
              "The long range is typically defined as being able to hit the opponents lead/weapon hand with your weapon/stick only.",
              "Medium range is where you are able to strike the opponent's body/head with your weapon/stick while also checking/monitoring the opponent's lead hand with your rear/live hand.",
              "And the short range is when you can strike the opponent's body/head with your rear/live hand or being able to strike the opponent's head/body with the hilt/punyo end of the weapon/stick.",
              "Some styles or systems may also define a closer range for elbows to the head or body, or grappling.",
              "Many Filipino systems focus on defending against and/or reacting to angles of attack rather than particular strikes.",
              "The theory behind this is that virtually all types of hand-to-hand attacks (barehanded or with a weapon) hit or reach a combatant via these angles of attack and the reasoning is that it is more efficient to learn to defend against different angles of attack rather than learn to defend against particular styles, particular techniques or particular weapons.",
              "For instance, the technique for defending against an attack angle that comes overhead from the right is very similar whether the attacker uses bare fists, a knife, a sword or a spear.",
              "Older styles gave each angle a name, but more recent systems tend to simply number them.",
              "Many systems have twelve standard angles, though some have as few as 5, and others as many as 72.",
              "Although the exact angles, the order they are numbered in (numerado), and the way the player executes moves vary from system to system, most are based upon Filipino cosmology.",
              "These standard angles describe exercises.",
              "To aid memorization, player often practise a standard series of strikes from these angles, called an abecedario (Spanish for \"alphabet\").",
              "These are beginner strikes or the \"ABC's\" of Arnis.",
              "While most systems do incorporate a numbering system for the angles of attack, not all use the same numbering system, so always get clarification before training in a new system or style.",
              "Additionally, while the angles are numbered for ease of discussion, the numbers do not generally define how the attack is thrown.",
              "That is to say, usually (excluding thrusts) a #1 angle, means an attack that starts on the right side of the practitioner and comes down at about a 45\u00b0 from right to left.",
              "But, it does not matter whether this is done with the right or left hand (forehand or backhand) or if the hit continues through the target or returns back along the same line.",
              "Some angles of attack and some strikes have characteristic names: Many Arnis techniques have Spanish names, because Spanish was the lingua franca spoken during colonial times among the natives, who spoke over 170 languages across 7,600 islands.",
              "Arnis techniques are generally based on the assumption that both student and opponent are very highly trained and well prepared.",
              "Thus, Arnis tends to favour extreme caution, always considering the possibility of a failed technique or an unexpected knife.",
              "On the other hand, the practitioner is assumed to be capable of quick, precise strikes.",
              "The general principle is that an opponent's ability to attack should be destroyed rather than trying to injure and convince them to stop.",
              "Many strikes are therefore aimed at the hands and arms, hoping to break the hand holding the weapon, or cut the nerves and tendons controlling it (the concept of \"defanging the snake\").",
              "Strike to the eyes and legs are also important.",
              "This is summed up in a popular mnemonic: \"Stick seeks bone, blade seeks flesh\".",
              "Mano Mano is the empty-hand component of Filipino martial arts, particularly Arnis.",
              "The term translates as \"hands\" or \"hand-[to]-hand\" and comes from the Spanish mano (\"hand\").",
              "It is also known as suntukan or panununtukan in Luzon and pangamot in the Visayas, as well as De Cadena, Cadena de Mano or Arnis de Mano in some FMA systems. American colonists referred to it as \"combat judo\" or \"Filipino boxing\".",
              "Mano mano moves include kicking, punching, locking, throwing, and dumog (grappling).",
              "Filipino martial artists regard empty hands as another weapon, and all movements of Mano Mano are directly based on weapon techniques.",
              "In Arnis, weapons are seen as extensions of the body, so training with weapons naturally leads to proficiency in bare-handed combat.",
              "For this reason, Mano Mano is often taught in higher grades after weapons training has been mastered, as advanced students are expected to be able to apply experience with weapons to unarmed fighting.",
              "This not always the case though, as some systems of Arnis start with (and at times only consist of) empty hands fighting.",
              "Some notable masters of Mano Mano include: Paninipa, Pagsipa, Pananadiyak, Pagtadiyak, and Sikaran (all terms for \"kicking\" in various regions, dialects and styles) are components of eskrima that focus on knees, tripping, low-line kicks, and stomps.",
              "Pananjakman is also a term used in Filipino-American-developed and Western FMA systems, usually referring to the system from the Lucky Lucaylucay, Floro Villabrille and Dan Inosanto blend lineage.",
              "Except for the distinct style of Sikaran from the Baras area of the province of Rizal, which also uses high kicks, kicking as a separate art is never taught by itself in the Philippines, and this practice is only done in the West with Pananjakman.",
              "Pananjakman is usually taught together with Panantukan.",
              "Paninipa can be regarded as the study of leg muscles and bones and how they are connected, with the goal of either inflicting pain or outright breaking or dislocating the bones.",
              "Most striking techniques involve applying pressure to bend the target areas in unnatural ways so as to injure or break them.",
              "Such pressure may be delivered in the form of a heel smash, a toe kick, a stomp, or a knee.",
              "Targets include the groin, thighs, knees, shins, ankles, feet and toes.",
              "The upper body is used only for defensive maneuvers, making pananadiyak ideal for when combatants are engaged in a clinch.",
              "When used effectively, the strikes can bring an opponent to the ground or otherwise end an altercation by making them too weak to stand.",
              "Fundamental techniques include kicking or smashing the ankle to force it either towards or away from the opposite foot (severe supination or pronation, respectively), heel-stomping the top of the foot where it meets the lower leg so as to break or crush the numerous bones or otherwise disrupt the opponent's balance, and smashing the opponents knee from the side to break the knee (with severe supination and pronation as the desired result).",
              "Several classes of exercises, such as sombrada, contrada, sinawali, hubud-lubud and sequidas, initially presented to the public as a set of organized drills by the Inosanto school, are expressly designed to allow partners to move quickly and experiment with variations while remaining safe.",
              "For example, in a sumbrada drill, one partner feeds an attack, which the other counters, flowing into a counterattack, which is then countered, flowing into a counterattack, and so on.",
              "The hubud-lubud or hubad-lubad from Doce Pares is frequently used as a type of \"generator\" drill, where one is forced to act and think fast.",
              "Initially, students learn a specific series of attacks, counters, and counter-attacks.",
              "As they advance they can add minor variations, change the footwork, or switch to completely different attacks;",
              "eventually the exercise becomes almost completely free-form.",
              "Palakaw, from the Balintawak style, are un-choreographed and random defensive and offensive moves.",
              "Palakaw in Cebuano means a walk-through or rehearsing the different strike angles and defenses.",
              "It may be known as corridas, or striking without any order or pattern.",
              "Disarms, take-downs, and other techniques usually break the flow of such a drill, but they are usually initiated from such a sequence of movements to force the student to adapt to a variety of situations.",
              "A common practice is to begin a drill with each student armed with two weapons.",
              "Once the drill is flowing, if a student sees an opportunity to disarm their opponent, they do, but the drill continues until both students are empty-handed.",
              "Some drills use only a single weapon per pair, and the partners take turns disarming each other.",
              "Seguidas drills, taken from the San Miguel system, are sets of hitting and movement patterns usually involving stick and dagger.",
              "Rhythm, while an essential part of eskrima drills, is emphasized more in the United States and Europe, where a regular beat serves a guide for students to follow.",
              "To ensure safety, participants perform most drills at a constant pace, which they increase as they progress.",
              "The rhythm, together with the southern Filipino attire of a vest and sashed pants, is commonly mistaken for some sort of tradition when practising eskrima in the Philippines \u2013 perhaps incorrectly derived from traditional rhythm-based dances or an attempt to add a sense of ethnicity.",
              "Eskrima is usually practised in the Philippines without a rhythm, off-beat or out of rhythm.",
              "The diversity of Filipino martial arts means that there is no officially established standard uniform in eskrima.",
              "The live hand (or alive hand) is the opposite hand of the practitioner that does not contain the main weapon.",
              "The heavy usage of the live hand is an important concept and distinguishing hallmark of eskrima.",
              "Even (or especially) when empty, the live hand can be used as a companion weapon by eskrima practitioners.",
              "As opposed to most weapon systems like fencing where the off-hand is hidden and not used to prevent it from being hit, eskrima actively uses the live hand for trapping, locking, supporting weapon blocks, checking, disarming, striking and controlling the opponent.",
              "The usage of the live hand is one of the most evident examples of how Eskrima's method of starting with weapons training leads to effective empty hand techniques.",
              "Because of Doble Baston (double weapons) or Espada y Daga (sword and parrying dagger) ambidextrous weapon muscle memory conditioning, Eskrima practitioners find it easy to use the off-hand actively once they transition from using it with a weapon to an empty hand.",
              "Doble baston, and less frequently doble olisi, are common names for a group of techniques involving two sticks.",
              "The art is more commonly known around the world as Sinawali meaning \"to weave\".",
              "The term Sinawali is taken from a matting called sawali that is commonly used in the tribal Nipa Huts.",
              "It is made up of woven pieces of palm leaf and used for both flooring and walls.",
              "This technique requires the user to use both left and right weapons in an equal manner;",
              "many co-ordination drills are used to help the practitioner become more ambidextrous.",
              "It is the section of the art that is taught mainly at the intermediate levels and above and is considered one of the most important areas of learning in the art.",
              "Sinawali refers to the activity of \"weaving\", as applied Eskrima with reference to a set of two-person, two-weapon exercises.",
              "The term comes from \"Sawali\", the woven material that typically forms the walls of nipa huts.",
              "Sinawali exercises provide eskrima practitioners with basic skills and motions relevant to a mode of two-weapon blocking and response method called Doblete.",
              "Sinawali training is often introduced to novices to help them develop certain fundamental skills \u2013 including: body positioning and distance relative to an opponent, rotation of the body and the proper turning radius, recognition of one's center of gravity, eye\u2013hand coordination, target perception and recognition, increased ambidexterity, recognition and performance of rhythmic structures for upper body movement, and muscular developments important to the art, especially, the wrist and forearm regions.",
              "It helps teach the novice eskrimador proper positioning while swinging a weapon.",
              "The Chinese and Malay communities of the Philippines have practiced eskrima together with Kuntaw and Silat for centuries, so much so that many North Americans mistakenly believe silat to have originated in the Philippines.",
              "Some of the modern styles, particularly doce pares and Modern Arnis contain some elements of Japanese Martial Arts such as joint locks, throws, blocks, strikes, and groundwork, taken from: Jujutsu, Judo, Aikido and Karate as some of the founders obtained black belt Dan grades in some of these systems. Some eskrima styles are complementary with Chinese Wing Chun because of the nervous system conditioning and body mechanics when striking, twirling or swinging sticks.",
              "In Western countries, it is common to practice eskrima in conjunction with other martial arts, particularly Wing Chun, Jeet Kune Do and silat.",
              "As a result, there is some confusion between styles, systems, and lineage, because some people cross-train without giving due credit to the founders or principles of their arts.",
              "For example, American Kenpo and Kajukenbo cross-training traces back to the interactions between Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants in territorial/pre-statehood Hawaii, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the United States.",
              "In the United States the cross-training between eskrima and Jeet Kune Do Concepts as headed by Dan Inosanto of the Inosanto Academy in Marina del Rey, California, goes according to the maxim \"Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless\".",
              "Proponents of such training say the arts are very similar in many aspects and complement each other well.",
              "It has become marketable to offer eskrima classes in other traditional Asian martial arts studios in America but some practitioners of other eskrima styles often dismiss these lessons as debased versions of original training methods."

              "Arnis students start their instruction by learning to fight with weapons, and only advance to empty-hand training once the stick and knife techniques have been sufficiently mastered.",
              "This is in contrast to most other well-known Asian martial arts but it is justified by the principle that bare-handed moves are acquired naturally through the same exercises as the weapon techniques, making muscle memory an important aspect of the teaching.",
              "It is also based on the obvious fact that an armed person who is trained has the advantage over a trained unarmed person, and serves to condition students to fight against armed assailants.",
              "Most systems of Arnis apply a single set of techniques for the stick, knife, and empty hands, a concept sometimes referred to as motion grouping.",
              "Since the weapon is seen as simply an extension of the body, the same angles and footwork are used either with or without a weapon.",
              "The reason for this is probably historical, because tribal warriors went into battle armed and only resorted to bare-handed fighting after losing their weapons.",
              "Many systems begin training with two weapons, either a pair of sticks or a stick and a wooden knife.",
              "These styles emphasise keeping both hands full and never moving them in the same direction, and trains practitioners to become ambidextrous.",
              "For example, one stick may strike the head while the other hits the arm.",
              "Such training develops the ability to use both limbs independently, a valuable skill, even when working with a single weapon.",
              "A core concept and distinct feature of Filipino martial arts is the Live Hand.",
              "Even when as a practitioner wields only one weapon, the extra hand is used to control, trap or disarm an opponent's weapon and to aid in blocking, joint locking and manipulation of the opponent or other simultaneous motions such as bicep destruction with the live hand.",
              "The most basic and common weapon in Arnis is the baston or yantok.",
              "They are typically constructed from rattan, an inexpensive stem from a type of Southeast Asian vine.",
              "Hard and durable yet lightweight, it shreds only under the worst abuse and does not splinter like wood, making it a safer training tool.",
              "This aspect makes it useful in defense against blades.",
              "Kamagong (ironwood or ebony) and bahi (heart of the palm) are sometimes used after being charred and hardened.",
              "These hardwoods are generally not used for sparring, however, as they are dense enough to cause serious injury, but traditional sparring does not include weapon to body contact.",
              "The participants are skilled enough to parry and counterstrike, showing respect in not intentionally hitting the training partner.",
              "In modern times, many Arnis practitioners have also come to wear head and hand protection while sparring with rattan sticks, or otherwise use padded bastons.",
              "Some modern schools also use sticks made out of aluminium or other metals, or modern high-impact plastics.",
              "Baraw is a Cebuano term used in eskrima that means knife or dagger.",
              "The term Baraw is more commonly used on the Cebu Island in the Visayan region whereas other islands and regions more commonly use the term Daga but both terms are often interchangeable within the Filipino martial arts community.",
              "The terms Baraw and Daga can be used either as Solo Baraw or Solo Daga associated with single knife fighting and defense systems, Doble Baraw or Doble Daga associated with the double knife fighting systems or even with a combination of long and short weapons e.",

              "The practitioners must conform to criteria based on the number of years of training and level of proficiency in technical skills.",
              "Practitioners are screened by the rank promotion committee to determine their rank in the grading system.",
              "Most systems recognize that the technical nature of combat changes drastically as the distance between opponents changes, and generally classify the ranges into at least three categories.",
              "Each range has its characteristic techniques and footwork.",
              "Of course, some systems place more emphasis on certain ranges than others, but almost all recognize that being able to work in and control any range is essential.",
              "The Balintawak style for example, uses long-, medium- and short-range fighting techniques, but focuses on the short-range.",
              "To control the range, and for numerous other purposes, good footwork is essential.",
              "Most eskrima systems explain their footwork in terms of triangles: normally when moving in any direction two feet occupy two corners of the triangle and the step is to the third corner such that no leg crosses the other at any time.",
              "The shape and size of the triangle must be adapted to the particular situation.",
              "The style of footwork and the standing position vary greatly from school to school and from practitioner to practitioner.",
              "For a very traditional school, conscious of battlefield necessities, stances are usually very low, often with one knee on the ground, and footwork is complex, involving many careful cross-steps to allow practitioners to cope with multiple opponents.",
              "The Villabrille and San Miguel styles are usually taught in this way.",
              "Systems that have been adapted to duels or sporting matches generally employ simpler footwork, focusing on a single opponent.",
              "North American schools tend to use much more upright stances, as this puts less stress on the legs, but there are some exceptions.",
              "Many systems, including the Inosanto/Lacosta system of escrima/kali recognize and teach 3 basic ranges: long range (largo), medium range (medio) and short range (corto).",
              "The long range is typically defined as being able to hit the opponents lead/weapon hand with your weapon/stick only.",
              "Medium range is where you are able to strike the opponent's body/head with your weapon/stick while also checking/monitoring the opponent's lead hand with your rear/live hand.",
              "And the short range is when you can strike the opponent's body/head with your rear/live hand or being able to strike the opponent's head/body with the hilt/punyo end of the weapon/stick.",
              "Some styles or systems may also define a closer range for elbows to the head or body, or grappling.",
              "Many Filipino systems focus on defending against and/or reacting to angles of attack rather than particular strikes.",
              "The theory behind this is that virtually all types of hand-to-hand attacks (barehanded or with a weapon) hit or reach a combatant via these angles of attack and the reasoning is that it is more efficient to learn to defend against different angles of attack rather than learn to defend against particular styles, particular techniques or particular weapons.",
              "For instance, the technique for defending against an attack angle that comes overhead from the right is very similar whether the attacker uses bare fists, a knife, a sword or a spear.",
              "Older styles gave each angle a name, but more recent systems tend to simply number them.",
              "Many systems have twelve standard angles, though some have as few as 5, and others as many as 72.",
              "Although the exact angles, the order they are numbered in (numerado), and the way the player executes moves vary from system to system, most are based upon Filipino cosmology.",
              "These standard angles describe exercises.",
              "To aid memorization, player often practise a standard series of strikes from these angles, called an abecedario (Spanish for \"alphabet\").",
              "These are beginner strikes or the \"ABC's\" of Arnis.",
              "While most systems do incorporate a numbering system for the angles of attack, not all use the same numbering system, so always get clarification before training in a new system or style.",
              "Additionally, while the angles are numbered for ease of discussion, the numbers do not generally define how the attack is thrown.",
              "That is to say, usually (excluding thrusts) a #1 angle, means an attack that starts on the right side of the practitioner and comes down at about a 45\u00b0 from right to left.",
              "But, it does not matter whether this is done with the right or left hand (forehand or backhand) or if the hit continues through the target or returns back along the same line.",
              "Some angles of attack and some strikes have characteristic names: Many Arnis techniques have Spanish names, because Spanish was the lingua franca spoken during colonial times among the natives, who spoke over 170 languages across 7,600 islands.",
              "Arnis techniques are generally based on the assumption that both student and opponent are very highly trained and well prepared.",
              "Thus, Arnis tends to favour extreme caution, always considering the possibility of a failed technique or an unexpected knife.",
              "On the other hand, the practitioner is assumed to be capable of quick, precise strikes.",
              "The general principle is that an opponent's ability to attack should be destroyed rather than trying to injure and convince them to stop.",
              "Many strikes are therefore aimed at the hands and arms, hoping to break the hand holding the weapon, or cut the nerves and tendons controlling it (the concept of \"defanging the snake\").",
              "Strike to the eyes and legs are also important.",
              "This is summed up in a popular mnemonic: \"Stick seeks bone, blade seeks flesh\".",
              "Mano Mano is the empty-hand component of Filipino martial arts, particularly Arnis.",
              "The term translates as \"hands\" or \"hand-[to]-hand\" and comes from the Spanish mano (\"hand\").",
              "It is also known as suntukan or panununtukan in Luzon and pangamot in the Visayas, as well as De Cadena, Cadena de Mano or Arnis de Mano in some FMA systems. American colonists referred to it as \"combat judo\" or \"Filipino boxing\".",
              "Mano mano moves include kicking, punching, locking, throwing, and dumog (grappling).",
              "Filipino martial artists regard empty hands as another weapon, and all movements of Mano Mano are directly based on weapon techniques.",
              "In Arnis, weapons are seen as extensions of the body, so training with weapons naturally leads to proficiency in bare-handed combat.",
              "For this reason, Mano Mano is often taught in higher grades after weapons training has been mastered, as advanced students are expected to be able to apply experience with weapons to unarmed fighting.",
              "This not always the case though, as some systems of Arnis start with (and at times only consist of) empty hands fighting.",
              "Some notable masters of Mano Mano include: Paninipa, Pagsipa, Pananadiyak, Pagtadiyak, and Sikaran (all terms for \"kicking\" in various regions, dialects and styles) are components of eskrima that focus on knees, tripping, low-line kicks, and stomps.",
              "Pananjakman is also a term used in Filipino-American-developed and Western FMA systems, usually referring to the system from the Lucky Lucaylucay, Floro Villabrille and Dan Inosanto blend lineage.",
              "Except for the distinct style of Sikaran from the Baras area of the province of Rizal, which also uses high kicks, kicking as a separate art is never taught by itself in the Philippines, and this practice is only done in the West with Pananjakman.",
              "Pananjakman is usually taught together with Panantukan.",
              "Paninipa can be regarded as the study of leg muscles and bones and how they are connected, with the goal of either inflicting pain or outright breaking or dislocating the bones.",
              "Most striking techniques involve applying pressure to bend the target areas in unnatural ways so as to injure or break them.",
              "Such pressure may be delivered in the form of a heel smash, a toe kick, a stomp, or a knee.",
              "Targets include the groin, thighs, knees, shins, ankles, feet and toes.",
              "The upper body is used only for defensive maneuvers, making pananadiyak ideal for when combatants are engaged in a clinch.",
              "When used effectively, the strikes can bring an opponent to the ground or otherwise end an altercation by making them too weak to stand.",
              "Fundamental techniques include kicking or smashing the ankle to force it either towards or away from the opposite foot (severe supination or pronation, respectively), heel-stomping the top of the foot where it meets the lower leg so as to break or crush the numerous bones or otherwise disrupt the opponent's balance, and smashing the opponents knee from the side to break the knee (with severe supination and pronation as the desired result).",
              "Several classes of exercises, such as sombrada, contrada, sinawali, hubud-lubud and sequidas, initially presented to the public as a set of organized drills by the Inosanto school, are expressly designed to allow partners to move quickly and experiment with variations while remaining safe.",
              "For example, in a sumbrada drill, one partner feeds an attack, which the other counters, flowing into a counterattack, which is then countered, flowing into a counterattack, and so on.",
              "The hubud-lubud or hubad-lubad from Doce Pares is frequently used as a type of \"generator\" drill, where one is forced to act and think fast.",
              "Initially, students learn a specific series of attacks, counters, and counter-attacks.",
              "As they advance they can add minor variations, change the footwork, or switch to completely different attacks;",
              "eventually the exercise becomes almost completely free-form.",
              "Palakaw, from the Balintawak style, are un-choreographed and random defensive and offensive moves.",
              "Palakaw in Cebuano means a walk-through or rehearsing the different strike angles and defenses.",
              "It may be known as corridas, or striking without any order or pattern.",
              "Disarms, take-downs, and other techniques usually break the flow of such a drill, but they are usually initiated from such a sequence of movements to force the student to adapt to a variety of situations.",
              "A common practice is to begin a drill with each student armed with two weapons.",
              "Once the drill is flowing, if a student sees an opportunity to disarm their opponent, they do, but the drill continues until both students are empty-handed.",
              "Some drills use only a single weapon per pair, and the partners take turns disarming each other.",
              "Seguidas drills, taken from the San Miguel system, are sets of hitting and movement patterns usually involving stick and dagger.",
              "Rhythm, while an essential part of eskrima drills, is emphasized more in the United States and Europe, where a regular beat serves a guide for students to follow.",
              "To ensure safety, participants perform most drills at a constant pace, which they increase as they progress.",
              "The rhythm, together with the southern Filipino attire of a vest and sashed pants, is commonly mistaken for some sort of tradition when practising eskrima in the Philippines \u2013 perhaps incorrectly derived from traditional rhythm-based dances or an attempt to add a sense of ethnicity.",
              "Eskrima is usually practised in the Philippines without a rhythm, off-beat or out of rhythm.",
              "The diversity of Filipino martial arts means that there is no officially established standard uniform in eskrima.",
              "The live hand (or alive hand) is the opposite hand of the practitioner that does not contain the main weapon.",
              "The heavy usage of the live hand is an important concept and distinguishing hallmark of eskrima.",
              "Even (or especially) when empty, the live hand can be used as a companion weapon by eskrima practitioners.",
              "As opposed to most weapon systems like fencing where the off-hand is hidden and not used to prevent it from being hit, eskrima actively uses the live hand for trapping, locking, supporting weapon blocks, checking, disarming, striking and controlling the opponent.",
              "The usage of the live hand is one of the most evident examples of how Eskrima's method of starting with weapons training leads to effective empty hand techniques.",
              "Because of Doble Baston (double weapons) or Espada y Daga (sword and parrying dagger) ambidextrous weapon muscle memory conditioning, Eskrima practitioners find it easy to use the off-hand actively once they transition from using it with a weapon to an empty hand.",
              "Doble baston, and less frequently doble olisi, are common names for a group of techniques involving two sticks.",
              "The art is more commonly known around the world as Sinawali meaning \"to weave\".",
              "The term Sinawali is taken from a matting called sawali that is commonly used in the tribal Nipa Huts.",
              "It is made up of woven pieces of palm leaf and used for both flooring and walls.",
              "This technique requires the user to use both left and right weapons in an equal manner;",
              "many co-ordination drills are used to help the practitioner become more ambidextrous.",
              "It is the section of the art that is taught mainly at the intermediate levels and above and is considered one of the most important areas of learning in the art.",
              "Sinawali refers to the activity of \"weaving\", as applied Eskrima with reference to a set of two-person, two-weapon exercises.",
              "The term comes from \"Sawali\", the woven material that typically forms the walls of nipa huts.",
              "Sinawali exercises provide eskrima practitioners with basic skills and motions relevant to a mode of two-weapon blocking and response method called Doblete.",
              "Sinawali training is often introduced to novices to help them develop certain fundamental skills \u2013 including: body positioning and distance relative to an opponent, rotation of the body and the proper turning radius, recognition of one's center of gravity, eye\u2013hand coordination, target perception and recognition, increased ambidexterity, recognition and performance of rhythmic structures for upper body movement, and muscular developments important to the art, especially, the wrist and forearm regions.",
              "It helps teach the novice eskrimador proper positioning while swinging a weapon.",
              "The Chinese and Malay communities of the Philippines have practiced eskrima together with Kuntaw and Silat for centuries, so much so that many North Americans mistakenly believe silat to have originated in the Philippines.",
              "Some of the modern styles, particularly doce pares and Modern Arnis contain some elements of Japanese Martial Arts such as joint locks, throws, blocks, strikes, and groundwork, taken from: Jujutsu, Judo, Aikido and Karate as some of the founders obtained black belt Dan grades in some of these systems. Some eskrima styles are complementary with Chinese Wing Chun because of the nervous system conditioning and body mechanics when striking, twirling or swinging sticks.",
              "In Western countries, it is common to practice eskrima in conjunction with other martial arts, particularly Wing Chun, Jeet Kune Do and silat.",
              "As a result, there is some confusion between styles, systems, and lineage, because some people cross-train without giving due credit to the founders or principles of their arts.",
              "For example, American Kenpo and Kajukenbo cross-training traces back to the interactions between Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants in territorial/pre-statehood Hawaii, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the United States.",
              "In the United States the cross-training between eskrima and Jeet Kune Do Concepts as headed by Dan Inosanto of the Inosanto Academy in Marina del Rey, California, goes according to the maxim \"Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless\".",
              "Proponents of such training say the arts are very similar in many aspects and complement each other well.",
              "It has become marketable to offer eskrima classes in other traditional Asian martial arts studios in America but some practitioners of other eskrima styles often dismiss these lessons as debased versions of original training methods."

              "have Spanish names suggest an influence.",
              "Some argue though that Spanish names in the martial art simply reflect the fact that Spanish was the lingua franca of the Philippines until the early 20th century, and that actual Spanish martial influence was limited.",
              "What is certain is that the Spaniards brought with them and used their bladed weapon arts (including the system of Destreza developed by Carranza) when they started colonizing the archipelago in the 16th century.",
              "What is also known is that the Spaniards recruited soldiers from Mexico[38] and Peru[39] and sent them to fortify the Philippines and they had also trained mercenaries and warriors from local people like the Pangasinenses, Kapampangans, Tagalogs, Ilonggos, Cebuanos and Warays to pacify regions and put down revolts.",

              "And it was all the worse because these people had been trained in the military art in our own schools in the presidios (fortified outposts) of Ternate, Zamboanga, Jolo, Caraga and other places where their valor was well known;",
              "but this needs the help of ours, and so they say that a Spaniard plus three Pampangos equal four Spaniards.",
              "[41] Logic dictates that these native warriors and foreign soldiers would have passed on to very close friends and family members these newly learned skills to augment already existing and effective local ones.",
              "They would have also shared tactics and techniques with each other when placed in the same military group and fighting on the same side in foreign regions such as Formosa, Mindanao, the Moluccas[40] and the Marianas.",
              "[42] One of the more prominent features of Arnis that point to possible Spanish influence is the Espada y Daga (Spanish for \"sword and dagger\") method, a term also used in Spanish fencing.",
              "Filipino espada y daga differs somewhat from European rapier and dagger techniques;",

              "[44] Having done comparative studies, Kalis Ilustrisimo archivist Romeo Macapagal also estimates that 40% of the blade-oriented style of Antonio \"Tatang\" Ilustrisimo\u2020 (1904\u20131997) descends from European styles, brought by the Spanish.",
              "[45] After the Spanish colonized the Philippines, a decree was set that prohibited civilians from carrying full-sized swords (such as the Kris and the Kampilan).",
              "Despite this, the practitioners found ways to maintain and keep the arts alive, using sticks made out of rattan rather than swords, as well as small knives wielded like swords.",
              "Some of the arts were passed down from one generation to the other.",
              "Sometimes the art took the form choreographed dances such as the Sakuting stick dance[46] or during mock battles at Moro-moro (Moros y Cristianos) stage plays.",
              "Also as a result, a unique and complex stick-based technique evolved in the Visayas and Luzon regions.",
              "The southern Mindanao retains almost exclusively blade-oriented techniques, as the Spaniards and Americans never fully conquered the southern parts of this island.",
              "[47] Although Arnis combines native fighting techniques with old Spanish fencing and other influences, a degree of systematization was achieved over time, resulting in a distinguishable Philippine martial art.",
              "With time, a system for the teaching of the basics also evolved.",
              "However, with the exception of a few older and more established systems, it was previously common to pass the art from generation to generation in an informal approach.",
              "This has made attempts to trace the lineage of a practitioner difficult.",
              "For example, aside from learning from their family members like his uncle Regino Ilustrisimo, Antonio Ilustrisimo seemed to have learned to fight while sailing around the Philippines, while his cousin and student Floro Villabrille claimed to have been also taught by a blind Moro princess in the mountains;",

              "[48][49] Unlike in the West where Medieval and Renaissance combative and self-defense blade arts have gone almost extinct (having devolved into sport fencing with the advent of firearms),[50] blade fighting in the Philippines is a living art.",
              "Local folk in the Philippines are much more likely to carry knives than guns.",
              "They are commonly carried as tools by farmers, used by street vendors to prepare coconuts, pineapples, watermelons, other fruits and meats, and balisongs are cheap to procure in the streets as well as being easily concealed.",
              "In fact, in some areas in the countryside, carrying a farming knife like the itak or bolo was a sign that one was making a living because of the nature of work in those areas.",
              "[51] In the country of Palau, the local term for Filipino is chad ra oles, which literally means \"people of the knife\" because of Filipinos' reputation for carrying knives and using them in fights.",
              "[52] Soldiers and mercenaries trained in the Philippines which were recruited by France which was then in an alliance with Spain, had fought in Cambodia and Vietnam justified by defending newly converted Catholic populations from persecutions and had assisted France in establishing French Cochinchina centered in Saigon.",

              "This is in contrast to most other well-known Asian martial arts but it is justified by the principle that bare-handed moves are acquired naturally through the same exercises as the weapon techniques, making muscle memory an important aspect of the teaching.",
              "It is also based on the obvious fact that an armed person who is trained has the advantage over a trained unarmed person, and serves to condition students to fight against armed assailants.",
              "Most systems of Arnis apply a single set of techniques for the stick, knife, and empty hands, a concept sometimes referred to as motion grouping.",
              "Since the weapon is seen as simply an extension of the body, the same angles and footwork are used either with or without a weapon.",
              "The reason for this is probably historical, because tribal warriors went into battle armed and only resorted to bare-handed fighting after losing their weapons.",
              "Many systems begin training with two weapons, either a pair of sticks or a stick and a wooden knife.",
              "These styles emphasise keeping both hands full and never moving them in the same direction, and trains practitioners to become ambidextrous.",
              "For example, one stick may strike the head while the other hits the arm.",
              "Such training develops the ability to use both limbs independently, a valuable skill, even when working with a single weapon.",
              "A core concept and distinct feature of Filipino martial arts is the Live Hand.",
              "Even when as a practitioner wields only one weapon, the extra hand is used to control, trap or disarm an opponent's weapon and to aid in blocking, joint locking and manipulation of the opponent or other simultaneous motions such as bicep destruction with the live hand.",
              "The most basic and common weapon in Arnis is the baston or yantok.",
              "They are typically constructed from rattan, an inexpensive stem from a type of Southeast Asian vine.",
              "Hard and durable yet lightweight, it shreds only under the worst abuse and does not splinter like wood, making it a safer training tool.",

              "Practitioners are screened by the rank promotion committee to determine their rank in the grading system.",
              "Most systems recognize that the technical nature of combat changes drastically as the distance between opponents changes, and generally classify the ranges into at least three categories.",
              "Each range has its characteristic techniques and footwork.",
              "Of course, some systems place more emphasis on certain ranges than others, but almost all recognize that being able to work in and control any range is essential.",
              "The Balintawak style for example, uses long-, medium- and short-range fighting techniques, but focuses on the short-range.",
              "To control the range, and for numerous other purposes, good footwork is essential.",
              "Most eskrima systems explain their footwork in terms of triangles: normally when moving in any direction two feet occupy two corners of the triangle and the step is to the third corner such that no leg crosses the other at any time.",
              "The shape and size of the triangle must be adapted to the particular situation.",
              "The style of footwork and the standing position vary greatly from school to school and from practitioner to practitioner.",
              "For a very traditional school, conscious of battlefield necessities, stances are usually very low, often with one knee on the ground, and footwork is complex, involving many careful cross-steps to allow practitioners to cope with multiple opponents.",
              "The Villabrille and San Miguel styles are usually taught in this way.",
              "Systems that have been adapted to duels or sporting matches generally employ simpler footwork, focusing on a single opponent.",
              "North American schools tend to use much more upright stances, as this puts less stress on the legs, but there are some exceptions.",
              "Many systems, including the Inosanto/Lacosta system of escrima/kali recognize and teach 3 basic ranges: long range (largo), medium range (medio) and short range (corto).",
              "The long range is typically defined as being able to hit the opponents lead/weapon hand with your weapon/stick only.",
              "Medium range is where you are able to strike the opponent's body/head with your weapon/stick while also checking/monitoring the opponent's lead hand with your rear/live hand.",
              "And the short range is when you can strike the opponent's body/head with your rear/live hand or being able to strike the opponent's head/body with the hilt/punyo end of the weapon/stick.",
              "Some styles or systems may also define a closer range for elbows to the head or body, or grappling.",
              "Many Filipino systems focus on defending against and/or reacting to angles of attack rather than particular strikes.",
              "The theory behind this is that virtually all types of hand-to-hand attacks (barehanded or with a weapon) hit or reach a combatant via these angles of attack and the reasoning is that it is more efficient to learn to defend against different angles of attack rather than learn to defend against particular styles, particular techniques or particular weapons.",
              "For instance, the technique for defending against an attack angle that comes overhead from the right is very similar whether the attacker uses bare fists, a knife, a sword or a spear.",
              "Older styles gave each angle a name, but more recent systems tend to simply number them.",
              "Many systems have twelve standard angles, though some have as few as 5, and others as many as 72.",
              "Although the exact angles, the order they are numbered in (numerado), and the way the player executes moves vary from system to system, most are based upon Filipino cosmology.",
              "These standard angles describe exercises.",
              "To aid memorization, player often practise a standard series of strikes from these angles, called an abecedario (Spanish for \"alphabet\").",
              "These are beginner strikes or the \"ABC's\" of Arnis.",
              "While most systems do incorporate a numbering system for the angles of attack, not all use the same numbering system, so always get clarification before training in a new system or style.",
              "Additionally, while the angles are numbered for ease of discussion, the numbers do not generally define how the attack is thrown.",
              "That is to say, usually (excluding thrusts) a #1 angle, means an attack that starts on the right side of the practitioner and comes down at about a 45\u00b0 from right to left.",
              "But, it does not matter whether this is done with the right or left hand (forehand or backhand) or if the hit continues through the target or returns back along the same line.",
              "Some angles of attack and some strikes have characteristic names: Many Arnis techniques have Spanish names, because Spanish was the lingua franca spoken during colonial times among the natives, who spoke over 170 languages across 7,600 islands.",
              "Arnis techniques are generally based on the assumption that both student and opponent are very highly trained and well prepared.",
              "Thus, Arnis tends to favour extreme caution, always considering the possibility of a failed technique or an unexpected knife.",
              "On the other hand, the practitioner is assumed to be capable of quick, precise strikes.",
              "The general principle is that an opponent's ability to attack should be destroyed rather than trying to injure and convince them to stop.",
              "Many strikes are therefore aimed at the hands and arms, hoping to break the hand holding the weapon, or cut the nerves and tendons controlling it (the concept of \"defanging the snake\").",
              "Strike to the eyes and legs are also important.",

              "Mano Mano is the empty-hand component of Filipino martial arts, particularly Arnis.",
              "The term translates as \"hands\" or \"hand-[to]-hand\" and comes from the Spanish mano (\"hand\").",
              "It is also known as suntukan or panununtukan in Luzon and pangamot in the Visayas, as well as De Cadena, Cadena de Mano or Arnis de Mano in some FMA systems. American colonists referred to it as \"combat judo\" or \"Filipino boxing\".",
              "Mano mano moves include kicking, punching, locking, throwing, and dumog (grappling).",
              "Filipino martial artists regard empty hands as another weapon, and all movements of Mano Mano are directly based on weapon techniques.",
              "In Arnis, weapons are seen as extensions of the body, so training with weapons naturally leads to proficiency in bare-handed combat.",
              "For this reason, Mano Mano is often taught in higher grades after weapons training has been mastered, as advanced students are expected to be able to apply experience with weapons to unarmed fighting.",
              "This not always the case though, as some systems of Arnis start with (and at times only consist of) empty hands fighting.",
              "Some notable masters of Mano Mano include: Paninipa, Pagsipa, Pananadiyak, Pagtadiyak, and Sikaran (all terms for \"kicking\" in various regions, dialects and styles) are components of eskrima that focus on knees, tripping, low-line kicks, and stomps.",
              "Pananjakman is also a term used in Filipino-American-developed and Western FMA systems, usually referring to the system from the Lucky Lucaylucay, Floro Villabrille and Dan Inosanto blend lineage.",
              "Except for the distinct style of Sikaran from the Baras area of the province of Rizal, which also uses high kicks, kicking as a separate art is never taught by itself in the Philippines, and this practice is only done in the West with Pananjakman.",
              "Pananjakman is usually taught together with Panantukan.",
              "Paninipa can be regarded as the study of leg muscles and bones and how they are connected, with the goal of either inflicting pain or outright breaking or dislocating the bones.",
              "Most striking techniques involve applying pressure to bend the target areas in unnatural ways so as to injure or break them.",
              "Such pressure may be delivered in the form of a heel smash, a toe kick, a stomp, or a knee.",
              "Targets include the groin, thighs, knees, shins, ankles, feet and toes.",
              "The upper body is used only for defensive maneuvers, making pananadiyak ideal for when combatants are engaged in a clinch.",
              "When used effectively, the strikes can bring an opponent to the ground or otherwise end an altercation by making them too weak to stand.",
              "Fundamental techniques include kicking or smashing the ankle to force it either towards or away from the opposite foot (severe supination or pronation, respectively), heel-stomping the top of the foot where it meets the lower leg so as to break or crush the numerous bones or otherwise disrupt the opponent's balance, and smashing the opponents knee from the side to break the knee (with severe supination and pronation as the desired result).",
              "Several classes of exercises, such as sombrada, contrada, sinawali, hubud-lubud and sequidas, initially presented to the public as a set of organized drills by the Inosanto school, are expressly designed to allow partners to move quickly and experiment with variations while remaining safe.",
              "For example, in a sumbrada drill, one partner feeds an attack, which the other counters, flowing into a counterattack, which is then countered, flowing into a counterattack, and so on.",
              "The hubud-lubud or hubad-lubad from Doce Pares is frequently used as a type of \"generator\" drill, where one is forced to act and think fast.",
              "Initially, students learn a specific series of attacks, counters, and counter-attacks.",
              "As they advance they can add minor variations, change the footwork, or switch to completely different attacks;",
              "eventually the exercise becomes almost completely free-form.",
              "Palakaw, from the Balintawak style, are un-choreographed and random defensive and offensive moves.",
              "Palakaw in Cebuano means a walk-through or rehearsing the different strike angles and defenses.",
              "It may be known as corridas, or striking without any order or pattern.",
              "Disarms, take-downs, and other techniques usually break the flow of such a drill, but they are usually initiated from such a sequence of movements to force the student to adapt to a variety of situations.",
              "A common practice is to begin a drill with each student armed with two weapons.",
              "Once the drill is flowing, if a student sees an opportunity to disarm their opponent, they do, but the drill continues until both students are empty-handed.",
              "Some drills use only a single weapon per pair, and the partners take turns disarming each other.",
              "Seguidas drills, taken from the San Miguel system, are sets of hitting and movement patterns usually involving stick and dagger.",
              "Rhythm, while an essential part of eskrima drills, is emphasized more in the United States and Europe, where a regular beat serves a guide for students to follow.",
              "To ensure safety, participants perform most drills at a constant pace, which they increase as they progress.",
              "The rhythm, together with the southern Filipino attire of a vest and sashed pants, is commonly mistaken for some sort of tradition when practising eskrima in the Philippines \u2013 perhaps incorrectly derived from traditional rhythm-based dances or an attempt to add a sense of ethnicity.",
              "Eskrima is usually practised in the Philippines without a rhythm, off-beat or out of rhythm.",
              "The diversity of Filipino martial arts means that there is no officially established standard uniform in eskrima.",
              "The live hand (or alive hand) is the opposite hand of the practitioner that does not contain the main weapon.",
              "The heavy usage of the live hand is an important concept and distinguishing hallmark of eskrima.",
              "Even (or especially) when empty, the live hand can be used as a companion weapon by eskrima practitioners.",
              "As opposed to most weapon systems like fencing where the off-hand is hidden and not used to prevent it from being hit, eskrima actively uses the live hand for trapping, locking, supporting weapon blocks, checking, disarming, striking and controlling the opponent.",
              "The usage of the live hand is one of the most evident examples of how Eskrima's method of starting with weapons training leads to effective empty hand techniques.",
              "Because of Doble Baston (double weapons) or Espada y Daga (sword and parrying dagger) ambidextrous weapon muscle memory conditioning, Eskrima practitioners find it easy to use the off-hand actively once they transition from using it with a weapon to an empty hand.",
              "Doble baston, and less frequently doble olisi, are common names for a group of techniques involving two sticks.",
              "The art is more commonly known around the world as Sinawali meaning \"to weave\".",
              "The term Sinawali is taken from a matting called sawali that is commonly used in the tribal Nipa Huts.",
              "It is made up of woven pieces of palm leaf and used for both flooring and walls.",
              "This technique requires the user to use both left and right weapons in an equal manner;",
              "many co-ordination drills are used to help the practitioner become more ambidextrous.",
              "It is the section of the art that is taught mainly at the intermediate levels and above and is considered one of the most important areas of learning in the art.",
              "Sinawali refers to the activity of \"weaving\", as applied Eskrima with reference to a set of two-person, two-weapon exercises.",
              "The term comes from \"Sawali\", the woven material that typically forms the walls of nipa huts.",
              "Sinawali exercises provide eskrima practitioners with basic skills and motions relevant to a mode of two-weapon blocking and response method called Doblete.",
              "Sinawali training is often introduced to novices to help them develop certain fundamental skills \u2013 including: body positioning and distance relative to an opponent, rotation of the body and the proper turning radius, recognition of one's center of gravity, eye\u2013hand coordination, target perception and recognition, increased ambidexterity, recognition and performance of rhythmic structures for upper body movement, and muscular developments important to the art, especially, the wrist and forearm regions.",
              "It helps teach the novice eskrimador proper positioning while swinging a weapon.",
              "The Chinese and Malay communities of the Philippines have practiced eskrima together with Kuntaw and Silat for centuries, so much so that many North Americans mistakenly believe silat to have originated in the Philippines.",
              "Some of the modern styles, particularly doce pares and Modern Arnis contain some elements of Japanese Martial Arts such as joint locks, throws, blocks, strikes, and groundwork, taken from: Jujutsu, Judo, Aikido and Karate as some of the founders obtained black belt Dan grades in some of these systems. Some eskrima styles are complementary with Chinese Wing Chun because of the nervous system conditioning and body mechanics when striking, twirling or swinging sticks.",
              "In Western countries, it is common to practice eskrima in conjunction with other martial arts, particularly Wing Chun, Jeet Kune Do and silat.",
              "As a result, there is some confusion between styles, systems, and lineage, because some people cross-train without giving due credit to the founders or principles of their arts.",
              "For example, American Kenpo and Kajukenbo cross-training traces back to the interactions between Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants in territorial/pre-statehood Hawaii, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the United States.",
              "In the United States the cross-training between eskrima and Jeet Kune Do Concepts as headed by Dan Inosanto of the Inosanto Academy in Marina del Rey, California, goes according to the maxim \"Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless\".",
              "Proponents of such training say the arts are very similar in many aspects and complement each other well.",
              "It has become marketable to offer eskrima classes in other traditional Asian martial arts studios in America but some practitioners of other eskrima styles often dismiss these lessons as debased versions of original training methods."

              "It is common to hear that Capoeira and Eskrima, martial arts that developed under Portuguese and Spanish colonial rule respectively, both survived their colonial regimes by being hidden in dance.",
              "Yet there is no Capoeira without \u2018ginga\u2019 (sway) and there is evidence for Eskrima being an adaptation of Spanish swordsmanship taught to Christianised Filipinos by Jesuit \u2018warrior\u2019 Priests to repulse a perceived Muslim pirate threat from the South.",
              "[1] In the search for identity, and history, language becomes a surprising ally.",
              "Martial Arts are a multi-dimensional practice, constituted by the varied classes of phenomena (eg.",
              "technical emphasis, tactics, material weaponry, teaching methodology, philosophy, social hierarchy etc.)",
              "that construct the very existence of a given martial art style.",
              "[2] Such styles are inevitably culturally-historically located, emerging from complex socio-political contexts.",
              "The forms of martial art thus differ, sometimes dramatically, and are irreducible to simple definitions such as self-defence methods, or combat sports;",
              "and categories such as \u2018modern\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 collapse under close scrutiny.",
              "[3] Despite this, Bowman has argued that \u201cMartial arts as a cluster of familiar ideas, motifs, images, and as a category has certainly achieved stabilization in contemporary discourses, even if it lacks both precision and a stable referent\u201d (p.",
              "58).",
              "[4] Cautiously then, I will provide a brief introduction to aspects of the history culture of two particular arts, Capoeira (the Afro-Brazilian \u201cdance-fighting\u201d art), and Eskrima or Arnis de Mano (the Filipino national \u201cstick-fighting\u201d sport).",
              "In terms of appearance these arts would seem to have little in common.",
              "However, what may not be immediately obvious, is that both register traces of an historical connection with the Iberian world (as prior colonies of Portugal and Spain respectively), and offer particular insights into the post-colonial landscapes of their respective martial art traditions, in which history is both remembered and forgotten, and there exists within tradition a respect for inheritance and innovation.",
              "Capoeira is frequently described as an Afro-Brazilian martial art.",
              "The term Capoeiristas use to describe the art themselves is jogo (a game).",
              "The Jogo de Capoeira (game of Capoeira) in its contemporary form, is played to the pulsating rhythms of a berimbau (musical bow), atabaque (conga-like drum), and pandeiro (a type of tambourine).",
              "Originally developed by African slaves living in Brazil\u2019s Senzalas (slaves houses) in the 1700s and 1800s, Capoeira has roots in West African courtship and war dances;",
              "and influenced the peacock-like break-dancing culture of the late 1970s.",
              "[5] When the berimbau calls, Capoeiristas stand shoulder to shoulder forming a roda (circle) within which the players enter to play the game.",
              "Those forming the circle keep cadence with their clapping.",
              "During the jogo each player attempts to use their malendragem (trickery) and malicia (cunning) to read and out-wit the other in a physical game of chess, in which only the hands, feet, and head are typically permitted to touch the floor.",
              "Games are a complex dialogue of powerful kicks and daring evasions, artful acrobatics and playful theatrics.",
              "Adding further complexity to the jogo, Capoeira players must be responsive to changes in the rhythm being played on the berimbau, and listen carefully to the songs, sung in Portuguese (originally the language of the coloniser), being led by the Mestre (Master), that encourage certain actions in the game (such as the execution of a takedown), or make commentary, often humorously, on what is happening in the game (such as the suggestion that players are getting too close, or a game too heated, and that the combatants might need to find a bungalow, the historical equivalent of \u2018find a room\u2019).",
              "These ideas are often encoded in metaphor, and are missed by outsiders.",
              "Understanding develops among the young Capoeirista over time, as they become more familiar with the game and its rituals.",
              "The songs also carry the historical and cultural memory of oppression and the struggle for freedom, forming an important pedagogical tool in the shaping of a Capoeirista\u2019s outlook and identity.",
              "[6] Originally a game played by slaves on Sundays, Capoeira was sometimes known as vadiac\u0327ao (a word that directly translates as vagrancy or loitering, but is reinscribed within the art as something like \u2018just messing around\u2019).",
              "This concept is deeply embedded in the game, making it desirable to find the most beautiful, deceptive, and effortless route to the out-witting of your camarada (comrade), the correct reference for your opponent in the game, perhaps used in contrast to what would have been your real opponent or oppressor, the slave owner.",
              "Direct attack is rare, and is read as less skillful, unless executed with unexpected and unrivalled speed and precision.",
              "If you are to survive in this world, it should look like your oppressor walked into your leg, and not that you deliberately kicked them.",
              "In this regard, the defining characteristic of a Capoeira Mestre is mandinga, a word that implies \u2018magical power\u2019 and is exhibited through \u201cbodily acts of deception and trickery.",
              "\u201d[7] The mandigueiro (a term that would have once been translated as \u2018witch doctor\u2019 and means something like magician or wise-one), moves with Matrix-like power and insight, being able to deceive an adversary without ever \u201cbeing caught open or exposed.",
              "\u201d[8] It is the embodiment of maldade (wickedness), a capacity to be treacherous, and yet to appear the opposite.",
              "From the outside, the master\u2019s mandinga may give their moves the appearance of luck, or a capacity to bend reality to one\u2019s advantage, without exuding any obvious effort.",
              "Mandinga is learnt, rather than taught,[9] and represents the highest expression of the game, and a key marker of a skillful Capoeirista\u2019s identity.",
              "Despite the Mestre\u2019s possession of mandinga, there is a Capoeira song that celebrates that Capoeira\u2019s ends are unknown, even to the wisest of masters, suggesting a respect for the expected and continued evolution of the art.",
              "Within the landscape of Capoeira, the figure of the Mestre looms large in another way too, intimately connected with the idea of history, lineage, and respect for ancestral knowledge.",
              "There is a song lyric that translates \u201cBoy, who formed you?",
              "Who taught you the beauty, of dancing within the fight?",
              "\u201d[10] Here there is clear importance placed on knowing your roots, and giving thanks to those who have passed on this precious knowledge to you.",
              "This is not so much lineage as legitimation, as may be important in many East Asian martial arts, but hovers as a challenge to maintain a deep connection with, and sincere acknowledgement of, where your embodied knowledge has come from.",
              "Within the Capoeira community, your identity as a jogador (player) is forever tied to those from whom you have inherited your ability to dance in the fight.",
              "There is no (respectful) place for forgetting this.",
              "The Filipino martial art of Eskrima (the local pronunciation of the Spanish word for \u2018fencing\u2019) is a practical form of combat with baston (sticks) and bolo (what might be called \u2018working blades\u2019 or cutlass-style machete), most likely arising from a unique synergy of elements from a lingering Sino-Malay martial arts cultural background, and an ingenious Filipino re-engineering of the geometric logic of Spanish swordsmanship for local weapons.",
              "[11] The early evolution of the art remains uncertain.",
              "What we can say with some confidence is that the process of development of the many forms of Eskrima[12] occurred over three hundred years of colonisation in which Jesuit priests taught swordsmanship to local warriors;",
              "[13] was refined through revolution and rebellion during struggles for independence;",
              "formalised in the pre-WWII period through the formation of sporting clubs;",
              "and finally, officially recognised in 2009 as the country\u2019s national sport.",
              "Among ex-pat Filipinos living in the United States during the Civil Rights era, it became popular to refer to the art as Kali, from an old Tagalog word (meaning \u201cskill with blades\u201d), as a kind of resistance to use of the Spanish loan-word Eskrima (which accurately implied the practitioner\u2019s ability to wield a stick with the skill of a swordsman, but carried strong connotations of a colonial inheritance).",
              "Like Capoeira, language carries historical traces in this post-colonial martial art tradition, and while Kali practitioners may have desired to locate a pre-Hispanic origin for their art, they appear to have had little difficulty using Spanish terminology for many of their drills and sub-systems, Engganyo (feinting or deception), Numerado (by the numbers), Sombrada (a cover and counter drill), Espada y Daga (sword and dagger), Abierta and Serrada (open and closed guard positions), among much of the art\u2019s lingua franca, despite one source claiming that during the colonial period the number of Filipinos who could speak Spanish apparently never exceeded 2.",
              "8% of the population.",
              "[14] Of course, this suggests a strong Spanish influence, still registered in contemporary forms of the art, as does the art\u2019s official name, Arnis de Mano (literally \u2018armour of the hand\u2019), which most likely refers to the fact that the Eskrimador\u2019s only armour during the Juego Todo (no holds barred) stick-fighting duels that continued into the early 20th Century, was the stick in their hand.",
              "[15] Another, frequent refrain, links the term Arnis to the costumes of actors in Moro Moro plays in which the Christianised Visayan warriors, wearing Arnes (armour), successfully repulse the Muslim \u2018pirates\u2019 from Mindinao.",
              "[16] Such plays reconstruct and repeat an historical conflict which continues to have resonances today.",
              "[17] History gives way to myth rapidly within the Filipino martial tradition, as some Eskrimadors embellish stories of the past in order to claim prestige in the present.",
              "[18] It is common practice to rename the art in each successive generation, making genealogies complex, but providing legitimacy for innovation as a core aspect of tradition.",
              "Once taught mostly in families or villages, many Eskrima styles are treated like precious heirlooms, only to be shared with a trusted few, making their preservation an object of contemporary concern.",
              "Researching the history of martial arts emergent from post-colonial communities presents unique problems beyond the separation of fact from opinion, or the establishment of a plausible account.",
              "Complex sensibilities must be navigated.",
              "As an Anglo-Celtic student of these arts, I remain mindful that I am a guest in these lands.",
              "Within such post-colonial (not to mention \u2018globalised\u2019) martial arts landscapes, historical origins may be uncertain, but methods have been passed down through the generations, without the disruption seen in Europe, where there is a return to Medieval and Renaissance manuals to rehabilitate lost Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) traditions.",
              "Exploring martial history culture in the colonies presents an interesting point of reference for this work, given the visible legacies of these encounters between the metropol and the periphery;",

              "Unter den in den Vereinigten Staaten lebenden Expat-Filipinos der Bu\u0308rgerrechtszeit wurde die Kunst ha\u0308ufig als Kali bezeichnet.",
              "Diese Bezeichnung stammt von einem alten Tagalog-Wort (das \u201cGeschicklichkeit mit Klingen\u201d bedeutet), als eine Art Widerstand gegen die Verwendung des spanischen Lehnwortes Eskrima (das genau die Fa\u0308higkeit des Praktizierenden implizierte, einen Stock mit der Geschicklichkeit eines Schwertka\u0308mpfers zu fu\u0308hren, aber starke Konnotationen eines kolonialen Erbes trug).",
              "Wie Capoeira tra\u0308gt auch die Sprache in dieser postkolonialen Kampfkunsttradition historische Spuren.",
              "Obwohl die Kali-Praktizierenden vielleicht einen vorspanischen Ursprung fu\u0308r ihre Kunst ausfindig machen wollten, scheinen sie wenig Schwierigkeiten gehabt zu haben, spanische Begriffe fu\u0308r viele ihrer Drills und Subsysteme zu verwenden: Engganyo (Finten oder Ta\u0308uschung), Numerado (gema\u0308ss den Zahlen), Sombrada (ein Deckungs- und Konter-Drill), Espada y Daga (Schwert und Dolch), Abierta und Serrada (offene und geschlossene Wachpositionen), um nur einige Elemente der kampfsportbezogenen Lingua franca zu nennen.",

              "Postkolonialen Landschaften Die Erforschung der Geschichte von Kampfku\u0308nsten, die aus postkolonialen Gemeinschaften hervorgegangen sind, stellt einzigartige Probleme dar, die u\u0308ber die Trennung von Fakten und Meinungen oder die Erstellung einer plausiblen Darstellung hinausreichen.",

              "[3] Dennoch hat Bowman argumentiert, dass \u201cKampfkunst als ein Cluster von vertrauten Ideen, Motiven, Bildern und als Kategorie sicherlich eine Stabilisierung in den zeitgeno\u0308ssischen Diskursen erreicht hat, auch wenn es ihr sowohl an Pra\u0308zision als auch an einem stabilen Referenten fehlt\u201d.",
              "[4] Mit gewisser Vorsicht werde ich daher eine kurze Einfu\u0308hrung in kulturhistorische Aspekte von zwei besonderen Ku\u0308nsten geben, Capoeira (die afro-brasilianische \u201cTanz-Kampf\u201d-Kunst) und Eskrima oder Arnis de Mano (der philippinische \u201cStockkampf\u201d).",

              "Capoeira wird ha\u0308ufig als afro-brasilianische Kampfkunst beschrieben.",
              "Der Begriff, mit dem Capoeiristas die Kunst selbst beschreiben, ist Jogo (ein Spiel).",
              "Das Jogo de Capoeira (Spiel der Capoeira) in seiner heutigen Form wird zu den pulsierenden Rhythmen eines Berimbau (Musikbogen), Atabaque (Conga-a\u0308hnliche Trommel) und Pandeiro (eine Art Tamburin) gespielt.",
              "Urspru\u0308nglich von afrikanischen Sklav:innen entwickelt, die in den 1700er und 1800er Jahren in Brasiliens Senzalas (Sklavenha\u0308usern) lebten, hat Capoeira seine Wurzeln in westafrikanischen Balz- und Kriegsta\u0308nzen und beeinflusste die pfauenartige Breakdance-Kultur der spa\u0308ten 1970er Jahre.",
              "[5] Ruft der Berimbau, stehen die Capoeiristas Schulter an Schulter und bilden eine Roda (Kreis), in den die Spieler:innen eintreten, um das Spiel zu spielen.",
              "Diejenigen, die den Kreis bilden, halten klatschend die Kadenz aufrecht.",
              "Wa\u0308hrend des Jogo versuchen die Spieler:innen, ihre malendragem (List) und malicia (Gerissenheit) zu nutzen, um das Gegenu\u0308ber in einem physischen Schachspiel zu lesen und zu u\u0308berlisten, in dem normalerweise nur die Ha\u0308nde, Fu\u0308\u00dfe und der Kopf den Boden beru\u0308hren du\u0308rfen.",
              "Die Spiele sind ein komplexer Dialog aus kraftvollen Tritten und gewagten Ausweichmano\u0308vern, kunstvoller Akrobatik und spielerischer Theatralik.",
              "Um die Komplexita\u0308t des Jogo noch zu steigern, mu\u0308ssen Capoeira-Spieler:innen auf Vera\u0308nderungen im Rhythmus reagieren, der auf dem Berimbau gespielt wird, und aufmerksam auf die Lieder ho\u0308ren, die auf Portugiesisch (urspru\u0308nglich die Sprache der Kolonialherren) gesungen und vom Mestre (Meister) angefu\u0308hrt werden, der bestimmte Handlungen im Spiel ermutigt (wie z.",

              "Die Lieder tragen auch das historische und kulturelle Geda\u0308chtnis der Unterdru\u0308ckung und des Freiheitskampfes in sich und bilden so ein wichtiges pa\u0308dagogisches Werkzeug bei der Ausbildung der Weltanschauung und Identita\u0308t eines Capoeirista.",
              "[6] Urspru\u0308nglich ein Spiel, das von Sklaven an Sonntagen gespielt wurde, war Capoeira manchmal als vadiac\u0327ao bekannt (ein Wort, das direkt mit Landstreicherei oder Herumlungern u\u0308bersetzt wird, aber innerhalb der Kunst als so etwas wie \u201cnur herumalbern\u201d umgeschrieben wird).",
              "Dieses Konzept ist tief in das Spiel eingebettet und macht es erstrebenswert, den scho\u0308nsten, tru\u0308gerischsten und mu\u0308helosesten Weg zu finden, um seinen camarada (Kamerad) zu u\u0308berlisten, die korrekte Bezeichnung fu\u0308r den Gegner im Spiel, vielleicht verwendet im Gegensatz zu dem, was der eigentliche Gegner oder Unterdru\u0308cker gewesen wa\u0308re, der Sklavenhalter.",

              "In dieser Hinsicht ist das definierende Merkmal eines Capoeira Mestre mandinga, welches \u201cmagische Kraft\u201d impliziert und durch \u201cko\u0308rperliche Handlungen der Ta\u0308uschung und List\u201d zur Schau gestellt wird.",

              "Von au\u00dfen betrachtet mag das mandinga des Meisters den Anschein von Glu\u0308ck oder der Fa\u0308higkeit, die Realita\u0308t zu seinem Vorteil zu biegen, erwecken, ohne offenkundige Anstrengung.",

              "In der Landschaft der Capoeira taucht die Figur des Mestre auch auf andere Weise auf, eng verbunden mit der Idee von Geschichte, Abstammung und dem Respekt vor dem Wissen der Vorfahren.",

              "Die philippinische Kampfkunst Eskrima (die lokale Aussprache des spanischen Wortes fu\u0308r \u201cFechten\u201d) ist eine praktische Form des Kampfes mit Baston (Sto\u0308cken) und Bolo (was man als \u201cArbeitsklingen\u201d oder buschmessera\u0308hnliche Machete bezeichnen ko\u0308nnte).",
              "Entstanden ist Eskrima ho\u0308chstwahrscheinlich aus einer einzigartigen Synergie von Elementen aus dem verbleibenden kulturellen Hintergrund der sino-malaiischen Kampfku\u0308nste und einer genialen philippinischen Umgestaltung der geometrischen Logik der spanischen Schwertkunst fu\u0308r lokale Waffen.",
              "[11] Die fru\u0308he Entwicklung der Kunst bleibt ungewiss.",
              "Was sich mit einiger Sicherheit sagen la\u0308sst, ist, dass der Entwicklungsprozess der vielen Formen des Eskrima[12] u\u0308ber dreihundert Jahre der Kolonialisierung stattfand, in denen Jesuitenpriester den lokalen Kriegern die Schwertkunst lehrten,[13] durch Revolution und Rebellion wa\u0308hrend der Unabha\u0308ngigkeitska\u0308mpfe verfeinert worden ist und in der Zeit vor dem Zweiten Weltkrieg durch die Gru\u0308ndung von Sportvereinen formalisiert wurde \u2013 und schliesslich 2009 offiziell als Nationalsport des Landes anerkannt worden ist.",
              "Unter den in den Vereinigten Staaten lebenden Expat-Filipinos der Bu\u0308rgerrechtszeit wurde die Kunst ha\u0308ufig als Kali bezeichnet.",
              "Diese Bezeichnung stammt von einem alten Tagalog-Wort (das \u201cGeschicklichkeit mit Klingen\u201d bedeutet), als eine Art Widerstand gegen die Verwendung des spanischen Lehnwortes Eskrima (das genau die Fa\u0308higkeit des Praktizierenden implizierte, einen Stock mit der Geschicklichkeit eines Schwertka\u0308mpfers zu fu\u0308hren, aber starke Konnotationen eines kolonialen Erbes trug).",
              "Wie Capoeira tra\u0308gt auch die Sprache in dieser postkolonialen Kampfkunsttradition historische Spuren.",
              "Obwohl die Kali-Praktizierenden vielleicht einen vorspanischen Ursprung fu\u0308r ihre Kunst ausfindig machen wollten, scheinen sie wenig Schwierigkeiten gehabt zu haben, spanische Begriffe fu\u0308r viele ihrer Drills und Subsysteme zu verwenden: Engganyo (Finten oder Ta\u0308uschung), Numerado (gema\u0308ss den Zahlen), Sombrada (ein Deckungs- und Konter-Drill), Espada y Daga (Schwert und Dolch), Abierta und Serrada (offene und geschlossene Wachpositionen), um nur einige Elemente der kampfsportbezogenen Lingua franca zu nennen.",

              "8% der Bevo\u0308lkerung ausmachte.",
              "[14] Dies deutet natu\u0308rlich auf einen starken spanischen Einfluss hin, der sich auch in den zeitgeno\u0308ssischen Formen der Kunst niederschla\u0308gt, ebenso wie der offizielle Name der Kunst, Arnis de Mano (wo\u0308rtlich: \u201cRu\u0308stung der Hand\u201d).",
              "Wahrscheinlich bezieht sich dieser auf die Tatsache, dass die einzige Ru\u0308stung der Eskrimador wa\u0308hrend der Juego Todo (Faustka\u0308mpfe), die bis ins fru\u0308he 20.",
              "Jahrhundert andauerten, der Stock war.",
              "[15] Ein anderer, ha\u0308ufiger Refrain verbindet den Begriff Arnis mit den Kostu\u0308men der Schauspieler in Moro Moro Stu\u0308cken, in denen die christianisierten Visayan-Krieger, die Arnes (Ru\u0308stungen) tragen, die muslimischen \u201cPiraten\u201d von Mindinao erfolgreich zuru\u0308ckschlagen.",
              "[16] Solche Stu\u0308cke rekonstruieren und wiederholen einen historischen Konflikt, der bis heute nachhallt.",
              "[17] Die Geschichte weicht in der philippinischen Kampfkunsttradition schnell einem Mythos, da einige Eskrimadors die Geschichten aus der Vergangenheit ausschmu\u0308cken, um in der Gegenwart Prestige fu\u0308r sich zu beanspruchen.",
              "[18] Es ist ga\u0308ngige Praxis, die Kunst in jeder nachfolgenden Generation umzubenennen, was die Genealogien komplex macht, aber Innovation als einen Kernaspekt der Tradition legitimiert.",
              "Einst hauptsa\u0308chlich in Familien oder Do\u0308rfern gelehrt, werden viele Eskrima-Stile wie kostbare Erbstu\u0308cke behandelt, die nur mit wenigen vertrauenswu\u0308rdigen Personen geteilt werden, was ihre Erhaltung zu einem heutigen Anliegen macht.",
              "Postkolonialen Landschaften Die Erforschung der Geschichte von Kampfku\u0308nsten, die aus postkolonialen Gemeinschaften hervorgegangen sind, stellt einzigartige Probleme dar, die u\u0308ber die Trennung von Fakten und Meinungen oder die Erstellung einer plausiblen Darstellung hinausreichen.",
              "Komplexe Empfindlichkeiten mu\u0308ssen navigiert werden.",

              "Particularly the Afro-Brazilian martial art Capoeira, invented by slaves in the 18th century, is discussed as a sophisticated, genuinely interdisciplinary hybrid (involving dance, sport, art, several types of verbal and non-verbal communication) on the intersection of tradition and innovation \u2013 a hybrid that tells a collective story and invents new personal stories.",

              "Focusing on Capoeira and Eskrima, post-colonial martial arts that developed under Portuguese and Spanish colonial rule respectively, this paper offers selective insights into the landscapes of each art in which history is both remembered and forgotten, and respect is identified for both ancestral inheritance and innovation.",

              "Languages: English, German In the history culture of martial arts, especially in post-colonial societies, myth-making, tied to national identity formation, creates a veil on the past.",
              "It is common to hear that Capoeira and Eskrima, martial arts that developed under Portuguese and Spanish colonial rule respectively, both survived their colonial regimes by being hidden in dance.",
              "Yet there is no Capoeira without \u2018ginga\u2019 (sway) and there is evidence for Eskrima being an adaptation of Spanish swordsmanship taught to Christianised Filipinos by Jesuit \u2018warrior\u2019 Priests to repulse a perceived Muslim pirate threat from the South.",
              "[1] In the search for identity, and history, language becomes a surprising ally.",
              "Martial Arts are a multi-dimensional practice, constituted by the varied classes of phenomena (eg.",
              "technical emphasis, tactics, material weaponry, teaching methodology, philosophy, social hierarchy etc.)",
              "that construct the very existence of a given martial art style.",
              "[2] Such styles are inevitably culturally-historically located, emerging from complex socio-political contexts.",
              "The forms of martial art thus differ, sometimes dramatically, and are irreducible to simple definitions such as self-defence methods, or combat sports;",
              "and categories such as \u2018modern\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 collapse under close scrutiny.",
              "[3] Despite this, Bowman has argued that \u201cMartial arts as a cluster of familiar ideas, motifs, images, and as a category has certainly achieved stabilization in contemporary discourses, even if it lacks both precision and a stable referent\u201d (p.",
              "58).",
              "[4] Cautiously then, I will provide a brief introduction to aspects of the history culture of two particular arts, Capoeira (the Afro-Brazilian \u201cdance-fighting\u201d art), and Eskrima or Arnis de Mano (the Filipino national \u201cstick-fighting\u201d sport).",
              "In terms of appearance these arts would seem to have little in common.",
              "However, what may not be immediately obvious, is that both register traces of an historical connection with the Iberian world (as prior colonies of Portugal and Spain respectively), and offer particular insights into the post-colonial landscapes of their respective martial art traditions, in which history is both remembered and forgotten, and there exists within tradition a respect for inheritance and innovation.",
              "Capoeira is frequently described as an Afro-Brazilian martial art.",
              "The term Capoeiristas use to describe the art themselves is jogo (a game).",
              "The Jogo de Capoeira (game of Capoeira) in its contemporary form, is played to the pulsating rhythms of a berimbau (musical bow), atabaque (conga-like drum), and pandeiro (a type of tambourine).",
              "Originally developed by African slaves living in Brazil\u2019s Senzalas (slaves houses) in the 1700s and 1800s, Capoeira has roots in West African courtship and war dances;",
              "and influenced the peacock-like break-dancing culture of the late 1970s.",
              "[5] When the berimbau calls, Capoeiristas stand shoulder to shoulder forming a roda (circle) within which the players enter to play the game.",
              "Those forming the circle keep cadence with their clapping.",
              "During the jogo each player attempts to use their malendragem (trickery) and malicia (cunning) to read and out-wit the other in a physical game of chess, in which only the hands, feet, and head are typically permitted to touch the floor.",
              "Games are a complex dialogue of powerful kicks and daring evasions, artful acrobatics and playful theatrics.",
              "Adding further complexity to the jogo, Capoeira players must be responsive to changes in the rhythm being played on the berimbau, and listen carefully to the songs, sung in Portuguese (originally the language of the coloniser), being led by the Mestre (Master), that encourage certain actions in the game (such as the execution of a takedown), or make commentary, often humorously, on what is happening in the game (such as the suggestion that players are getting too close, or a game too heated, and that the combatants might need to find a bungalow, the historical equivalent of \u2018find a room\u2019).",
              "These ideas are often encoded in metaphor, and are missed by outsiders.",
              "Understanding develops among the young Capoeirista over time, as they become more familiar with the game and its rituals.",
              "The songs also carry the historical and cultural memory of oppression and the struggle for freedom, forming an important pedagogical tool in the shaping of a Capoeirista\u2019s outlook and identity.",
              "[6] Originally a game played by slaves on Sundays, Capoeira was sometimes known as vadiac\u0327ao (a word that directly translates as vagrancy or loitering, but is reinscribed within the art as something like \u2018just messing around\u2019).",
              "This concept is deeply embedded in the game, making it desirable to find the most beautiful, deceptive, and effortless route to the out-witting of your camarada (comrade), the correct reference for your opponent in the game, perhaps used in contrast to what would have been your real opponent or oppressor, the slave owner.",
              "Direct attack is rare, and is read as less skillful, unless executed with unexpected and unrivalled speed and precision.",
              "If you are to survive in this world, it should look like your oppressor walked into your leg, and not that you deliberately kicked them.",
              "In this regard, the defining characteristic of a Capoeira Mestre is mandinga, a word that implies \u2018magical power\u2019 and is exhibited through \u201cbodily acts of deception and trickery.",
              "\u201d[7] The mandigueiro (a term that would have once been translated as \u2018witch doctor\u2019 and means something like magician or wise-one), moves with Matrix-like power and insight, being able to deceive an adversary without ever \u201cbeing caught open or exposed.",
              "\u201d[8] It is the embodiment of maldade (wickedness), a capacity to be treacherous, and yet to appear the opposite.",
              "From the outside, the master\u2019s mandinga may give their moves the appearance of luck, or a capacity to bend reality to one\u2019s advantage, without exuding any obvious effort.",
              "Mandinga is learnt, rather than taught,[9] and represents the highest expression of the game, and a key marker of a skillful Capoeirista\u2019s identity.",
              "Despite the Mestre\u2019s possession of mandinga, there is a Capoeira song that celebrates that Capoeira\u2019s ends are unknown, even to the wisest of masters, suggesting a respect for the expected and continued evolution of the art.",
              "Within the landscape of Capoeira, the figure of the Mestre looms large in another way too, intimately connected with the idea of history, lineage, and respect for ancestral knowledge.",
              "There is a song lyric that translates \u201cBoy, who formed you?",
              "Who taught you the beauty, of dancing within the fight?",
              "\u201d[10] Here there is clear importance placed on knowing your roots, and giving thanks to those who have passed on this precious knowledge to you.",
              "This is not so much lineage as legitimation, as may be important in many East Asian martial arts, but hovers as a challenge to maintain a deep connection with, and sincere acknowledgement of, where your embodied knowledge has come from.",
              "Within the Capoeira community, your identity as a jogador (player) is forever tied to those from whom you have inherited your ability to dance in the fight.",
              "There is no (respectful) place for forgetting this.",
              "The Filipino martial art of Eskrima (the local pronunciation of the Spanish word for \u2018fencing\u2019) is a practical form of combat with baston (sticks) and bolo (what might be called \u2018working blades\u2019 or cutlass-style machete), most likely arising from a unique synergy of elements from a lingering Sino-Malay martial arts cultural background, and an ingenious Filipino re-engineering of the geometric logic of Spanish swordsmanship for local weapons.",
              "[11] The early evolution of the art remains uncertain.",
              "What we can say with some confidence is that the process of development of the many forms of Eskrima[12] occurred over three hundred years of colonisation in which Jesuit priests taught swordsmanship to local warriors;",
              "[13] was refined through revolution and rebellion during struggles for independence;",
              "formalised in the pre-WWII period through the formation of sporting clubs;",
              "and finally, officially recognised in 2009 as the country\u2019s national sport.",
              "Among ex-pat Filipinos living in the United States during the Civil Rights era, it became popular to refer to the art as Kali, from an old Tagalog word (meaning \u201cskill with blades\u201d), as a kind of resistance to use of the Spanish loan-word Eskrima (which accurately implied the practitioner\u2019s ability to wield a stick with the skill of a swordsman, but carried strong connotations of a colonial inheritance).",
              "Like Capoeira, language carries historical traces in this post-colonial martial art tradition, and while Kali practitioners may have desired to locate a pre-Hispanic origin for their art, they appear to have had little difficulty using Spanish terminology for many of their drills and sub-systems, Engganyo (feinting or deception), Numerado (by the numbers), Sombrada (a cover and counter drill), Espada y Daga (sword and dagger), Abierta and Serrada (open and closed guard positions), among much of the art\u2019s lingua franca, despite one source claiming that during the colonial period the number of Filipinos who could speak Spanish apparently never exceeded 2.",
              "8% of the population.",
              "[14] Of course, this suggests a strong Spanish influence, still registered in contemporary forms of the art, as does the art\u2019s official name, Arnis de Mano (literally \u2018armour of the hand\u2019), which most likely refers to the fact that the Eskrimador\u2019s only armour during the Juego Todo (no holds barred) stick-fighting duels that continued into the early 20th Century, was the stick in their hand.",
              "[15] Another, frequent refrain, links the term Arnis to the costumes of actors in Moro Moro plays in which the Christianised Visayan warriors, wearing Arnes (armour), successfully repulse the Muslim \u2018pirates\u2019 from Mindinao.",
              "[16] Such plays reconstruct and repeat an historical conflict which continues to have resonances today.",
              "[17] History gives way to myth rapidly within the Filipino martial tradition, as some Eskrimadors embellish stories of the past in order to claim prestige in the present.",
              "[18] It is common practice to rename the art in each successive generation, making genealogies complex, but providing legitimacy for innovation as a core aspect of tradition.",
              "Once taught mostly in families or villages, many Eskrima styles are treated like precious heirlooms, only to be shared with a trusted few, making their preservation an object of contemporary concern.",
              "Researching the history of martial arts emergent from post-colonial communities presents unique problems beyond the separation of fact from opinion, or the establishment of a plausible account.",
              "Complex sensibilities must be navigated.",
              "As an Anglo-Celtic student of these arts, I remain mindful that I am a guest in these lands.",
              "Within such post-colonial (not to mention \u2018globalised\u2019) martial arts landscapes, historical origins may be uncertain, but methods have been passed down through the generations, without the disruption seen in Europe, where there is a return to Medieval and Renaissance manuals to rehabilitate lost Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) traditions.",
              "Exploring martial history culture in the colonies presents an interesting point of reference for this work, given the visible legacies of these encounters between the metropol and the periphery;",
              "and martial traditions offer surprising insights into cultural values, identities, and histories.",

              "Dieses Konzept ist tief in das Spiel eingebettet und macht es erstrebenswert, den scho\u0308nsten, tru\u0308gerischsten und mu\u0308helosesten Weg zu finden, um seinen camarada (Kamerad) zu u\u0308berlisten, die korrekte Bezeichnung fu\u0308r den Gegner im Spiel, vielleicht verwendet im Gegensatz zu dem, was der eigentliche Gegner oder Unterdru\u0308cker gewesen wa\u0308re, der Sklavenhalter.",
              "Direkte Angriffe sind selten und werden als weniger geschickt interpretiert, es sei denn, sie werden mit unerwarteter und unu\u0308bertroffener Geschwindigkeit und Pra\u0308zision ausgefu\u0308hrt.",

              "In dieser Hinsicht ist das definierende Merkmal eines Capoeira Mestre mandinga, welches \u201cmagische Kraft\u201d impliziert und durch \u201cko\u0308rperliche Handlungen der Ta\u0308uschung und List\u201d zur Schau gestellt wird.",

              "[8] Dies verko\u0308rpert die sogenannte maldade (Bosheit), die Fa\u0308higkeit, heimtu\u0308ckisch zu sein und doch als das Gegenteil zu erscheinen.",
              "Von au\u00dfen betrachtet mag das mandinga des Meisters den Anschein von Glu\u0308ck oder der Fa\u0308higkeit, die Realita\u0308t zu seinem Vorteil zu biegen, erwecken, ohne offenkundige Anstrengung.",
              "Mandinga wird erlernt, nicht gelehrt, [9] und stellt den ho\u0308chsten Ausdruck des Spiels dar.",

              "Obwohl der Mestre mandinga besitzt, besingt ein Capoeira-Lied feierlich, dass das Ende der Capoeira selbst fu\u0308r die weisesten Meister unbekannt ist, was auf den Respekt vor der erwarteten und fortgesetzten Entwicklung der Kunst hinweist.",
              "In der Landschaft der Capoeira taucht die Figur des Mestre auch auf andere Weise auf, eng verbunden mit der Idee von Geschichte, Abstammung und dem Respekt vor dem Wissen der Vorfahren.",

              "Dies ist nicht so sehr Abstammung als Legitimation, wie es in vielen ostasiatischen Kampfku\u0308nsten wichtig sein mag.",
              "Im Gegenteil, es stellt die Herausforderung dar, eine tiefe Verbindung mit und aufrichtige Anerkennung dessen zu erhalten, woher das verko\u0308rperte Wissen stammt.",
              "Innerhalb der Capoeira-Gemeinschaft ist meine Identita\u0308t als jogador (Spieler) fu\u0308r immer an diejenigen gebunden, von denen ich die Fa\u0308higkeit, im Kampf zu tanzen, geerbt habe.",

              "Entstanden ist Eskrima ho\u0308chstwahrscheinlich aus einer einzigartigen Synergie von Elementen aus dem verbleibenden kulturellen Hintergrund der sino-malaiischen Kampfku\u0308nste und einer genialen philippinischen Umgestaltung der geometrischen Logik der spanischen Schwertkunst fu\u0308r lokale Waffen.",
              "[11] Die fru\u0308he Entwicklung der Kunst bleibt ungewiss.",
              "Was sich mit einiger Sicherheit sagen la\u0308sst, ist, dass der Entwicklungsprozess der vielen Formen des Eskrima[12] u\u0308ber dreihundert Jahre der Kolonialisierung stattfand, in denen Jesuitenpriester den lokalen Kriegern die Schwertkunst lehrten,[13] durch Revolution und Rebellion wa\u0308hrend der Unabha\u0308ngigkeitska\u0308mpfe verfeinert worden ist und in der Zeit vor dem Zweiten Weltkrieg durch die Gru\u0308ndung von Sportvereinen formalisiert wurde \u2013 und schliesslich 2009 offiziell als Nationalsport des Landes anerkannt worden ist.",
              "Unter den in den Vereinigten Staaten lebenden Expat-Filipinos der Bu\u0308rgerrechtszeit wurde die Kunst ha\u0308ufig als Kali bezeichnet.",
              "Diese Bezeichnung stammt von einem alten Tagalog-Wort (das \u201cGeschicklichkeit mit Klingen\u201d bedeutet), als eine Art Widerstand gegen die Verwendung des spanischen Lehnwortes Eskrima (das genau die Fa\u0308higkeit des Praktizierenden implizierte, einen Stock mit der Geschicklichkeit eines Schwertka\u0308mpfers zu fu\u0308hren, aber starke Konnotationen eines kolonialen Erbes trug).",
              "Wie Capoeira tra\u0308gt auch die Sprache in dieser postkolonialen Kampfkunsttradition historische Spuren.",
              "Obwohl die Kali-Praktizierenden vielleicht einen vorspanischen Ursprung fu\u0308r ihre Kunst ausfindig machen wollten, scheinen sie wenig Schwierigkeiten gehabt zu haben, spanische Begriffe fu\u0308r viele ihrer Drills und Subsysteme zu verwenden: Engganyo (Finten oder Ta\u0308uschung), Numerado (gema\u0308ss den Zahlen), Sombrada (ein Deckungs- und Konter-Drill), Espada y Daga (Schwert und Dolch), Abierta und Serrada (offene und geschlossene Wachpositionen), um nur einige Elemente der kampfsportbezogenen Lingua franca zu nennen.",

              "8% der Bevo\u0308lkerung ausmachte.",
              "[14] Dies deutet natu\u0308rlich auf einen starken spanischen Einfluss hin, der sich auch in den zeitgeno\u0308ssischen Formen der Kunst niederschla\u0308gt, ebenso wie der offizielle Name der Kunst, Arnis de Mano (wo\u0308rtlich: \u201cRu\u0308stung der Hand\u201d).",
              "Wahrscheinlich bezieht sich dieser auf die Tatsache, dass die einzige Ru\u0308stung der Eskrimador wa\u0308hrend der Juego Todo (Faustka\u0308mpfe), die bis ins fru\u0308he 20.",
              "Jahrhundert andauerten, der Stock war.",
              "[15] Ein anderer, ha\u0308ufiger Refrain verbindet den Begriff Arnis mit den Kostu\u0308men der Schauspieler in Moro Moro Stu\u0308cken, in denen die christianisierten Visayan-Krieger, die Arnes (Ru\u0308stungen) tragen, die muslimischen \u201cPiraten\u201d von Mindinao erfolgreich zuru\u0308ckschlagen.",
              "[16] Solche Stu\u0308cke rekonstruieren und wiederholen einen historischen Konflikt, der bis heute nachhallt.",
              "[17] Die Geschichte weicht in der philippinischen Kampfkunsttradition schnell einem Mythos, da einige Eskrimadors die Geschichten aus der Vergangenheit ausschmu\u0308cken, um in der Gegenwart Prestige fu\u0308r sich zu beanspruchen.",
              "[18] Es ist ga\u0308ngige Praxis, die Kunst in jeder nachfolgenden Generation umzubenennen, was die Genealogien komplex macht, aber Innovation als einen Kernaspekt der Tradition legitimiert.",
              "Einst hauptsa\u0308chlich in Familien oder Do\u0308rfern gelehrt, werden viele Eskrima-Stile wie kostbare Erbstu\u0308cke behandelt, die nur mit wenigen vertrauenswu\u0308rdigen Personen geteilt werden, was ihre Erhaltung zu einem heutigen Anliegen macht.",
              "Postkolonialen Landschaften Die Erforschung der Geschichte von Kampfku\u0308nsten, die aus postkolonialen Gemeinschaften hervorgegangen sind, stellt einzigartige Probleme dar, die u\u0308ber die Trennung von Fakten und Meinungen oder die Erstellung einer plausiblen Darstellung hinausreichen.",
              "Komplexe Empfindlichkeiten mu\u0308ssen navigiert werden.",

              "Die Erforschung der kriegerischen Geschichtskultur in den ehemaligen Kolonien stellt angesichts der sichtbaren Hinterlassenschaften dieser Begegnungen zwischen Metropole und Peripherie einen interessanten Bezugspunkt fu\u0308r diese Arbeit dar;",

              "Diese Bezeichnung stammt von einem alten Tagalog-Wort (das \u201cGeschicklichkeit mit Klingen\u201d bedeutet), als eine Art Widerstand gegen die Verwendung des spanischen Lehnwortes Eskrima (das genau die Fa\u0308higkeit des Praktizierenden implizierte, einen Stock mit der Geschicklichkeit eines Schwertka\u0308mpfers zu fu\u0308hren, aber starke Konnotationen eines kolonialen Erbes trug).",
              "Wie Capoeira tra\u0308gt auch die Sprache in dieser postkolonialen Kampfkunsttradition historische Spuren.",

              "[18] Es ist ga\u0308ngige Praxis, die Kunst in jeder nachfolgenden Generation umzubenennen, was die Genealogien komplex macht, aber Innovation als einen Kernaspekt der Tradition legitimiert.",

              "Postkolonialen Landschaften Die Erforschung der Geschichte von Kampfku\u0308nsten, die aus postkolonialen Gemeinschaften hervorgegangen sind, stellt einzigartige Probleme dar, die u\u0308ber die Trennung von Fakten und Meinungen oder die Erstellung einer plausiblen Darstellung hinausreichen.",

              "In his portrayal of Capoeira and Eskrima, heavy metal researcher Laina Dawe\u2019s motto \u201cwriting is fighting\u201d is being inverted, so to speak: \u201cfighting is writing\u201d.",
              "Particularly the Afro-Brazilian martial art Capoeira, invented by slaves in the 18th century, is discussed as a sophisticated, genuinely interdisciplinary hybrid (involving dance, sport, art, several types of verbal and non-verbal communication) on the intersection of tradition and innovation \u2013 a hybrid that tells a collective story and invents new personal stories.",
              "The author\u2019s reference to a Capoeira song which \u201ccelebrates that Capoeira\u2019s ends are unknown, even to the wisest of masters, suggesting a respect for the expected and continued evolution of the art\u201d is a relevant source for future research on creativity and innovation.",
              "The culture of Capoeira supports the assumption that creativity emerges from playfulness, openness, allusion, metaphor, idiosyncratic encoding (cf.",
              "\u201csignifying\u201d and \u201cbattle rap\u201d in Hip Hop), not from instrumental techniques or programs which promise to exploit creativity as a resource.",
              "Accordingly, the Capoeiristas themselves conceive of their practice not (only) as a fight but decidedly as a game.",
              "European researchers on aesthetics may feel reminded of Friedrich Schiller and his insistence on the playfulness of the aesthetic sensibility as a precondition for reason, or of philosopher Peter Sloterdijk who in a 2020 interview implicitly referred to Schiller when stating that human progress means \u201ctaking artificial dangers.",
              "When dangers become artificial, then one has actually reached the goal of life, because as long as one has to struggle with real dangers, the release into the playful mode of being has not been achieved.",
              "\u201d[1] However, the author outlines that respect of tradition is paramount as well in Capoeira, clearly expressed by the \u201cimportance placed on knowing your roots, and giving thanks to those who have passed on this precious knowledge to you\u201d.",
              "This emphasis on \u201croots\u201d has political undertones, given the history of slavery in Brazil and the persistence of racism in the present day.",
              "In popular culture, the nexus of Capoeira, creativity, politics, and history is well known.",
              "Just think of Brazilian metal band Sepultura\u2019s music video for \u201cRoots, Bloody Roots\u201d.",

              "The next scene shows a Christian Cross, the symbol of the colonizing power, followed by the band performing with Timbalada drummers.",
              "These scenes strongly resonate with the \u201cimportance placed on knowing your roots\u201d mentioned in the paper, while reconciling roots with contemporary pop culture.",
              "As for Eskrima, portrayed in lesser detail in the paper, the author convincingly points out the transcultural dimension of the martial art which, until today, is subject of constant transformation and re-interpretation: \u201cthere is evidence for Eskrima being an adaptation of Spanish swordsmanship taught to Christianised Filipinos by Jesuit \u2018warrior\u2019 Priests to repulse a perceived Muslim pirate threat from the South.",

              "This is in contrast to most other well-known Asian martial arts but it is justified by the principle that bare-handed moves are acquired naturally through the same exercises as the weapon techniques, making muscle memory an important aspect of the teaching.",
              "It is also based on the obvious fact that an armed person who is trained has the advantage over a trained unarmed person, and serves to condition students to fight against armed assailants.",
              "Most systems of Arnis apply a single set of techniques for the stick, knife, and empty hands, a concept sometimes referred to as motion grouping.",
              "Since the weapon is seen as simply an extension of the body, the same angles and footwork are used either with or without a weapon.",
              "The reason for this is probably historical, because tribal warriors went into battle armed and only resorted to bare-handed fighting after losing their weapons.",
              "Many systems begin training with two weapons, either a pair of sticks or a stick and a wooden knife.",
              "These styles emphasise keeping both hands full and never moving them in the same direction, and trains practitioners to become ambidextrous.",
              "For example, one stick may strike the head while the other hits the arm.",
              "Such training develops the ability to use both limbs independently, a valuable skill, even when working with a single weapon.",
              "A core concept and distinct feature of Filipino martial arts is the Live Hand.",
              "Even when as a practitioner wields only one weapon, the extra hand is used to control, trap or disarm an opponent's weapon and to aid in blocking, joint locking and manipulation of the opponent or other simultaneous motions such as bicep destruction with the live hand.",
              "The most basic and common weapon in Arnis is the baston or yantok.",
              "They are typically constructed from rattan, an inexpensive stem from a type of Southeast Asian vine.",
              "Hard and durable yet lightweight, it shreds only under the worst abuse and does not splinter like wood, making it a safer training tool.",

              "The participants are skilled enough to parry and counterstrike, showing respect in not intentionally hitting the training partner.",
              "In modern times, many Arnis practitioners have also come to wear head and hand protection while sparring with rattan sticks, or otherwise use padded bastons.",

              "The term Baraw is more commonly used on the Cebu Island in the Visayan region whereas other islands and regions more commonly use the term Daga but both terms are often interchangeable within the Filipino martial arts community.",
              "The terms Baraw and Daga can be used either as Solo Baraw or Solo Daga associated with single knife fighting and defense systems, Doble Baraw or Doble Daga associated with the double knife fighting systems or even with a combination of long and short weapons e.",

              "The practitioners must conform to criteria based on the number of years of training and level of proficiency in technical skills.",
              "Practitioners are screened by the rank promotion committee to determine their rank in the grading system.",
              "Most systems recognize that the technical nature of combat changes drastically as the distance between opponents changes, and generally classify the ranges into at least three categories.",
              "Each range has its characteristic techniques and footwork.",
              "Of course, some systems place more emphasis on certain ranges than others, but almost all recognize that being able to work in and control any range is essential.",
              "The Balintawak style for example, uses long-, medium- and short-range fighting techniques, but focuses on the short-range.",
              "To control the range, and for numerous other purposes, good footwork is essential.",
              "Most eskrima systems explain their footwork in terms of triangles: normally when moving in any direction two feet occupy two corners of the triangle and the step is to the third corner such that no leg crosses the other at any time.",
              "The shape and size of the triangle must be adapted to the particular situation.",
              "The style of footwork and the standing position vary greatly from school to school and from practitioner to practitioner.",
              "For a very traditional school, conscious of battlefield necessities, stances are usually very low, often with one knee on the ground, and footwork is complex, involving many careful cross-steps to allow practitioners to cope with multiple opponents.",
              "The Villabrille and San Miguel styles are usually taught in this way.",
              "Systems that have been adapted to duels or sporting matches generally employ simpler footwork, focusing on a single opponent.",
              "North American schools tend to use much more upright stances, as this puts less stress on the legs, but there are some exceptions.",
              "Many systems, including the Inosanto/Lacosta system of escrima/kali recognize and teach 3 basic ranges: long range (largo), medium range (medio) and short range (corto).",
              "The long range is typically defined as being able to hit the opponents lead/weapon hand with your weapon/stick only.",
              "Medium range is where you are able to strike the opponent's body/head with your weapon/stick while also checking/monitoring the opponent's lead hand with your rear/live hand.",
              "And the short range is when you can strike the opponent's body/head with your rear/live hand or being able to strike the opponent's head/body with the hilt/punyo end of the weapon/stick.",
              "Some styles or systems may also define a closer range for elbows to the head or body, or grappling.",
              "Many Filipino systems focus on defending against and/or reacting to angles of attack rather than particular strikes.",
              "The theory behind this is that virtually all types of hand-to-hand attacks (barehanded or with a weapon) hit or reach a combatant via these angles of attack and the reasoning is that it is more efficient to learn to defend against different angles of attack rather than learn to defend against particular styles, particular techniques or particular weapons.",
              "For instance, the technique for defending against an attack angle that comes overhead from the right is very similar whether the attacker uses bare fists, a knife, a sword or a spear.",
              "Older styles gave each angle a name, but more recent systems tend to simply number them.",
              "Many systems have twelve standard angles, though some have as few as 5, and others as many as 72.",
              "Although the exact angles, the order they are numbered in (numerado), and the way the player executes moves vary from system to system, most are based upon Filipino cosmology.",
              "These standard angles describe exercises.",
              "To aid memorization, player often practise a standard series of strikes from these angles, called an abecedario (Spanish for \"alphabet\").",
              "These are beginner strikes or the \"ABC's\" of Arnis.",
              "While most systems do incorporate a numbering system for the angles of attack, not all use the same numbering system, so always get clarification before training in a new system or style.",
              "Additionally, while the angles are numbered for ease of discussion, the numbers do not generally define how the attack is thrown.",
              "That is to say, usually (excluding thrusts) a #1 angle, means an attack that starts on the right side of the practitioner and comes down at about a 45\u00b0 from right to left.",
              "But, it does not matter whether this is done with the right or left hand (forehand or backhand) or if the hit continues through the target or returns back along the same line.",
              "Some angles of attack and some strikes have characteristic names: Many Arnis techniques have Spanish names, because Spanish was the lingua franca spoken during colonial times among the natives, who spoke over 170 languages across 7,600 islands.",
              "Arnis techniques are generally based on the assumption that both student and opponent are very highly trained and well prepared.",
              "Thus, Arnis tends to favour extreme caution, always considering the possibility of a failed technique or an unexpected knife.",
              "On the other hand, the practitioner is assumed to be capable of quick, precise strikes.",
              "The general principle is that an opponent's ability to attack should be destroyed rather than trying to injure and convince them to stop.",
              "Many strikes are therefore aimed at the hands and arms, hoping to break the hand holding the weapon, or cut the nerves and tendons controlling it (the concept of \"defanging the snake\").",
              "Strike to the eyes and legs are also important.",
              "This is summed up in a popular mnemonic: \"Stick seeks bone, blade seeks flesh\".",
              "Mano Mano is the empty-hand component of Filipino martial arts, particularly Arnis.",
              "The term translates as \"hands\" or \"hand-[to]-hand\" and comes from the Spanish mano (\"hand\").",
              "It is also known as suntukan or panununtukan in Luzon and pangamot in the Visayas, as well as De Cadena, Cadena de Mano or Arnis de Mano in some FMA systems. American colonists referred to it as \"combat judo\" or \"Filipino boxing\".",
              "Mano mano moves include kicking, punching, locking, throwing, and dumog (grappling).",
              "Filipino martial artists regard empty hands as another weapon, and all movements of Mano Mano are directly based on weapon techniques.",
              "In Arnis, weapons are seen as extensions of the body, so training with weapons naturally leads to proficiency in bare-handed combat.",
              "For this reason, Mano Mano is often taught in higher grades after weapons training has been mastered, as advanced students are expected to be able to apply experience with weapons to unarmed fighting.",
              "This not always the case though, as some systems of Arnis start with (and at times only consist of) empty hands fighting.",
              "Some notable masters of Mano Mano include: Paninipa, Pagsipa, Pananadiyak, Pagtadiyak, and Sikaran (all terms for \"kicking\" in various regions, dialects and styles) are components of eskrima that focus on knees, tripping, low-line kicks, and stomps.",
              "Pananjakman is also a term used in Filipino-American-developed and Western FMA systems, usually referring to the system from the Lucky Lucaylucay, Floro Villabrille and Dan Inosanto blend lineage.",
              "Except for the distinct style of Sikaran from the Baras area of the province of Rizal, which also uses high kicks, kicking as a separate art is never taught by itself in the Philippines, and this practice is only done in the West with Pananjakman.",
              "Pananjakman is usually taught together with Panantukan.",
              "Paninipa can be regarded as the study of leg muscles and bones and how they are connected, with the goal of either inflicting pain or outright breaking or dislocating the bones.",
              "Most striking techniques involve applying pressure to bend the target areas in unnatural ways so as to injure or break them.",
              "Such pressure may be delivered in the form of a heel smash, a toe kick, a stomp, or a knee.",
              "Targets include the groin, thighs, knees, shins, ankles, feet and toes.",
              "The upper body is used only for defensive maneuvers, making pananadiyak ideal for when combatants are engaged in a clinch.",
              "When used effectively, the strikes can bring an opponent to the ground or otherwise end an altercation by making them too weak to stand.",
              "Fundamental techniques include kicking or smashing the ankle to force it either towards or away from the opposite foot (severe supination or pronation, respectively), heel-stomping the top of the foot where it meets the lower leg so as to break or crush the numerous bones or otherwise disrupt the opponent's balance, and smashing the opponents knee from the side to break the knee (with severe supination and pronation as the desired result).",
              "Several classes of exercises, such as sombrada, contrada, sinawali, hubud-lubud and sequidas, initially presented to the public as a set of organized drills by the Inosanto school, are expressly designed to allow partners to move quickly and experiment with variations while remaining safe.",
              "For example, in a sumbrada drill, one partner feeds an attack, which the other counters, flowing into a counterattack, which is then countered, flowing into a counterattack, and so on.",
              "The hubud-lubud or hubad-lubad from Doce Pares is frequently used as a type of \"generator\" drill, where one is forced to act and think fast.",
              "Initially, students learn a specific series of attacks, counters, and counter-attacks.",
              "As they advance they can add minor variations, change the footwork, or switch to completely different attacks;",
              "eventually the exercise becomes almost completely free-form.",
              "Palakaw, from the Balintawak style, are un-choreographed and random defensive and offensive moves.",
              "Palakaw in Cebuano means a walk-through or rehearsing the different strike angles and defenses.",
              "It may be known as corridas, or striking without any order or pattern.",
              "Disarms, take-downs, and other techniques usually break the flow of such a drill, but they are usually initiated from such a sequence of movements to force the student to adapt to a variety of situations.",
              "A common practice is to begin a drill with each student armed with two weapons.",
              "Once the drill is flowing, if a student sees an opportunity to disarm their opponent, they do, but the drill continues until both students are empty-handed.",
              "Some drills use only a single weapon per pair, and the partners take turns disarming each other.",
              "Seguidas drills, taken from the San Miguel system, are sets of hitting and movement patterns usually involving stick and dagger.",
              "Rhythm, while an essential part of eskrima drills, is emphasized more in the United States and Europe, where a regular beat serves a guide for students to follow.",
              "To ensure safety, participants perform most drills at a constant pace, which they increase as they progress.",
              "The rhythm, together with the southern Filipino attire of a vest and sashed pants, is commonly mistaken for some sort of tradition when practising eskrima in the Philippines \u2013 perhaps incorrectly derived from traditional rhythm-based dances or an attempt to add a sense of ethnicity.",
              "Eskrima is usually practised in the Philippines without a rhythm, off-beat or out of rhythm.",
              "The diversity of Filipino martial arts means that there is no officially established standard uniform in eskrima.",
              "The live hand (or alive hand) is the opposite hand of the practitioner that does not contain the main weapon.",
              "The heavy usage of the live hand is an important concept and distinguishing hallmark of eskrima.",
              "Even (or especially) when empty, the live hand can be used as a companion weapon by eskrima practitioners.",
              "As opposed to most weapon systems like fencing where the off-hand is hidden and not used to prevent it from being hit, eskrima actively uses the live hand for trapping, locking, supporting weapon blocks, checking, disarming, striking and controlling the opponent.",
              "The usage of the live hand is one of the most evident examples of how Eskrima's method of starting with weapons training leads to effective empty hand techniques.",
              "Because of Doble Baston (double weapons) or Espada y Daga (sword and parrying dagger) ambidextrous weapon muscle memory conditioning, Eskrima practitioners find it easy to use the off-hand actively once they transition from using it with a weapon to an empty hand.",
              "Doble baston, and less frequently doble olisi, are common names for a group of techniques involving two sticks.",
              "The art is more commonly known around the world as Sinawali meaning \"to weave\".",
              "The term Sinawali is taken from a matting called sawali that is commonly used in the tribal Nipa Huts.",
              "It is made up of woven pieces of palm leaf and used for both flooring and walls.",
              "This technique requires the user to use both left and right weapons in an equal manner;",
              "many co-ordination drills are used to help the practitioner become more ambidextrous.",
              "It is the section of the art that is taught mainly at the intermediate levels and above and is considered one of the most important areas of learning in the art.",
              "Sinawali refers to the activity of \"weaving\", as applied Eskrima with reference to a set of two-person, two-weapon exercises.",
              "The term comes from \"Sawali\", the woven material that typically forms the walls of nipa huts.",
              "Sinawali exercises provide eskrima practitioners with basic skills and motions relevant to a mode of two-weapon blocking and response method called Doblete.",
              "Sinawali training is often introduced to novices to help them develop certain fundamental skills \u2013 including: body positioning and distance relative to an opponent, rotation of the body and the proper turning radius, recognition of one's center of gravity, eye\u2013hand coordination, target perception and recognition, increased ambidexterity, recognition and performance of rhythmic structures for upper body movement, and muscular developments important to the art, especially, the wrist and forearm regions.",
              "It helps teach the novice eskrimador proper positioning while swinging a weapon.",
              "The Chinese and Malay communities of the Philippines have practiced eskrima together with Kuntaw and Silat for centuries, so much so that many North Americans mistakenly believe silat to have originated in the Philippines.",
              "Some of the modern styles, particularly doce pares and Modern Arnis contain some elements of Japanese Martial Arts such as joint locks, throws, blocks, strikes, and groundwork, taken from: Jujutsu, Judo, Aikido and Karate as some of the founders obtained black belt Dan grades in some of these systems. Some eskrima styles are complementary with Chinese Wing Chun because of the nervous system conditioning and body mechanics when striking, twirling or swinging sticks.",
              "In Western countries, it is common to practice eskrima in conjunction with other martial arts, particularly Wing Chun, Jeet Kune Do and silat.",
              "As a result, there is some confusion between styles, systems, and lineage, because some people cross-train without giving due credit to the founders or principles of their arts.",
              "For example, American Kenpo and Kajukenbo cross-training traces back to the interactions between Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants in territorial/pre-statehood Hawaii, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the United States.",
              "In the United States the cross-training between eskrima and Jeet Kune Do Concepts as headed by Dan Inosanto of the Inosanto Academy in Marina del Rey, California, goes according to the maxim \"Absorb what is useful, reject what is useless\".",
              "Proponents of such training say the arts are very similar in many aspects and complement each other well.",
              "It has become marketable to offer eskrima classes in other traditional Asian martial arts studios in America but some practitioners of other eskrima styles often dismiss these lessons as debased versions of original training methods."

              "[3] The three are roughly interchangeable umbrella terms for the traditional martial arts of the Philippines (\"Filipino Martial Arts\", or FMA), which emphasize weapon-based fighting with sticks, knives, bladed weapons, and various improvised weapons, as well as \"open hand\" techniques without weapons.",

              "The name kali is most likely derived from the pre-Hispanic Filipino term for blades and fencing, kalis (Spanish spelling: \"calis\"),[10] documented by Ferdinand Magellan's expedition chronicler Antonio Pigafetta during their journey through the Visayas and in old Spanish to Filipino Mother Tongue dictionaries and vocabulary books dating from 1612 to the late 1800s, such as in Vocabulario de Lengua Tagala by Fr.",

              "[21] In some of these dictionaries, the term calis refers to a sword or knife kris or keris, while in others it refers to both swords and knives and their usage as well as a form of esgrima stick fighting.",
              "[14][15] While Mirafuente posits that the original term was kali and that the letter \"S\" was added later, the late Grandmaster Remy Presas suggests that the \"S\" was dropped in modern times and became presently more known as kali in FMA circles.",

              "have Spanish names suggest an influence.",
              "Some argue though that Spanish names in the martial art simply reflect the fact that Spanish was the lingua franca of the Philippines until the early 20th century, and that actual Spanish martial influence was limited.",
              "What is certain is that the Spaniards brought with them and used their bladed weapon arts (including the system of Destreza developed by Carranza) when they started colonizing the archipelago in the 16th century.",
              "What is also known is that the Spaniards recruited soldiers from Mexico[38] and Peru[39] and sent them to fortify the Philippines and they had also trained mercenaries and warriors from local people like the Pangasinenses, Kapampangans, Tagalogs, Ilonggos, Cebuanos and Warays to pacify regions and put down revolts.",

              "but this needs the help of ours, and so they say that a Spaniard plus three Pampangos equal four Spaniards.",
              "[41] Logic dictates that these native warriors and foreign soldiers would have passed on to very close friends and family members these newly learned skills to augment already existing and effective local ones.",
              "They would have also shared tactics and techniques with each other when placed in the same military group and fighting on the same side in foreign regions such as Formosa, Mindanao, the Moluccas[40] and the Marianas.",
              "[42] One of the more prominent features of Arnis that point to possible Spanish influence is the Espada y Daga (Spanish for \"sword and dagger\") method, a term also used in Spanish fencing.",

              "With time, a system for the teaching of the basics also evolved.",
              "However, with the exception of a few older and more established systems, it was previously common to pass the art from generation to generation in an informal approach.",
              "This has made attempts to trace the lineage of a practitioner difficult.",
              "For example, aside from learning from their family members like his uncle Regino Ilustrisimo, Antonio Ilustrisimo seemed to have learned to fight while sailing around the Philippines, while his cousin and student Floro Villabrille claimed to have been also taught by a blind Moro princess in the mountains;",

              "They are commonly carried as tools by farmers, used by street vendors to prepare coconuts, pineapples, watermelons, other fruits and meats, and balisongs are cheap to procure in the streets as well as being easily concealed.",
              "In fact, in some areas in the countryside, carrying a farming knife like the itak or bolo was a sign that one was making a living because of the nature of work in those areas.",
              "[51] In the country of Palau, the local term for Filipino is chad ra oles, which literally means \"people of the knife\" because of Filipinos' reputation for carrying knives and using them in fights.",
              "[52] Soldiers and mercenaries trained in the Philippines which were recruited by France which was then in an alliance with Spain, had fought in Cambodia and Vietnam justified by defending newly converted Catholic populations from persecutions and had assisted France in establishing French Cochinchina centered in Saigon.",
              "[53] Also in Asia, at China, during the Taiping Rebellion, Filipinos who were described as Manilamen and were 'Reputed to be brave and fierce fighters' and 'were plentiful in Shanghai and always eager for action' were employed by the Foreign forces as mercenaries to successfully quell the Taiping Rebellion.",

              "The earlier Arnis Philippines[73] (ARPI) system, established in 1986, was most prominently used during the 2005 Southeast Asian Games.",
              "Arnis students start their instruction by learning to fight with weapons, and only advance to empty-hand training once the stick and knife techniques have been sufficiently mastered.",
              "This is in contrast to most other well-known Asian martial arts but it is justified by the principle that bare-handed moves are acquired naturally through the same exercises as the weapon techniques, making muscle memory an important aspect of the teaching.",
              "It is also based on the obvious fact that an armed person who is trained has the advantage over a trained unarmed person, and serves to condition students to fight against armed assailants.",
              "Most systems of Arnis apply a single set of techniques for the stick, knife, and empty hands, a concept sometimes referred to as motion grouping.",
              "Since the weapon is seen as simply an extension of the body, the same angles and footwork are used either with or without a weapon.",
              "The reason for this is probably historical, because tribal warriors went into battle armed and only resorted to bare-handed fighting after losing their weapons.",
              "Many systems begin training with two weapons, either a pair of sticks or a stick and a wooden knife.",
              "These styles emphasise keeping both hands full and never moving them in the same direction, and trains practitioners to become ambidextrous.",
              "For example, one stick may strike the head while the other hits the arm.",
              "Such training develops the ability to use both limbs independently, a valuable skill, even when working with a single weapon.",
              "A core concept and distinct feature of Filipino martial arts is the Live Hand.",
              "Even when as a practitioner wields only one weapon, the extra hand is used to control, trap or disarm an opponent's weapon and to aid in blocking, joint locking and manipulation of the opponent or other simultaneous motions such as bicep destruction with the live hand.",
              "The most basic and common weapon in Arnis is the baston or yantok.",
              "They are typically constructed from rattan, an inexpensive stem from a type of Southeast Asian vine.",
              "Hard and durable yet lightweight, it shreds only under the worst abuse and does not splinter like wood, making it a safer training tool.",
              "This aspect makes it useful in defense against blades.",
              "Kamagong (ironwood or ebony) and bahi (heart of the palm) are sometimes used after being charred and hardened.",
              "These hardwoods are generally not used for sparring, however, as they are dense enough to cause serious injury, but traditional sparring does not include weapon to body contact.",
              "The participants are skilled enough to parry and counterstrike, showing respect in not intentionally hitting the training partner.",
              "In modern times, many Arnis practitioners have also come to wear head and hand protection while sparring with rattan sticks, or otherwise use padded bastons.",
              "Some modern schools also use sticks made out of aluminium or other metals, or modern high-impact plastics.",
              "Baraw is a Cebuano term used in eskrima that means knife or dagger.",
              "The term Baraw is more commonly used on the Cebu Island in the Visayan region whereas other islands and regions more commonly use the term Daga but both terms are often interchangeable within the Filipino martial arts community.",
              "The terms Baraw and Daga can be used either as Solo Baraw or Solo Daga associated with single knife fighting and defense systems, Doble Baraw or Doble Daga associated with the double knife fighting systems or even with a combination of long and short weapons e.",
              "g. stick and dagger fighting systems Olisi Baraw or sword and dagger fighting systems Espada y Daga.",
              "The practitioners must conform to criteria based on the number of years of training and level of proficiency in technical skills.",
              "Practitioners are screened by the rank promotion committee to determine their rank in the grading system.",
              "Most systems recognize that the technical nature of combat changes drastically as the distance between opponents changes, and generally classify the ranges into at least three categories.",
              "Each range has its characteristic techniques and footwork.",
              "Of course, some systems place more emphasis on certain ranges than others, but almost all recognize that being able to work in and control any range is essential.",
              "The Balintawak style for example, uses long-, medium- and short-range fighting techniques, but focuses on the short-range.",
              "To control the range, and for numerous other purposes, good footwork is essential.",
              "Most eskrima systems explain their footwork in terms of triangles: normally when moving in any direction two feet occupy two corners of the triangle and the step is to the third corner such that no leg crosses the other at any time.",
              "The shape and size of the triangle must be adapted to the particular situation.",
              "The style of footwork and the standing position vary greatly from school to school and from practitioner to practitioner.",
              "For a very traditional school, conscious of battlefield necessities, stances are usually very low, often with one knee on the ground, and footwork is complex, involving many careful cross-steps to allow practitioners to cope with multiple opponents.",
              "The Villabrille and San Miguel styles are usually taught in this way.",
              "Systems that have been adapted to duels or sporting matches generally employ simpler footwork, focusing on a single opponent.",
              "North American schools tend to use much more upright stances, as this puts less stress on the legs, but there are some exceptions.",
              "Many systems, including the Inosanto/Lacosta system of escrima/kali recognize and teach 3 basic ranges: long range (largo), medium range (medio) and short range (corto).",
              "The long range is typically defined as being able to hit the opponents lead/weapon hand with your weapon/stick only.",
              "Medium range is where you are able to strike the opponent's body/head with your weapon/stick while also checking/monitoring the opponent's lead hand with your rear/live hand.",
              "And the short range is when you can strike the opponent's body/head with your rear/live hand or being able to strike the opponent's head/body with the hilt/punyo end of the weapon/stick.",
              "Some styles or systems may also define a closer range for elbows to the head or body, or grappling.",
              "Many Filipino systems focus on defending against and/or reacting to angles of attack rather than particular strikes.",
              "The theory behind this is that virtually all types of hand-to-hand attacks (barehanded or with a weapon) hit or reach a combatant via these angles of attack and the reasoning is that it is more efficient to learn to defend against different angles of attack rather than learn to defend against particular styles, particular techniques or particular weapons.",
              "For instance, the technique for defending against an attack angle that comes overhead from the right is very similar whether the attacker uses bare fists, a knife, a sword or a spear.",
              "Older styles gave each angle a name, but more recent systems tend to simply number them.",
              "Many systems have twelve standard angles, though some have as few as 5, and others as many as 72.",
              "Although the exact angles, the order they are numbered in (numerado), and the way the player executes moves vary from system to system, most are based upon Filipino cosmology.",
              "These standard angles describe exercises.",
              "To aid memorization, player often practise a standard series of strikes from these angles, called an abecedario (Spanish for \"alphabet\").",
              "These are beginner strikes or the \"ABC's\" of Arnis.",
              "While most systems do incorporate a numbering system for the angles of attack, not all use the same numbering system, so always get clarification before training in a new system or style.",
              "Additionally, while the angles are numbered for ease of discussion, the numbers do not generally define how the attack is thrown.",
              "That is to say, usually (excluding thrusts) a #1 angle, means an attack that starts on the right side of the practitioner and comes down at about a 45\u00b0 from right to left.",
              "But, it does not matter whether this is done with the right or left hand (forehand or backhand) or if the hit continues through the target or returns back along the same line.",
              "Some angles of attack and some strikes have characteristic names: Many Arnis techniques have Spanish names, because Spanish was the lingua franca spoken during colonial times among the natives, who spoke over 170 languages across 7,600 islands.",
              "Arnis techniques are generally based on the assumption that both student and opponent are very highly trained and well prepared.",
              "Thus, Arnis tends to favour extreme caution, always considering the possibility of a failed technique or an unexpected knife.",
              "On the other hand, the practitioner is assumed to be capable of quick, precise strikes.",
              "The general principle is that an opponent's ability to attack should be destroyed rather than trying to injure and convince them to stop.",
              "Many strikes are therefore aimed at the hands and arms, hoping to break the hand holding the weapon, or cut the nerves and tendons controlling it (the concept of \"defanging the snake\").",
              "Strike to the eyes and legs are also important.",
              "This is summed up in a popular mnemonic: \"Stick seeks bone, blade seeks flesh\".",
              "Mano Mano is the empty-hand component of Filipino martial arts, particularly Arnis.",
              "The term translates as \"hands\" or \"hand-[to]-hand\" and comes from the Spanish mano (\"hand\").",
              "It is also known as suntukan or panununtukan in Luzon and pangamot in the Visayas, as well as De Cadena, Cadena de Mano or Arnis de Mano in some FMA systems. American colonists referred to it as \"combat judo\" or \"Filipino boxing\".",
              "Mano mano moves include kicking, punching, locking, throwing, and dumog (grappling).",
              "Filipino martial artists regard empty hands as another weapon, and all movements of Mano Mano are directly based on weapon techniques.",
              "In Arnis, weapons are seen as extensions of the body, so training with weapons naturally leads to proficiency in bare-handed combat.",
              "For this reason, Mano Mano is often taught in higher grades after weapons training has been mastered, as advanced students are expected to be able to apply experience with weapons to unarmed fighting.",
              "This not always the case though, as some systems of Arnis start with (and at times only consist of) empty hands fighting.",
              "Some notable masters of Mano Mano include: Paninipa, Pagsipa, Pananadiyak, Pagtadiyak, and Sikaran (all terms for \"kicking\" in various regions, dialects and styles) are components of eskrima that focus on knees, tripping, low-line kicks, and stomps.",
              "Pananjakman is also a term used in Filipino-American-developed and Western FMA systems, usually referring to the system from the Lucky Lucaylucay, Floro Villabrille and Dan Inosanto blend lineage.",
              "Except for the distinct style of Sikaran from the Baras area of the province of Rizal, which also uses high kicks, kicking as a separate art is never taught by itself in the Philippines, and this practice is only done in the West with Pananjakman.",
              "Pananjakman is usually taught together with Panantukan.",
              "Paninipa can be regarded as the study of leg muscles and bones and how they are connected, with the goal of either inflicting pain or outright breaking or dislocating the bones.",
              "Most striking techniques involve applying pressure to bend the target areas in unnatural ways so as to injure or break them.",
              "Such pressure may be delivered in the form of a heel smash, a toe kick, a stomp, or a knee.",
              "Targets include the groin, thighs, knees, shins, ankles, feet and toes.",
              "The upper body is used only for defensive maneuvers, making pananadiyak ideal for when combatants are engaged in a clinch.",
              "When used effectively, the strikes can bring an opponent to the ground or otherwise end an altercation by making them too weak to stand.",
              "Fundamental techniques include kicking or smashing the ankle to force it either towards or away from the opposite foot (severe supination or pronation, respectively), heel-stomping the top of the foot where it meets the lower leg so as to break or crush the numerous bones or otherwise disrupt the opponent's balance, and smashing the opponents knee from the side to break the knee (with severe supination and pronation as the desired result).",
              "Several classes of exercises, such as sombrada, contrada, sinawali, hubud-lubud and sequidas, initially presented to the public as a set of organized drills by the Inosanto school, are expressly designed to allow partners to move quickly and experiment with variations while remaining safe.",
              "For example, in a sumbrada drill, one partner feeds an attack, which the other counters, flowing into a counterattack, which is then countered, flowing into a counterattack, and so on.",
              "The hubud-lubud or hubad-lubad from Doce Pares is frequently used as a type of \"generator\" drill, where one is forced to act and think fast.",
              "Initially, students learn a specific series of attacks, counters, and counter-attacks.",
              "As they advance they can add minor variations, change the footwork, or switch to completely different attacks;",
              "eventually the exercise becomes almost completely free-form.",
              "Palakaw, from the Balintawak style, are un-choreographed and random defensive and offensive moves.",
              "Palakaw in Cebuano means a walk-through or rehearsing the different strike angles and defenses.",
              "It may be known as corridas, or striking without any order or pattern.",
              "Disarms, take-downs, and other techniques usually break the flow of such a drill, but they are usually initiated from such a sequence of movements to force the student to adapt to a variety of situations.",
              "A common practice is to begin a drill with each student armed with two weapons.",
              "Once the drill is flowing, if a student sees an opportunity to disarm their opponent, they do, but the drill continues until both students are empty-handed.",
              "Some drills use only a single weapon per pair, and the partners take turns disarming each other.",
              "Seguidas drills, taken from the San Miguel system, are sets of hitting and movement patterns usually involving stick and dagger.",
              "Rhythm, while an essential part of eskrima drills, is emphasized more in the United States and Europe, where a regular beat serves a guide for students to follow.",
              "To ensure safety, participants perform most drills at a constant pace, which they increase as they progress.",
              "The rhythm, together with the southern Filipino attire of a vest and sashed pants, is commonly mistaken for some sort of tradition when practising eskrima in the Philippines \u2013 perhaps incorrectly derived from traditional rhythm-based dances or an attempt to add a sense of ethnicity.",
              "Eskrima is usually practised in the Philippines without a rhythm, off-beat or out of rhythm.",
              "The diversity of Filipino martial arts means that there is no officially established standard uniform in eskrima.",
              "The live hand (or alive hand) is the opposite hand of the practitioner that does not contain the main weapon.",
              "The heavy usage of the live hand is an important concept and distinguishing hallmark of eskrima.",
              "Even (or especially) when empty, the live hand can be used as a companion weapon by eskrima practitioners.",
              "As opposed to most weapon systems like fencing where the off-hand is hidden and not used to prevent it from being hit, eskrima actively uses the live hand for trapping, locking, supporting weapon blocks, checking, disarming, striking and controlling the opponent.",
              "The usage of the live hand is one of the most evident examples of how Eskrima's method of starting with weapons training leads to effective empty hand techniques.",
              "Because of Doble Baston (double weapons) or Espada y Daga (sword and parrying dagger) ambidextrous weapon muscle memory conditioning, Eskrima practitioners find it easy to use the off-hand actively once they transition from using it with a weapon to an empty hand.",
              "Doble baston, and less frequently doble olisi, are common names for a group of techniques involving two sticks.",
              "The art is more commonly known around the world as Sinawali meaning \"to weave\".",
              "The term Sinawali is taken from a matting called sawali that is commonly used in the tribal Nipa Huts.",
              "It is made up of woven pieces of palm leaf and used for both flooring and walls.",
