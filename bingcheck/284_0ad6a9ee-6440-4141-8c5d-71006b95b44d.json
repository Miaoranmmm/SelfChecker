    "response": "Sure, I can explain the science behind how vaccines work and how they are able to provide immunity against infectious diseases. Here is a summary based on the information from the web search results:\n\nVaccines are a way of protecting the body from harmful germs, such as bacteria or viruses, that cause diseases. Vaccines work by imitating an infection and stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies and white blood cells that can fight off the real infection in the future[^1^] [^2^].\n\nThe immune system is the body's defense against disease. It uses white blood cells, such as macrophages, B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes, to recognize and destroy germs that invade the body[^1^]. Macrophages swallow up and digest germs and leave behind antigens, which are parts of the germs that the body identifies as dangerous. B-lymphocytes produce antibodies that attach to the antigens and mark them for destruction. T-lymphocytes help kill infected cells and remember how to fight the same germ again[^1^].\n\nThere are different types of vaccines that use different methods to imitate an infection and trigger an immune response. Some of the common types of vaccines are:\n\n- **Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines**: These vaccines give your cells instructions to build a harmless piece of a protein that is found on the surface of a germ, such as the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus. The protein triggers an immune response and teaches your body how to fight off the real germ if you encounter it[^1^] [^2^].\n- **Viral vector vaccines**: These vaccines use a weakened version of a different virus to deliver genetic material from the germ you want to protect against, such as the COVID-19 virus. The genetic material gives your cells instructions to make copies of a protein that is found on the surface of the germ. The protein triggers an immune response and teaches your body how to fight off the real germ if you encounter it[^2^].\n- **Protein subunit vaccines**: These vaccines include only the parts (proteins) of a germ that best stimulate your immune system, such as the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus. They may also have an ingredient called an adjuvant that helps boost your immune response. The proteins trigger an immune response and teach your body how to fight off the real germ if you encounter it[^2^].\n\nAfter getting vaccinated, it takes some time for your body to produce enough antibodies and white blood cells to provide immunity against a disease. Therefore, it is possible that you could still get infected with a disease just before or just after vaccination because your body has not had enough time to build protection[^1^]. Also, no vaccine is 100% effective, so it is possible that you could still get sick even after being fully vaccinated, but your symptoms would likely be milder than if you were not vaccinated[^1^].\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand how vaccines work and how they are able to provide immunity against infectious diseases.",

              "After they have eliminated an infection, white blood cells stop multiplying and their numbers dwindle until only a few are left to keep watch.",
              "At that point, a person is considered immunized.",
              "Because immunity can take weeks to develop after vaccination, it is possible to become infected in the weeks immediately following vaccination.",
              "Even after that, vaccinated people can and sometimes do get infected.",

              "Skin, mucus, and cilia (microscopic hairs that move debris away from the lungs) all work as physical barriers to prevent pathogens from entering the body in the first place.",
              "When a pathogen does infect the body, our body\u2019s defences, called the immune system, are triggered and the pathogen is attacked and destroyed or overcome.",
              "A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that can cause disease within the body.",
              "Each pathogen is made up of several subparts, usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes.",
              "The subpart of a pathogen that causes the formation of antibodies is called an antigen.",
              "The antibodies produced in response to the pathogen\u2019s antigen are an important part of the immune system.",

              "Each antibody, or soldier, in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen.",
              "We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies.",
              "When the human body is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it takes time for the immune system to respond and produce antibodies specific to that antigen.",
              "In the meantime, the person is susceptible to becoming ill.",
              "Once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced, they work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease.",
              "Antibodies to one pathogen generally don\u2019t protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other, like cousins.",
              "Once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an antigen, it also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies.",
              "If the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen.",
              "This means that if the person is exposed to the dangerous pathogen in the future, their immune system will be able to respond immediately, protecting against disease.",
              "Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body.",
              "Newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself.",
              "Regardless of whether the vaccine is made up of the antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the antigen, this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogen.",
              "Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart.",
              "This is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies and development of memory cells.",
              "In this way, the body is trained to fight the specific disease-causing organism, building up memory of the pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future.",
              "When someone is vaccinated, they are very likely to be protected against the targeted disease.",
              "But not everyone can be vaccinated.",
              "People with underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems (such as cancer or HIV) or who have severe allergies to some vaccine components may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines.",
              "These people can still be protected if they live in and amongst others who are vaccinated.",
              "When a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the pathogen has a hard time circulating because most of the people it encounters are immune.",
              "So the more that others are vaccinated, the less likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines are at risk of even being exposed to the harmful pathogens.",
              "This is called herd immunity.",
              "This is especially important for those people who not only can\u2019t be vaccinated but may be more susceptible to the diseases we vaccinate against.",
              "No single vaccine provides 100% protection, and herd immunity does not provide full protection to those who cannot safely be vaccinated.",
              "But with herd immunity, these people will have substantial protection, thanks to those around them being vaccinated.",

              "The immune response to a vaccine might cause tiredness and discomfort for a day or two, but the resulting protection can last a lifetime.",
              "Infections are unpredictable and can have long-term consequences.",
              "Even mild or symptom-less infections can be deadly.",
              "For example, most people infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV) never show any sign of infection.",
              "But for some, the sign appears years later as an aggressive, life-threatening cancer.",

              "Vaccines work by imitating an infection\u2014the presence of a disease-causing organism in the body\u2014to engage the body\u2019s natural defenses.",
              "The active ingredient in all vaccines is an antigen, the name for any substance that causes the immune system to begin producing antibodies.",
              "In a vaccine, the antigen could be either Antibodies are proteins produced by white blood cells to identify and neutralize foreign substances.",
              "White blood cells are created in the bone marrow but dispersed throughout the body in low numbers, ready to begin multiplying and attacking microbes and substances not native to the body.",
              "After they have eliminated an infection, white blood cells stop multiplying and their numbers dwindle until only a few are left to keep watch.",
              "At that point, a person is considered immunized.",
              "Because immunity can take weeks to develop after vaccination, it is possible to become infected in the weeks immediately following vaccination.",
              "Even after that, vaccinated people can and sometimes do get infected.",
              "But a vaccinated person is far less likely to die or become seriously ill than someone whose immune system is unprepared to fight an infection.",
              "A single dose of vaccine provides only partial protection.",
              "The number of doses needed to achieve immunity depends on whether the antigen in a vaccine is alive or not.",
              "Because they contain living bacteria or viruses, live-attenuated vaccines can provide enduring protection with only two doses.",
              "By contrast, non-live vaccines typically require at least three doses to achieve protection that fades over time and must be restored with booster doses.",

              "When a pathogen does infect the body, our body\u2019s defences, called the immune system, are triggered and the pathogen is attacked and destroyed or overcome.",
              "A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that can cause disease within the body.",
              "Each pathogen is made up of several subparts, usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes.",
              "The subpart of a pathogen that causes the formation of antibodies is called an antigen.",
              "The antibodies produced in response to the pathogen\u2019s antigen are an important part of the immune system.",
              "You can consider antibodies as the soldiers in your body\u2019s defense system.",
              "Each antibody, or soldier, in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen.",
              "We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies.",
              "When the human body is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it takes time for the immune system to respond and produce antibodies specific to that antigen.",
              "In the meantime, the person is susceptible to becoming ill.",
              "Once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced, they work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease.",
              "Antibodies to one pathogen generally don\u2019t protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other, like cousins.",
              "Once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an antigen, it also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies.",
              "If the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen.",
              "This means that if the person is exposed to the dangerous pathogen in the future, their immune system will be able to respond immediately, protecting against disease.",
              "Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body.",
              "Newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself.",
              "Regardless of whether the vaccine is made up of the antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the antigen, this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogen.",
              "Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart.",
              "This is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies and development of memory cells.",
              "In this way, the body is trained to fight the specific disease-causing organism, building up memory of the pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future.",
              "When someone is vaccinated, they are very likely to be protected against the targeted disease.",
              "But not everyone can be vaccinated.",
              "People with underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems (such as cancer or HIV) or who have severe allergies to some vaccine components may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines.",
              "These people can still be protected if they live in and amongst others who are vaccinated.",
              "When a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the pathogen has a hard time circulating because most of the people it encounters are immune.",
              "So the more that others are vaccinated, the less likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines are at risk of even being exposed to the harmful pathogens.",
              "This is called herd immunity.",
              "This is especially important for those people who not only can\u2019t be vaccinated but may be more susceptible to the diseases we vaccinate against.",
              "No single vaccine provides 100% protection, and herd immunity does not provide full protection to those who cannot safely be vaccinated.",
              "But with herd immunity, these people will have substantial protection, thanks to those around them being vaccinated.",
              "Vaccinating not only protects yourself, but also protects those in the community who are unable to be vaccinated.",
              "If you are able to, get vaccinated.",
              "Throughout history, humans have successfully developed vaccines for a number of life-threatening diseases, including meningitis, tetanus, measles and wild poliovirus.",
              "In the early 1900s, polio was a worldwide disease, paralysing hundreds of thousands of people every year.",

              "The gastrointestinal tract faces an unrivaled exposure to foreign antigens and, as a result, is home to the largest compartment of the immune system.",
              "This includes a network of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), including macrophages and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), that play distinct yet complementary roles in discriminating between innocuous antigens and potential pathogens, ensuring that the appropriate response is mounted to each.",
              "While this is a highly efficient process, it can break down in some individuals, leading to the development of chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in which inappropriate immune responses are mounted against the commensal microbiota.",
              "Thus, there is great interest in understanding the biology of intestinal MPs.",
              "The role of macrophages in health and disease has attracted particular attention, as their plasticity and wound healing capabilities make them attractive targets for potential novel therapies to treat IBD.",
              "In this article, we will first discuss the current understanding of macrophage heterogeneity in the gut wall, before describing the roles macrophages play in intestinal homeostasis and how this may depend on their anatomical positioning.",
              "We will then review the recent developments in intestinal macrophage ontogeny, discussing how the local environment of the gut imprints the phenotypic and functional identity of macrophages, before finally describing the changes that occur when homeostasis is perturbed by inflammation.",
              "One of the major issues that has stifled our progress on understanding the immunobiology of intestinal macrophages is their inaccurate identification.",
              "For instance, although murine macrophages have traditionally been identified based on their expression of the pan-macrophage marker F4/80 (1), it is clear that other cells, such as conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and eosinophils can express F4/80 to some extent (2, 3).",
              "Furthermore, many macrophages, including those in the intestine, express high levels of CD11c and MHCII, markers that have classically been used to identify cDCs (3).",
              "Thus, the identification of intestinal macrophages requires a multi-parameter approach.",
              "The Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) and the high affinity Fc\u03b3R1 (CD64), have emerged as superior markers for the identification of macrophages across different tissues (4\u20136), the latter also being useful across species (7\u20139, 10).",
              "When used in combination with CD11c and MHCII, CD64 expression distinguishes macrophages from bona fide cDC in the gut wall (5, 10, 11).",
              "This is corroborated by the distinct growth factor dependency and migration patterns of CD64-defined MPs.",
              "Whereas CD64+ MPs are highly dependent on colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1;",
              "also known as M-CSF) for their development and/or survival, CD64\u2212 CD11c+ MHCII+ MPs, but not CD64+ MPs, are highly dependent on the cDC-specific growth factor Flt3L (10, 11).",
              "Consistently, CD64\u2212 CD11c+MHCII+ MPs have been shown to continually migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes in a CCR7-dependent manner to participate in T cell priming (10, 12\u201314), defining features of cDC.",
              "In contrast, CD64+ MPs are non-migratory and display characteristic macrophage morphology, with abundant cytoplasm and cytoplasmic vacuoles (9, 15, 16).",
              "Thus, by multiple criteria, CD64\u2212 CD11c+ MHCII+ MPs and CD64+ MPs fit the definition of cDC and macrophages, respectively.",
              "One additional feature of murine intestinal macrophages that distinguishes them from cDC is their high expression of the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 (9, 15, 17\u201320).",
              "Indeed, by using Cx3cr1+/gfp knock-in mice (21), mature CX3CR1hi macrophages can be visualized throughout the lamina propria (LP), the large layer of connective tissue underlying the epithelium, as well as in the deeper layers of the gut wall, such as the submucosa and muscularis (17, 19, 20).",
              "Macrophages in these distinct sites are reported to express differential levels of CD11c, with CD11c+ and CD11c\u2212/lo CX3CR1hi macrophages enriched in the LP and muscularis, respectively (18, 20, 22).",
              "As discussed in more detail below, additional heterogeneity has been unmasked recently by transcriptional profiling, with discrete subsets of CX3CR1hi macrophages identifiable based on their expression of CD4 and Tim4 (23, 24).",
              "The recent advances in multi-parameter analysis have also led to the much-needed alignment of analysis of murine and human tissue macrophages.",
              "The use of markers such as CD64 and CD14 has meant that the same cells can be characterized across species (7, 9, 10, 25).",
              "This has highlighted similarities, but also important differences between mouse and man.",
              "For instance, expression of CD4, CD163, CD172a (SIRP\u03b1), and CD206 are conserved features of intestinal macrophages across species (7, 9, 23, 24, 26).",
              "However, mature intestinal macrophages in humans express only low levels of the CX3CR1 and CD11c markers found on their murine equivalents.",
              "Very recent work has also described potential phenotypic heterogeneity between human LP and muscularis macrophages, with the latter expressing higher levels of CD14 and CD11b (7).",
              "Macrophages play a variety of roles to maintain intestinal homeostasis (Figure \u200b(Figure1).",
              "1).",
              "Like their counterparts in other tissues, macrophages in the gut wall are avidly phagocytic.",
              "However, while being highly bactericidal, phagocytosis by intestinal macrophages does not result in an overt inflammatory response in both mouse and man (see below)(7, 9, 25, 27, 28).",
              "Consistent with this role, intestinal macrophages display high expression of genes associated with phagocytosis, such as Mertk, Cd206, Gas6, Axl, Cd36, Itgav, and Itgb5 (23, 29).",
              "Integrins \u03b1v and \u03b25 dimerise to form \u03b1v\u03b25, which is involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells (29), a process known as efferocytosis (30).",
              "Notably, Lys2-directed deletion of integrin \u03b1v results in the accumulation of apoptotic cells in the intestine (31), and Itgb5 deficiency predisposes to increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis (29), highlighting a particularly important role for this pathway in this process.",
              "Homeostatic functions of intestinal macrophages.",
              "Intestinal lamina propria (LP) macrophages are highly phagocytic and are responsible for clearing apoptotic and senescent epithelial cells.",
              "Through their expression of tissue-remodeling metalloproteinases and secretion of factors that stimulate epithelial stem cell renewal, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and Wnt ligands, they promote epithelial integrity.",
              "Their position under the epithelial monolayer and their bactericidal activity, mean LP macrophages are ideally placed to capture and destroy any bacteria that breach the barrier.",
              "They may also send cellular processes across the epithelial barrier to sample luminal contents.",
              "Macrophages can transfer acquired antigen to migratory dendritic cells (DCs) for presentation to T cells in the draining mesenteric lymph nodes.",
              "Through their production of immunoregulatory cytokines, such as IL10 and TGF\u03b2, they maintain and facilitate secondary expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) locally in the LP.",
              "In a similar manner, they support Th17 cells and ILC3s through their production of IL1\u03b2, which is induced by exposure to the microbiota or its derivatives.",
              "Macrophages are also present in deeper layers of the gut wall, including the submucosa and muscularis externae.",
              "Submucosa macrophages are thought to support the integrity of the submucosal vasculature, although the factors involved in this interaction remain unclear.",
              "Muscularis macrophages participate in bidirectional crosstalk with sympathetic neurons of the enteric nervous system and influence gut motility.",
              "The sub-epithelial positioning of LP macrophages means they are ideally placed to capture and eliminate any bacteria that cross the epithelial barrier.",
              "In addition, murine studies have shown that they are able to sample luminal bacteria, involving the formation of transepithelial dendrites (TEDs), cellular processes that cross the epithelial barrier without perturbing tight junctions and epithelial integrity and depend on the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis (32\u201334).",
              "A similar process may allow mature CX3CR1hi macrophages in the upper small bowel to capture dietary materials and is suggested to be involved in the generation of oral tolerance to dietary antigens (35).",
              "This requires the induction of antigen specific Tregs in the gut draining mesenteric lymph nodes with gut homing properties (36, 37).",
              "Given that CX3CR1hi macrophages do not migrate to draining lymph nodes under normal conditions and nai\u0308ve T cells are essentially absent in the LP (13, 15, 38), they are unlikely to play a major role in this process.",
              "However, they may contribute to the induction of oral tolerance through antigen transfer to migratory CD103+ DC via connexin-43-dependent gap junctions (35).",
              "Indeed, mice that lack connexin-43 in CD11c+ cells fail to develop oral tolerance (35).",
              "Macrophages have also been proposed to regulate oral tolerance development by supporting Treg maintenance locally in the mucosa 39, 37, 40.",
              "This is thought to involve macrophage-derived IL10, as Cx3cr1-mediated deletion of IL10 reduces antigen specific Treg frequencies in a model of oral tolerance (37, 40).",
              "Interestingly however, deletion of IL10 in macrophages appears to have no impact on the overall abundance of endogenous Treg (40, 41).",
              "In addition to Tregs, macrophages may also support the induction/maintenance of commensal-specific Th17 cells through IL1\u03b2 secretion (42, 43).",
              "Notably, whether maintenance of mucosal T cells also involves cognate interactions remains to be determined with certainty.",
              "Although macrophages are very poor in activating naive T cells compared to DCs (15), their high expression of MHCII suggests that they might be involved in antigen presentation to previously activated T cells locally in the intestine.",
              "By doing so, they could maintain or promote further differentiation of antigen-specific T cells.",
              "Consistent with this, Cx3cr1-mediated deletion of MHCII retards the generation/maintenance of antigen-specific Treg after feeding of ovalbumin (OVA) (40).",
              "Macrophages may also influence T cell priming indirectly through their effects on cDC differentiation.",
              "For instance, secretion of IL1\u03b2 has been shown to enhance ILC3 production of CSF2 (44), which is known to control cDC differentiation in the intestinal LP (45).",
              "Notably, most functional analyses have been performed in mice and whether human intestinal macrophages carry out the same roles remains unclear.",
              "While it has been known for many years that macrophages are present in deeper layers of the gut wall (46), only recently has work begun to interrogate their role in intestinal homeostasis.",
              "Macrophages in the muscularis are intimately associated with the enteric nervous system and, in mice, appear morphologically and transcriptionally distinct (47).",
              "There is bidirectional crosstalk between muscularis macrophages and neurons, where macrophage-derived bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) acts on the BMP receptor (BMPR) expressed by enteric neurons to induce secretion of CSF1, which maintains the muscularis macrophage compartment and stimulates further BMP2 expression (20, 22).",
              "These interactions regulate smooth muscle contractions, thereby controlling peristalsis, and can be disrupted by broad spectrum antibiotics (22), suggesting the microbiota may regulate gut motility to some extent (48).",
              "Macrophages are also found in the submucosa and recent depletion studies have revealed a role for these cells in maintaining the integrity of the submucosal vasculature (47).",
              "Thus, macrophages fulfill niche-specific functions to meet the local demands of their microenvironment.",
              "There have been major developments in our understanding of macrophage ontogeny in recent years [see (49) for review].",
              "Traditionally, it was proposed that tissue macrophages were derived from blood monocytes that were replenished in turn by highly proliferative bone marrow (BM) progenitors as part of a linear mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) (50, 51).",
              "Geissmann et al.",
              "(52) then refined this model demonstrating that the murine monocyte compartment, like its human counterpart (53), is heterogeneous, with subsets defined on the basis of Ly6C expression.",
              "In this scheme, Ly6Chi monocytes were shown to preferentially enter tissues under inflammatory conditions, leading to them being described as \u201cinflammatory\u201d monocytes (52).",
              "However, as discussed below, Ly6Chi monocytes can also be found in healthy tissues and tend to fulfill the functions classically ascribed to monocytes, therefore these are now referred to as \u201cclassical\u201d monocytes.",
              "Because they did not enter inflamed tissues, it was proposed that Ly6Clo monocytes were the precursors of tissue resident macrophages (52).",
              "However, adoptively transferred Ly6Clo monocytes rarely enter healthy tissues, even following diphtheria toxin (DT)-mediated depletion of resident macrophages (9, 17).",
              "Moreover, recent work has shown that a major function of \u2018non-classical' Ly6Clo monocytes is to patrol the vasculature and scavenge necrotic endothelial cells (54) rather than acting as a circulating intermediate.",
              "Thus, in some respects, Ly6Clo monocytes could be thought of as macrophages of the circulatory system.",
              "Rather than deriving from blood monocytes, recent elegant fate mapping techniques have shown that many tissue macrophages exist independently from conventional haematopoiesis and instead derive from embryonic precursors arising from the yolk sac and/or fetal liver (55\u201359).",
              "For instance, microglia of the central nervous system and epidermal Langerhans cells appear to maintain themselves autonomously through intrinsic longevity and in situ self-renewal throughout adult life (60\u201364).",
              "In contrast, we have shown that although the intestine is initially seeded by embryo-derived macrophages, these are subsequently displaced with age by cells deriving from conventional haematopoiesis (16).",
              "Consistently, colonic macrophages, but not microglia or Langerhans cells, are labeled in genetic fate mapping studies exploiting Flt3 or Kit expression to fate map cells deriving from haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (16, 55, 59, 65).",
              "Moreover, intestinal macrophages are largely replaced by donor cells in the setting of parabiosis and in tissue-protected bone marrow chimeric mice, unlike many other tissue macrophages (16, 56, 66\u201369).",
              "The finding that macrophage numbers are reduced in the gut wall of unmanipulated adult Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice (9), in whom classical Ly6Chi monocyte egress from BM is defective (70), implies that Ly6Chi and not Ly6Clo monocytes are the main precursors of intestinal macrophages in adulthood.",
              "In line with this, adoptively transferred classical Ly6Chi monocytes, but not Ly6Clo monocytes, give rise to fully mature intestinal macrophages (9, 17, 19, 71).",
              "Furthermore, intestinal macrophages are eliminated by repetitive administration of DT to CCR2-DTR transgenic mice (43, 72), again indicating that the macrophage pool relies on CCR2-dependent replenishment.",
              "Notably, as well as its role in BM egress, homeostatic extravasation of Ly6Chi monocytes from the bloodstream into the intestinal mucosa relies on the CCL2-CCR2 axis.",
              "This is demonstrated by the failure of both WT monocytes to enter the colonic mucosa of Ccl2-deficient mice and Ccr2-deficient monocytes to enter the mucosa of WT mice in mixed BM chimeras or in the setting of parabiosis (5, 16, 73).",
              "It is now clear that a monocyte to macrophage differentiation continuum exists in the intestinal LP, a process that has become known as the monocyte \u201cwaterfall\u201d (5, 9) (Figure \u200b(Figure2).",
              "2).",
              "At one end are Ly6Chi CX3CR1int MHCII\u2212 (\u201cP1\u201d) monocytes that appear phenotypically and morphologically similar to their counterparts in blood.",
              "Indeed, monocytes in the mucosa retain expression of molecules involved in chemotaxis and extravasation from the circulation, such as CCR2, CD62L, VLA-1, LFA-1, and of course Ly6C (23).",
              "These monocytes first acquire MHCII expression (\u2018P2' monocytes), before downregulating Ly6C, and the other markers of extravasation (\u201cP3\u201dmacrophages), and finally upregulating CX3CR1 to give rise to fully mature (\u201cP4\u201d) macrophages;",
              "this process takes around 5\u20136 days and involves major gene expression changes (5, 9, 23).",
              "Importantly, there is mounting evidence that an analogous \u201cwaterfall\u201d is present in the human intestinal mucosa, with classical CD14hiCCR2+CD11chi monocytes at one end and mature CD14loCCR2\u2212CD11clo macrophages at the other (7, 9, 25) (Figure \u200b(Figure2).",
              "2).",
              "In support of this, Bujko et al.",
              "have recently used HLA-mismatched duodenal transplants to measure turnover of intestinal macrophages in man, showing that donor CD14hiCCR2+CD11chi cells in the graft, which are analogous to P1/P2 cells in mouse, are rapidly replaced by recipient cells.",
              "Mature macrophages are also replaced by recipient-derived cells, albeit at slower rates (7).",
              "This contrasts markedly with Langerhans cells of the skin epidermis, which have been shown to remain of graft origin in transplanted skin for at least up to 10 years (74).",
              "Similarly, alveolar macrophages persist for up to 2 years in transplanted lungs (75).",
              "Thus, the limited data available from human transplant studies support the findings from fate mapping studies in mice (64, 65, 69, 76).",
              "Heterogeneity, origin and differentiation of intestinal macrophages.",
              "The majority of mucosal macrophages are replenished by classical monocytes that enter the mucosa in a CCR2-dependent manner and differentiate through a series of intermediaries (mouse-and human-specific markers denoted in blue and green, respectively) to give rise to mature macrophages, which can be identified in both mouse and man as CD64+MHCIIhi CD206+CD163+ cells (common markers denoted in red).",
              "In addition, high levels of CD11b, CD11c, CD14, and CX3CR1 are characteristic features of murine LP macrophages.",
              "In contrast, human LP macrophages express only low levels of most of these markers but express high levels of CD209.",
              "Once in the mucosa and under cues from the local environment, monocytes first upregulate MHCII and downregulate molecules involved in extravasation, such as CCR2, LFA-1 and CD62L.",
              "They then upregulate phagocytic receptors and increase their production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as becoming hyporesponsive to stimulation through e.",
              "g., TLRs.",
              "Studies in mice have identified IL10, TGF\u03b2, and CX3CL1 as key factors in promoting macrophage differentiation in the healthy mucosa.",
              "Furthermore, exposure to the microbiota and its metabolites is known to influence macrophage differentiation and the rate of their turnover in the LP.",

              "Despite the evidence that intestinal macrophages are derived from continuous replenishment by extravasating monocytes, this idea may need to be refined on the basis of very recent findings that long-lived macrophages may be present in the adult intestine (24, 47).",
              "Longitudinal fate-mapping using Cx3cr1-based strategies and tissue-protected BM chimeric mice have identified macrophages that persist for longer than 8 months in the gut wall (47).",
              "Two independent studies showed that long-lived macrophages can be identified by Tim4 and CD4 expression (24, 47), which are unaffected by Ccr2 deficiency, unlike most of their Tim4\u2212 counterparts (24).",
              "This is consistent with the long-lived nature of Tim4-expressing macrophages in other tissues, such as the liver and the peritoneal cavity (69, 77).",
              "Notably, De Schepper and colleagues (47) showed that long-lived macrophages were predominantly found in the deeper layers of the gut wall, such as the muscularis and submucosa, whereas mucosal macrophages showed high levels of turnover from BM.",
              "Importantly, this group also showed that long-lived macrophages derived from both embryonic and BM-derived cells, demonstrating that intrinsic longevity is not an exclusive property of embryo-derived macrophages (47).",
              "Thus, in light of these findings, it is clear that the origin of intestinal macrophages is highly dynamic, with embryonic and BM-derived macrophages present alongside one another in each layer of the gut wall, the proportions of which change markedly with age and microbial colonization in a niche-specific manner (see below).",
              "Indeed, this brings the gut into line with other tissues, such as the heart (58, 78, 79), lung (65, 69, 80), dermis (67), and the peritoneal cavity (69, 81, 82) where short-lived and long-lived macrophages co-exist.",
              "Here it should also be noted that it has never been shown definitely that patrolling Ly6Clo monocytes cannot contribute to gut macrophage replenishment.",
              "One approach has been to assess macrophage abundance in the gut wall of mice in whom Ly6Clo blood monocytes are markedly reduced, for instance those deficient in Cx3cr1 (37, 83).",
              "However, different groups have reached discordant conclusions on the effect of Cx3cr1 deficiency on intestinal macrophage numbers (37, 83).",
              "Furthermore, given the high expression of CX3CR1 by intestinal macrophages themselves, effects of Cx3cr1 deficiency may be due to altered differentiation and/or survival of mature macrophages rather than indicating derivation from Ly6Clo monocytes (see below).",
              "More recent work has identified Nr4a1 as a master regulator of Ly6Clo monocyte differentiation and survival (84).",
              "New tools that specifically target Nr4a1 deficiency to monocytes, while sparing its roles in macrophage function, such as those described recently by Hedrick and colleagues (85), will be critical to assess the role of Ly6Clo monocytes in tissue macrophage replenishment under normal physiological conditions and if this changes in the context of disease.",
              "The exact factors that determine why different tissues contain macrophages of distinct origins remain very poorly understood.",
              "Specifically, it is unknown how and why embryonic-derived macrophages persist in the CNS and the epidermis, but fail to persist in significant numbers in the gut mucosa.",
              "It has been proposed that this could simply reflect niche accessibility and availability (86) and indeed, there is free accessibility to the mucosa throughout life, whereas the brain and epidermis are separated from the vasculature during development by the blood brain barrier and basement membrane, respectively.",
              "However, other tissue macrophages that are not separated from the vasculature by a physical barrier, such as liver Kupffer cells, also exist relatively autonomously, suggesting that tissue accessibility may not be the main factor influencing replacement by blood monocytes (65).",
              "In the intestine, monocyte recruitment may be driven by the \u201cphysiological inflammation\u201d generated by exposure to antigenic material from the diet or commensal bacteria (87).",
              "Indeed, there are now several lines of evidence to demonstrate a key role for the microbiota in influencing macrophage population dynamics in the mucosa.",
              "First, major changes in the colonic macrophage compartment are seen following microbial colonization, particularly at the point of weaning where monocyte differentiation through the monocyte \u201cwaterfall\u201d becomes established (16).",
              "Secondly, macrophage turnover can be reduced by administration of broad spectrum antibiotics, further indicating a role of the commensal microbiota in controlling macrophage turnover (16).",
              "Moreover, fewer macrophages are found in the gut wall of germ free mice compared with their SPF counterparts(16, 24, 88).",
              "The mucosal microenvironment may actually programme macrophages to orchestrate their own replacement.",
              "This is supported by the findings that as intestinal macrophages mature, they progressively upregulate monocyte chemoattractants, such as CCL7, CCL8, and CCL12 (23).",
              "As noted above, the microbiota may constitute one stimulus for this differentiation and additional possibilities could include dietary metabolites or the continual mechanical stress generated by peristalsis.",
              "Mechanical stress has been suggested to explain the replacement of embryo-derived macrophages in the heart (89) and as well as generating low grade \u201cinflammation,\u201d it could simply prevent long term macrophage residence.",
              "That differential turnover rates of macrophages are observed in distinct anatomical locales of the gut wall could reflect the fact that particular niches do not support macrophage self-renewal.",
              "However, whether distinct macrophage subpopulations display differential rates of proliferation has not been tested experimentally.",
              "Thus, while some progress has been made in understanding macrophage turnover dynamics, more work is needed to identify the factors that govern this process.",
              "While it is clear that monocytes progress through a defined series of intermediaries to replenish the majority of macrophages in the gut, the molecular factors in the gut environment that imprint the unique phenotypic and functional profile of intestinal macrophages are only starting to be understood.",
              "CSF1 is clearly involved in the differentiation and/or survival of intestinal macrophages, as demonstrated by their reduction in Csf1op/op mice, which have a naturally occurring inactivating mutation in the CSF1 gene (90, 91), their inability to arise from Csf1r\u2212/\u2212 precursors in a competitive BM chimeric setting (11) and their depletion by anti-CSF1R antibody treatment (22, 92, 93).",
              "As described above, upregulation of MHCII is one of the first features of monocyte differentiation in the mucosa of mouse and man (5, 7, 9).",
              "Although it is clear that this occurs independently of the IFN\u03b3-STAT1 pathway (94), the exact factors that drive upregulation of MHCII remain unclear.",
              "Given that this appears to be a common feature of monocytes entering a variety of tissues (16, 59, 67, 68, 95), it is plausible that MHCII expression may be triggered by extravasation through the vascular endothelium (68).",
              "Indeed monocytes in the colonic mucosa already display major transcriptional differences compared with their counterparts in blood (23), despite appearing phenotypically similar.",
              "This is tissue specific, because recently arrived colonic monocytes are also transcriptionally distinct from their phenotypic counterparts in the dermis (23).",
              "Once in the mucosa, we have shown that TGF\u03b2R signaling is essential for the terminal differentiation of macrophages.",
              "In particular, upregulation of genes associated with the homeostatic profile of gut macrophages, such as CX3CR1, IL10, and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin relies on the TGF\u03b2-TGF\u03b2R axis (23).",
              "Consistent with this, expression of the Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), which regulates TGF\u03b2 signaling, is a unique feature of intestinal macrophages (96).",
              "The TGF\u03b2-TGF\u03b2R axis may also regulate macrophage turnover by dampening expression of the monocyte chemoattractant CCL8 by colonic macrophages (23).",
              "Although many sources of TGF\u03b2 exist in the mucosa, macrophages themselves may be important, since efferocytosis is known to induce TGF\u03b2 expression in macrophages (97) and, at least in man, macrophages may activate TGF\u03b2 through their expression of integrin \u03b28 (98).",
              "Indeed, uptake of apoptotic epithelial cells induces an anti-inflammatory programme in intestinal macrophages (99).",
              "The epithelium may also support macrophage differentiation through expression of Notch ligands, such as Delta-like and Jagged family members, as mature macrophages express high levels of Hes1 (23), a downstream target of Notch signaling, and their differentiation is disrupted when Notch signaling is ablated (100).",
              "A characteristic feature of mature intestinal macrophages is their hyporesponsiveness to exogenous stimulation (9, 27, 101\u2013105), a functional adaptation that allows these cells to exist in this microbe-rich environment.",
              "Interestingly, TGF\u03b2 does not appear to be responsible for the unresponsiveness of intestinal macrophages to TLR stimulation in mice (23), whereas this is proposed to be a key role of TGF\u03b2 in the human mucosa (102, 105).",
              "In contrast, the IL10-IL10R axis plays a fundamental role in the control of macrophage responsiveness in both species.",
              "Colonic macrophages from mice in which this axis has been disrupted, either globally or specifically in myeloid cells, have heightened expression of proinflammatory mediators, such as iNOS, IL23, and IL12.",
              "As a result, they display overt responsiveness to TLR stimulation and an altered metabolic profile, leading to the development of spontaneous intestinal inflammation (41, 103, 106\u2013109) that can be rescued by rendering macrophages unresponsive to TLR stimulation through cell specific deletion of the TLR adaptor molecule MyD88 (110).",
              "Early onset IBD occurs in patients with polymorphisms in IL10RA and IL10RB genes (111), and in vitro generated monocyte-derived macrophages from these patients respond aggressively to LPS stimulation (108).",
              "The exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses in the absence of IL10R signaling may result from a failure to downregulate inflammation potentiating molecules such as TREM-1 and STAT1 (41, 112) and/or altered accessibility to pro-inflammatory genes that is normally restricted by IL10-dependent chromatin remodeling (113, 114).",
              "IL10 can also limit pro-inflammatory responses by inducing expression of negative regulators of NF-kB, such as IBNS (115).",
              "The high expression of CX3CR1 by murine intestinal macrophages and their positioning adjacent to CX3CL1-producing epithelial cells suggests that the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis could also control macrophage differentiation.",
              "For instance, CX3CR1 is indispensable for the formation of TEDs that permit luminal sampling by LP macrophages (32\u201334).",
              "Furthermore, Cx3cr1-deficient macrophages produce less IL10 (37), suggesting the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis promotes the regulatory features of gut macrophages.",
              "In line with this, Cx3cr1-deficient mice have been shown to be more susceptible to chemically-induced colitis (83), although this has been contested by other reports showing that Cx3cr1 deficiency suppresses DSS-induced and T cell transfer colitis (32, 34).",
              "However, as noted above, human intestinal macrophages do not express CX3CR1, raising questions about the general significance of its role.",
              "In addition to influencing their turnover (16, 24), the microbiota is required for optimal production of IL1\u03b2 (42) and IL10 by intestinal macrophages(40, 71, 103), with the latter proposed to rely on autocrine type 1 IFNs (116).",
              "Microbial colonization may also contribute to the anergic phenotype of colonic macrophages, since some studies have shown them to display TLR hyperresponsiveness when isolated from germ free mice (103), although this is disputed by others (104).",
              "The microbiota may act directly on macrophages, for example through the release of as yet unidentified polysaccharides, such as that recently identified by the Powrie group to be released by H.",

              "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) ligands derived from the microbiome or the diet may also control macrophage behavior.",
              "Consistent with this idea, CD11cCre-Ahrfl/fl mice display heightened susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis, which is attributed to altered Wnt ligand expression by AhR-deficient macrophages and impaired epithelial barrier integrity (122).",
              "Thus, multiple environmental factors act in concert to control macrophage differentiation and function in the mucosa.",
              "The equivalent factors controlling macrophage differentiation in the muscularis remain relatively unexplored, although it is clear they are acutely dependent on CSF1R signaling (22).",
              "In addition, norepinephrine signaling by sympathetic neurons via \u03b22 adrenergic receptors on muscularis macrophages has been reported to shape their tissue protective phenotype (20).",
              "Notably, the abundance and patterning of macrophages in the muscularis is not dependent on neuronal signals because they are normal in Ret\u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack an enteric nervous system, as well as in patients with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), where the enteric nervous system is absent from the distal bowel (123).",
              "The monocyte/macrophage compartment alters markedly in both CD and UC, with accumulation of CD14hiCD11chi monocytes/immature macrophages that come to outnumber CD64+HLA-DRhiCD14lo resident macrophages (9, 27, 124,\u2013127).",
              "In contrast to their homeostatic counterparts, these CD14hi cells in the gut produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL6, IL12, IL23, and CCL11 (125, 127), display respiratory burst activity (128) and respond in an aberrant manner to commensal bacteria (125).",

              "Importantly, mucosal healing in IBD patients receiving anti-TNF has been shown to be accompanied by loss of these CD14hi cells and accumulation of CD206+ macrophages, which are thought to be pro-reparative (130).",
              "Although anti-TNF (adalimumab) has been shown to bind membrane-bound TNF on CD14+ intestinal macrophages in CD patients (131, 132), whether this triggers a phenotypic switch of existing pro-inflammatory macrophages or if these are replaced by CD206+ macrophages remains unclear.",
              "Thus, much of the recent work in this field has focussed on understanding the relationship between homeostatic and pro-inflammatory macrophages and the nature of their precursors, with the ultimate aim of identifying novel therapeutic targets.",

              "Interestingly, resolution of inflammation in post-operative ileus is delayed in Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that recruited Ly6Chi monocytes and their derivatives are important for restoration of homeostasis in the muscularis (179).",
              "The fate of the monocytes elicited during inflammation in the repairing mucosa is unclear, although it is assumed that they are cleared by apoptosis, as in other tissues (180).",

              "In the process of clonal deletion, immature B cells that bind strongly to self-antigens expressed on tissues are signaled to induce their own destruction by apoptosis, removing them from the population.",
              "In the process of clonal anergy, however, B cells exposed to soluble antigen in the bone marrow are not physically deleted, but become unable to function.",
              "Another mechanism called peripheral tolerance is a direct result of T cell tolerance.",

              "At the other end of the molecule are two identical antigen-binding sites.",
              "In general, antibodies have two basic functions.",
              "They can act as the B cell antigen receptor or they can be secreted, circulate, and bind to a pathogen, often labeling it for identification by other forms of the immune response.",

              "As the primary response proceeds, the antibody produced in a B cell can change to IgG, IgA, or IgE by the process known as class switching.",
              "Class switching is the change of one antibody class to another.",
              "While the class of antibody changes, the specificity and the antigen-binding sites do not.",
              "Thus, the antibodies made are still specific to the pathogen that stimulated the initial IgM response.",
              "IgG is a major antibody of late primary responses and the main antibody of secondary responses in the blood.",
              "This is because class switching occurs during primary responses.",
              "IgG is a monomeric antibody that clears pathogens from the blood and can activate complement proteins (although not as well as IgM), taking advantage of its antibacterial activities.",
              "Furthermore, this class of antibody is the one that crosses the placenta to protect the developing fetus from disease exits the blood to the interstitial fluid to fight extracellular pathogens.",
              "IgA exists in two forms, a four-chain monomer in the blood and an eight-chain structure, or dimer, in exocrine gland secretions of the mucous membranes, including mucus, saliva, and tears.",
              "Thus, dimeric IgA is the only antibody to leave the interior of the body to protect body surfaces.",
              "IgA is also of importance to newborns, because this antibody is present in mothera\u0302\u0080\u0099s breast milk (colostrum), which serves to protect the infant from disease.",
              "IgE is usually associated with allergies and anaphylaxis.",
              "It is present in the lowest concentration in the blood, because its Fc region binds strongly to an IgE-specific Fc receptor on the surfaces of mast cells.",
              "IgE makes mast cell degranulation very specific, such that if a person is allergic to peanuts, there will be peanut-specific IgE bound to their mast cells.",
              "In this person, eating peanuts will cause the mast cells to degranulate, sometimes causing severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, a severe, systemic allergic response that can cause death.",
              "Clonal selection and expansion work much the same way in B cells as in T cells.",
              "Only B cells with appropriate antigen specificity are selected for and expanded (Figure 21.",
              "23).",
              "Eventually, the plasma cells secrete antibodies with antigenic specificity identical to those that were on the surfaces of the selected B cells.",
              "Notice in the figure that both plasma cells and memory B cells are generated simultaneously.",
              "Primary and secondary responses as they relate to T cells were discussed earlier.",
              "This section will look at these responses with B cells and antibody production.",
              "Because antibodies are easily obtained from blood samples, they are easy to follow and graph (Figure 21.",
              "24).",
              "As you will see from the figure, the primary response to an antigen (representing a pathogen) is delayed by several days.",
              "This is the time it takes for the B cell clones to expand and differentiate into plasma cells.",
              "The level of antibody produced is low, but it is sufficient for immune protection.",
              "The second time a person encounters the same antigen, there is no time delay, and the amount of antibody made is much higher.",
              "Thus, the secondary antibody response overwhelms the pathogens quickly and, in most situations, no symptoms are felt.",
              "When a different antigen is used, another primary response is made with its low antibody levels and time delay.",
              "Immunity to pathogens, and the ability to control pathogen growth so that damage to the tissues of the body is limited, can be acquired by (1) the active development of an immune response in the infected individual or (2) the passive transfer of immune components from an immune individual to a nonimmune one.",
              "Both active and passive immunity have examples in the natural world and as part of medicine.",
              "Active immunity is the resistance to pathogens acquired during an adaptive immune response within an individual (Table 21.",

              "Artificially acquired active immunity involves the use of vaccines.",
              "A vaccine is a killed or weakened pathogen or its components that, when administered to a healthy individual, leads to the development of immunological memory (a weakened primary immune response) without causing much in the way of symptoms. Thus, with the use of vaccines, one can avoid the damage from disease that results from the first exposure to the pathogen, yet reap the benefits of protection from immunological memory.",
              "The advent of vaccines was one of the major medical advances of the twentieth century and led to the eradication of smallpox and the control of many infectious diseases, including polio, measles, and whooping cough.",
              "Passive immunity arises from the transfer of antibodies to an individual without requiring them to mount their own active immune response.",
              "Naturally acquired passive immunity is seen during fetal development.",
              "IgG is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus via the placenta, protecting the fetus from infection and protecting the newborn for the first few months of its life.",
              "As already stated, a newborn benefits from the IgA antibodies it obtains from milk during breastfeeding.",
              "The fetus and newborn thus benefit from the immunological memory based on the pathogens to which the pregnant person has been exposed.",
              "In medicine, artificially acquired passive immunity usually involves injections of immunoglobulins, taken from animals previously exposed to a specific pathogen.",
              "This treatment is a fast-acting method of temporarily protecting an individual who was possibly exposed to a pathogen.",
              "The downside to both types of passive immunity is the lack of the development of immunological memory.",
              "Once the antibodies are transferred, they are effective for only a limited time before they degrade.",
              "Immunity can be acquired in an active or passive way, and it can be natural or artificial.",

              "A T cell-independent antigen usually is in the form of repeated carbohydrate moieties found on the cell walls of bacteria.",
              "Each antibody on the B cell surface has two binding sites, and the repeated nature of T cell-independent antigen leads to crosslinking of the surface antibodies on the B cell.",
              "The crosslinking is enough to activate it in the absence of T cell cytokines.",
              "A T cell-dependent antigen, on the other hand, usually is not repeated to the same degree on the pathogen and thus does not crosslink surface antibody with the same efficiency.",
              "To elicit a response to such antigens, the B and T cells must come close together (Figure 21.",

              "Its surface immunoglobulin must recognize native antigen.",
              "Some of this antigen is internalized, processed, and presented to the Th2 cells on a class II MHC molecule.",
              "The T cell then binds using its antigen receptor and is activated to secrete cytokines that diffuse to the B cell, finally activating it completely.",
              "Thus, the B cell receives signals from both its surface antibody and the T cell via its cytokines, and acts as a professional antigen-presenting cell in the process.",

              "Early microbiologists took serum from an immune patient and mixed it with a fresh culture of the same type of bacteria, then observed the bacteria under a microscope.",
              "The bacteria became clumped in a process called agglutination.",
              "When a different bacterial species was used, the agglutination did not happen.",
              "Thus, there was something in the serum of immune individuals that could specifically bind to and agglutinate bacteria.",
              "Scientists now know the cause of the agglutination is an antibody molecule, also called an immunoglobulin.",
              "What is an antibody?",
              "An antibody protein is essentially a secreted form of a B cell receptor.",
              "(In fact, surface immunoglobulin is another name for the B cell receptor.)",
              "Not surprisingly, the same genes encode both the secreted antibodies and the surface immunoglobulins.",
              "One minor difference in the way these proteins are synthesized distinguishes a nai\u0308ve B cell with antibody on its surface from an antibody-secreting plasma cell with no antibodies on its surface.",
              "The antibodies of the plasma cell have the exact same antigen-binding site and specificity as their B cell precursors.",
              "There are five different classes of antibody found in humans: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE.",
              "Each of these has specific functions in the immune response, so by learning about them, researchers can learn about the great variety of antibody functions critical to many adaptive immune responses.",
              "B cells do not recognize antigen in the complex fashion of T cells.",
              "B cells can recognize native, unprocessed antigen and do not require the participation of MHC molecules and antigen-presenting cells.",
              "B cells differentiate in the bone marrow.",
              "During the process of maturation, up to 100 trillion different clones of B cells are generated, which is similar to the diversity of antigen receptors seen in T cells.",
              "B cell differentiation and the development of tolerance are not quite as well understood as it is in T cells.",
              "Central tolerance is the destruction or inactivation of B cells that recognize self-antigens in the bone marrow, and its role is critical and well established.",
              "In the process of clonal deletion, immature B cells that bind strongly to self-antigens expressed on tissues are signaled to induce their own destruction by apoptosis, removing them from the population.",
              "In the process of clonal anergy, however, B cells exposed to soluble antigen in the bone marrow are not physically deleted, but become unable to function.",
              "Another mechanism called peripheral tolerance is a direct result of T cell tolerance.",
              "In peripheral tolerance, functional, mature B cells leave the bone marrow but have yet to be exposed to self-antigen.",
              "Most protein antigens require signals from helper T cells (Th2) to proceed to make antibody.",
              "When a B cell binds to a self-antigen but receives no signals from a nearby Th2 cell to produce antibody, the cell is signaled to undergo apoptosis and is destroyed.",
              "This is yet another example of the control that T cells have over the adaptive immune response.",
              "After B cells are activated by their binding to antigen, they differentiate into plasma cells.",
              "Plasma cells often leave the secondary lymphoid organs, where the response is generated, and migrate back to the bone marrow, where the whole differentiation process started.",
              "After secreting antibodies for a specific period, they die, as most of their energy is devoted to making antibodies and not to maintaining themselves.",
              "Thus, plasma cells are said to be terminally differentiated.",
              "The final B cell of interest is the memory B cell, which results from the clonal expansion of an activated B cell.",
              "Memory B cells function in a way similar to memory T cells.",
              "They lead to a stronger and faster secondary response when compared to the primary response, as illustrated below.",
              "Antibodies are glycoproteins consisting of two types of polypeptide chains with attached carbohydrates.",
              "The heavy chain and the light chain are the two polypeptides that form the antibody.",
              "The main differences between the classes of antibodies are in the differences between their heavy chains, but as you shall see, the light chains have an important role, forming part of the antigen-binding site on the antibody molecules.",
              "All antibody molecules have two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains.",
              "(Some antibodies contain multiple units of this four-chain structure.)",
              "The Fc region of the antibody is formed by the two heavy chains coming together, usually linked by disulfide bonds (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)).",
              "The Fc portion of the antibody is important in that many effector cells of the immune system have Fc receptors.",
              "Cells having these receptors can then bind to antibody-coated pathogens, greatly increasing the specificity of the effector cells.",
              "At the other end of the molecule are two identical antigen-binding sites.",
              "In general, antibodies have two basic functions.",
              "They can act as the B cell antigen receptor or they can be secreted, circulate, and bind to a pathogen, often labeling it for identification by other forms of the immune response.",
              "Of the five antibody classes, notice that only two can function as the antigen receptor for nai\u0308ve B cells: IgM and IgD (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)).",
              "Mature B cells that leave the bone marrow express both IgM and IgD, but both antibodies have the same antigen specificity.",
              "Only IgM is secreted, however, and no other nonreceptor function for IgD has been discovered.",
              "IgM consists of five four-chain structures (20 total chains with 10 identical antigen-binding sites) and is thus the largest of the antibody molecules.",
              "IgM is usually the first antibody made during a primary response.",
              "Its 10 antigen-binding sites and large shape allow it to bind well to many bacterial surfaces.",
              "It is excellent at binding complement proteins and activating the complement cascade, consistent with its role in promoting chemotaxis, opsonization, and cell lysis.",
              "Thus, it is a very effective antibody against bacteria at early stages of a primary antibody response.",
              "As the primary response proceeds, the antibody produced in a B cell can change to IgG, IgA, or IgE by the process known as class switching.",
              "Class switching is the change of one antibody class to another.",
              "While the class of antibody changes, the specificity and the antigen-binding sites do not.",
              "Thus, the antibodies made are still specific to the pathogen that stimulated the initial IgM response.",
              "IgG is a major antibody of late primary responses and the main antibody of secondary responses in the blood.",
              "This is because class switching occurs during primary responses.",
              "IgG is a monomeric antibody that clears pathogens from the blood and can activate complement proteins (although not as well as IgM), taking advantage of its antibacterial activities.",
              "Furthermore, this class of antibody is the one that crosses the placenta to protect the developing fetus from disease exits the blood to the interstitial fluid to fight extracellular pathogens.",
              "IgA exists in two forms, a four-chain monomer in the blood and an eight-chain structure, or dimer, in exocrine gland secretions of the mucous membranes, including mucus, saliva, and tears.",
              "Thus, dimeric IgA is the only antibody to leave the interior of the body to protect body surfaces.",
              "IgA is also of importance to newborns, because this antibody is present in mother\u2019s breast milk (colostrum), which serves to protect the infant from disease.",
              "IgE is usually associated with allergies and anaphylaxis.",
              "It is present in the lowest concentration in the blood, because its Fc region binds strongly to an IgE-specific Fc receptor on the surfaces of mast cells.",
              "IgE makes mast cell degranulation very specific, such that if a person is allergic to peanuts, there will be peanut-specific IgE bound to their mast cells.",
              "In this person, eating peanuts will cause the mast cells to degranulate, sometimes causing severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, a severe, systemic allergic response that can cause death.",
              "Clonal selection and expansion work much the same way in B cells as in T cells.",
              "Only B cells with appropriate antigen specificity are selected for and expanded (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)).",
              "Eventually, the plasma cells secrete antibodies with antigenic specificity identical to those that were on the surfaces of the selected B cells.",
              "Notice in the figure that both plasma cells and memory B cells are generated simultaneously.",
              "Primary and secondary responses as they relate to T cells were discussed earlier.",
              "This section will look at these responses with B cells and antibody production.",
              "Because antibodies are easily obtained from blood samples, they are easy to follow and graph (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)).",
              "As you will see from the figure, the primary response to an antigen (representing a pathogen) is delayed by several days.",
              "This is the time it takes for the B cell clones to expand and differentiate into plasma cells.",
              "The level of antibody produced is low, but it is sufficient for immune protection.",
              "The second time a person encounters the same antigen, there is no time delay, and the amount of antibody made is much higher.",
              "Thus, the secondary antibody response overwhelms the pathogens quickly and, in most situations, no symptoms are felt.",
              "When a different antigen is used, another primary response is made with its low antibody levels and time delay.",
              "Immunity to pathogens, and the ability to control pathogen growth so that damage to the tissues of the body is limited, can be acquired by (1) the active development of an immune response in the infected individual or (2) the passive transfer of immune components from an immune individual to a nonimmune one.",
              "Both active and passive immunity have examples in the natural world and as part of medicine.",
              "Active immunity is the resistance to pathogens acquired during an adaptive immune response within an individual (Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)).",
              "Naturally acquired active immunity, the response to a pathogen, is the focus of this chapter.",
              "Artificially acquired active immunity involves the use of vaccines.",
              "A vaccine is a killed or weakened pathogen or its components that, when administered to a healthy individual, leads to the development of immunological memory (a weakened primary immune response) without causing much in the way of symptoms. Thus, with the use of vaccines, one can avoid the damage from disease that results from the first exposure to the pathogen, yet reap the benefits of protection from immunological memory.",
              "The advent of vaccines was one of the major medical advances of the twentieth century and led to the eradication of smallpox and the control of many infectious diseases, including polio, measles, and whooping cough.",
              "Passive immunity arises from the transfer of antibodies to an individual without requiring them to mount their own active immune response.",
              "Naturally acquired passive immunity is seen during fetal development.",
              "IgG is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus via the placenta, protecting the fetus from infection and protecting the newborn for the first few months of its life.",
              "As already stated, a newborn benefits from the IgA antibodies it obtains from milk during breastfeeding.",
              "The fetus and newborn thus benefit from the immunological memory based on the pathogens to which the pregnant person has been exposed.",
              "In medicine, artificially acquired passive immunity usually involves injections of immunoglobulins, taken from animals previously exposed to a specific pathogen.",
              "This treatment is a fast-acting method of temporarily protecting an individual who was possibly exposed to a pathogen.",
              "The downside to both types of passive immunity is the lack of the development of immunological memory.",
              "Once the antibodies are transferred, they are effective for only a limited time before they degrade.",
              "Immunity can be acquired in an active or passive way, and it can be natural or artificial.",
              "Watch this video to see an animated discussion of passive and active immunity.",
              "What is an example of natural immunity acquired passively?",
              "As discussed previously, Th2 cells secrete cytokines that drive the production of antibodies in a B cell, responding to complex antigens such as those made by proteins.",
              "On the other hand, some antigens are T cell independent.",
              "A T cell-independent antigen usually is in the form of repeated carbohydrate moieties found on the cell walls of bacteria.",
              "Each antibody on the B cell surface has two binding sites, and the repeated nature of T cell-independent antigen leads to crosslinking of the surface antibodies on the B cell.",
              "The crosslinking is enough to activate it in the absence of T cell cytokines.",
              "A T cell-dependent antigen, on the other hand, usually is not repeated to the same degree on the pathogen and thus does not crosslink surface antibody with the same efficiency.",
              "To elicit a response to such antigens, the B and T cells must come close together (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\)).",
              "The B cell must receive two signals to become activated.",
              "Its surface immunoglobulin must recognize native antigen.",
              "Some of this antigen is internalized, processed, and presented to the Th2 cells on a class II MHC molecule.",
              "The T cell then binds using its antigen receptor and is activated to secrete cytokines that diffuse to the B cell, finally activating it completely.",
              "Thus, the B cell receives signals from both its surface antibody and the T cell via its cytokines, and acts as a professional antigen-presenting cell in the process.",

              "The human body has evolved a complex symbiotic relationship with innocuous, commensal bacteria in which immunological defense mechanisms are tempered, to allow a state of mutualism that is beneficial to both the host and the colonizing microbiota.",
              "However, mucosal surfaces of the human body also frequently encounter harmful bacterial pathogens and, in response, employ immune defense mechanisms designed to counteract such pathogenic assault.",
              "Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the surface of bacteria, such as lipopolysaccharides and endotoxins, initially triggers a rapid, first-line of defense that is driven by the innate immune system.",
              "Such protective immunity was originally thought to not be retained in any form of enduring immunological memory.",
              "However, this concept was recently challenged, revealing that cellular components of the innate immune system possess \u201ctrained immunity\u201d and retain the ability to respond faster, upon pathogen reencounter [1].",
              "Immunological memory is more classically witnessed in the adaptive immune system, composed of T cells and B cells, which respond to foreign antigens from pathogens to orchestrate protective immune responses that persist and are memorized.",
              "In the T cell arm of adaptive immunity, CD8+ T cells function to kill infected cells, whilst CD4+ T cells support memory CD8+ T cell responses [2,3] and antibody-generating B cells [4], whilst also possessing direct killing capabilities.",
              "T cells use membrane-bound, heterodimeric T cell receptors (TCRs) to detect and respond to infected cells expressing foreign antigen, and are classically sub-divided based on their expression of \u03b1\u03b2 or \u03b3\u03b4 TCRs.",
              "Conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T cells typically recognise small peptide antigens (8\u201313 amino acids) or larger antigenic fragments (>15 amino acids) presented on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II molecules.",
              "CD8+ T cells typically recognise MHC class I-restricted peptides, whilst CD4+ T cells detect MHC class II-restricted peptides, although it is evident that CD8+ T cells can break these \u201crules\u201d and bind peptide-MHC (pMHC) class II complexes [5,6].",
              "Classical MHC class I and II molecules are extremely polymorphic (>6000 allelic variants) and can present an immensely diverse array of antigens from pathogens.",
              "To respond to such antigenic variance, TCR sequences are also very diverse and TCR \u03b1- and \u03b2-chain rearrangements can theoretically generate <1021 distinct \u03b1\u03b2 TCRs [7], although realistically, in humans this is closer to 108 TCRs [8].",
              "To create such clonotypic diversity, somatic recombination of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments (D regions are only found in TCR \u03b2-chains), and junctional adaptations, occur to produce three complementarity determining region (CDR) loops, in each TCR chain that govern recognition of the pMHC complexes.",
              "CDR1 and CDR2 loops, germline encoded from 47 TCR \u03b1-chain V (TRAV) and 54 TCR \u03b2-chain V (TRBV) genes, typically bind the TCR to its target MHC, whilst hypervariable CDR3 loops, defined by unique nucleotide sequences, engage the exposed regions of the MHC bound peptide [7,9].",
              "Such high diversity in the nai\u0308ve T cell compartment means that the precursor frequency of antigen-specific T cells is very low [10].",
              "Accordingly, mechanisms of clonal expansion are employed to amplify the numbers of antigen-specific effector T cells.",
              "Upon antigen exposure, nai\u0308ve \u03b1\u03b2 T cells are primed by APCs to clonally expand into effector T cells in a process that is guided by immunological cues delivered by antigen [11], cytokines, and co-stimulatory interactions [12,13].",
              "Antigen clearance leads to effector T cell contraction and conversion into memory T cells [12] that populate the blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissues.",
              "Such immunological memory is maintained in the absence of antigen [14] by cytokines, such as IL-7 and IL-15 [15,16], rather than those integral to effector T cell development [17,18,19,20].",
              "Upon re-exposure to antigen, memory T cells can then be rapidly recalled, and evoke immune responses with a greater efficacy.",
              "Conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T cells were long considered to be only capable of recognising peptidic antigens complexed to classical MHC class I and II molecules.",
              "However, it was established that \u03b1\u03b2 T cells could engage antigens presented by non-classical MHC class Ib molecules.",
              "In humans, these include Human Leukocyte Antigen-E (HLA-E) molecules, which possess near allelic monomorphism, in contrast to MHC class I and II [21].",

              "Such \u201cunconventional\u201d T cell populations (Figure 1), including mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, appear to be \u201cinnate-like\u201d, as they are poised to respond faster than T cells restricted by classical MHC molecules and display invariance in their TCR repertoire, which limits their clonotypic diversity [24].",
              "Furthermore, these unconventional T cells also include T cells bearing \u03b3\u03b4 TCRs, which mediate antigen recognition in an MHC-unrestricted process that, to this date, is still poorly understood, since the identity of \u03b3\u03b4 TCR antigens is largely unclear [26].",
              "However, recent evidence in the past decade provided some clarity and suggests that it involves butyrophilin (BTN) or BTN-like (BTNL) molecules, which are related to the B7 co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD86 [26,27,28].",
              "Furthermore, antigen recognition by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells also appears to be quite promiscuous, since they can also engage MR1 [29], CD1 variants [30,31,32,33], MHC class I homologs (e.",

              "In the case of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, the process of identifying \u03b3\u03b4 T cell antigens is complicated and, as such, the nature of bonafide antigens that respond to \u03b3\u03b4 TCRs is largely unclear [26].",
              "New developments shed light on \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-driven antigen recognition and further work could theoretically uncover novel antigens from bacterial sources.",
              "Similarly, the repertoire of MAIT cell antigens is expanding and the flexibility observed in the MR1-binding cleft suggest that many more antigens could be presented to MAIT cells or T cells that can react to MR1-restricted antigens.",

              "By the end of this section, you will be able to: As explained in Overview of Specific Adaptive Immunity, the antibodies involved in humoral immunity often bind pathogens and toxins before they can attach to and invade host cells.",
              "Thus, humoral immunity is primarily concerned with fighting pathogens in extracellular spaces.",
              "However, pathogens that have already gained entry to host cells are largely protected from the humoral antibody-mediated defenses.",
              "Cellular immunity, on the other hand, targets and eliminates intracellular pathogens through the actions of T lymphocytes, or T cells (Figure 18.",
              "13).",
              "T cells also play a more central role in orchestrating the overall adaptive immune response (humoral as well as cellular) along with the cellular defenses of innate immunity.",
              "T cells, like all other white blood cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity, are formed from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (see Figure 17.",
              "12).",
              "However, unlike the white blood cells of innate immunity, eventual T cells differentiate first into lymphoid stem cells that then become small, immature lymphocytes, sometimes called lymphoblasts.",
              "The first steps of differentiation occur in the red marrow of bones (Figure 18.",
              "14), after which immature T lymphocytes enter the bloodstream and travel to the thymus for the final steps of maturation (Figure 18.",
              "15).",
              "Once in the thymus, the immature T lymphocytes are referred to as thymocytes.",
              "The maturation of thymocytes within the thymus can be divided into three critical steps of positive and negative selection, collectively referred to as thymic selection.",
              "The first step of thymic selection occurs in the cortex of the thymus and involves the development of a functional T-cell receptor (TCR) that is required for activation by APCs.",
              "Thymocytes with defective TCRs are removed by negative selection through the induction of apoptosis (programmed controlled cell death).",
              "The second step of thymic selection also occurs in the cortex and involves the positive selection of thymocytes that will interact appropriately with MHC molecules.",
              "Thymocytes that can interact appropriately with MHC molecules receive a positive stimulation that moves them further through the process of maturation, whereas thymocytes that do not interact appropriately are not stimulated and are eliminated by apoptosis.",
              "The third and final step of thymic selection occurs in both the cortex and medulla and involves negative selection to remove self-reacting thymocytes, those that react to self-antigens, by apoptosis.",
              "This final step is sometimes referred to as central tolerance because it prevents self-reacting T cells from reaching the bloodstream and potentially causing autoimmune disease, which occurs when the immune system attacks healthy a\u0302\u0080\u009cselfa\u0302\u0080\u009d cells.",
              "Despite central tolerance, some self-reactive T cells generally escape the thymus and enter the peripheral bloodstream.",
              "Therefore, a second line of defense called peripheral tolerance is needed to protect against autoimmune disease.",
              "Peripheral tolerance involves mechanisms of anergy and inhibition of self-reactive T cells by regulatory T cells.",
              "Anergy refers to a state of nonresponsiveness to antigen stimulation.",
              "In the case of self-reactive T cells that escape the thymus, lack of an essential co-stimulatory signal required for activation causes anergy and prevents autoimmune activation.",
              "Regulatory T cells participate in peripheral tolerance by inhibiting the activation and function of self-reactive T cells and by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines.",
              "It is not completely understood what events specifically direct maturation of thymocytes into regulatory T cells.",
              "Current theories suggest the critical events may occur during the third step of thymic selection, when most self-reactive T cells are eliminated.",
              "Regulatory T cells may receive a unique signal that is below the threshold required to target them for negative selection and apoptosis.",
              "Consequently, these cells continue to mature and then exit the thymus, armed to inhibit the activation of self-reactive T cells.",
              "It has been estimated that the three steps of thymic selection eliminate 98% of thymocytes.",
              "The remaining 2% that exit the thymus migrate through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to sites of secondary lymphoid organs/tissues, such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and tonsils (Figure 18.",
              "15), where they await activation through the presentation of specific antigens by APCs.",
              "Until they are activated, they are known as mature naA\u0303 \u0304ve T cells.",
              "T cells can be categorized into three distinct classes: helper T cells, regulatory T cells, and cytotoxic T cells.",
              "These classes are differentiated based on their expression of certain surface molecules, their mode of activation, and their functional roles in adaptive immunity (Table 18.",
              "1).",
              "All T cells produce cluster of differentiation (CD) molecules, cell surface glycoproteins that can be used to identify and distinguish between the various types of white blood cells.",
              "Although T cells can produce a variety of CD molecules, CD4 and CD8 are the two most important used for differentiation of the classes.",
              "Helper T cells and regulatory T cells are characterized by the expression of CD4 on their surface, whereas cytotoxic T cells are characterized by the expression of CD8.",
              "Classes of T cells can also be distinguished by the specific MHC molecules and APCs with which they interact for activation.",
              "Helper T cells and regulatory T cells can only be activated by APCs presenting antigens associated with MHC II.",
              "In contrast, cytotoxic T cells recognize antigens presented in association with MHC I, either by APCs or by nucleated cells infected with an intracellular pathogen.",
              "The different classes of T cells also play different functional roles in the immune system.",
              "Helper T cells serve as the central orchestrators that help activate and direct functions of humoral and cellular immunity.",
              "In addition, helper T cells enhance the pathogen-killing functions of macrophages and NK cells of innate immunity.",
              "In contrast, the primary role of regulatory T cells is to prevent undesirable and potentially damaging immune responses.",
              "Their role in peripheral tolerance, for example, protects against autoimmune disorders, as discussed earlier.",
              "Finally, cytotoxic T cells are the primary effector cells for cellular immunity.",
              "They recognize and target cells that have been infected by intracellular pathogens, destroying infected cells along with the pathogens inside.",
              "For both helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, activation is a complex process that requires the interactions of multiple molecules and exposure to cytokines.",
              "The T-cell receptor (TCR) is involved in the first step of pathogen epitope recognition during the activation process.",
              "The TCR comes from the same receptor family as the antibodies IgD and IgM, the antigen receptors on the B cell membrane surface, and thus shares common structural elements.",
              "Similar to antibodies, the TCR has a variable region and a constant region, and the variable region provides the antigen-binding site (Figure 18.",
              "16).",
              "However, the structure of TCR is smaller and less complex than the immunoglobulin molecules (Figure 18.",
              "5).",
              "Whereas immunoglobulins have four peptide chains and Y-shaped structures, the TCR consists of just two peptide chains (I\u0302\u00b1 and I\u03022 chains), both of which span the cytoplasmic membrane of the T cell.",
              "TCRs are epitope-specific, and it has been estimated that 25 million T cells with unique epitope-binding TCRs are required to protect an individual against a wide range of microbial pathogens.",
              "Because the human genome only contains about 25,000 genes, we know that each specific TCR cannot be encoded by its own set of genes.",
              "This raises the question of how such a vast population of T cells with millions of specific TCRs can be achieved.",
              "The answer is a process called genetic rearrangement, which occurs in the thymus during the first step of thymic selection.",
              "The genes that code for the variable regions of the TCR are divided into distinct gene segments called variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments.",
              "The genes segments associated with the I\u0302\u00b1 chain of the TCR consist 70 or more different VI\u0302\u00b1 segments and 61 different JI\u0302\u00b1 segments.",
              "The gene segments associated with the I\u03022 chain of the TCR consist of 52 different VI\u03022 segments, two different DI\u03022 segments, and 13 different JI\u03022 segments.",
              "During the development of the functional TCR in the thymus, genetic rearrangement in a T cell brings together one VI\u0302\u00b1 segment and one JI\u0302\u00b1 segment to code for the variable region of the I\u0302\u00b1 chain.",
              "Similarly, genetic rearrangement brings one of the VI\u03022 segments together with one of the DI\u03022 segments and one of thetJI\u03022 segments to code for the variable region of the I\u03022 chain.",
              "All the possible combinations of rearrangements between different segments of V, D, and J provide the genetic diversity required to produce millions of TCRs with unique epitope-specific variable regions.",
              "Helper T cells can only be activated by APCs presenting processed foreign epitopes in association with MHC II.",
              "The first step in the activation process is TCR recognition of the specific foreign epitope presented within the MHC II antigen-binding cleft.",
              "The second step involves the interaction of CD4 on the helper T cell with a region of the MHC II molecule separate from the antigen-binding cleft.",
              "This second interaction anchors the MHC II-TCR complex and ensures that the helper T cell is recognizing both the foreign (a\u0302\u0080\u009cnonselfa\u0302\u0080\u009d) epitope and a\u0302\u0080\u009cselfa\u0302\u0080\u009d antigen of the APC;",
              "both recognitions are required for activation of the cell.",
              "In the third step, the APC and T cell secrete cytokines that activate the helper T cell.",
              "The activated helper T cell then proliferates, dividing by mitosis to produce clonal naA\u0303 \u0304ve helper T cells that differentiate into subtypes with different functions (Figure 18.",
              "17).",
              "Activated helper T cells can differentiate into one of four distinct subtypes, summarized in Table 18.",
              "2.",
              "The differentiation process is directed by APC-secreted cytokines.",
              "Depending on which APC-secreted cytokines interact with an activated helper T cell, the cell may differentiate into a T helper 1 (TH1) cell, a T helper 2 (TH2) cell, or a memory helper T cell.",
              "The two types of helper T cells are relatively short-lived effector cells, meaning that they perform various functions of the immediate immune response.",
              "In contrast, memory helper T cells are relatively long lived;",
              "they are programmed to a\u0302\u0080\u009cremembera\u0302\u0080\u009d a specific antigen or epitope in order to mount a rapid, strong, secondary response to subsequent exposures.",
              "TH1 cells secrete their own cytokines that are involved in stimulating and orchestrating other cells involved in adaptive and innate immunity.",
              "For example, they stimulate cytotoxic T cells, enhancing their killing of infected cells and promoting differentiation into memory cytotoxic T cells.",
              "TH1 cells also stimulate macrophages and neutrophils to become more effective in their killing of intracellular bacteria.",
              "They can also stimulate NK cells to become more effective at killing target cells.",
              "TH2 cells play an important role in orchestrating the humoral immune response through their secretion of cytokines that activate B cells and direct B cell differentiation and antibody production.",
              "Various cytokines produced by TH2 cells orchestrate antibody class switching, which allows B cells to switch between the production of IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE as needed to carry out specific antibody functions and to provide pathogen-specific humoral immune responses.",
              "A third subtype of helper T cells called TH17 cells was discovered through observations that immunity to some infections is not associated with TH1 or TH2 cells.",
              "TH17 cells and the cytokines they produce appear to be specifically responsible for the bodya\u0302\u0080\u0099s defense against chronic mucocutaneous infections.",
              "Patients who lack sufficient TH17 cells in the mucosa (e.",
              "g., HIV patients) may be more susceptible to bacteremia and gastrointestinal infections.",
              "1 Cytotoxic T cells (also referred to as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, or CTLs) are activated by APCs in a three-step process similar to that of helper T cells.",
              "The key difference is that the activation of cytotoxic T cells involves recognition of an antigen presented with MHC I (as opposed to MHC II) and interaction of CD8 (as opposed to CD4) with the receptor complex.",
              "After the successful co-recognition of foreign epitope and self-antigen, the production of cytokines by the APC and the cytotoxic T cell activate clonal proliferation and differentiation.",
              "Activated cytotoxic T cells can differentiate into effector cytotoxic T cells that target pathogens for destruction or memory cells that are ready to respond to subsequent exposures.",
              "As noted, proliferation and differentiation of cytotoxic T cells is also stimulated by cytokines secreted from TH1 cells activated by the same foreign epitope.",
              "The co-stimulation that comes from these TH1 cells is provided by secreted cytokines.",
              "Although it is possible for activation of cytotoxic T cells to occur without stimulation from TH1 cells, the activation is not as effective or long-lasting.",
              "Once activated, cytotoxic T cells serve as the effector cells of cellular immunity, recognizing and kill cells infected with intracellular pathogens through a mechanism very similar to that of NK cells.",
              "However, whereas NK cells recognize nonspecific signals of cell stress or abnormality, cytotoxic T cells recognize infected cells through antigen presentation of pathogen-specific epitopes associated with MHC I.",
              "Once an infected cell is recognized, the TCR of the cytotoxic T cell binds to the epitope and releases perforin and granzymes that destroy the infected cell (Figure 18.",
              "18).",
              "Perforin is a protein that creates pores in the target cell, and granzymes are proteases that enter the pores and induce apoptosis.",
              "This mechanism of programmed cell death is a controlled and efficient means of destroying and removing infected cells without releasing the pathogens inside to infect neighboring cells, as might occur if the infected cells were simply lysed.",
              "In this video, you can see a cytotoxic T cell inducing apoptosis in a target cell.",
              "When T cell activation is controlled and regulated, the result is a protective response that is effective in combating infections.",
              "However, if T cell activation is unregulated and excessive, the result can be life-threatening.",
              "Certain bacterial and viral pathogens produce toxins known as superantigens (see Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens) that can trigger such an unregulated response.",
              "Known bacterial superantigens include toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST), staphylococcal enterotoxins, streptococcal pyrogenic toxins, streptococcal superantigen, and the streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin.",
              "Viruses known to produce superantigens include Epstein-Barr virus (human herpesvirus 4), cytomegalovirus (human herpesvirus 5), and others.",
              "The mechanism of T cell activation by superantigens involves their simultaneous binding to MHC II molecules of APCs and the variable region of the TCR I\u03022 chain.",
              "This binding occurs outside of the antigen-binding cleft of MHC II, so the superantigen will bridge together and activate MHC II and TCR without specific foreign epitope recognition (Figure 18.",
              "19).",
              "The result is an excessive, uncontrolled release of cytokines, often called a cytokine storm, which stimulates an excessive inflammatory response.",
              "This can lead to a dangerous decrease in blood pressure, shock, multi-organ failure, and potentially, death.",
              "Melissa, an otherwise healthy 22-year-old woman, is brought to the emergency room by her concerned boyfriend.",
              "She complains of a sudden onset of high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle aches.",
              "In her initial interview, she tells the attending physician that she is on hormonal birth control and also is two days into the menstruation portion of her cycle.",

              "The physician believes she is likely suffering from toxic shock syndrome (TSS).",
              "TSS is caused by the toxin TSST-1, a superantigen associated with Staphylococcus aureus, and improper tampon use is a common cause of infections leading to TSS.",
              "The superantigen inappropriately stimulates widespread T cell activation and excessive cytokine release, resulting in a massive and systemic inflammatory response that can be fatal.",
              "Vaginal or cervical swabs may be taken to confirm the presence of the microbe, but these tests are not critical to perform based on Melissaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s symptoms and medical history.",

              "3 Vaccines also helped change the course of the global COVID-19 pandemic.",
              "To understand how a vaccine immune response works, it helps to learn a little bit about immune-system cells called B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes, or B-cells and T-cells.",
              "B-cells produce antibodies that fight off infection.",
              "5 T-cells recognize and kill cells infected with a virus or other foreign cells, which can stop the infection from spreading.",
              "5 When a vaccine introduces an antigen into the body, those B-cells and T-cells get to work.",
              "Because of that immune response, following immunization some people may experience mild symptoms for a day or two, such as a fever, chills, or feeling tired.",
              "6 That\u2019s because the body is acting as if it\u2019s fighting a mild form of the germ\u2014not because it\u2019s infected.",

              "\"That's the basis of vaccination,\" says Gruber.",
              "\"Before the pathogen can replicate in the body, you've got antibodies generated to prevent that from happening.\"",
              "He adds that some memory cells can protect a person for life, while others are shorter-lived.",
              "Developing this tailored immune response is not immediate, says Gruber, who warns that it can take several weeks to build up enough antibodies to provide protection.",
              "Sometimes, he adds, people need to receive one or more additional doses of a vaccine to build a stronger and durable immune response.",
              "All vaccines teach the immune system to create antibodies to help it fight off a particular pathogen.",
              "1 However, the method they use to accomplish this goal depends on the underlying vaccine technology.",
              "It\u2019s a particularly exciting time for vaccine technology.",
              "We are seeing the opportunities that may come from matching different pathogens to specific vaccine technologies and shifting from traditional vaccines to mRNA vaccines in some cases.",
              "Traditional vaccines contain a version or part of the virus, bacteria, or other pathogen.",
              "1 It may be live but weakened, such as in the measles or chickenpox vaccines.",
              "Or, it might be dead or inert, such as in the pertussis (whooping cough) or tetanus vaccines.",
              "mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccines don't contain any part of the pathogen.",
              "Instead, mRNA is a molecule that contains instructions that direct cells to make a protein, or a piece of a protein.",
              "7, 8 mRNA vaccines only became available to the public after 2020, but the technology has been in development for decades, as scientists worked to ensure that safe and effective vaccination was possible with this approach.",
              "7 These advances are particularly beneficial from a global health standpoint, as mRNA vaccines can potentially be produced more rapidly than traditional vaccines, in response to a new threat of infectious disease.",

              "These challenges involve mainly the preparation of vaccines or novel and efficacious therapies to induce an early protective response in individuals3 During the last century, vaccines proved their efficacy to eradicate once widespread life-threatening and debilitating diseases such as smallpox and polio.",
              "The anti-CoV-2 vaccines were developed in a much shorter time than previous vaccines: past vaccines took approximately eight to ten years before being used in humans, whereas the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were ready in eight to ten months.",
              "The reason for this time difference is simple: first of all, pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca invested enormous resources to achieve their goal and thereby combat this pandemic and stop the millions of deaths it has caused.",
              "Indeed, research funds are usually enough for one candidate at a time to be developed and experimented on;",
              "however, during the current situation many approaches were tested simultaneously.",
              "As a result, many preclinical candidates for the anti-Covid-19 vaccine were developed, driven by the urgency of the pandemic and the support afforded by numerous funding sources (a situation that has not existed for other vaccines).",
              "4 The most common vaccine development approach was based on the spike protein of the virus as an antigen because it is the only surface protein on the microorganism and it is readily accessible by antibodies and immunological cells in the body.",
              "5 The spike protein seemed to be the best bet to get an effective vaccine ready fast.",
              "Another hurdle during vaccine development is the gap between research in animal models (such as mice) and its translation to human research in a clinical context.",
              "In vivo systems incorporating human cells and tissues in a physiological setting may help to close this gap.",
              "For example, humanized mice with engrafted human cells provide suitable tools to study human-specific pathogens.",

              "All in all, vaccine development research addresses both safety concerning the detection of side-effects and efficacy concerning the prevention of infection (AstraZeneca) or the prevention of disease or severe disease (Pfizer and Moderna).",
              "After conclusion of an experimental phase for vaccine preparation, relevant data are transmitted for approval to the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), the EMA (European Medicine Agency), the MHRA (Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory Agency), or in Italy to the AIFA (Italian Medicines Agency).",

              "10 This nanoparticle is injected intramuscularly into the human body and once attached to the host cells, inserts its mRNA into the cytoplasm (not in the nucleus) in such a way as to reach the ribosomes and use them for synthesizing the viral spike proteins.",
              "This process is called translation.",
              "9 Proteins then achieve the cellular membrane and evolve in two types: the MHC-2 (antigen presenting cells) and the MHC-1 related to another antigen which is present in all the nucleated cells of our body.",
