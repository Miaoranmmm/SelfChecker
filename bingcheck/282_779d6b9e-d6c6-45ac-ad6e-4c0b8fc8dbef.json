    "query": "What is the most innovative and sustainable approach to waste management currently being implemented in cities around the world, and how is it changing the way we think about and handle waste?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Waste management is a crucial issue for cities around the world, as it affects the environment, health, and economy. There are many innovative and sustainable approaches to waste management currently being implemented in cities around the world, and they are changing the way we think about and handle waste.\n\nSome examples of these approaches are:\n\n- **Underground waste management**: Helsinki, Finland has one of the world\u2019s most advanced underground waste management systems. It\u2019s called the Envac automated waste collection system and uses a series of pneumatic tubes hidden underground to transport recycling and waste to a central processing facility[^1^]. This reduces the need for garbage trucks, saves space, lowers emissions, and improves hygiene.\n\n- **Resident recycling network**: East Brunswick, New Jersey has created a resident recycling network that rewards people for recycling. Residents can use an app to scan their recycling bags and earn points that can be redeemed for discounts at local businesses[^1^]. This encourages people to recycle more and supports the local economy.\n\n- **Waste collection optimization**: Nitra, Slovakia has implemented a smart waste collection system that uses sensors and GPS to monitor the fill level and location of waste bins. This allows the city to optimize the collection routes and frequency, saving time, fuel, and money[^1^]. It also prevents overflowing bins and littering.\n\n- **Food waste composting**: San Francisco, California has a mandatory food waste composting program that collects food scraps from residents and businesses and turns them into organic fertilizer[^2^]. This reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and enriches the soil.\n\n- **Waste-to-energy sites**: Stockholm, Sweden has several waste-to-energy sites that burn non-recyclable waste and use the heat to generate electricity and district heating[^1^]. This reduces the dependence on fossil fuels, cuts down greenhouse gas emissions, and provides clean energy for homes and businesses.\n\nThese are some of the innovative and sustainable approaches to waste management currently being implemented in cities around the world. They are changing the way we think about and handle waste by making it more efficient, convenient, rewarding, and beneficial for the environment and society.",

              ".",
              "Users of the pneumatic waste collection system deposit their refuse into waste inlets, located around the chosen operating area.",
              "Waste collection points are placed outdoors or indoors and are accessible 24 hours a day.",
              "There is one waste inlet for each type of refuse (which will typically be divided into mixed waste, organic waste and paper waste).",
              "The refuse is temporarily stored by the waste inlets until the next emptying cycle.",
              "The refuse is then transported along the pipelines into containers at the waste station.",
              "When full, the containers are sent away for further processing using, for example, the city\u2019s existing underground railway network.",
              "The system is remotely monitored and controlled by operators at the waste station.",
              "In addition, some staff are needed to handle the system maintenance when required.",
              "No personnel are needed in the actual collection and transport of waste from the collection point to the waste station.",
              "As well as savings from reduced personnel costs, waste vehicle and fuel costs, there are various ways in which automated waste collection systems benefit not only the city image but the environment.",
              "One of the main environmental benefits is reduced CO2 emissions, which is a result of reduced waste vehicle traffic.",
              "Reduced waste vehicle traffic also means a more pleasant and safe environment for people living in the area where the system is in use.",
              "Typical application areas for pneumatic collection systems include large metropolitan and residential areas, high-rise buildings, public spaces, healthcare facilities, and hotel and office complexes.",
              "The system life cycle depends on several factors, such as the amount of collected waste, the climate of the operating environment and ground conditions.",
              "MariMatic, a company that provides waste, by-product and conveying solutions for a wide range of businesses globally, has developed the MetroTaifun system.",
              "This system is designed to last for at least 60 years (this applies to the pipeline and waste inlets).",
              "Waste inlets Waste inlets are the points where the users deposit their refuse bags.",
              "Each waste collection point incorporates as many waste inlets as there are types of refuse.",
              "There are various classifications for waste fractions.",
              "The most commonly used waste fractions in pneumatic waste collection systems are: mixed waste, organic waste and paper.",
              "Alternatively, the waste can be sorted at recycling centres.",
              "In this case, there is only one waste inlet per collection point.",
              "Residential waste inlets can be located indoors or outdoors.",
              "Outdoor waste points are preferred for sparsely populated areas because of their lower construction costs.",
              "It is often a good idea to equip residential outdoor waste inlets with locks to prevent unauthorized usage.",
              "An alternative method is to use RFID (Radio frequency identification) tags to identify the users.",
              "This allows for distribution of waste handling costs based on the actual usage typically one collection point serves 100150 residents.",
              "Depending on the amount of waste generated, the capacity of the waste inlet, and the size of the system, the emptying interval may vary between hours and days.",
              "All waste inlets incorporate sensors for the detection of the refuse level.",
              "This prevents overflow while eliminating the unnecessary emptying of waste inlets.",
              "Waste inlets generally lie 1.",
              "5 metres above ground level, and the rest of the waste inlet system lies beneath the surface.",
              "This underground part of the waste point substantially increases the storage volume of the inlet without taking up unnecessary space above ground.",
              "The underground space also serves as the technical room, housing various sensors and discharge valves.",
              "Pipeline The main network typically comprises 500 mm diameter steel pipes that are hermetically welded.",
              "Any major wearing of the pipe is the result of abrasion by the transported material, in particular, hard and edgy materials such as glass or metal refuse with the most significant pipe wear occurring at bends.",
              "MariMatic has developed and patented special, durable bends used in the MetroTaifun system to help overcome this issue.",
              "Waste station Typically, the waste station is located as far as 2 km from the waste collection points.",
              "The entire network can be monitored and controlled by the waste station operators.",
              "At least one container is required for each waste type.",
              "It is also possible to connect the waste station to the existing public transportation rail network.",
              "The number of waste containers is dependent on the number of waste fractions, waste volume and emptying frequency.",
              "For biowaste, a tank is used instead of a container.",
              "Full waste containers remain closed and the only time a container is in contact with air is when a full container is replaced by an empty one;",
              "this ensures that high levels of hygiene are maintained throughout the system.",
              "Benefits Pneumatic waste collection systems provide notable long-term cost savings.",
              "In order to operate, systems require personnel at the waste station and for maintenance but no manpower is needed in the actual collection and transportation of waste to the waste station.",
              "In addition, no waste trucks are needed to collect waste containers from residential areas, bringing savings in fuel costs and vehicle costs.",
              "While the initial investment cost for a pneumatic system is higher than that of traditional methods, the operating cost of the old system is usually considerably higher, and after the typical estimated payback period of 1012 years, the pneumatic system is considerably more economical than the conventional one.",
              "In addition to cost savings, pneumatic waste management systems have environmental benefits.",
              "As there are no waste collection trucks circling around the residential areas, there are less fuel emissions, less traffic and fewer accidents.",
              "It has also been discovered that the waste collection points of the pneumatic system encourage the users to recycle more efficiently.",
              "The inlets are never full and the fact that there are no unsightly piles of waste or unpleasant odours is beneficial for both the cleanliness and image of the area.",
              "Another benefit is that a pipeline-based waste collection system is very flexible and the system does not get congested even at peak times.",
              "Single-line and ring-line systems Single-line systems are the conventional type of automated waste collection system.",
              "In a single-line system, the pipeline network forms a tree-like layout, where the waste station is located at the root of the tree and the waste inlets are located along the branches.",
              "Ring-line systems are a novel technology developed by MariMatic.",
              "In MetroTaifun ring-line systems, the main pipeline both starts and ends at the waste station.",
              "The ring-line uses vacuum and pressure to convey refuse along the pipeline.",
              "Ring-line systems use both vacuum and pressure to transport waste.",
              "This brings many benefits, such as the automatic removal of blockages.",
              "Click here to enlarge image The ring-line system enables effective and safe municipal waste collection and offers a cleaner, quieter and less smelly solution to municipal waste collection, when compared with the conventional single-line systems. The use of both suction and overpressure in a ring-line system allows for automatic blockage removal.",
              "The system also has a considerably lower energy consumption.",
              "In the automatic blockage removal system, the blockage is moved backward and forward by the alternating vacuum and air pressure until it is successfully removed.",
              "This means that less maintenance is needed to keep the system operative.",
              "The MetroTaifun automatic airflushing and drying system operates by forcing double air speed through the pipes.",
              "This is done in the periods between waste fraction collections so that the pipes are clean and dry for each waste stream.",
              "This results in vastly improved material recyclability, as there is no cross contamination between different types of waste.",
              "This capability has arisen from from the extensive experience and advanced solutions that MariMatic has in conveying food destined for human consumption.",
              "The ring-line systems have lower energy consumption than conventional pneumatic systems. The reason for this is that the ring-line system mainly utilizes the existing air in the network, and that the combination of underpressure and overpressure conveys material with less energy than just the underpressure which is used by single-line solutions.",
              "Thanks to the durable special bends used in the MetroTaifun solution, the system also allows for the conveying of glass and metal waste which cannot be done by conventional systems. Some application areas Automated waste conveying systems are typically used in large, modern metropolitan areas as well as residential areas, and in healthcare facilities, town shopping centres or airports.",
              "Residential solutions are used in highly populated areas with high-rise buildings.",
              "The buildings are linked to the MetroTaifun main pipeline and replaceable containers are used.",
              "An economically feasible size for this system is 500+ households.",
              "The full-fledged MetroTaifun metropolitan waste system is suitable for large residential areas with over 20,000 households.",
              "The replaceable containers can be collected by metro/underground trains from the waste station.",
              "Smaller-scale pneumatic waste systems are ideal for shopping centres or airports where the installation of a comprehensive system is not as economically feasible.",
              "A waste collection system in a public space improves the image of its surroundings by eliminating overfilled waste bins and improving hygiene.",
              "Optional waste-bin fire detectors also improve safety.",
              "Hospital and nursing home waste systems offer a solution for healthcare facilities where hygiene is an issue and it is necessary for people to avoid contact with the discarded material.",

              "San Francisco Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance",
              "The San Francisco Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance (No.",
              "100-09) is a local municipal ordinance requiring all persons located in San Francisco to separate their recyclables, compostables and landfilled trash and to participate in recycling and composting programs.[1] Passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 2009, it became the first local municipal ordinance in the United States to universally require source separation of all organic material, including food residuals.",
              "[2][3] The roots of San Francisco's recycling and composting program can be traced back to the formation of the Scavengers Protective Union in 1879, when loose federations of scavengers began.",
              "Most were Italian immigrants from one region of Italy and they hauled municipal waste in horse-drawn wagons and hand-separated valuable discards for resale.",
              "[4][5] The scavengers made a living from materials similar to those salvaged in recycling programs today such as wood, metals, glass, rags, yard trimmings and food residuals.",
              "[4] At that time, some of the materials were used as fuel, others were recycled and the yard debris and food residuals were sold to hog farmers in the outlying neighborhoods of the city for use as animal feed.",
              "In 1921, the city began regulating waste collection and around the same time, scavengers, who were fiercely competing for the same materials, began forming associations.",
              "Rates were set under the 1932 ordinance, and required voter approval to change.",
              "This was modified by an amendment to the 1932 ordinance, approved by the voters in 1954 and effective in 1955, which established a rate adjustment system managed by city staff.",
              "Cooperation amongst the former rivals allowed them to pool their resources.",
              "[6] The two loose associations became known as Scavenger's Protective Association and Sunset Scavenger Company.",
              "These two entities eventually merged, and as a result all of the permits issued by the city came to be held by one entity.",
              "Exclusive refuse collection licenses for the city were issued in 1932\u2014licenses still held today under the parent company, Recology.",
              "[6][7] This steadfast relationship between the city and Recology San Francisco has resulted in a reliable public-private partnership, allowing San Francisco to design experimental pilot programs such as city-wide curbside organics collection.",
              "[7] Although San Francisco has the highest diversion rate amongst all large cities in the United States today,[7] in the late 1950s, the advent of packer trucks forced the city's recycling rate to an all-time low.",
              "Because separation of compacted materials was unfeasible, by 1967 Sunset Scavenger company and Golden Gate Disposal had scaled back their recycling operations to a mere two programs, metals and paper recycling.",
              "[5] However, the 1970s brought a renewed interest in resource conservation.",
              "The federal Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act were signed into legislation and the first Earth Day celebration was held on April 22, 1970.",
              "In the spirit of these times, San Francisco residents proactively organized to create new volunteer-run community recycling centers.",
              "By 1980, San Francisco had a total of ten community recycling centers, offering residents the opportunity to recycle their newspaper, glass and cans.",
              "[5] In 1980, under the city's chief administrative officer, the San Francisco Recycling Program (SFRP) was developed as a division of the Solid Waste Management Program.",
              "The goal of the SFRP was to facilitate and develop recycling programs throughout the city.",
              "After receiving a grant from the state in 1981, the city established three buy-back centers and launched its first curbside recycling program.",
              "With the passage of California's Bottle Bill (AB2020) in 1986, all community recycling centers in San Francisco began offering monetary compensation for materials with a California Redemption Value.",
              "While this initial curbside recycling collection was unsuccessful due to scavengers, San Francisco continued to promote recycling efforts.",
              "The city formed an advisory council to help design another residential curbside pilot and collaboratively started two new programs targeting bar and restaurant glass collection and city government office paper recycling.",
              "[5] In 1988, San Francisco's Solid Waste Management Program set diversion goals, calling for a 32 percent reduction in the city's waste stream by 1992 and 43 percent by 2002.",
              "However, in 1989, the California legislature preempted San Francisco's goals by passing the Integrated Waste Management Act (AB 939), which set waste reduction goals of 25 percent by 1995 and 50 percent by 2000.",
              "The city's diversion goals were amended shortly after to reflect the new state requirements.",
              "[5] By 1989, the city had begun a series of new curbside pilot programs, collecting mixed paper and containers (glass, aluminum and plastic).",
              "[8] This program was fully operational by 1991, and contributed to San Francisco's achievement of 27 percent diversion in 1990.",
              "[5] By 1997, the program had led to an additional 15,500 tons of recyclables diverted, yet a 1996 waste characterization study illustrated additional opportunities for reaching AB939 goals.",
              "According to the study, 60,000 tons of unrecovered recyclables remained in the waste stream, 26 percent of which were food residuals.",
              "Because San Francisco is a dense city, yard waste was found to make up only 5 percent of the residential waste stream.",
              "These findings, in conjunction with AB939 diversion requirements, prompted San Francisco to develop new curbside recycling pilots that included the collection of food residuals.",
              "[8] Pilot programs are commonly used as a mechanism for determining prospective infrastructure investments and educational tactics including, \"collection containers, vehicles, outreach needs, processing needs and the impact of neighborhoods with different demographics.\"",
              "[9] In 1999, San Francisco and Recology rolled out their most recent pilot, a dedicated color-coded cart system called the Fantastic Three.",
              "[10] The color-coded cart system was designed to make recycling and composting easy for residents, with each color signifying the type of materials accepted (blue=recycling, green=organics, black=landfill).",
              "The Fantastic Three also integrated financial incentives for participation.",
              "The program's pay as you throw framework allowed residents and businesses to reap savings as their trash volumes decreased.",
              "[9] Within seven months, the Fantastic Three helped to increase diversion by more than 90 percent amongst participating businesses and residents and generated a 73 percent satisfaction rating.",
              "[9][10] With this success rate, Recology, in collaboration with the city, invested in a plan to further expand the program.",
              "[9] Having invested in the infrastructure to increase the diversion of organics and recyclables from landfills, San Francisco realized a 50 percent diversion rate shortly after the Fantastic Three program was officially introduced.",
              "However, the city decided to pursue higher diversion rates than those required by the state for several reasons.",
              "First, the 1997 Sustainability Plan adopted by the Board of Supervisors included a long-term goal \"to maximize sustainable uses of natural resources and to eliminate solid waste generation in the City and County of San Francisco.\"",
              "[11] Additionally, Alameda County adopted Measure D which, \"set a goal of achieving a 75 percent waste diversion rate by 2010 and as a condition of the Waste Disposal Agreement for disposing San Francisco waste in the Altamont Landfill in Alameda County, the City was required to recycle or divert waste at the same or greater level than that of East Bay (Alameda County) jurisdictions using the Altamont landfill.\"",
              "[11] As a result, the Board of Supervisors passed the Zero Waste Goal (Resolution No.",
              "007-02-COE) in 2002, requiring San Francisco to divert 75 percent of its waste by 2010 and to achieve zero waste by 2020.",
              "[11] While the city's investment in the Fantastic Three program demonstrated its ability to achieve high diversion rates and encouraged the creation of new goals, the Zero Waste resolution built the framework from which new waste reduction legislation could be drafted.",
              "Shortly after the Zero Waste Goal passed, the city began to adopt a series of waste reduction policies as a means to meet its goal of zero waste.",
              "A timeline of select waste-reduction legislation is listed below: There were a number of other San Francisco waste reduction policies passed during this time;",
              "most of them focus on city government operations.",
              "For example, the Mayor's Executive Order on Bottled Water bans the purchase of bottled water with city funds, while the Precautionary Purchasing Ordinance \"requires city departments to purchase products that maximize post-consumer recycled content and recyclable or compostable materials, and that favor durability, repairability, and reuse.\"",
              "[12] All of the aforementioned policies have had large impacts on diversion rates and by the end of 2007, the city had reached 72 percent.",
              "However, it was clear that increased participation in the residential curbside collection program was desirable if San Francisco were to reach zero waste by 2020.",
              "According to Jack Macy, Commercial Zero Waste Coordinator for the City of San Francisco, if everyone in San Francisco participated in the program by separating all the materials accepted, a 90 percent diversion rate would be achievable.",
              "[13] San Francisco realized that voluntary participation would not suffice, and in 2009, the Board of Supervisors passed the Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance, requiring all persons in San Francisco to separate their recyclables, compostables and landfilled trash and to participate in recycling and composting programs. The mandatory ordinance represents further investment in recycling infrastructure and in San Francisco's goal of zero waste.",
              "It has provided the leverage of law and participation rates have increased as a result.",
              "Since the mandatory ordinance went into effect, \"composting has increased by 45 percent, and the City is now sending nearly 600 tons of food scraps, soiled paper, and yard trimmings to Recology's compost facilities daily, up from 400 tons a year ago.\"",
              "[14] In August 2010, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom announced the city's diversion rate had reached 77 percent.",
              "[14] Since construction and demolition sites already possessed a high diversion rate prior to the mandatory ordinance, the initial impact of the ordinance was mostly on homes and businesses.",
              "Landlords expressed early concern over the challenge of finding space for bins, as well as over possible odors.",
              "Despite these concerns, the ordinance remained popular overall, polling 85% prior to passing.",
              "[16] Before passing, the cap on fines was also lowered from $1,000 to $100 to address opposition to the possible size of fines.",
              "[17] Of the Board of Supervisors, only Carmen Chu and Sean Elsbernd opposed Gavin Newsom's proposal.",
              "Elsbernd was concerned about the preexisting problem of scavengers in trash cans and that the ordinance would worsen this problem.",
              "He was also concerned about fines being pursued heavily despite the assurance they would be lenient.",
              "After clauses making apartment owners responsible for their tenants' sorting were eliminated, the San Francisco Apartment Association took a neutral stance on the ordinance.",
              "[18] To aid San Francisco residents in a smooth transition to the new ordinance, the city and San Francisco's municipal solid waste collector, Recology, offered free services including consultations and multilingual training sessions to educate residents.",
              "They also offered materials to aid the physical collection process: pails to collect compost, signs, and labels to instruct others on how to separate their recyclables, trash, and food scraps.",
              "[19] There are also financial incentives for reducing waste thrown in the trash bin.",
              "Both composting and recycling are less costly per month than the trash bill.",
              "[20] The city newsletter highlighted this fact and suggested diverting more waste to recycling and composting bins, lowering trash bills by requesting less frequent trash collection, and using smaller trash bins to lessen the financial burden on residents.",
              "[21] In the event of \"egregious\" cases of noncompliance, or failure to separate recyclables, compostables, and trash, fines up to $100 for single-family homes and up to $1000 for large businesses are issued.",
              "[22] San Francisco's mandatory ordinance supports California's greenhouse gas reduction goals as expressed in the scoping plan for the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32).",
              "Commercial recycling, composting, diverting waste from landfill sites (with an eventual zero waste goal), and addressing methane release at these sites are all stated goals of AB 32.",
              "Recycling makes use of the embodied energy in recovered materials.",
              "Using recycled material in the manufacture of products thus saves energy that would be consumed in the materials-extraction, pre-manufacture, and manufacture lifecycle stages of products.",
              "Diversion of organic matter for other uses similarly reduces greenhouse gas emissions (see Food Waste Treatment section).",
              "The AB 32 scoping plan also lists organics diverted from the waste stream as a potential source of biofuel production, which could further reduce greenhouse gas emissions if substituted for fossil fuels.",
              "AB 32 further directs that the California Air Resources Board (ARB) will work with the California Department of Resource Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) to create a mandatory commercial recycling program, and partnerships between California and local government recycling and composting programs such as San Francisco's mandatory ordinance.",
              "Statewide, such diversions from the waste stream are expected to conservatively produce the following greenhouse gas savings in millions of metric tons (MMT) of carbon dioxide equivalents: San Francisco's Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance also contributes to the San Francisco Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
              "Most greenhouse gases attributed to waste are the result of energy consumed in lifecycle stages upstream from the landfill (materials extraction, pre-manufacture, manufacture, and transport), not from the landfill itself.",
              "In 2001, San Francisco's actions to divert materials from Altamont landfill into recycled products reduced greenhouse gas emissions from these upstream lifecycle stages by the equivalent of 768,000 tons of carbon dioxide, vs. manufacturing these same products from virgin materials.",
              "This shift away from virgin materials represents a 75\u201380% savings in net greenhouse gas emissions for paper, glass, copper, and steel, and a 97.",
              "5% savings for aluminum.",
              "The recycling of paper has an additional carbon sequestration effect through forest conservation.",
              "Diversion of organic material into composting also reduces greenhouse emissions, since applying compost as a soil amendment helps to sequester carbon.",
              "In this vein, San Francisco's mandatory recycling and composting ordinance supports the city's 2002 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Resolution to reduce emissions to 20% less than 1990 levels by no later than 2012.",
              "San Francisco's 2004 Climate Action Plan recommended mandatory residential and commercial recycling and composting policies to increase diversion of material from landfills.",
              "The Climate Action Plan projected estimated reductions in tons of emitted carbon dioxide equivalents from specific economic sectors and actions: As stated in the history section, landfill limitations placed on San Francisco by Alameda County influenced San Francisco's decision to move toward greater diversion.",
              "Alameda County has continued to move towards greater diversion, and on January 1, 2010, Alameda County implemented a new landfill ban targeted at professional landscapers.",
              "This ban prohibits garbage contaminants (such as bottles or plastic film) in plant debris brought to plant debris disposal facilities, since these contaminants may require the organic waste facility to reject the entire contaminated load.",
              "Similarly, the ban forbids plant debris to be disposed of in garbage.",
              "The ban is backed by fines of up to $500 per offense for repeat offenders.",
              "[25] One of San Francisco's waste reduction measures, the city's Plastic Bag Reduction Ordinance (described in the history section), has achieved national and international attention.",
              "Within a year of its implementation, Boston, Portland, and Phoenix were investigating such plastic bag bans, and city supervisor Ross Mirkarimi had fielded inquiries from Paris and London.",
              "However, the Marin County suburb of Fairfax retreated from a similar ban when the plastic bag industry threatened legal action.",
              "Mayor Mary Ann Maggiore stated that the city was too small to fight the suit.",
              "[26] On April 26, 2011, the San Francisco Bay Area county of Santa Clara also passed a plastic bag ban in unincorporated areas of the county, but this ban excludes restaurants and non-profit organizations.",
