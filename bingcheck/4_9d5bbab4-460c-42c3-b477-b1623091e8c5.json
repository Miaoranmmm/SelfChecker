              "As a result, clinicians rarely use them.",
              "[3] Avobenzones are considered broad-spectrum and have high efficacy against UVA I (>380 nm);",
              "however, they are very photo-unstable and lose from 50% to 90% of their particles after 1 hour of UV exposure.",

              "In animal studies, it prevented UVA-induced photoaging.",
              "[3] Broad-spectrum sunscreens include methylene-bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (MBBT) and bis- ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (BEMT).",
              "MBBT is advantageous as it is a large molecule that decreases the likelihood of systemic absorption or endocrine effects.",

              "Decreasing the size of the particles to a micronized form (10 to 50 nm) is more cosmetically appealing but leads to the protection of shorter wavelengths and increases the risk of systemic absorption.",
              "[8] A thick coating increases the degree of reflection but is cosmetically less appealing.",
              "Iron oxide can be an additive to increase absorption and improve UVA protection.",
              "Physical sunscreens consist of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.",

              "however, it is less efficient against UVB radiation.",
              "[3][5] Microfine titanium dioxide protects against UVA 2 (315 to 340 nm) and UVB but does not protect against UVA 1, as does zinc oxide.",
              "[5] It has a smaller particle size and higher refractive index than zinc oxide, causing it to appear white and making it cosmetically less appealing.",
              "Photochemical reactions cause zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to become less effective as a sunscreen.",
              "For this reason, silica and dimethicone coat these particles, stabilizing these inorganic filters.",
              "[3] As mentioned above, secondary photoprotection includes antioxidants, osmolytes, and DNA-repair enzymes, which help to limit skin damage by disturbing the photochemical cascade that occurs with UV sunlight.",
              "The mechanism of action of antioxidants is to reduce the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from UVA radiation.",
              "Naturally, these ROS become neutralized by antioxidants found naturally within the body, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase.",
              "These enzymes can become saturated within an overproduction of reactive oxygen species, resulting in a deficiency of antioxidants and damage to proteins and DNA.",
              "Topical antioxidants function from within the cell to decrease the shortage of antioxidants and can remain active for several days after application.",
              "[10][5] Many sunscreens include antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, silymarin, and green tea polyphenols.",
              "Vitamin C acts to protect against UV- damage, which results in sunburn and erythema.",
              "[5][11] Vitamin E has many protective actions, such as decreasing immunosuppression, erythema, photoaging, and photocarcinogenesis.",
              "[5][12][13][14] Silymarin comes from milk thistle plants, functioning to prevent lipid and lipoprotein oxidation and acting as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species.",

              "In mice, it has been shown to reduce the amount of UVB-induced tumors.",
              "[15] Green tea polyphenols contain antioxidants that are more potent than vitamin C and E.",
              "They are anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic.",
              "They function to scavenge singlet oxygen, superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, peroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide.",
              "[16] Osmolytes are small molecules that stabilize the cell in stressful conditions by regulating hydration.",
              "Taurine and ectoine are osmolytes that protect against many UV effects and are components in many sunscreens.",
              "[5][17][18] Sunscreen should be applied topically.",
              "Correct administration is key to the effectiveness of use.",
              "A liberal uniform film of sunscreen should be applied, and the application should be 15 minutes before sun exposure.",

              "Sunscreen should be reapplied every 2 hours and after sweating or swimming.",

              "In animal studies, research showed a UPF over 30 to protect against erythema and premalignant lesions.",
              "Whether the fabric is wet or dry may increase or decrease UPF based on the type of fabric.",
              "Light-colored fabrics have decreased UPF compared to dark-colored fabrics.",
              "[3] Overall, clothing provides a balanced amount of protection against both UVA and UVB, and a loose-fitting colored fabric is the best form of photoprotection.",
              "[5] Hats are a variable form of photoprotection dependent on the brim width, material, and weaving.",
              "A hat with a brim width of more than 7.",

              "[2] The most common UV filters that cause adverse effects are benzophenones and dibenzoylmethanes, with the most common photoallergen being benzophenone-3 (BP-3), as it is a derivative of PABA.",
              "For this reason, benzophenone 3 is not used frequently in the United States.",
              "[2] Some studies have associated sunscreen use with melanoma due to the users' false sense of security, which may increase the duration in the sun, resulting in UVA formation and malignant changes.",
              "[8] Phototoxic and allergic contact dermatitis are usually the results of UVA (320 to 400 nm) and visible light ranges (400 to 800 nm).",
