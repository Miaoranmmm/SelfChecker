    "query": "What is the history behind the development of the modern Olympics, and how has it evolved over time to become the global event we know today?",
    "response": "The modern Olympics were inspired by the ancient Olympic Games that were held in Greece from the 8th century BCE to the 4th century CE. The founder of the modern Olympics was Pierre de Coubertin, a French educator and sports enthusiast who wanted to promote international peace and cooperation through athletic competition. He organized the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, with 14 nations and 280 athletes participating in 43 events[^1^]. Since then, the Olympics have evolved over time to become a global event that showcases a variety of sports and cultures. Some of the changes that have occurred include:\n\n- The introduction of women's events in 1900[^1^] [^2^], winter sports in 1924[^1^], and Paralympic Games in 1960[^1^].\n- The expansion of the number of participating countries, athletes, and events. The most recent Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2020 (postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) had 206 nations and over 11,000 athletes competing in 339 events[^1^].\n- The development of the Olympic symbols, such as the five interlocking rings that represent the continents, the Olympic flame that symbolizes the continuity of the ancient and modern Games, and the Olympic motto \"Citius, Altius, Fortius\" (Faster, Higher, Stronger)[^1^].\n- The emergence of political and social issues that have affected the Games, such as boycotts, protests, doping scandals, terrorism, and human rights violations[^1^] [^2^].\n- The advancement of technology and media that have improved the performance, safety, and accessibility of the Games for athletes and spectators[^1^] [^2^].\n\nThe modern Olympics are still guided by the principles of Olympism, which aim to foster a spirit of friendship, solidarity, and fair play among people of different backgrounds and abilities[^1^]. The Olympics are also a platform for promoting cultural diversity, artistic expression, environmental sustainability, and educational values[^1^]. The Olympics are expected to continue to evolve and adapt to the changing needs and challenges of the world.",

              "Lausanne 1994, 79.",
              "The audience was surprised about the presentation of this ambitious idea and reacted moderately.",
              "Many of them believed that Coubertin had developed this idea more or less spontaneously.",
              "But this was wrongly perceived as Coubertin had mentioned this idea to Andrew D.",
              "White, founding president of Cornell University in the USA, in a letter dated 23rd July 1892.",
              "Even earlier than this, namely in 1888/89, Coubertin mentioned already his idea to plan an organisation of sport for all nations to William Milligan Sloane, university professor at Princeton University in the USA, and to the French historian and philosopher Hippolyte Adolphe Taine.",
              "Despite the passive reaction of his audience in November 1892 Coubertin did not give up his Olympic idea.",
              "With the support of Sloane and Charles Herbert, the then secretary general of the Amateur Athletic Association in England, Coubertin organized the Congre\u0300s International de Paris Pour Le Re\u0301tablissement des Jeux Olympiques.",

              "In his idea to revive the modern Olympic Games Coubertin was stimulated by his cultural appreciation of the ancient Olympic Games, the German excavations in Olympia from 1875 to 1881 and by several initiatives which had taken place in, amongst others, Greece (Olympic Games of Evangelis Zappas) and England (Wenlock Olympian Games, organized by William Penny Brookes) on a regional and national level.",

              "But Coubertin did not want to merely copy the ancient Olympic Games, he wanted to coin a very modern profile of the Olympic Games.",
              "He aimed at establishing an international athletic festival of which the driving force should be an educational objective.",
              "The Olympic Games should promote the value of sport as an educational tool.",
              "Indeed, the idea was that sport can contribute to the education of modern citizens.",
              "Participation in sport competitions should support the development of highly social and moral character traits which could be transferred beyond the sporting context to daily private and professional life.",
              "Coubertin`s appreciation of this educational process was coined by this insight and analysis of the Anglo-American sport world at the university level and beyond.",

              "Coubertin published a variety of books, articles and newspaper reports about these study trips.",
              "Without doubt, the appreciation of sport as an educational tool for character development was one of the central pillars of Coubertin`s thinking.",
              "Of equal importance was his belief in intercultural learning.",
              "He became acquainted with it by his close contacts to leading representatives of the growing peace movement in the late 1880s and beginning of the 1890s.",
              "According to Coubertin the Olympic Games should be a platform to bring together athletes and spectators from different nations.",
              "The Olympic Games were to provide a useful pathway for the creation and expansion of friendly relationships through mutual understanding.",
              "He justified his intention to support transnational understanding via the re-establishment of the Olympic Games because sport enjoyed a growing interest world-wide.",
              "The Olympic Games, with their mandatory rules and regulations for athletes, were to facilitate international sport activities;",

              "Against this background the prevailing long-term assumption can be resolved that Coubertin was driven by national ambitions to revive the Olympic Games.",
              "He cannot be portrayed as a narrow-minded national reformer who suffered from the French defeat in the war against Germany in 1871 and blamed the poor physical condition of the French youth for this national crisis.",

              "He was a founding member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and served as its president from 1896 to 1925.",
              "As a republican born to the French aristocracy, a patriot with an internationalist\u2019s outlook, and a child of the French defeats of 1871 yet a committed progressive and optimist, Coubertin struggled in his 20s to find a satisfying vocation.",
              "Inspired by study tours of British public schools and American colleges, he resolved \u201cto attach his name to a great educational reform,\u201d embarking upon lifelong campaigns for secondary-school improvement, workers universities, and the popular study of world political history.",
              "These efforts attained little success and are largely forgotten today.",
              "In 1890 Coubertin met English educator William Penny Brookes, who had organized British Olympic Games as early as 1866.",

              "These local or national expressions often asserted the superiority of indigenous physical culture over that of rival peoples.",
              "By contrast, Brookes, Coubertin, and their colleagues were committed from the beginning to a quadrennial festival of strictly international character and featuring many kinds of modern athletic contests.",

              "At the 1889 Universal Exhibition in Paris, Coubertin launched a series of congresses on physical education and international sport that coincided with inspiring new archaeological finds from Olympia.",
              "His public call for an Olympic revival at one of these congresses in 1892 fell on deaf ears, but he persevered, and in 1894 a second Sorbonne congress resolved to hold an international Olympic Games in Athens.",

              "His campaign to promote athletic activities began as a lonely crusade, but it slowly gained support and he was able to organize the first modern Olympics in Athens in 1896.",
              "He was a founding member of the International Olympic Committee and served as its president from 1896 to 1925.",
              "Born on January 1, 1863, in Paris, Pierre Fredy, Baron de Coubertin was 8 years old when he witnessed the defeat of his homeland in the Franco-Prussian War.",
              "He came to believe that his nation\u2019s lack of physical education for the masses contributed to the defeat at the hands of Prussians led by Otto von Bismarck.",
              "In his youth, Coubertin was also fond of reading British novels for boys that stressed the importance of physical strength.",
              "The idea formed in Coubertin\u2019s mind early on that the French educational system was too intellectual.",
              "What was desperately needed in France, Coubertin believed, was a strong component of physical education.",
              "Athletics were becoming increasingly popular through the 1800s, after a long prior period when Coubertin's society was essentially indifferent to sports\u2014or even considered sports to be a frivolous diversion.",
              "Scientists in the 19th century began touting athletics as a way of improving health.",
              "Organized athletic endeavors, such as baseball leagues in the United States, were celebrated.",
              "In France, the upper classes indulged in sports, and young Pierre de Coubertin participated in rowing, boxing, \u200band fencing.",
              "Coubertin became fixated on physical education in the 1880s as he became convinced that athletic prowess could save his nation from military humiliation.",
              "In the 1880s and early 1890s, Coubertin made several trips to America and a dozen trips to England to study the administration of athletics.",
              "The French government was impressed with his work and commissioned him to hold \"athletic congresses,\" which featured events such as horseback riding, fencing, and track and field.",
              "A small item in the New York Times in December 1889 mentioned Coubertin visiting the campus of Yale University: The ambitious plans of Coubertin to revitalize the educational system of France never really materialized, but his travels began to inspire him with a far more ambitious plan.",
              "He began thinking about having countries compete in athletic events based on the Olympic festivals of ancient Greece.",
              "In 1892, at a jubilee of the French Union of Athletic Sports Societies, Coubertin introduced the idea of a modern Olympics.",
              "His idea was fairly vague, and it seems that even Coubertin himself did not have a clear idea of the form such games would take.",
              "Two years later, Coubertin organized a meeting that brought together 79 delegates from 12 countries to discuss how to revive the Olympic Games.",
              "The meeting established the first International Olympic Committee.",
              "The committee decided on the basic framework of having the Games every four years, with the first one to take place in Greece.",
              "The decision to hold the first modern Olympics in Athens, at the site of the ancient Games, was symbolic.",
              "It also proved to be problematic, as Greece was embroiled in political turmoil.",
              "However, Coubertin visited Greece and became convinced the Greek people would be happy to host the Games.",
              "Funds were raised to mount the Games, and the first modern Olympics began in Athens on April 5, 1896.",
              "The festival continued for 10 days and included events such as foot races, lawn tennis, swimming, diving, fencing, bicycle races, rowing, and a yacht race.",
              "A dispatch in The New York Times on April 16, 1896, described the closing ceremonies the previous day under the headline, \"Americans Won Most Crowns.\"",
              "Subsequent Games held in Paris and St.",
              "Louis were overshadowed by World's Fairs, but the Stockholm Games in 1912 returned to the ideals expressed by Coubertin.",
              "During World War I, Coubertin's family suffered hardships and fled to Switzerland.",
              "He was involved in organizing the 1924 Olympics but retired after that.",
              "The final years of his life were greatly troubled, and he faced severe financial hardships.",
              "He died in Geneva on September 2, 1937.",

              "His influence on the institution he founded endures.",
              "The idea of the Olympics as an event filled not merely with athletics but great pageantry came from Pierre de Coubertin.",
              "So while the Games are, of course, held on a scale far more grand than anything he could have imagined, the opening ceremonies, parades, and fireworks are very much \u200ba part of his legacy.",

              "[5] His father Charles was a staunch royalist and accomplished artist whose paintings were displayed and given prizes at the Parisian salon, at least in those years when he was not absent in protest of the rise to power of Louis Napoleon.",
              "His paintings often centered on themes related to the Roman Catholic Church, classicism, and nobility, which reflected those things he thought most important.",
              "[6] In a later semi-fictional autobiographical piece called Le Roman d'un rallie\u0301, Coubertin describes his relationship with both his mother and his father as having been somewhat strained during his childhood and adolescence.",
              "His memoirs elaborated further, describing as a pivotal moment his disappointment upon meeting Henri, Count of Chambord, whom the elder Coubertin believed to be the rightful king.",
              "[7] Coubertin grew up in a time of profound change in France: defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the Paris Commune, and the establishment of the Third Republic[8] but while these events were the setting of his childhood, his school experiences were just as formative.",
              "In October 1874, his parents enrolled him in a new Jesuit school called Externat de la rue de Vienne, which was still under construction for his first five years there.",
              "While many of the school's attendees were day students, Coubertin boarded at the school under the supervision of a Jesuit priest, which his parents hoped would instill him with a strong moral and religious education.",
              "[9] There, he was among the top three students in his class, and was an officer of the school's elite academy made up of its best and brightest.",
              "This suggests that despite his rebelliousness at home, Coubertin adapted well to the strict rigors of a Jesuit education.",
              "[10] As an aristocrat, Coubertin had a number of career paths from which to choose, including potentially prominent roles in the military or politics but he chose instead to pursue a career as an intellectual, studying and later writing on a broad range of topics, including education, history, literature and sociology.",
              "[3] The subject which he seems to have been most deeply interested in was education, and his study focused in particular on physical education and the role of sport in schooling.",
              "In 1883, at the age of twenty, he visited England for the first time, and studied the program of physical education instituted under Thomas Arnold at the Rugby School.",
              "Coubertin credited these methods with leading to the expansion of British power during the 19th century and advocated their use in French institutions.",
              "The inclusion of physical education in the curriculum of French schools would become an ongoing pursuit and passion of Coubertin's.",
              "[3] Coubertin is thought to have exaggerated the importance of sport to Thomas Arnold, whom he viewed as \"one of the founders of athletic chivalry\".",
              "The character-reforming influence of sport with which Coubertin was so impressed is more likely to have originated in the novel Tom Brown's School Days (published in 1857) rather than exclusively in the ideas of Arnold himself.",
              "Nonetheless, Coubertin was an enthusiast in need of a cause and he found it in England and in Thomas Arnold.",
              "[11] \"Thomas Arnold, the leader and classic model of English educators,\" wrote Coubertin, \"gave the precise formula for the role of athletics in education.",
              "The cause was quickly won.",
              "Playing fields sprang up all over England\".",
              "[12] He visited other English schools to see for himself.",
              "He described the results in a book, L'Education en Angleterre, which was published in Paris in 1888.",
              "The hero of his book is Thomas Arnold, and on his second visit in 1886, Coubertin reflected on Arnold's influence in the chapel at Rugby School.",
              "[13] What Coubertin saw on the playing fields of the English schools he visited was how \"organised sport can create moral and social strength\".",
              "[14] Not only did organized games help to set the mind and body in equilibrium, it also prevented the time being wasted in other ways.",
              "First developed by the ancient Greeks, it was an approach to education that he felt the rest of the world had forgotten and to whose revival he was to dedicate the rest of his life.",
              "As a historian and a thinker on education, Coubertin romanticized ancient Greece.",
              "Thus, when he began to develop his theory of physical education, he naturally looked to the example set by the Athenian idea of the gymnasium, a training facility that simultaneously encouraged physical and intellectual development.",
              "He saw in these gymnasia what he called a triple unity between old and young, between disciplines, and between different types of people, meaning between those whose work was theoretical and those whose work was practical.",
              "Coubertin advocated for these concepts, this triple unity, to be incorporated into schools.",
              "[15] While Coubertin was certainly a romantic, and while his idealized vision of ancient Greece would lead him later to the idea of reviving the Olympic Games, his advocacy for physical education was also based on practical concerns.",
              "He believed that men who received physical education would be better prepared to fight in wars, and better able to win conflicts like the Franco-Prussian War, in which France had been humiliated.",
              "He also saw sport as democratic, in that sports competition crossed class lines, although it did so without causing a mingling of classes, which he did not support.",
              "[15] Unfortunately for Coubertin, his efforts to incorporate more physical education into French schools failed.",
              "The failure of this endeavor, however, was closely followed by the development of a new idea, the revival of the ancient Olympic Games, the creation of a festival of international athleticism.",
              "[15] He was the referee of the first-ever French championship rugby union final on 20 March 1892, between Racing Club de France and Stade Franc\u0327ais.",
              "[16] Thomas Arnold, the head master of Rugby School, was an important influence on Coubertin's thoughts about education, but his meetings with William Penny Brookes also influenced his thinking about athletic competition to some extent.",
              "A trained physician, Brookes believed that the best way to prevent illness was through physical exercise.",
              "In 1850, he had initiated a local athletic competition that he referred to as \"Meetings of the Olympian Class\"[17] at the Gaskell recreation ground at Much Wenlock, Shropshire.",
              "[18] Along with the Liverpool Athletic Club, who began holding their own Olympic Festival in the 1860s, Brookes created a National Olympian Association which aimed to encourage such local competition in cities across Britain.",
              "These efforts were largely ignored by the British sporting establishment.",
              "Brookes also maintained communication with the government and sporting advocates in Greece, seeking a revival of the Olympic Games internationally under the auspices of the Greek government.",
              "[19] There, the philanthropist cousins Evangelos and Konstantinos Zappas had used their wealth to fund Olympics within Greece, and paid for the restoration of the Panathinaiko Stadium that was later used during the 1896 Summer Olympics.",
              "[20] The efforts of Brookes to encourage the internationalization of these games came to naught in his own lifetime before his death in 1895.",
              "[19] However, Brookes did organize a national Olympic Games in London, at Crystal Palace, in 1866 and this was the first Olympics to resemble an Olympic Games to be held outside of Greece[21] but while others had created Olympic contests within their countries, and broached the idea of international competition, it was Coubertin whose work would lead to the establishment of the International Olympic Committee and the organization of the first modern Olympic Games.",
              "[20] In 1888, Coubertin founded the Comite\u0301 pour la Propagation des Exercises Physiques more well known as the Comite\u0301 Jules Simon.",
              "Coubertin's earliest reference to the modern notion of Olympic Games criticizes the idea.",
              "[22] The idea for reviving the Olympic Games as an international competition came to Coubertin in 1889, apparently independently of Brookes, and he spent the following five years organizing an international meeting of athletes and sports enthusiasts that might make it happen.",
              "[15] In response to a newspaper appeal, Brookes wrote to Coubertin in 1890, and the two began an exchange of letters on education and sport.",
              "Although he was too old to attend the 1894 Congress, Brookes would continue to support Coubertin's efforts, most importantly by using his connections with the Greek government to seek its support in the endeavour.",
              "While Brookes' contribution to the revival of the Olympic Games was recognized in Britain at the time, Coubertin in his later writings largely neglected to mention the role the Englishman played in their development.",
              "[23] He did mention the roles of Evangelis Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas, but drew a distinction between their founding of athletic Olympics and his own role in the creation of an international contest.",
              "[20] However, Coubertin together with A.",
              "Mercatis, a close friend of Konstantinos, encouraged the Greek government to utilise part of Konstantinos' legacy to fund the 1896 Athens Olympic Games separately and in addition to the legacy of Evangelis Zappas that Konstantinos had been executor of.",
              "[24][25][26] Moreover, George Averoff was invited by the Greek government to fund the second refurbishment of the Panathinaiko Stadium that had already been fully funded by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier.",
              "[27] Coubertin's advocacy for the games centered on a number of ideals about sport.",
              "He believed that the early ancient Olympics encouraged competition among amateur rather than professional athletes, and saw value in that.",
              "The ancient practice of a sacred truce in association with the Games might have modern implications, giving the Olympics a role in promoting peace.",
              "This role was reinforced in Coubertin's mind by the tendency of athletic competition to promote understanding across cultures, thereby lessening the dangers of war.",
              "In addition, he saw the games as important in advocating his philosophical ideal for athletic competition: that the competition itself, the struggle to overcome one's opponent, was more important than winning.",
              "[28] Coubertin expressed this ideal thus: L'important dans la vie ce n'est point le triomphe, mais le combat, l'essentiel ce n'est pas d'avoir vaincu mais de s'e\u0302tre bien battu.",
              "The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.",
              "As Coubertin prepared for his Congress, he continued to develop a philosophy of the Olympic Games.",
              "While he certainly intended the Games to be a forum for competition between amateur athletes, his conception of amateurism was complex.",
              "By 1894, the year the Congress was held, he publicly criticized the type of amateur competition embodied in English rowing contests, arguing that its specific exclusion of working-class athletes was wrong.",
              "While he believed that athletes should not be paid to be such, he did think that compensation was in order for the time when athletes were competing and would otherwise have been earning money.",
              "Following the establishment of a definition for an amateur athlete at the 1894 Congress, he would continue to argue that this definition should be amended as necessary, and as late as 1909 would argue that the Olympic movement should develop its definition of amateurism gradually.",
              "[29] Along with the development of an Olympic philosophy, Coubertin invested time in the creation and development of a national association to coordinate athletics in France, the Union des Socie\u0301te\u0301s Franc\u0327aises de Sports Athle\u0301tiques (USFSA).",
              "In 1889, French athletics associations had grouped together for the first time and Coubertin founded a monthly magazine La Revue Athletique, the first French periodical devoted exclusively to athletics[30] and modelled on The Athlete, an English journal established around 1862.",
              "[31] Formed by seven sporting societies with approximately 800 members, by 1892 the association had expanded to 62 societies with 7,000 members.",
              "[32] That November, at the annual meeting of the USFSA, Coubertin first publicly suggested the idea of reviving the Olympics.",
              "His speech met general applause, but little commitment to the Olympic ideal he was advocating for, perhaps because sporting associations and their members tended to focus on their own area of expertise and had little identity as sportspeople in a general sense.",
              "This disappointing result was prelude to a number of challenges he would face in organizing his international conference.",
              "In order to develop support for the conference, he began to play down its role in reviving Olympic Games and instead promoted it as a conference on amateurism in sport which, he thought, was slowly being eroded by betting and sponsorships.",
              "This led to later suggestions that participants were convinced to attend under false pretenses.",
              "Little interest was expressed by those he spoke to during trips to the United States in 1893 and London in 1894, and an attempt to involve the Germans angered French gymnasts who did not want the Germans invited at all.",
              "Despite these challenges, the USFSA continued its planning for the games, adopting in its first program for the meeting eight articles to address, only one of which had to do with the Olympics.",
              "A later program would give the Olympics a much more prominent role in the meeting.",
              "[33] The congress was held on 23 June 1894 at the Sorbonne in Paris.",
              "Once there, participants divided the congress into two commissions, one on amateurism and the other on reviving the Olympics.",
              "A Greek participant, Demetrios Vikelas, was appointed to head the commission on the Olympics, and would later become the first President of the International Olympic Committee.",

              "In its report, the commission proposed that Olympic Games be held every four years and that the program for the Games be one of modern rather than ancient sports.",
              "They also set the date and location for the first modern Olympic Games, the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, and the second, the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris.",
              "Coubertin had originally opposed the choice of Greece, as he had concerns about the ability of a weakened Greek state to host the competition, but was convinced by Vikelas to support the idea.",
              "The commission's proposals were accepted unanimously by the congress, and the modern Olympic movement was officially born.",
              "The proposals of the other commission, on amateurism, were more contentious, but this commission also set important precedents for the Olympic Games, specifically the use of heats to narrow participants and the banning of prize money in most contests.",
              "[34] Following the Congress, the institutions created there began to be formalized into the International Olympic Committee (IOC), with Demetrios Vikelas as its first president.",
              "The work of the IOC increasingly focused on the planning the 1896 Athens Games, and de Coubertin played a background role as Greek authorities took the lead in logistical organization of the Games in Greece itself, offering technical advice such as a sketch of a design of a velodrome to be used in cycling competitions.",
              "He also took the lead in planning the program of events, although to his disappointment, polo, football, or boxing were not included in 1896.",
              "[35] The Greek organizing committee had been informed that four foreign football teams had entered, however none of them showed up in Athens, and despite Greek preparations for a football tournament it was cancelled during the Games.",
              "[36] The Greek authorities were also frustrated that he could not provide an exact estimate of the number of attendees more than a year in advance.",
              "In France, Coubertin's efforts to elicit interest in the Games among athletes and the press met difficulty, largely because the participation of German athletes angered French nationalists who begrudged Germany their victory in the Franco-Prussian War.",
              "Germany also threatened not to participate after rumors spread that Coubertin had sworn to keep Germany out, but following a letter to the Kaiser denying the accusation, the German National Olympic Committee decided to attend.",
              "Coubertin himself was frustrated by the Greeks, who increasingly ignored him in their planning and who wanted to continue to hold the Games in Athens every four years, against de Coubertin's wishes.",
              "The conflict was resolved after he suggested to the King of Greece that he hold pan-Hellenic games in between Olympiads, an idea which the King accepted, although Coubertin would receive some angry correspondence even after the compromise was reached and the King did not mention him at all during the banquet held in honor of foreign athletes during the 1896 Games.",

              "Despite the initial success, the Olympic movement faced hard times, as the 1900 Games (in De Coubertin's own Paris) and 1904 Games were both overshadowed by World's Fairs in the same cities, and received little attention.",

              "He was a founding member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and served as its president from 1896 to 1925.",
              "As a republican born to the French aristocracy, a patriot with an internationalist\u2019s outlook, and a child of the French defeats of 1871 yet a committed progressive and optimist, Coubertin struggled in his 20s to find a satisfying vocation.",

              "These efforts attained little success and are largely forgotten today.",

              "After the highly successful 1924 Olympics in Paris, Coubertin retired from the IOC presidency.",
              "His final years were marked by personal isolation, penury, and family tragedy, while the Games themselves, as evidenced by Los Angeles 1932 and Berlin 1936, stepped closer to the centre of world affairs.",

              "A move \u201cconsidered so perilous and challenging that no other woman has attempted it in competition,\u201d per the New York Times, the skill found the 24-year-old launching herself toward a stationary vaulting horse at speeds of up to 15 miles per hour and flipping her body through the air a full two-and-a-half times.",
              "Landing this vault is far from the only example of Biles making gymnastics history.",
              "Widely considered the greatest female gymnast of all time, the athlete was the first to perform at least four exceptionally difficult skills in competition, including a triple-double on floor and a double-double dismount on beam.",
              "She\u2019s also the most decorated gymnast, male or female, in World Championship history.",

              "The sport\u2019s most popular discipline\u2014artistic gymnastics\u2014made its Olympic debut in 1896, at the first modern Games.",
              "Today, women artistic gymnasts compete for individual and team all-around titles in four events (vault, uneven bars, beam and floor), while male gymnasts compete in six events (floor, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars and horizontal bar).",
              "From classical civilization to Olga Korbut to Tokyo 2020, here\u2019s what you need to know about gymnastics\u2019 evolution over the past two millennia.",
              "The sport traces its roots to ancient Greece, where men performed physical exercises in spaces known, fittingly enough, as gymnasiums. The name of the sport itself is derived from the Greek word gymnazein, meaning \u201cto exercise naked.",
              "\u201d As alluded to by this definition, most activities, including running, tumbling floor exercises, weight lifting and swimming, were undertaken while unclothed.",
              "The ancient Greeks practiced gymnastics as part of a slate of activities designed to promote physical and mental health.",
              "As surgeon and educator David William Cheever wrote for the Atlantic in 1859, \u201cThe Athenians wisely held that there could be no health of the mind, unless the body were cared for\u2014and viewed exercise also as a powerful remedial agent in disease.",
              "\u201d Different Greek city-states had varying reasons for embracing the sport: In Cheever\u2019s words, the \u201chardy Spartans, who valued most the qualities of bravery, endurance and self-denial, used the gymnasia only as schools of training for the more sanguinary contests of war.",
              "\u201d Many of the exercises once categorized as gymnastics are now viewed as distinct sports.",
              "Some of these events, like boxing, wrestling and racing, appeared in the ancient Olympic Games prior to their discontinuation in 393 C.",
              "E.",
              "Following the decline of Greek civilization and the rise of the Romans, gymnastics evolved \u201cinto a more formal sport.",
              "\u201d As seen in Sparta, the Romans viewed athletic activity as a means to a martial end.",
              "Per Cheever, \u201cThe soldier of the early Republic was hence taught gymnastics only as a means of increasing his efficiency.",
              "\u201d Artistic records of athletic feats reminiscent of what\u2019s classified as gymnastics today appear across the ancient world.",

              "In Egypt, an array of hieroglyphics show people performing backbends and similarly acrobatic feats, while in China, Han dynasty engravings feature performers practicing juedixi, a predecessor of gymnastics that incorporated elements of dance, wrestling and tumbling.",
              "Gymnastics fell into relative obscurity after antiquity, with early medieval Europeans shunning extracurricular physical activity in part due to \u201cthe strongly ascetic sentiment of early Christianity,\u201d notes Medievalists.",
              "net.",
              "Financial constraints and shifting cultural tastes also played a role in the sport\u2019s decline, though traveling troupes of thespians, dancers, acrobats and jugglers continued to practice tumbling and gymnastics-adjacent skills throughout the medieval period.",
              "Modern gymnastics first emerged during the Enlightenment, when Europe experienced \u201ca shift toward [re]emphasizing physical education and mental education,\u201d says Georgia Cervin, a New Zealand\u00ad\u00ad\u2013based sports scholar and the author of Degrees of Difficulty: How Women's Gymnastics Rose to Prominence and Fell from Grace.",
              "Many 19th-century gymnastics regimens had nationalist overtones, with the activity falling under a broader \u201ceducation program for citizens geared [at] having a population that was both healthy and able to serve the country and the military,\u201d Cervin adds.",
              "The so-called grandfather of gymnastics, German educator Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuth, published the first written guide to the sport in 1793.",
              "Titled Gymnastic fuer die Jugend, or Gymnastics for Youth, the text outlined two forms of gymnastics: natural, or utilitarian, and artificial, or nonutilitarian.",
              "The former prioritized physical health, while the latter placed a higher value on skills\u2019 aesthetic, much like artistic gymnastics today.",
              "In a revised 1804 edition of Gymnastics for Youth, GutsMuths lauded physical education as a way to \u201cfully develop the aptitude of the physical individual and attain the body\u2019s potential beauty and perfect usefulness.",
              "\u201d The educator also alluded to gymnastics\u2019 origins in ancient Greece, adding, \u201cOur gymnastics adheres closely to the culture of the intellect;",
              "walks harmoniously hand in hand with it and thereby ideally resembles the pedagogical skills that were practiced by the young men in the Academy of Athens.",
              "\u201d If GutsMuths was the grandfather of gymnastics, then Prussian educator and former soldier Friedrich Ludwig Jahn was undoubtedly its father.",
              "Prompted to develop a program of physical education after witnessing his home country\u2019s defeat at the hands of Napoleon, Jahn embraced gymnastics as a means of boosting morale and inspiring patriotism.",
              "Jahn viewed fresh-air expeditions, gymnastics and calisthenics as ways of building \u201cnational character\u201d and inspiring \u201ca love for the Fatherland the purity of the Volk,\u201d or people.",
              "His training regimen bordered on militaristic and directly influenced the Hitler Youth movement of the following century.",
              "His first open-air gymnasium, the Turnplatz in Berlin, debuted in 1811, quickly gaining traction among young, middle-class students who responded to his emphasis on \u201c[n]ationalistic pride and national restoration.",
              "\u201d The Turnverein movement sparked by Jahn derived its name from the German words turen (\u201cto practice gymnastics\u201d) and Verein (\u201cclub, union\u201d).",
              "Adherents known as Turners practiced their skills on apparatuses much like those used today, including the pommel horse, parallel bars, balance beam and horizontal bar.",
              "Turner clubs\u2019 distinct nationalist bent soon attracted the attention of more conservative forces, who objected to Jahn\u2019s promotion of a Prussia free of French influence.",
              "Anti-nationalist sentiment proved so strong that in 1819, Prussian king Frederick William III actually banned the sport and placed Jahn under house arrest.",
              "Turners were only able to practice gymnastics in Prussia again in 1842, when Frederick William IV lifted the ban.",
              "The Sokol\u2014another movement inspired by the Turnverein\u2014took shape in nearby Prague during the early 1860s.",
              "(Alternatives to these dominant forms, including a rhythmic-centric movement in Sweden, also cropped up across Europe.)",
              "According to Britannica, the Sokol \u201ctraditionally emphasized mass calisthenics as a means of promoting communal spirit and physical fitness,\u201d using gymnastics and other exercises to \u201cdevelop strength, litheness, alertness and courage.",
              "\u201d Like the Turnverein, the Sokol movement attracted backlash from those eager to tamp down nationalism: Nazi occupiers banned the gymnastics society during World War II, and though the movement was revived in 1945, the region\u2019s communist leaders banned it once again in 1948.",
              "European immigrants brought gymnastics to the United States in the mid-19th century, establishing offshoots of Turnverein and Sokol clubs in their new country.",
              "An American pioneer of the sport was Dudley Allen Sargent, a doctor and educator who taught gymnastics at several U.",

              "universities between the 1860s and 1910s, in addition to inventing more than 30 different apparatuses for the sport.",
              "The Bureau of the European Gymnastics Federation\u2014a predecessor to today\u2019s International Gymnastics Federation (FIG)\u2014was established in 1881 as a global governing body for the sport.",
              "Fifteen years later, at the first modern Olympic Games, male gymnasts competed in six individual events (horizontal and parallel bars, pommel horse, rings, rope climbing and vault) and two team ones.",
              "Germany dominated the field, claiming five gold medals, three silvers and two bronzes.",
              "Prior to 1928, Olympic gymnastics, like its precursor in ancient Greece, was defined rather broadly.",
              "In 1900, male gymnasts competed in events more closely associated with track and field today, from pole vaulting to long jumping.",
              "Standardization of the sport began with the 1928 Games, though specific events, including floor exercise, were only introduced later.",
              "(Interestingly, track and field continued to appear at the World Gymnastics Championships until 1954.)",
              "Women gymnasts participated in demonstration exercises at the Olympics as early as 1906, when the Intercalated Games were held, but were barred from actually competing until the 1928 Olympics.",
              "(The FIG, for its part, introduced the men\u2019s World Championships in 1903 and the women\u2019s in 1934.)",
              "\u201cNo one wanted them to compete, because competition was seen as quite aggressive\u201d and masculine, says Cervin.",
              "Jane Rogers, an associate curator at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History (NMAH), points out that sports were considered too \u201cstrenuous\u201d for women at the time, as men were convinced that their wives\u2019 \u201creproductive health would just go down the drain if they exercised.",
              "\u201d To allay these (unfounded) concerns, the FIG designed women\u2019s gymnastics \u201cin a way that would showcase femininity\u201d and demonstrate that participating in sports was not just safe for women\u2019s health, but could also be beneficial, says Cervin.",
              "\u201cWhat they\u2019re going to reward [with high scores] align with traditional female values,\u201d she adds: \u201csoft, passive movements\u201d showcasing flexibility, beauty and grace.",
              "In the first half of the 20th century, gymnastics proved most popular in continental Europe, where the sport\u2019s modern resurgence had taken place.",
              "Though gymnastics experienced a decline in popularity around the mid-1900s, interest soared during the Cold War, when the Olympics emerged as a cultural battleground for nations on both sides of the Iron Curtain.",
              "\u201cThe Olympics were seen as a place where the Cold War could be contested,\u201d Cervin explains.",
              "\u201cIt was a place where, in all sports, the ideologies of communism and capitalism were represented.",
              "Winning at a sport was effectively billed as being superior, proving the superiority of that country, from ideology to values.",

              "[71] It has been documented that cost and cost overrun for the Games follow a power-law distribution, which means that, first, the Games are prone to large cost overruns and, second, it is only a matter of time until an overrun occurs that is larger than the largest to date.",
              "In short, hosting the Games is economically and financially extremely risky.",
              "[74] Seeking a scholarly institution to independently research the Games, Bob Barney led efforts to establish the International Centre for Olympic Studies in 1989, endeavouring to write about sociocultural impacts of the Olympic Games.",
              "[75][76] He felt that the Olympics \"is worthy of study because it is one of the biggest meetings in a global context and has many political, economic, and other problems associated with it\".",

              "[77][78] The International Society of Olympic Historians was founded in 1991, which publishes the Journal of Olympic History.",
              "[79] Is a common point for many economists as they are sceptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasising that such \"mega-events\" often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run.",
              "[80] Conversely hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games.",
              "[81] Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector.",
              "This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently.",
              "This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.",

              "for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.",
              "[83] The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were the most expensive Olympic Games in history, costing in excess of US$50 billion.",
              "According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that was released at the time of the games, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but could attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.",
              "[84] But by December 2014,eight months after the games endThe Guardian stated that Sochi \"now feels like a ghost town\", citing the spread-out nature of the stadiums and arenas, the still-unfinished infrastructure, and the overall effects of Russia's political and economic turmoil.",
              "[85] Furthermore, at least four cities withdrew their bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing the high costs or the lack of local support,[86] resulting in only a two-city race between Almaty, Kazakhstan and Beijing, China who hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics.",
              "Thus,some weeks before the 2016 Summer Olympics, The Guardian stated that the biggest threat to the future of the Olympics is that very few cities or countries want to host them.",
              "[87] Bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics also became a two-city race between Paris and Los Angeles, so the IOC took the unusual step of simultaneously awarding both the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles.",
              "Both of the bids were praised for high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities.",

              "[89] As the umbrella organisation of the Olympic Movement, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the Olympic sports programme, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.",
              "[90] The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements: French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement.",

              "Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three (or more) languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country: French is always spoken first, followed by an English translation, and then the dominant language of the host nation (when this is not English or French).",
              "[95] The IOC has often been accused of being an intractable organisation, with several life members on the committee.",
              "The presidential terms of Avery Brundage and Juan Antonio Samaranch were especially controversial.",

              "As a result of the investigation, ten members of the IOC were expelled and a further ten sanctioned.",
              "[100] Stricter rules were adopted for future bids, and caps were introduced to define how much IOC members could accept from bid cities.",
              "Additionally, new term and age limits were put into place for IOC membership, and fifteen former Olympic athletes were added to the committee.",

              "[101] The 2002 Games were also a financial success, raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, leaving SLOC with a surplus of $40 million.",

              "[104] He later noted that when the spotlight is on the athletes, it has \"the power to eclipse impressions of scandal or corruption\", with respect to the Olympic bid process.",

              "Given the two-year gap between each summer and winter edition, and the marketing opportunity such a showpiece presents, it\u2019s only natural that technology and science companies from all over the world battle to give athletes the most telling edge.",
              "Here are some great examples of how technological tweaks and overhauls have completely changed 10 of the Olympics\u2019 best-known disciplines.",
