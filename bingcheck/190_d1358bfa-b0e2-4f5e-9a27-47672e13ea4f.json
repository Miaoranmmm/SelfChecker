Here are some interesting and lesser-known facts about her life and career:\n\n- She was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland in 1867 to two schoolteachers who raised her with little money in a poverty stricken neighborhood[^2^].\n- She moved to Paris in 1891 to pursue her education at the Sorbonne University, where she met and married Pierre Curie, a professor of physics[^2^] [^3^].\n- She discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, with her husband in 1898. She named polonium after her homeland, Poland[^2^] [^4^].\n- She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, in Physics, in 1903, along with her husband and Henri Becquerel. She was also the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, when she received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 for her work on radioactivity[^1^] [^4^].\n- She championed the development of X-rays and mobile radiography units, which she called \"Little Curies\", during World War I. She personally drove these units to the front lines to help treat wounded soldiers[^1^] [^5^].\n- She died in 1934 from aplastic anemia, a blood disease caused by exposure to radiation. Her papers, notebooks and belongings are still radioactive and require special handling[^4^] [^5^].\n- Her daughter, Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie, also won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 with her husband Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie for their discovery of artificial radioactivity[^5^].\n\nMarie Curie's contributions to science have had a profound impact on our understanding of radioactivity and its applications in medicine, industry and research.

              "Following Henri Becquerel\u2019s discovery (1896) of a new phenomenon (which she later called \u201cradioactivity\u201d), Marie Curie, looking for a subject for a thesis, decided to find out if the property discovered in uranium was to be found in other matter.",

              "[14][15] Maria made an agreement with her sister, Bronis\u0142awa, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronis\u0142awa's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later.",
              "[14][22] In connection with this, Maria took a position first as a home tutor in Warsaw, then for two years as a governess in Szczuki with a landed family, the Z\u0307orawskis, who were relatives of her father.",
              "[14][22] While working for the latter family, she fell in love with their son, Kazimierz Z\u0307orawski, a future eminent mathematician.",
              "[22] His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them.",

              "Influenced by these two important discoveries, Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.",
              "[14][30] She used an innovative technique to investigate samples.",
              "Fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had developed a version of the electrometer, a sensitive device for measuring electric charge.",

              "Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present.",
              "[30] She hypothesized that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itself.",
              "[30] This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible.",
              "[30][31] In 1897, her daughter Ire\u0300ne was born.",

              "She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium.",
              "[32][34] She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive.",
              "[30] Pierre Curie was increasingly intrigued by her work.",
              "By mid-1898 he was so invested in it that he decided to drop his work on crystals and to join her.",

              "no one helped her formulate it, and although she took it to her husband for his opinion she clearly established her ownership of it.",

              "[36] Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium;",
              "two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.",
              "[37] At that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: \"The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium.\"",
              "She later would recall how she felt \"a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible.\"",

              "They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tonnes of the ore.",
              "[37] In July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element they named \"polonium\", in honour of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires (Russian, Austrian, and Prussian).",

              "[32][40] She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.",
              "[32] Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumour-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.",
              "[41] In 1900, Curie became the first woman faculty member at the E\u0301cole Normale Supe\u0301rieure and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris.",

              "[25] At first the committee had intended to honour only Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, but a committee member and advocate for women scientists, Swedish mathematician Magnus Go\u0308sta Mittag-Leffler, alerted Pierre to the situation, and after his complaint, Marie's name was added to the nomination.",
              "[46] Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.",

              "[45][46] As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905.",
              "[46] The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant.",
              "[46] Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre Curie a position, the University of Paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still did not have a proper laboratory.",

              "Walking across the Rue Dauphine in heavy rain, he was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels, fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.",
              "[25][47] Curie was devastated by her husband's death.",
              "[48] On 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and offer it to Marie.",
              "She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre.",
              "[48][49] She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.",
              "[25] Curie's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris, however.",
              "In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris.",
              "[49] The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul E\u0301mile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute.",
              "[25][50] Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.",
              "[50] In 1910 Curie succeeded in isolating radium;",
              "she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre: the curie.",
              "[49] Nevertheless, in 1911 the French Academy of Sciences failed, by one[25] or two votes,[51] to elect her to membership in the academy.",
              "Elected instead was E\u0301douard Branly, an inventor who had helped Guglielmo Marconi develop the wireless telegraph.",
              "[52] It was only over half a century later, in 1962, that a doctoral student of Curie's, Marguerite Perey, became the first woman elected to membership in the academy.",
              "Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia\u2014the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair\u2014which also fuelled false speculation that Curie was Jewish.",
              "[25][51] During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right-wing press as a foreigner and atheist.",
              "[51] Her daughter later remarked on the French press's hypocrisy in portraying Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but portraying her as a French heroine when she received foreign honours such as her Nobel Prizes.",
              "[25] In 1911 it was revealed that Curie was involved in a year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's,[53] a married man who was estranged from his wife.",
              "[51] This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents.",

              "on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.",
              "[51] International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honoured her a second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "[17] This award was \"in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.\"",
              "[55] Because of the negative publicity due to her affair with Langevin, the chair of the Nobel committee, Svante Arrhenius, attempted to prevent her attendance at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in Chemistry, citing her questionable moral standing.",
              "Curie replied that she would be present at the ceremony, because \"the prize has been given to her for her discovery of polonium and radium\" and that \"there is no relation between her scientific work and the facts of her private life\".",
              "She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each.",

              "[17] Curie's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government to support the Radium Institute, built in 1914, where research was conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine.",
              "[50] A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment.",
              "For most of 1912, she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton.",
              "She returned to her laboratory only in December, after a break of about 14 months.",
              "[55] In 1912 the Warsaw Scientific Society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie (today rue Pierre-et-Marie-Curie).",
              "[50][55] She was appointed director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.",

              "The institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.",
              "[50][55][57] During World War I, Curie recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible.",
              "[58] She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons,[57] including to obviate amputations when in fact limbs could be saved.",
              "[59][60] After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics, she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, and auxiliary generators, and she developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies (\"Little Curies\").",
              "[57] She became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914.",
              "[57] Assisted at first by a military doctor and her 17-year-old daughter Ire\u0300ne, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war.",
              "[50][57] Later, she began training other women as aides.",
              "[61] In 1915, Curie produced hollow needles containing \"radium emanation\", a colourless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue.",
              "She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply.",
              "[61] It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units.",
              "[21][50] Busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that period.",
              "[50] In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, Curie never received any formal recognition of it from the French government.",
              "[57] Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the French National Bank refused to accept them.",
              "[61] She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money.",
              "[61] She said: I am going to give up the little gold I possess.",
              "I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me.",
              "There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns.",

              "She then moved to rue Flatters, in the Latin quarter, in March 1892, in order to be closer to the Sorbonne.",

              "He was well respected for his talent in designing experiments and his quick wit.",
              "The two got on well and began to work together.",
              "In March, Marie sat in the audience as Pierre obtained his doctorate in Physics.",
              "However, Marie\u2019s plan had always been to go back to her home country and become a teacher.",
              "When she did return to Poland in the summer of 1894, Pierre wrote to her to persuade her to come back to live and work alongside him.",
              "Marie let herself be convinced, and with her father\u2019s blessing, she married Pierre Curie on 25 July 1895 in a small ceremony at the Town Hall in Sceaux, just south of Paris.",
              "To celebrate their union, the couple bought themselves two state of the art bicycles \u2013 that had tyres!",
              "Their honeymoon was the first of many bike-riding holidays in Brittany.",
              "They then moved in to a property at 108 boulevard Kellermann in Paris.",
              "Despite being married to a renowned physicist, the newly named Marie Curie still hoped to become a teacher.",

              "On 12 September 1897, Pierre and Marie\u2019s first daughter, Irene, was born.",
              "But that didn\u2019t stop Marie from continuing her research.",
              "She published her first scientific paper on the magnetic properties of metal, for which she was awarded the Gegner Prize from the Academy of Sciences in 1898.",
              "She went on to win the same prize twice more in 1900 and 1902.",
              "With the support of Pierre Curie, Marie decided at the end of 1897 to undertake a doctorate in physics on the invisible rays emitted by uranium, discovered 18 months earlier by Henri Becquerel (1852-1908).",
              "To work on these experiments, Marie made the most of the laboratory that the EMPCI had granted her and her husband.",
              "She undertook a quantitative study of \u201curanium rays\u201d with some highly sensitive equipment developed by Pierre Curie.",
              "She coined to term \u201cradioactivity\u201d to describe the spontaneous release of radium, established the atomic properties of this phenomenon and sought to identify whether or not radiation was also present, initially in other elements, then in uranium-rich minerals such as pitchblende.",
              "She set out the hypothesis that they contained an unknown element.",
              "Gabriel Lippmann presented this work to the Academy of Sciences on 12 April 1898.",
              "Pierre Curie, intrigued by the results, abandoned his own research to work alongside his wife.",
              "\u201cMarie Sk\u0142odowska Curie (1867-1934) was the first woman scientist to win worldwide acclaim and was, indeed, one of the great scientists of the twentieth century.",

              "It also spotlights her remarkable life, from her childhood in Poland, to her storybook Parisian marriage to fellow scientist Pierre Curie, to her tragic death from the very radium that brought her fame.",

              "Despite these achievements, or perhaps because of her fame, she has remained a saintly, unapproachable genius.",
              "From family documents and a private journal only recently made available, Susan Quinn at last tells the full human story.",
              "From the stubborn sixteen-year-old studying science at night while working as a governess, to her romance and scientific partnership with Pierre Curie \u2013 an extraordinary marriage of equals- we fell her defeats as well as her successes: her rejection by the French Academy, her unbearable grief at Pierre\u2019s untimely and gruesome death, and her retreat into a love affair with a married fellow scientist, causing a scandal which almost cost her the second Nobel Prize.",

              "Perhaps more well-known today than her husband, the equally brilliant scientist Pierre Curie, she left behind her legacy of the Marie Curie cancer charity.",
              "When Marie met Pierre, they came together through a shared love of science and it was really a marriage of minds.",
              "She was at first reluctant to marry, as she felt her work came first.",
              "However, once she accepted his proposal, they spent their marriage working on scientific discoveries together.",
              "They won a Nobel Prize in Physics jointly in 1903 with physicist Henri Becquerel.",
              "Then, Marie went on to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911.",
              "She was the first person and the only woman to win the award twice in two different fields.",

              "Her father taught maths and physics.",
              "At the time, Poland was trying to regain its independence from Russia and the family lost their property and money during the national uprisings.",
              "When the Russian leadership banned laboratory teaching in schools, Wladyslaw took his equipment home and taught his children how to use it, sparking Marie\u2019s early interest.",
              "As a child, she suffered the loss of her mother to tuberculosis in 1878.",
              "Marie was an exceptional student and graduated from school at 15 with a gold medal.",
              "She fell ill on leaving school and spent a year recuperating in the countryside.",
              "She planned on going on to higher education but wasn\u2019t permitted to enrol because she was female.",
              "After attending the underground Flying University (a Polish institution that accepted women), she became a governess, but went to Paris to continue her studies.",
              "Changing her name to Marie on arriving in France in 1891, she studied at Sorbonne University and passed her higher degrees, before beginning her scientific work.",
              "Pierre was born in Paris in May 1859 to doctor Eugene Curie and his wife Sophie-Claire.",
              "Educated by his father, he showed an aptitude for mathematics and geometry.",
              "After enrolling for university at 16, he obtained his Licence e\u0300s Sciences at 18, but was unable to proceed to his doctorate due to a lack of funds.",
              "Instead, he worked in the laboratory of French engineer and teacher Jean-Gustave Bourbouze, at the Faculty of Science of Paris, while preparing for his Bachelor of Science degree.",
              "Pierre carried out research with his older brother, Jacques.",
              "They discovered piezoelectricity \u2013 the energy generated by compressing crystals.",

              "He came to think of her as his muse and was fascinated by her incredible intelligence.",
              "She was equally fascinated by Pierre, who was eight years her senior.",
              "She remembered entering a room and seeing him standing in the recess of a French window, looking out on to a balcony.",
              "She recalled, \u201cHe seemed to me very young, though he was, at that time, 35 years old.",
              "\u201d Immediately struck by his \u201copen expression\u201d and the \u201csuggestion of detachment\u201d in his attitude, she described his speech as \u201cslow and deliberate\u201d and his smile as being \u201cgrave and youthful\u201d at the same time.",
              "She said everything about him \u201cinspired confidence\u201d.",
              "Pierre began to woo Marie and wrote a letter to her, saying what a \u201cbeautiful thing\u201d it would be \u2013 but something he \u201cdare not hope\u201d \u2013 if they could spend their life together, \u201chypnotised\u201d by their \u201chumanitarian and scientific dreams\u201d.",
              "He had proposed to Marie within a year, but at first she refused, as she felt her career as a scientist should come first and she was planning to return to Poland to work.",
              "However, her plans to go to Krako\u0301w University fell through, because women were not admitted there.",
              "Married lifePierre convinced her to stay in Paris and they were married at a civil ceremony in Sceaux on 26th July 1895.",
              "The bride had only one dress, a dark blue one, which doubled as a lab coat, so she wore it for the ceremony.",

              "They went on a bicycle tour of the French countryside for their honeymoon and enjoyed a happy marriage, having two daughters, Irene in 1897 and Eve in 1904.",
              "Working together in the laboratory throughout their married life, in 1903 they won the Noble Prize for physics together, along with Becquerel, for their joint research into radiation.",
              "Marie was not included in the original nomination, but Pierre complained and insisted her name was added.",
              "Health risksThey took risks with their health in their research and both experienced radium burns.",
              "Exposed to extensive doses of radiation, they experienced radiation sickness, but carried on regardless, working at the Sorbonne, where Pierre was a professor.",
              "Sadly, tragedy struck on 19th April 1906, when Pierre was knocked down by a horse-drawn vehicle while crossing the Rue Dauphine in Paris.",
              "It was reported he had slipped on the wet street and died instantly from a fractured skull, at the age of 46.",
              "Marie was devastated but honoured her husband by succeeding him as a professor at the Sorbonne on 13th May.",

              "She worked as a private tutor from 1884 to 1889.",
              "As women were not allowed to study in Poland, she moved to Paris in 1891 to join her sister Bronia, whose medical degree she had helped fund.",
              "She enrolled at the Sorbonne for a degree in physics, which she completed with top marks in 1893 followed by the second best marks in mathematics in 1894.",
              "Earlier that year, she had met physicist Pierre Curie, whom she married in 1895.",
              "One year later, she passed the examination entitling her to teach at secondary schools for girls \u2013 once again, with top marks.",
              "In the autumn of 1897, she gave birth to her first daughter, Ire\u0300ne, who would eventually follow in her parents' scientific footsteps.",
              "At the end of that year, she embarked on a PhD under physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel, researching uranium's natural radiation, which Becquerel had discovered in 1896.",
              "In 1898, she and her husband stumbled across two previously unknown radiating elements, which the couple named radium and polonium.",
              "They referred to the radiation as radioactivity.",
              "In the first half of 1903, Marie Curie completed her PhD with her dissertation \"Recherches sur les substances radioactives\".",
              "At the end of 1903, she, her husband and her PhD supervisor Becquerel received the Nobel Prize in Physics.",

              "In the meantime, the increased medical use of radium required precise and comparable measured data.",
              "In honour of Marie Curie, the introduced unit of mass for radium would be called \"curies\" until it was eventually replaced by the unit \"becquerel\" in 1985.",
              "On behalf of the International Radium Standard Commission, Marie Curie isolated pure radium, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911.",
              "Shortly beforehand, however, the French press had blown up her affair with the married physicist Paul Langevin into a public scandal, which not only jeopardised her nomination for the Nobel Prize, but also overshadowed the rest of her life, despite her subsequent scientific successes.",
              "During the First World War, aided by her daughter Ire\u0300ne, Marie Curie devised a mobile X-ray station to examine wounded soldiers, even driving one of these vehicles to the front herself.",

              "To get the ball rolling, Marie Curie, among others, was asked for her opinion of Einstein.",
              "The hope was that a favourable assessment from a two-time Nobel Prize-winner would go down well with the Swiss National Council, which had the final say.",

              "In July 1895, they were married at the town hall at Sceaux, where Pierre\u2019s parents lived.",
              "They were given money as a wedding present which they used to buy a bicycle for each of them, and long, sometimes adventurous, cycle rides became their way of relaxing.",
              "Their life was otherwise quietly monotonous, a life filled with work and study.",
              "Persuaded by his father and by Marie, Pierre submitted his doctoral thesis in 1895.",
              "It concerned various types of magnetism, and contained a presentation of the connection between temperature and magnetism that is now known as Curie\u2019s Law.",
              "In 1896, Marie passed her teacher\u2019s diploma, coming first in her group.",
              "Their daughter Ire\u0300ne was born in September 1897.",
              "Pierre had managed to arrange that Marie should be allowed to work in the school\u2019s laboratory, and in 1897, she concluded a number of investigations into the magnetic properties of steel on behalf of an industrial association.",
              "Deciding after a time to go on doing research, Marie looked around for a subject for a doctoral thesis.",
              "Becquerel\u2019s discovery had not aroused very much attention.",
              "When, just a day or so after his discovery, he informed the Monday meeting of l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, his colleagues listened politely, then went on to the next item on the agenda.",
              "It was Ro\u0308ntgen\u2019s discovery and the possibilities it provided that were the focus of the interest and enthusiasm of researchers.",
              "Becquerel himself made certain important observations, for instance that gases through which the rays passed become able to conduct electricity, but he was soon to leave this field.",
              "Marie decided to make a systematic investigation of the mysterious \u201curanium rays\u201d.",
              "She had an excellent aid at her disposal \u2013 an electrometer for the measurement of weak electrical currents, which was constructed by Pierre and his brother, and was based on the piezoelectric effect.",
              "Results were not long in coming.",
              "Just after a few days, Marie discovered that thorium gives off the same rays as uranium.",
              "Her continued systematic studies of the various chemical compounds gave the surprising result that the strength of the radiation did not depend on the compound that was being studied.",
              "It depended only on the amount of uranium or thorium.",
              "Chemical compounds of the same element generally have very different chemical and physical properties: one uranium compound is a dark powder, another is a transparent yellow crystal, but what was decisive for the radiation they gave off was only the amount of uranium they contained.",
              "Marie drew the conclusion that the ability to radiate did not depend on the arrangement of the atoms in a molecule, it must be linked to the interior of the atom itself.",
              "This discovery was absolutely revolutionary.",
              "From a conceptual point of view it is her most important contribution to the development of physics.",
              "She now went through the whole periodic system.",
              "Her findings were that only uranium and thorium gave off this radiation.",
              "Marie\u2019s next idea, seemingly simple but brilliant, was to study the natural ores that contain uranium and thorium.",
              "She obtained samples from geological museums and found that of these ores, pitchblende was four to five times more active than was motivated by the amount of uranium.",
              "It was her hypothesis that a new element that was considerably more active than uranium was present in small amounts in the ore.",
              "Fascinating new vistas were opening up.",
              "Pierre gave up his research into crystals and symmetry in nature which he was deeply involved in and joined Marie in her project.",
              "They found that the strong activity came with the fractions containing bismuth or barium.",
              "When Marie continued her analysis of the bismuth fractions, she found that every time she managed to take away an amount of bismuth, a residue with greater activity was left.",
              "At the end of June 1898, they had a substance that was about 300 times more strongly active than uranium.",
              "In the work they published in July 1898, they write, \u201cWe thus believe that the substance that we have extracted from pitchblende contains a metal never known before, akin to bismuth in its analytic properties.",
              "If the existence of this new metal is confirmed, we suggest that it should be called polonium after the name of the country of origin of one of us.",
              "\u201d It was also in this work that they used the term radioactivity for the first time.",
              "After another few months of work, the Curies informed the l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, on December 26, 1898, that they had demonstrated strong grounds for having come upon an additional very active substance that behaved chemically almost like pure barium.",
              "They suggested the name of radium for the new element.",
              "In order to be certain of showing that it was a matter of new elements, the Curies would have to produce them in demonstrable amounts, determine their atomic weight and preferably isolate them.",
              "To do so, the Curies would need tons of the costly pitchblende.",
              "However, it was known that at the Joachimsthal mine in Bohemia large slag-heaps had been left in the surrounding forests.",
              "Marie considered that radium ought to be left in the residue.",
              "A sample was sent to them from Bohemia and the slag was found to be even more active than the original mineral.",
              "Several tons of pitchblende was later put at their disposal through the good offices of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.",
              "It was now that there began the heroic e\u0301poque in their life that has become legendary.",
              "At this stage they needed more room, and the principal of the school where Pierre worked once again came to their aid.",
              "They could use a large shed which was not occupied.",
              "There the very laborious work of separation and analysis began.",
              "Marie carried out the chemical separations, Pierre undertook the measurements after each successive step.",
              "Physically it was heavy work for Marie.",
              "She processed 20 kilos of raw material at a time.",
              "First of all she had to clear away pine needles and any perceptible debris, then she had to undertake the work of separation.",
              "\u201cSometimes I had to spend a whole day stirring a boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly as big as myself.",
              "I would be broken with fatigue at day\u2019s end,\u201d she writes.",
              "In a preface to Pierre Curie\u2019s collected works, Marie describes the shed as having a bituminous floor, and a glass roof which provided incomplete protection against the rain, and where it was like a hothouse in the summer, draughty and cold in the winter;",
              "yet it was in that shed that they spent the best and happiest years of their lives.",
              "There they could devote themselves to work the livelong day.",
              "Sometimes they could not do their processing outdoors, so the noxious gases had to be let out through the open windows.",
              "The only furniture were old, worn pine tables where Marie worked with her costly radium fractions.",
              "Since they did not have any shelter in which to store their precious products the latter were arranged on tables and boards.",
              "Marie could remember the joy they felt when they came into the shed at night, seeing \u201cfrom all sides the feebly luminous silhouettes\u201d of the products of their work.",
              "The dangerous gases of which Marie speaks contained, among other things, radon \u2013 the radioactive gas which is a matter of concern to us today since small amounts are emitted from certain kinds of building materials.",
              "Wilhelm Ostwald, the highly respected German chemist, who was one of the first to realize the importance of the Curies\u2019 research, traveled from Berlin to Paris to see how they worked.",

              "From 1900 Marie had had a part-time teaching post at the E\u0301cole Normale Supe\u0301rieur de Se\u0300vres for girls.",
              "After thousands of crystallizations, Marie finally \u2013 from several tons of the original material \u2013 isolated one decigram of almost pure radium chloride and had determined radium\u2019s atomic weight as 225.",

              "Of the three members of the examination committee, two were to receive the Nobel Prize a few years later: Lippmann, her former teacher, in 1908 for physics, and Moissan, in 1906 for chemistry.",

              "His study of the deflection of radiation in magnetic fields had not met with success until he had been sent a strongly radioactive preparation by the Curies.",
              "By that time he was already famous and was soon to be considered as the greatest experimental physicist of the day.",
              "It was a warmish evening and the group went out into the garden.",
              "Pierre had prepared an effective finale to the day.",
              "When they had all sat down, he drew from his waistcoat pocket a little tube, partly coated with zinc sulfide, which contained a quantity of radium salt in solution.",
              "Suddenly the tube became luminous, lighting up the darkness, and the group stared at the display in wonder, quietly and solemnly.",
              "But in the light from the tube, Rutherford saw that Pierre\u2019s fingers were scarred and inflamed and that he was finding it hard to hold the tube.",
              "A week earlier Marie and Pierre had been invited to the Royal Institution in London where Pierre gave a lecture.",
              "Before the crowded auditorium he showed how radium rapidly affected photographic plates wrapped in paper, how the substance gave off heat;",

              "He had wrapped a sample of radium salts in a thin rubber covering and bound it to his arm for ten hours, then had studied the wound, which resembled a burn, day by day.",
              "After 52 days a permanent grey scar remained.",
              "In that connection Pierre mentioned the possibility of radium being able to be used in the treatment of cancer.",

              "Shock broke her down totally to begin with.",
              "But even now she could draw on the toughness and perseverance that were fundamental aspects of her character.",
              "When she was offered a pension, she refused it: I am 38 and able to support myself, was her answer.",
              "She was appointed to succeed Pierre as the head of the laboratory, being undoubtedly most suitable, and to be responsible for his teaching duties.",
              "She thus became the first woman ever appointed to teach at the Sorbonne.",
              "After some months, in November 1906, she gave her first lecture.",

              "When Marie entered, thin, pale and tense, she was met by an ovation.",
              "However the expectations of something other than a clear and factual lecture on physics were not fulfilled.",
              "But Marie\u2019s personality, her aura of simplicity and competence made a great impression.",
              "Ire\u0300ne was now 9 years old.",

              "Marie organized a private school with the parents themselves acting as teachers.",
              "A group of some ten children were accordingly taught only by prominent professors: Jean Perrin, Paul Langevin, E\u0301douard Chavannes, a professor of Chinese, Henri Mouton from the Pasteur Institute, a sculptor was engaged for modeling and drawing.",
              "Marie took the view that scientific subjects should be taught at an early age but not according to a too rigid curriculum.",
              "It was important for children to be able to develop freely.",
              "Games and physical activities took up much of the time.",
              "Quite a lot of time was taken for travel, too, for the children had to travel to the homes of their teachers, to Marie at Sceaux or to Langevin\u2019s lessons in one of the Paris suburbs.",
              "The little group became a kind of school for the elite with a great emphasis on science.",

              "For Ire\u0300ne it was in those years that the foundation of her development into a researcher was laid.",
              "The educational experiment lasted two years.",
              "Subsequently the pupils had to prepare for their forthcoming baccalaure\u0301at exam and to follow the traditional educational programs. In 1908 Marie, as the first woman ever, was appointed to become a professor at the Sorbonne.",
              "She went on to produce several decigrams of very pure radium chloride before finally, in collaboration with Andre\u0301 Debierne, she was able to isolate radium in metallic form.",
              "Andre\u0301 Debierne, who began as a laboratory assistant, became her faithful collaborator until her death and then succeeded her as head of the laboratory.",
              "In 1911 she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "The citation by the Nobel Committee was, \u201cin recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.",
              "\u201d Now that the archives have been made available to the public, it is possible to study in detail the events surrounding the awarding of the two Prizes, in 1903 and 1911.",
              "In a letter in 1903, several members of the l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, including Henri Poincare\u0301 and Gaston Darboux, had nominated Becquerel and Pierre Curie for the Prize in Physics.",
              "Marie\u2019s name was not mentioned.",

              "That letter has never survived but Pierre Curie\u2019s answer, dated August 6, 1903, has been preserved.",
              "He wrote, \u201cIf it is true that one is seriously thinking about me (for the Prize), I very much wish to be considered together with Madame Curie with respect to our research on radioactive bodies.",
              "\u201d Drawing attention to the role she played in the discovery of radium and polonium, he added, \u201cDo you not think that it would be more satisfying from the artistic point of view, if we were to be associated in this manner?",
              "\u201d (plus joli d\u2019un point de vue artistique).",
              "Some biographers have questioned whether Marie deserved the Prize for Chemistry in 1911.",
              "They have claimed that the discoveries of radium and polonium were part of the reason for the Prize in 1903, even though this was not stated explicitly.",
              "Marie was said to have been awarded the Prize again for the same discovery, the award possibly being an expression of sympathy for reasons that will be mentioned below.",
              "Actually, however, the citation for the Prize in 1903 was worded deliberately with a view to a future Prize in Chemistry.",
              "Chemists considered that the discovery and isolation of radium was the greatest event in chemistry since the discovery of oxygen.",
              "That for the first time in history it could be shown that an element could be transmuted into another element, revolutionized chemistry and signified a new epoch.",
              "Despite the second Nobel Prize and an invitation to the first Solvay Conference with the world\u2019s leading physicists, including Einstein, Poincare\u0301 and Planck, 1911 became a dark year in Marie\u2019s life.",
              "In two smear campaigns she was to experience the inconstancy of the French press.",
              "The first was started on 16 November 1910, when, by an article in Le Figaro, it became known that she was willing to be nominated for election to l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences.",
              "Examples of factors other than merit deciding an election did exist, but Marie herself and her eminent research colleagues seemed to have considered that with her exceptionally brilliant scientific merits, her election was self-evident.",
              "Notwithstanding, it turned out that it was not merit that was decisive.",
              "The dark underlying currents of anti-Semitism, prejudice against women, xenophobia and even anti-science attitudes that existed in French society came welling up to the surface.",
              "Normally the election was of no interest to the press.",
              "The most rabid paper was the ultra-nationalistic and anti-Semitic L\u2019Action Franc\u0327aise, which was led by Le\u0301on Daudet, the son of the writer Alphonse Daudet.",
              "Dreyfus had got redress for his wrongs in 1906 and had been decorated with the Legion of Honour, but in the eyes of the groups who had been against him during his trial, he was still guilty, was still \u201cthe Jewish traitor.",
              "\u201d The pro-Dreyfus groups who had supported his cause were suspect and the scientists who were supporting Marie were among them.",
              "Jokes in bad taste alternated with outrageous accusations.",
              "It was said that in her career, Pierre\u2019s research had given her a free ride.",
              "She came from Poland, though admittedly she was formally a Catholic but her name Sklodowska indicated that she might be of Jewish origin, and so on.",

              "The vote on January 23, 1911 was taken in the presence of journalists, photographers and hordes of the curious.",
              "The election took place in a tumultuous atmosphere.",
              "In the first round Marie lost by one vote, in the second by two.",
              "In all, fifty-eight votes were cast.",
              "A Nobel Prize in 1903 and support from prominent researchers such as Jean Perrin, Henri Poincare\u0301, Paul Appell and the permanent secretary of the Acade\u0301mie, Gaston Darboux, were not sufficient to make the Acade\u0301mie open its doors.",
              "This event attracted international attention and indignation.",
              "It deeply wounded both Marie and indeed E\u0301douard Branly, too, himself a well-merited researcher.",
              "However, Marie\u2019s tribulations were not at an end.",
              "When, at the beginning of November 1911, Marie went to Belgium, being invited with the world\u2019s most eminent physicists to attend the first Solvay Conference, she received a message that a new campaign had started in the press.",
              "Now it was a matter of her private life and her relations with her colleague Paul Langevin, who had also been invited to the conference.",
              "He had had marital problems for several years and had moved from his suburban home to a small apartment in Paris.",
              "Marie was depicted as the reason.",
              "Both were described in slanderous terms. The scandal developed dramatically.",
              "Marie stands up in her own defence and managed to force an apology from the newspaper Le Temps.",
              "The same day she received word from Stockholm that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "However, the very newspapers that made her a legend when she received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, now completely ignored the fact that she had been awarded the Prize in Chemistry or merely reported it in a few words on an inside page.",
              "The Langevin scandal escalated into a serious affair that shook the university world in Paris and the French government at the highest level.",
              "Madame Langevin was preparing legal action to obtain custody of the four children.",
              "With a burglary in Langevin\u2019s apartment certain letters were stolen and delivered to the press.",
              "Le\u0301on Daudet made the whole thing into a new Dreyfus affair.",
              "Day after day Marie had to run the gauntlet in the newspapers: an alien, a Polish woman, a researcher supported by our French scientists, had come and stolen an honest French woman\u2019s husband.",
              "Daudet quoted Fouquier-Tinville\u2019s notorious words that during the Revolution had sent the chemist Lavoisier to the guillotine: \u201cThe Republic does not need any scientists.",

              "In the midst of all its gravity, the duel had turned into a farce.",
              "However, the publication of the letters and the duel were too much for those responsible at the Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm.",
              "Marie received a letter from a member, Svante Arrhenius, in which he said that the duel had given the impression that the published correspondence had not been falsified.",
              "He asked her to cable that she would not be coming to the prize award ceremony and to write him a letter to the effect that she did not want to accept the Prize until the Langevin court proceedings had shown that the accusations against her were absolutely without foundation.",
              "Of those most closely affected, the person who remained level-headed despite the enormous strain of the critical situation was in fact Marie herself.",
              "In a well-formulated and matter-of-fact reply, she pointed out that she had been awarded the Prize for her discovery of radium and polonium, and that she could not accept the principle that appreciation of the value of scientific work should be influenced by slander concerning a researcher\u2019s private life.",
              "On December 6, Langevin wrote a long letter to Svante Arrhenius, whom he had met previously.",
              "He described the whole situation, explained what circles were behind the smear campaign.",

              "She declared that she also regarded this Prize as a tribute to Pierre Curie.",

              "Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present.",
              "[30] She hypothesized that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itself.",
              "[30] This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible.",

              "She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium.",

              "[25][50] Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.",

              "[32][34] She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive.",
              "[30] Pierre Curie was increasingly intrigued by her work.",
              "By mid-1898 he was so invested in it that he decided to drop his work on crystals and to join her.",
              "[25][32] The [research] idea [writes Reid] was her own;",
              "no one helped her formulate it, and although she took it to her husband for his opinion she clearly established her ownership of it.",
              "She later recorded the fact twice in her biography of her husband to ensure there was no chance whatever of any ambiguity.",
              "It [is] likely that already at this early stage of her career [she] realized that.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "many scientists would find it difficult to believe that a woman could be capable of the original work in which she was involved.",
              "[35] She was acutely aware of the importance of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority.",
              "Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Acade\u0301mie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity (and even a Nobel Prize), would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson.",
              "Curie chose the same rapid means of publication.",
              "Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Acade\u0301mie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann.",
              "[36] Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium;",
              "two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.",
              "[37] At that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: \"The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium.\"",
              "She later would recall how she felt \"a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible.\"",
              "[37] On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar.",
              "They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tonnes of the ore.",
              "[37] In July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element they named \"polonium\", in honour of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires (Russian, Austrian, and Prussian).",
              "[14] On 26 December 1898, the Curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named \"radium\", from the Latin word for \"ray\".",
              "[25][32][38] In the course of their research, they also coined the word \"radioactivity\".",
              "[14] To prove their discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form.",
              "[32] Pitchblende is a complex mineral;",
              "the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task.",
              "The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy;",
              "chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore.",
              "[32] Radium, however, was more elusive;",
              "it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements.",
              "By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach.",
              "[39] The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization.",
              "From a tonne of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902.",
              "In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal.",
              "[32][40] She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.",
              "[32] Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumour-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.",
              "[41] In 1900, Curie became the first woman faculty member at the E\u0301cole Normale Supe\u0301rieure and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris.",
              "[42][43] In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her father's death.",

              "being a woman, she was prevented from speaking, and Pierre Curie alone was allowed to.",
              "[45] Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on radium.",
              "[42] The Curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business.",
              "[32][42] In December 1903 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics, \"in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel.\"",
              "[25] At first the committee had intended to honour only Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, but a committee member and advocate for women scientists, Swedish mathematician Magnus Go\u0308sta Mittag-Leffler, alerted Pierre to the situation, and after his complaint, Marie's name was added to the nomination.",
              "[46] Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.",
              "[25] Curie and her husband declined to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person;",
              "they were too busy with their work, and Pierre Curie, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill.",
              "[45][46] As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905.",
              "[46] The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant.",
              "[46] Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre Curie a position, the University of Paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still did not have a proper laboratory.",
              "[25][42][43] Upon Pierre Curie's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.",
              "[46] In December 1904, Curie gave birth to their second daughter, E\u0300ve.",
              "[46] She hired Polish governesses to teach her daughters her native language, and sent or took them on visits to Poland.",
              "[10] On 19 April 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident.",
              "Walking across the Rue Dauphine in heavy rain, he was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels, fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.",
              "[25][47] Curie was devastated by her husband's death.",
              "[48] On 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and offer it to Marie.",
              "She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre.",
              "[48][49] She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.",
              "[25] Curie's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris, however.",
              "In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris.",
              "[49] The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul E\u0301mile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute.",
              "[25][50] Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.",
              "[50] In 1910 Curie succeeded in isolating radium;",
              "she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre: the curie.",
              "[49] Nevertheless, in 1911 the French Academy of Sciences failed, by one[25] or two votes,[51] to elect her to membership in the academy.",
              "Elected instead was E\u0301douard Branly, an inventor who had helped Guglielmo Marconi develop the wireless telegraph.",
              "[52] It was only over half a century later, in 1962, that a doctoral student of Curie's, Marguerite Perey, became the first woman elected to membership in the academy.",
              "Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia\u2014the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair\u2014which also fuelled false speculation that Curie was Jewish.",
              "[25][51] During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right-wing press as a foreigner and atheist.",
              "[51] Her daughter later remarked on the French press's hypocrisy in portraying Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but portraying her as a French heroine when she received foreign honours such as her Nobel Prizes.",
              "[25] In 1911 it was revealed that Curie was involved in a year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's,[53] a married man who was estranged from his wife.",
              "[51] This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents.",
              "Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker.",
              "[54] When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium;",
              "on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.",
              "[51] International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honoured her a second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "[17] This award was \"in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.\"",
              "[55] Because of the negative publicity due to her affair with Langevin, the chair of the Nobel committee, Svante Arrhenius, attempted to prevent her attendance at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in Chemistry, citing her questionable moral standing.",
              "Curie replied that she would be present at the ceremony, because \"the prize has been given to her for her discovery of polonium and radium\" and that \"there is no relation between her scientific work and the facts of her private life\".",
              "She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each.",
              "A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning, headed by novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz, encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country.",
              "[17] Curie's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government to support the Radium Institute, built in 1914, where research was conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine.",
              "[50] A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment.",
              "For most of 1912, she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton.",
              "She returned to her laboratory only in December, after a break of about 14 months.",
              "[55] In 1912 the Warsaw Scientific Society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie (today rue Pierre-et-Marie-Curie).",
              "[50][55] She was appointed director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.",
              "[56] She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities.",
              "The institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.",
              "[50][55][57] During World War I, Curie recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible.",
              "[58] She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons,[57] including to obviate amputations when in fact limbs could be saved.",
              "[59][60] After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics, she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, and auxiliary generators, and she developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies (\"Little Curies\").",
              "[57] She became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914.",
              "[57] Assisted at first by a military doctor and her 17-year-old daughter Ire\u0300ne, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war.",
              "[50][57] Later, she began training other women as aides.",
              "[61] In 1915, Curie produced hollow needles containing \"radium emanation\", a colourless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue.",
              "She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply.",
              "[61] It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units.",
              "[21][50] Busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that period.",
              "[50] In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, Curie never received any formal recognition of it from the French government.",
              "[57] Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the French National Bank refused to accept them.",
              "[61] She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money.",
              "[61] She said: I am going to give up the little gold I possess.",
              "I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me.",
              "There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns.",
              "This is the chief part of what we possess.",
              "I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans.",

              "Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost.",
              "[58] She was also an active member in committees of Polonia in France dedicated to the Polish cause.",
              "[62] After the war, she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, Radiology in War (1919).",
              "[61] In 1920, for the 25th anniversary of the discovery of radium, the French government established a stipend for her;",
              "its previous recipient was Louis Pasteur, who had died in 1895.",
              "[50] In 1921, she was welcomed triumphantly when she toured the United States to raise funds for research on radium.",

              "[5][65] Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed by the fact that she had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered her a Legion of Honour award, but she refused.",
              "[65][66] In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine.",
              "[50] She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.",
              "[67] Led by Curie, the Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners, including her daughter Ire\u0300ne Joliot-Curie and her son-in-law, Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Joliot-Curie.",

              "the Institute opened in 1932, with her sister Bronis\u0142awa its director.",
              "[50][65] These distractions from her scientific labours, and the attendant publicity, caused her much discomfort but provided resources for her work.",

              "From childhood she was remarkable for her prodigious memory, and at the age of 16 she won a gold medal on completion of her secondary education at the Russian lyce\u0301e.",
              "Because her father, a teacher of mathematics and physics, lost his savings through bad investment, she had to take work as a teacher and, at the same time, took part clandestinely in the nationalist \u201cfree university,\u201d reading in Polish to women workers.",
              "At the age of 18 she took a post as governess, where she suffered an unhappy love affair.",
              "From her earnings she was able to finance her sister Bronis\u0142awa\u2019s medical studies in Paris, with the understanding that Bronis\u0142awa would in turn later help her to get an education.",
              "In 1891 Sk\u0142odowska went to Paris and, now using the name Marie, began to follow the lectures of Paul Appell, Gabriel Lippmann, and Edmond Bouty at the Sorbonne.",

              "It was in the spring of that year that she met Pierre Curie.",
              "Their marriage (July 25, 1895) marked the start of a partnership that was soon to achieve results of world significance, in particular the discovery of polonium (so called by Marie in honour of her native land) in the summer of 1898 and that of radium a few months later.",
              "Following Henri Becquerel\u2019s discovery (1896) of a new phenomenon (which she later called \u201cradioactivity\u201d), Marie Curie, looking for a subject for a thesis, decided to find out if the property discovered in uranium was to be found in other matter.",

              "Schmidt did.",
              "Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose activity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity.",
              "Pierre Curie then joined her in the work that she had undertaken to resolve this problem and that led to the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium.",
              "While Pierre Curie devoted himself chiefly to the physical study of the new radiations, Marie Curie struggled to obtain pure radium in the metallic state\u2014achieved with the help of the chemist Andre\u0301-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre Curie\u2019s pupils.",
              "On the results of this research, Marie Curie received her doctorate of science in June 1903 and, with Pierre, was awarded the Davy Medal of the Royal Society.",
              "Also in 1903 they shared with Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of radioactivity.",
              "The birth of her two daughters, Ire\u0300ne and E\u0300ve, in 1897 and 1904, did not interrupt Marie\u2019s intensive scientific work.",
              "She was appointed lecturer in physics at the E\u0301cole Normale Supe\u0301rieure for girls in Se\u0300vres (1900) and introduced there a method of teaching based on experimental demonstrations.",

              "How Marie Curie Helped Save a Million Soldiers During World War I",
              "THE INSTITUTEBy 1914 Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie had already made several pioneering contributions to the field of radioactivity, including discovering the radioactive elements radium and polonium.",
              "When World War I broke out in Europe that year, Curie saw a way to apply her expertise to help save the lives of wounded soldiers.",
              "She realized that the electromagnetic radiation of X-rays could help doctors see the bullets and shrapnel embedded in the soldiers\u2019 bodies and remove them, as well as locate broken bones.",
              "Many hospitals in France already had X-ray equipment, but those machines were often far from the battlefield.",
              "To move the technology closer to the soldiers, Curie and her daughter amassed a fleet of vehicles equipped with X-ray machines and set up 200 radiological units in more permanent posts during the first two years of the war.",
              "Curie, who was born in Poland, was living in Paris in 1914 when the war began.",
              "As founding director of France\u2019s Red Cross Radiology Service, she was in the midst of setting up her laboratory at the Radium Institute, a new center in the city for the study of radioactivity.",
              "Construction was complete, but many of her researchers were off fighting the war.",
              "Just before the German army\u2019s invasion, the French government moved the country\u2019s capital to Bordeaux.",
              "Curie transported France\u2019s only sample of radium in a safe-deposit box to the city, 600 kilometers southwest, but she quickly returned to Paris, determined to apply her scientific knowledge to aid the war effort.",
              "Curie approached her wealthy friends and colleagues to donate automotive vehicles which when modified could be used as mobile X-ray units.",
              "And she persuaded French manufacturers of X-ray equipment to donate it along with portable electric generators.",
              "She also asked local body shops to voluntarily outfit the vehicles with the equipment so it could be positioned in field hospitals close to the front.",
              "By October 1914, the first of 20 vehicles, which French soldiers dubbed petites Curies (little Curies), were ready.",
              "Marie Curie (above) amassed a fleet of vehicles equipped with X-ray machines to bring the life-saving technology closer to the battlefield during World War I.",
              "Photo: Oxford Science Archive/Print Collector/Getty Images Although Curie had lectured about X-rays at Sorbonne University (now Paris Sorbonne University), she had no practical experience working with them.",
              "So she took crash courses on how to operate the equipment and on human anatomy so she could learn how to read the film.",
              "She also learned how to drive a car and how to fix it if necessary.",
              "Accompanied by a military doctor and her 17-year-old daughter, Ire\u0300ne, for an assistant, Curie made her trip to the battlefront in October 1914.",
              "In less than two years, the number of units had grown substantially, and the Curies had set up a training program at the Radium Institute to teach other women to operate the equipment.",
              "Curie also opened her wallet to aid the war effort.",
              "She was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, in 1903, for physics, and she went on to receive the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "She offered to donate her gold medals to the French government to aid the war effort, but the French National Bank turned her down.",
              "Instead, she used most of her Nobel Prize money to buy French war bonds.",
              "The war ended on 11 November 1918, and a year later her laboratory at the Radium Institute was finally ready.",
              "There, she would dedicate herself to research until she died in 1934 at age 66 of aplastic anemia\u2014a rare condition in which the body stops producing enough red blood cells.",
              "Her anemia was attributed to the lack of protection from radiation exposure when she operated the mobile X-ray units, as well as the radon gas tubes she carried in her pockets during her research.",

              "THE INSTITUTEBy 1914 Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie had already made several pioneering contributions to the field of radioactivity, including discovering the radioactive elements radium and polonium.",
              "When World War I broke out in Europe that year, Curie saw a way to apply her expertise to help save the lives of wounded soldiers.",
              "She realized that the electromagnetic radiation of X-rays could help doctors see the bullets and shrapnel embedded in the soldiers\u2019 bodies and remove them, as well as locate broken bones.",
              "Many hospitals in France already had X-ray equipment, but those machines were often far from the battlefield.",
              "To move the technology closer to the soldiers, Curie and her daughter amassed a fleet of vehicles equipped with X-ray machines and set up 200 radiological units in more permanent posts during the first two years of the war.",
              "Curie, who was born in Poland, was living in Paris in 1914 when the war began.",
              "As founding director of France\u2019s Red Cross Radiology Service, she was in the midst of setting up her laboratory at the Radium Institute, a new center in the city for the study of radioactivity.",
              "Construction was complete, but many of her researchers were off fighting the war.",
              "Just before the German army\u2019s invasion, the French government moved the country\u2019s capital to Bordeaux.",
              "Curie transported France\u2019s only sample of radium in a safe-deposit box to the city, 600 kilometers southwest, but she quickly returned to Paris, determined to apply her scientific knowledge to aid the war effort.",
              "Curie approached her wealthy friends and colleagues to donate automotive vehicles which when modified could be used as mobile X-ray units.",
              "And she persuaded French manufacturers of X-ray equipment to donate it along with portable electric generators.",
              "She also asked local body shops to voluntarily outfit the vehicles with the equipment so it could be positioned in field hospitals close to the front.",
              "By October 1914, the first of 20 vehicles, which French soldiers dubbed petites Curies (little Curies), were ready.",
              "Marie Curie (above) amassed a fleet of vehicles equipped with X-ray machines to bring the life-saving technology closer to the battlefield during World War I.",
              "Photo: Oxford Science Archive/Print Collector/Getty Images Although Curie had lectured about X-rays at Sorbonne University (now Paris Sorbonne University), she had no practical experience working with them.",
              "So she took crash courses on how to operate the equipment and on human anatomy so she could learn how to read the film.",
              "She also learned how to drive a car and how to fix it if necessary.",
              "Accompanied by a military doctor and her 17-year-old daughter, Ire\u0300ne, for an assistant, Curie made her trip to the battlefront in October 1914.",
              "In less than two years, the number of units had grown substantially, and the Curies had set up a training program at the Radium Institute to teach other women to operate the equipment.",
              "Curie also opened her wallet to aid the war effort.",
              "She was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, in 1903, for physics, and she went on to receive the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "She offered to donate her gold medals to the French government to aid the war effort, but the French National Bank turned her down.",
              "Instead, she used most of her Nobel Prize money to buy French war bonds.",
              "The war ended on 11 November 1918, and a year later her laboratory at the Radium Institute was finally ready.",
              "There, she would dedicate herself to research until she died in 1934 at age 66 of aplastic anemia\u2014a rare condition in which the body stops producing enough red blood cells.",
              "Her anemia was attributed to the lack of protection from radiation exposure when she operated the mobile X-ray units, as well as the radon gas tubes she carried in her pockets during her research.",

              "But that\u2019s just my guess \u2013 luckily, there\u2019s some information on the matter, so we don\u2019t have to guess.",
              "The reason for the concern is that Marie and Pierre Curie processed tons of uranium-bearing minerals in their laboratory, discovering the naturally radioactive elements polonium and radium through an arduous process of grinding tons of rock and painstakingly extracting the radioactive components.",
              "They were doing this work only a few years after the discovery of radiation and radioactivity, and little was known of the potential harm they could cause.",
              "Even less was known about good radiological work practices \u2013 it\u2019s not surprising that the laboratory and notebooks became contaminated.",
              "Considering radium\u2019s 1600-year half-life and the sensitivity of today\u2019s radiation detectors, it\u2019s equally unsurprising that this contamination is still detectable today.",
              "Oh \u2013 and if you\u2019re interested, you can see Marie Curie\u2019s notebook yourself \u2013 it\u2019s in the Wellcome Collection (located in London), and anybody can download a scan as a PDF.",
              "Scholars can handle the notebook, although the Christian Science Monitor tells us that they first need to sign a release and use gloves because of the contamination.",
              "But before we make an appointment to see the notebooks, let\u2019s talk about the risks!",
              "Contamination In 2014 the Wellcome Trust commissioned an evaluation of contamination and radiation levels from Marie Curie\u2019s notebook \u2013 the highest levels of contamination found were about 2500 counts per second (cps) of alpha contamination and 3500 cps of beta contamination.",
              "Further analysis (and a little bit of calculation) showed that the notebook has about 1.",

              "According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a person can ingest up to 2 microCuries annually without exceeding a dose limit \u2013 this means that someone who decided to eat Marie Curie\u2019s laboratory notebook would exceed their annual dose limit by about 60% for that year.",
              "Is this a lot of radiation exposure?",
              "Well.",

              "It seems unlikely \u2013 but even if they did, there\u2019s not enough radioactivity to cause radiation sickness in the short term or create a significant risk of cancer in the long term.",
              "The bottom line is that this notebook doesn\u2019t pose an appreciable risk to anybody who wants to read it \u2013 even if they do decide to lick the cover and pages.",
              "In reality, the likely radiation exposure from handling the diary is even lower \u2013 at most, about 0.",
              "0003 microCuries might be removed by holding the notebook.",
              "Were this to be ingested (perhaps by licking one\u2019s fingers or transferring it to a sandwich), one might receive a dose equivalent to the same amount of exposure we receive from natural radiation in just two days.",
              "Radiation exposure Radium primarily emits alpha radiation, which can\u2019t even pass through a half-inch (about 1 cm) of air and cannot penetrate through the dead layer of skin cells of our epidermis to reach the living cells beneath.",
              "Radium also gives off a small amount of gamma radiation, but the low levels of radium measured in Curie\u2019s notebook give off equally low levels of gamma radiation.",
              "Someone turning the pages wouldn\u2019t receive enough radiation exposures to cause any health concerns.",

              "Marie and Pierre Curie\u2019s remains Marie Curie\u2019s body (Pierre\u2019s as well) was somewhat radioactive at the time of her death due to the radium and other radioactivity she had inhaled and ingested during her many years of laboratory work.",
              "As a result, she and Pierre were buried in lead coffins to shield the radiation both were emitting at the time of their death.",
              "In 1995 France honored both Marie and Pierre by moving their bodies to the Pantheon, where they were to be laid to rest with Victor Hugo, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, and other great French intellectuals.",
              "At this time, the French radiation protection agency (l\u2019Office de Protection contres les Rayonnements Ionisants \u2013 OPRI) directed that radiation measurements be made during the exhumation to determine the risk, if any, to those involved in the process.",
              "Radiation dose rates in the cemetery were slightly elevated, but this was determined to be due to natural radioactivity in the granite headstone, monuments, and pavers.",

              "However, the average human skeleton weighs about 10 kg;",
              "if we assume for the sake of argument that Pierre\u2019s skeleton contained about half the mass of his remains, then the total amount of radioactivity in Pierre\u2019s body would have been about 0.",
              "16 microCuries \u2013 this number is almost certainly wrong, but there\u2019s no way to tell if it\u2019s high or low.",
              "If we multiply by a factor of 10 for the high estimate and divide by the same amount for the low estimate, it seems safe to say that Pierre had somewhere between 0.",

              "6 microCuries of radioactivity at the time of his death.",
              "The high estimate is still lower than what US regulations permit a radiation worker to ingest annually and would give a radiation dose of about 40 rem to the surface of the bone or about four rem to the whole body.",
              "Given the relatively long half-life (about 1600 years) of radium, there has been virtually no radioactive decay between the time of the Curies\u2019 death and today \u2013 if there\u2019s very little radioactivity today, then there was very little at the time of their death.",
              "Given what was known at that time about their work, it likely made sense to bury both Marie and Pierre in lead-lined coffins \u2013 given the more recent measurements (1995), this seems to have been overly protective.",
              "Conclusion Marie and Pierre Curie worked with large amounts of radioactivity in their laboratory in an era when laboratory safety and radiation safety practices were rudimentary.",
              "As a result, both were almost certainly contaminated with radioactivity inside and out.",
              "But the contamination left behind on their laboratory notebooks and the radioactivity inside their bodies does not seem to have posed a risk to others at the times of their death, nor does it pose a threat to others today.",

              "[1] One of seven children born to teachers, Marie showed an interest in mathematics and physics, which her father taught at a high school.",
              "[1] Universities in Poland did not allow women to attend, so in 1891, Marie moved to Paris to attend Sorbonne.",
              "By 1894, she had graduated at the top of her class with degrees in both mathematics and physics, taking after her father.",
              "[2] While in attendance, she met Pierre Curie, a professor at the university.",
              "On July 26, 1895, Marie married Pierre and remained in Paris to conduct research alongside him.",
              "[2] Early in her career, Marie took an interest in Becquerel rays.",
              "She did not have the funding for a lab, so she conducted her research in a storeroom.",
              "In the tight working quarters, she discovered that the chemical or physical state of the uranium did not matter.",
              "The more uranium in the compound, the more radiation it gave off.",
              "[1] She continued exploring other types of compounds that emitted Becquerel rays and found that thorium also produced rays similar to uranium.",
              "She decided to name the activity of the two compounds radioactivity.",
              "[1] After this discovery, she and Pierre turned their attention to a mineral called pitchblende (uranium oxide), which is about 70 percent uranium, but more active than uranium.",
              "[3] They assumed there was a radioactive substance inside pitchblende causing this.",
              "Through fractional crystallization, they were able to discover polonium and radium.",
              "[1] With the new knowledge of these two substances, Curie later realized that radium could be used as a gamma ray source on X-ray machines.",
              "This was extremely useful during World War I because it allowed for smaller, more accurate x-ray machines that could be used by medics.",
              "[3] In 1903, following her and Pierres research on Becquerel rays, they both received the Nobel Prize for Physics.",
              "Pierre died in a car accident in 1906, but Marie continued her research.",

              "In her lab, she would keep tubes of radium in her pocket.",
              "[3] She began to suspect that radium negatively impacted health when one of her fellow researchers died of a blood disease, and then a few years later her personal assistant died of a blood disease.",
              "Even though she suspected that radium exposure was bad for her health, she did very little to monitor her own blood.",
              "In 1932, she broke her wrist and the break took much longer to heal than it should have.",
              "She then began to notice that her vision was deteriorating and radiation burns on her fingers were becoming more and more painful.",
              "Some days she felt too ill to even go to the lab, and finally on July 4, 1934, Marie died from aplastic anemia.",
              "[1] Marie suspected that her health was being negatively impacted by radium exposure, but did nothing about it, most likely because there weren't any effective treatments for radium poisoning yet.",
              "At the time, scientists knew that radium was metabolized like calcium.",
              "In an attempt to remove it from the system, they manipulated calcium intake.",
              "[4] This caused little to no improvements, so parathyroid hormone was added to the treatment.",
              "Again, there was some reduction of radium, but not a significant amount.",
              "It wasn't until after Marie's death that they realized once radium is in the bones, it is extremely difficult to extract.",

              "Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Acade\u0301mie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity (and even a Nobel Prize), would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson.",
              "Curie chose the same rapid means of publication.",
              "Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Acade\u0301mie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann.",
              "[36] Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium;",
              "two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.",
              "[37] At that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: \"The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium.\"",
              "She later would recall how she felt \"a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible.\"",
              "[37] On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar.",
              "They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tonnes of the ore.",
              "[37] In July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element they named \"polonium\", in honour of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires (Russian, Austrian, and Prussian).",
              "[14] On 26 December 1898, the Curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named \"radium\", from the Latin word for \"ray\".",
              "[25][32][38] In the course of their research, they also coined the word \"radioactivity\".",
              "[14] To prove their discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form.",
              "[32] Pitchblende is a complex mineral;",
              "the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task.",
              "The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy;",
              "chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore.",
              "[32] Radium, however, was more elusive;",
              "it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements.",
              "By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach.",
              "[39] The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization.",
              "From a tonne of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902.",
              "In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal.",
              "[32][40] She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.",
              "[32] Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumour-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.",
              "[41] In 1900, Curie became the first woman faculty member at the E\u0301cole Normale Supe\u0301rieure and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris.",
              "[42][43] In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her father's death.",
              "[25] In June 1903, supervised by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris.",
              "[25][44] That month the couple were invited to the Royal Institution in London to give a speech on radioactivity;",
              "being a woman, she was prevented from speaking, and Pierre Curie alone was allowed to.",
              "[45] Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on radium.",
              "[42] The Curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business.",
              "[32][42] In December 1903 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics, \"in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel.\"",
              "[25] At first the committee had intended to honour only Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, but a committee member and advocate for women scientists, Swedish mathematician Magnus Go\u0308sta Mittag-Leffler, alerted Pierre to the situation, and after his complaint, Marie's name was added to the nomination.",
              "[46] Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.",
              "[25] Curie and her husband declined to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person;",
              "they were too busy with their work, and Pierre Curie, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill.",
              "[45][46] As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905.",
              "[46] The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant.",
              "[46] Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre Curie a position, the University of Paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still did not have a proper laboratory.",
              "[25][42][43] Upon Pierre Curie's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.",
              "[46] In December 1904, Curie gave birth to their second daughter, E\u0300ve.",
              "[46] She hired Polish governesses to teach her daughters her native language, and sent or took them on visits to Poland.",
              "[10] On 19 April 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident.",
              "Walking across the Rue Dauphine in heavy rain, he was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels, fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.",
              "[25][47] Curie was devastated by her husband's death.",
              "[48] On 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and offer it to Marie.",
              "She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre.",
              "[48][49] She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.",
              "[25] Curie's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris, however.",
              "In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris.",
              "[49] The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul E\u0301mile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute.",
              "[25][50] Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.",
              "[50] In 1910 Curie succeeded in isolating radium;",
              "she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre: the curie.",
              "[49] Nevertheless, in 1911 the French Academy of Sciences failed, by one[25] or two votes,[51] to elect her to membership in the academy.",
              "Elected instead was E\u0301douard Branly, an inventor who had helped Guglielmo Marconi develop the wireless telegraph.",
              "[52] It was only over half a century later, in 1962, that a doctoral student of Curie's, Marguerite Perey, became the first woman elected to membership in the academy.",
              "Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia\u2014the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair\u2014which also fuelled false speculation that Curie was Jewish.",
              "[25][51] During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right-wing press as a foreigner and atheist.",
              "[51] Her daughter later remarked on the French press's hypocrisy in portraying Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but portraying her as a French heroine when she received foreign honours such as her Nobel Prizes.",
              "[25] In 1911 it was revealed that Curie was involved in a year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's,[53] a married man who was estranged from his wife.",
              "[51] This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents.",
              "Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker.",
              "[54] When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium;",
              "on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.",
              "[51] International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honoured her a second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "[17] This award was \"in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.\"",
              "[55] Because of the negative publicity due to her affair with Langevin, the chair of the Nobel committee, Svante Arrhenius, attempted to prevent her attendance at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in Chemistry, citing her questionable moral standing.",
              "Curie replied that she would be present at the ceremony, because \"the prize has been given to her for her discovery of polonium and radium\" and that \"there is no relation between her scientific work and the facts of her private life\".",
              "She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each.",
              "A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning, headed by novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz, encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country.",
              "[17] Curie's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government to support the Radium Institute, built in 1914, where research was conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine.",
              "[50] A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment.",
              "For most of 1912, she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton.",
              "She returned to her laboratory only in December, after a break of about 14 months.",
              "[55] In 1912 the Warsaw Scientific Society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie (today rue Pierre-et-Marie-Curie).",
              "[50][55] She was appointed director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.",
              "[56] She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities.",
              "The institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.",
              "[50][55][57] During World War I, Curie recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible.",
              "[58] She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons,[57] including to obviate amputations when in fact limbs could be saved.",
              "[59][60] After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics, she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, and auxiliary generators, and she developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies (\"Little Curies\").",
              "[57] She became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914.",
              "[57] Assisted at first by a military doctor and her 17-year-old daughter Ire\u0300ne, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war.",
              "[50][57] Later, she began training other women as aides.",
              "[61] In 1915, Curie produced hollow needles containing \"radium emanation\", a colourless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue.",
              "She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply.",
              "[61] It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units.",
              "[21][50] Busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that period.",
              "[50] In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, Curie never received any formal recognition of it from the French government.",
              "[57] Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the French National Bank refused to accept them.",
              "[61] She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money.",
              "[61] She said: I am going to give up the little gold I possess.",
              "I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me.",
              "There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns.",
              "This is the chief part of what we possess.",
              "I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans.",
              "The state needs it.",
              "Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost.",
              "[58] She was also an active member in committees of Polonia in France dedicated to the Polish cause.",
              "[62] After the war, she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, Radiology in War (1919).",
              "[61] In 1920, for the 25th anniversary of the discovery of radium, the French government established a stipend for her;",
              "its previous recipient was Louis Pasteur, who had died in 1895.",
              "[50] In 1921, she was welcomed triumphantly when she toured the United States to raise funds for research on radium.",
              "Mrs.",
              "William Brown Meloney, after interviewing Curie, created a Marie Curie Radium Fund and raised money to buy radium, publicising her trip.",

              "Harding received her at the White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States, and the First Lady praised her as an example of a professional achiever who was also a supportive wife.",
              "[5][65] Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed by the fact that she had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered her a Legion of Honour award, but she refused.",
              "[65][66] In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine.",
              "[50] She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.",
              "[67] Led by Curie, the Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners, including her daughter Ire\u0300ne Joliot-Curie and her son-in-law, Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Joliot-Curie.",
              "[68] Eventually it became one of the world's four major radioactivity-research laboratories, the others being the Cavendish Laboratory, with Ernest Rutherford;",
              "the Institute for Radium Research, Vienna, with Stefan Meyer;",
              "and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner.",
              "[68][69] In August 1922 Marie Curie became a member of the League of Nations' newly created International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation.",
              "[70][13] She sat on the committee until 1934 and contributed to League of Nations' scientific coordination with other prominent researchers such as Albert Einstein, Hendrik Lorentz, and Henri Bergson.",
              "[71] In 1923 she wrote a biography of her late husband, titled Pierre Curie.",
              "[72] In 1925 she visited Poland to participate in a ceremony laying the foundations for Warsaw's Radium Institute.",
              "[50] Her second American tour, in 1929, succeeded in equipping the Warsaw Radium Institute with radium;",
              "the Institute opened in 1932, with her sister Bronis\u0142awa its director.",
              "[50][65] These distractions from her scientific labours, and the attendant publicity, caused her much discomfort but provided resources for her work.",
              "[65] In 1930 she was elected to the International Atomic Weights Committee, on which she served until her death.",
              "[73] In 1931, Curie was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.",
              "[74] Curie visited Poland for the last time in early 1934.",
              "[17][75] A few months later, on 4 July 1934, she died aged 66 at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anemia believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation, causing damage to her bone marrow.",
              "[50] The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed.",
              "[75] She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket,[76] and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark.",
              "[77] Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the First World War.",
              "[61] When Curie's body was exhumed in 1995, the French Office de Protection contre les Rayonnements Ionisants (OPRI) \"concluded that she could not have been exposed to lethal levels of radium while she was alive\".",
              "They pointed out that radium poses a risk only if it is ingested, and speculated that her illness was more likely to have been due to her use of radiography during the First World War.",
              "[78] She was interred at the cemetery in Sceaux, alongside her husband Pierre.",
              "[50] Sixty years later, in 1995, in honour of their achievements, the remains of both were transferred to the Paris Panthe\u0301on.",
              "Their remains were sealed in a lead lining because of the radioactivity.",
              "[79] She became the second woman to be interred at the Panthe\u0301on (after Sophie Berthelot) and the first woman to be honoured with interment in the Panthe\u0301on on her own merits.",
              "[13] Because of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle.",
              "[80] Even her cookbooks are highly radioactive.",
              "[81] Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing.",
              "[81] In her last year, she worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously in 1935.",

              "Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored.",
              "It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics.",
              "On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom.",
              "As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated.",
              "In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked.",
              "[40] In addition to helping to overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, Curie's work has had a profound effect in the societal sphere.",
              "To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way because she was a woman.",
              "[17] She was known for her honesty and moderate lifestyle.",

              "[14][33] She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates.",
              "[17] In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process so that the scientific community could do research unhindered.",
              "[83] [d] She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her.",
              "[82] She and her husband often refused awards and medals.",
              "[25] Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.",
