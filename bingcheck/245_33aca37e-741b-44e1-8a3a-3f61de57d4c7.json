    "query": "What is the psychological reasoning behind the phenomenon of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and what factors contribute to individuals experiencing this feeling?",
    "response": "D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a French term that means \"already seen\". It is a sense of having already seen something\u2014coupled with knowing you haven\u2019t actually seen it[^1^]. It is thought to be the equivalent of a small brain \u201cglitch,\u201d with two streams of thought colliding[^1^]. It is an incredibly common experience, something upwards of 97% of people are thought to have experienced it at least once[^1^] [^2^].\n\nThe psychological reasoning behind d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is not fully understood, but some possible explanations are:\n\n- Split perception: This happens when someone is processing a sight twice because they may have been distracted or their vision was obstructed for some reason. The second perception, immediately after the first one, becomes the one that is consciously experienced\u2014but it feels unfamiliar because we are not cognizant of the first experience, which we only partially processed[^1^].\n- Memory recollection and familiarity: This happens when there is a mismatch in the brain during its constant attempt to create whole perceptions of our world with very limited input. Think about your memory: it only takes small bits of sensory information (a familiar smell, for instance) to bring forth a very detailed recollection. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu may occur when there is a conflict between the recognition of the elements of a situation and the sense of familiarity that those elements evoke[^4^].\n- Temporal lobe epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that affects the temporal lobes of the brain, which are involved in memory and emotion. People with temporal lobe epilepsy may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as a symptom or an aura before a seizure. This happens because of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that affects the memory circuits[^2^] [^3^].\n\nSome factors that may contribute to individuals experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu are:\n\n- Age: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is more common in younger people than older people. This may be because younger people have more novel experiences that can trigger d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, or because older people have more memories that can interfere with d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu[^1^].\n- Stress and fatigue: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu may be more likely to occur when someone is tired or stressed, as these conditions can affect the brain's ability to process information and create coherent perceptions[^1^].\n- Personality and beliefs: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu may be more frequent in people who have open-minded personalities, who are interested in new experiences, and who believe in paranormal phenomena. These factors may make someone more receptive to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and more likely to interpret it as meaningful or significant[^1^].",

              "The idea of PHA group was based on the work done by Banister and Zangwill (1941), and the PHF group was built on the research results of O'Connor, Moulin, and Conway (2007).",

              "After completing the puzzle, each participant in the PHA group received a posthypnotic amnesia suggestion to forget the game in the hypnosis.",

              "In the PHF condition, if participants reported that the puzzle game felt familiar, researchers scored the participant as passing the suggestion.",

              "33% of the total sample.",
              "[33] More participants in PHF group felt a strong sense of familiarity, for instance, comments like \"I think I have done this several years ago.\"",
              "Furthermore, more participants in PHF group experienced a strong de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, for example, \"I think I have done the exact puzzle before.\"",
              "Three out of six participants in the PHA group felt a sense of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, and none of them experienced a strong sense of it.",
              "These figures are consistent with Banister and Zangwill's findings.",
              "Some participants in PHA group related the familiarity when completing the puzzle with an exact event that happened before, which is more likely to be a phenomenon of source amnesia.",
              "Other participants started to realize that they may have completed the puzzle game during hypnosis, which is more akin to the phenomenon of breaching.",
              "In contrast, participants in the PHF group reported that they felt confused about the strong familiarity of this puzzle, with the feeling of playing it just sliding across their minds.",
              "Overall, the experiences of participants in the PHF group is more likely to be the de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in life, while the experiences of participants in the PHA group is unlikely to be real de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "A 2012 study in the journal Consciousness and Cognition, that used virtual reality technology to study reported de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences, supported this idea.",
              "This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experience.",
              "[34] When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect\u2014that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.",
              "In 2018 a study examined volunteer's brains under experimentally induced de\u0301ja\u0300 vu through the use of fMRI brain scans.",
              "The induced \"deja vu\" state was created by getting them to look at a series of logically related and unrelated words.",
              "The researchers would then ask the participants how many words starting with a specific letter they saw.",
              "With related words such as \"door, shutter, screen, breeze\", the participants would be asked if they saw any words that started with \"W\" (ie.",
              "Window, a term that was not presented to the participants).",
              "If they did note that they thought they saw a word that wasn't presented to them, then de\u0301ja\u0300 vu was induced.",
              "The researchers would then examine the volunteer's brains at the moment of induced de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "From these scans, they noticed that there was visible activity in regions of the brain associated with mnemonic conflict.",
              "This finding suggests that more research regarding memory conflict may be important in better understanding de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "[35] Another possible explanation for the phenomenon of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is the occurrence of cryptomnesia, which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as \"de\u0301ja\u0300 vu\".",
              "Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recollection of fixed, established events.",
              "This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving emotions, distortions, and omissions.",
              "Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction.",
              "The proposed sense of recognition (de\u0301ja\u0300 vu) involves achieving a good match between the present experience and the stored data.",
              "This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event it is as though it had never been experienced before, even though it seems similar.",
              "[36] In 1965, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital proposed that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals.",
              "Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere.",
              "However, signals enter the temporal lobe twice before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them.",
              "Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.",
              "[37][38] Dreams can also be used to explain the experience of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, and they are related in three different aspects.",
              "Firstly, some de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences duplicate the situation in dreams instead of waking conditions, according to the survey done by Brown (2004).",
              "Twenty percent of the respondents reported their de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences were from dreams and 40% of the respondents reported from both reality and dreams. Secondly, people may experience de\u0301ja\u0300 vu because some elements in their remembered dreams were shown.",
              "Research done by Zuger (1966) supported this idea by investigating the relationship between remembered dreams and de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences, and suggested that there is a strong correlation.",
              "Thirdly, people may experience de\u0301ja\u0300 vu during a dream state, which links de\u0301ja\u0300 vu with dream frequency.",
              "[citation needed] Jamais vu (from French, meaning \"never seen\") is any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.",
              "Often described as the opposite of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, jamais vu involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that they have been in the situation before.",
              "Jamais vu is most commonly experienced when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person or place that they already know.",
              "Jamais vu is sometimes associated with certain types of aphasia, amnesia, and epilepsy.",
              "Theoretically, a jamais vu feeling in someone with a delirious disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the Capgras delusion, in which the patient takes a known person for a false double or impostor.",
              "[39] If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as depersonalization, hence jamais vus of oneself or of the \"reality of reality\", are termed depersonalization (or surreality) feelings.",
              "The feeling has been evoked through semantic satiation.",
              "Chris Moulin of the University of Leeds asked 95 volunteers to write the word \"door\" 30 times in 60 seconds.",
              "Sixty-eight percent of the subjects reported symptoms of jamais vu, with some beginning to doubt that \"door\" was a real word.",
              "[39] The experience has also been named \"vuja de\" and \"ve\u0301ja\u0300 du\".",

              "Recently, it has been considered a pathological form of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "However, unlike de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu has behavioral consequences.",

              "Because of the intense feeling of familiarity, patients experiencing de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu may withdraw from their current events or activities.",

              "One study carried out in 1967 found that only 11 percent of people who never traveled experienced de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, compared with 41 percent of those who made between one and four trips per year, and 44 percent of those traveling five or more times per year.",

              "The region of the brain associated with de\u0301ja\u0300 vu may have been pinned down, but what causes it?",
              "In general, theories of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu fit into four categories: None of the following theories holds all of the answers, but each gives a unique opportunity to revel in the paper-thin yet remarkably robust experience that we call consciousness.",
              "In a nutshell, dual processing theories suggest that two cognitive processes that normally run in parallel are, for a moment, uncoupled.",
              "This category of explanations can be further split into four types, depending on which processes are imagined to have uncoupled.",
              "It is worth noting that these are some of the oldest de\u0301ja\u0300 vu theories, and none have any empirical evidence to back them up.",
              "They are food for thought, however: Familiarity and recall: This theory argues that familiarity and retrieval are two cognitive functions that normally work in concert.",
              "If, for some reason, familiarity was erroneously triggered, we would feel a baseless sense of having been somewhere before.",
              "Encoding and retrieval: This explanation comes with a handy metaphor: a tape recorder.",
              "Normally, the record head (encoding) on a tape player and the play heads (retrieval) operate separately.",
              "We are either laying down memory, or we are retrieving it.",
              "The theory goes that sometimes, both heads can accidentally be functioning together.",
              "This means that we generate a false sense of familiarity about the sequence of events that is playing at the same time.",
              "Although the metaphor is pleasing, scientists are not convinced.",
              "Memory formation and retrieval do not work in that way.",
              "Perception and memory: This theory claims that, as we perceive events, memories are formed alongside.",
              "Normally, we are focused on perceiving events, but if we are tired or distracted, the formation of a memory can occur at the exact same time as we are perceiving our surroundings.",
              "In this way, our perception of \u201cnow\u201d would appear as a memory.",
              "Dual consciousness: First considered in the 1880s by Hughlings-Jackson, it posits that we have two parallel streams of consciousness: one monitoring the outside world, and one watching our internal musings.",

              "The logic clearly follows that, if this is the case, perhaps de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is a minor type of seizure.",
              "However, data do not back this up.",
              "De\u0301ja\u0300 vu is not more common in people with epilepsy in general, and people who have de\u0301ja\u0300 vu more regularly are not more prone to seizures.",
              "Also, although the connection between de\u0301ja\u0300 vu and TLE is well established, the majority of people with TLE do not experience de\u0301ja\u0300 vu as part of their aura.",
              "Neural transmission delay: There are a couple of versions of this theory.",
              "One describes de\u0301ja\u0300 vu as information traveling from the eye via a number of pathways to reach higher centers.",
              "If the information from two pathways arrives at different times, for whatever reason, the brain might perceive the second message as old information.",
              "This section of theories concentrates on the way in which memories are stored, held, and retrieved.",
              "One memory-based explanation does have some experimental backing.",
              "A study carried out in 2012, using virtual reality, gave an intriguing insight.",
              "Researchers found that if participants were shown a scene that was very similar to a scene that they had been presented with previously but could not recall, a feeling of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu was sometimes sparked.",
              "In other words, if the memory of a scene is not brought to mind as we view a new, similar scene, the previously experienced scene stored in our memory bank still exerts some influence \u2013 perhaps a feeling of familiarity.",
              "Another memory theory put forward by researchers Whittlesea and Williams turns our notion of familiarity on its head.",
              "Perhaps we have been thinking of \u201cfamiliarity\u201d in the wrong way.",
              "For instance, if we were to see our mailman at the front door of our house \u2013 a very familiar scene \u2013 it would not produce a sense of familiarity.",
              "However, if we were to see our mailman unexpectedly, such as if we were on holiday out of town, it would evoke a sense of familiarity.",
              "Our so-called sense of familiarity does not strike when we see familiar things.",
              "If it did, we would be sensing familiarity almost constantly.",
              "Rather, this feeling of familiarity occurs when we see something familiar unexpectedly.",
              "When we see something familiar, our brain processes it more quickly and it takes less effort.",
              "Whittlesea and Williams\u2019 theory has it that if we were to experience something very familiar (but not recognize it at the time) in an unfamiliar setting, the familiar element would be processed quickly (even though we hadn\u2019t noticed it), making the whole scene feel familiar.",
              "The fourth strand of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu explanations focus on attention.",
              "The basis of these theories is that a scene is briefly witnessed without full attention being given.",
              "Then, shortly after, the same scene is perceived again, but this time with full perception.",
              "The second perception matches the first and is accidentally assumed to be older than it truly is, thereby triggering de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "As intriguing as these theories are, none have been proven, and, in reality, all could have some or no truth to them.",
              "We assume that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is a single type of experience, but it could be generated in subtly different ways either between individuals or within the same individual at different times.",
              "Although the temporal lobes appear to be involved, we really are no further forward in understanding why this ubiquitous and unsettling phenomenon occurs.",

              "The first input experience is brief, degraded, occluded, or distracted.",
              "Immediately following that, the second perception might be familiar because the person naturally related it to the first input.",
              "One possibility behind this mechanism is that the first input experience involves shallow processing, which means that only some superficial physical attributes are extracted from the stimulus.",
              "[26] Research has associated de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences with good memory functions,[27] particularly long-term implicit memory.",
              "Recognition memory enables people to realize the event or activity that they are experiencing has happened before.",

              "[14] The similarity between a de\u0301ja\u0300-vu-eliciting stimulus and an existing, or non-existing but different, memory trace may lead to the sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past.",
              "[18][28] Thus, encountering something that evokes the implicit associations of an experience or sensation that cannot be remembered may lead to de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "In an effort to reproduce the sensation experimentally, Banister and Zangwill (1941)[29][30] used hypnosis to give participants posthypnotic amnesia for material they had already seen.",
              "When this was later re-encountered, the restricted activation caused thereafter by the posthypnotic amnesia resulted in three of the 10 participants reporting what the authors termed \"paramnesias\".",
              "Two approaches are used by researchers to study feelings of previous experience, with the process of recollection and familiarity.",
              "Recollection-based recognition refers to an ostensible realization that the current situation has occurred before.",
              "Familiarity-based recognition refers to the feeling of familiarity with the current situation without being able to identify any specific memory or previous event that could be associated with the sensation.",
              "[31] In 2010, O'Connor, Moulin, and Conway developed another laboratory analog of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu based on two contrast groups of carefully selected participants, a group under posthypnotic amnesia condition (PHA) and a group under posthypnotic familiarity condition (PHF).",
              "The idea of PHA group was based on the work done by Banister and Zangwill (1941), and the PHF group was built on the research results of O'Connor, Moulin, and Conway (2007).",
              "[32] They applied the same puzzle game for both groups, \"Railroad Rush Hour\", a game in which one aims to slide a red car through the exit by rearranging and shifting other blocking trucks and cars on the road.",
              "After completing the puzzle, each participant in the PHA group received a posthypnotic amnesia suggestion to forget the game in the hypnosis.",
              "Then, each participant in the PHF group was not given the puzzle but received a posthypnotic familiarity suggestion that they would feel familiar with this game during the hypnosis.",
              "After the hypnosis, all participants were asked to play the puzzle (the second time for PHA group) and reported the feelings of playing.",
              "In the PHA condition, if a participant reported no memory of completing the puzzle game during hypnosis, researchers scored the participant as passing the suggestion.",
              "In the PHF condition, if participants reported that the puzzle game felt familiar, researchers scored the participant as passing the suggestion.",
              "It turned out that, both in the PHA and PHF conditions, five participants passed the suggestion and one did not, which is 83.",
              "33% of the total sample.",
              "[33] More participants in PHF group felt a strong sense of familiarity, for instance, comments like \"I think I have done this several years ago.\"",
              "Furthermore, more participants in PHF group experienced a strong de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, for example, \"I think I have done the exact puzzle before.\"",
              "Three out of six participants in the PHA group felt a sense of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, and none of them experienced a strong sense of it.",
              "These figures are consistent with Banister and Zangwill's findings.",
              "Some participants in PHA group related the familiarity when completing the puzzle with an exact event that happened before, which is more likely to be a phenomenon of source amnesia.",
              "Other participants started to realize that they may have completed the puzzle game during hypnosis, which is more akin to the phenomenon of breaching.",
              "In contrast, participants in the PHF group reported that they felt confused about the strong familiarity of this puzzle, with the feeling of playing it just sliding across their minds.",
              "Overall, the experiences of participants in the PHF group is more likely to be the de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in life, while the experiences of participants in the PHA group is unlikely to be real de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "A 2012 study in the journal Consciousness and Cognition, that used virtual reality technology to study reported de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences, supported this idea.",
              "This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experience.",
              "[34] When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect\u2014that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.",
              "In 2018 a study examined volunteer's brains under experimentally induced de\u0301ja\u0300 vu through the use of fMRI brain scans.",
              "The induced \"deja vu\" state was created by getting them to look at a series of logically related and unrelated words.",
              "The researchers would then ask the participants how many words starting with a specific letter they saw.",
              "With related words such as \"door, shutter, screen, breeze\", the participants would be asked if they saw any words that started with \"W\" (ie.",
              "Window, a term that was not presented to the participants).",
              "If they did note that they thought they saw a word that wasn't presented to them, then de\u0301ja\u0300 vu was induced.",
              "The researchers would then examine the volunteer's brains at the moment of induced de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "From these scans, they noticed that there was visible activity in regions of the brain associated with mnemonic conflict.",
              "This finding suggests that more research regarding memory conflict may be important in better understanding de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "[35] Another possible explanation for the phenomenon of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is the occurrence of cryptomnesia, which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as \"de\u0301ja\u0300 vu\".",
              "Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recollection of fixed, established events.",
              "This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving emotions, distortions, and omissions.",
              "Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction.",
              "The proposed sense of recognition (de\u0301ja\u0300 vu) involves achieving a good match between the present experience and the stored data.",
              "This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event it is as though it had never been experienced before, even though it seems similar.",
              "[36] In 1965, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital proposed that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals.",
              "Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere.",
              "However, signals enter the temporal lobe twice before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them.",
              "Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.",
              "[37][38] Dreams can also be used to explain the experience of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, and they are related in three different aspects.",
              "Firstly, some de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences duplicate the situation in dreams instead of waking conditions, according to the survey done by Brown (2004).",
              "Twenty percent of the respondents reported their de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences were from dreams and 40% of the respondents reported from both reality and dreams. Secondly, people may experience de\u0301ja\u0300 vu because some elements in their remembered dreams were shown.",
              "Research done by Zuger (1966) supported this idea by investigating the relationship between remembered dreams and de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences, and suggested that there is a strong correlation.",
              "Thirdly, people may experience de\u0301ja\u0300 vu during a dream state, which links de\u0301ja\u0300 vu with dream frequency.",
              "[citation needed] Jamais vu (from French, meaning \"never seen\") is any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.",
              "Often described as the opposite of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, jamais vu involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that they have been in the situation before.",
              "Jamais vu is most commonly experienced when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person or place that they already know.",
              "Jamais vu is sometimes associated with certain types of aphasia, amnesia, and epilepsy.",
              "Theoretically, a jamais vu feeling in someone with a delirious disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the Capgras delusion, in which the patient takes a known person for a false double or impostor.",
              "[39] If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as depersonalization, hence jamais vus of oneself or of the \"reality of reality\", are termed depersonalization (or surreality) feelings.",
              "The feeling has been evoked through semantic satiation.",
              "Chris Moulin of the University of Leeds asked 95 volunteers to write the word \"door\" 30 times in 60 seconds.",
              "Sixty-eight percent of the subjects reported symptoms of jamais vu, with some beginning to doubt that \"door\" was a real word.",
              "[39] The experience has also been named \"vuja de\" and \"ve\u0301ja\u0300 du\".",
              "[40][41] De\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu (from French, meaning \"already lived\") is an intense, but false, feeling of having already lived through the present situation.",
              "Recently, it has been considered a pathological form of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "However, unlike de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu has behavioral consequences.",
              "Patients with de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu often cannot tell that this feeling of familiarity is not real.",
              "Because of the intense feeling of familiarity, patients experiencing de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu may withdraw from their current events or activities.",
              "Patients may justify their feelings of familiarity with beliefs bordering on delusion.",
              "[42][43] Presque vu (French pronunciation: [p\u0281\u025bsk vy], from French, meaning \"almost seen\") is the intense feeling of being on the very brink of a powerful epiphany, insight, or revelation, without actually achieving the revelation.",
              "The feeling is often therefore associated with a frustrating, tantalizing sense of incompleteness or near-completeness.",
              "[44] De\u0301ja\u0300 re\u0302ve\u0301 (from French, meaning \"already dreamed\") is the feeling of having already dreamed something that is currently being experienced.",
              "[45] De\u0301ja\u0300 entendu (literally \"already heard\") is the experience of feeling sure about having already heard something, even though the exact details are uncertain or were perhaps imagined.",

              "Other decouplings of epistemic feelings and memory processing can occur.",
              "For instance, jamais vu (often described as the inverse of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu\u2014a sense of unfamiliarity for a familiar stimulus), by our view would arise because someone has the experience of novelty for a stimulus which they nonetheless know to be familiar.",
              "One other similar clash of evaluations between consciousness and memory is the tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) phenomenon;",

              "The critical issue with the ToT is that it seems to signal that material is accessible without actually accessing that material itself, suggesting a reflective \u201cfeeling\u201d which is part of the retrieval process from memory, and yet which does not yield the sought-for item itself, and is somewhat disconnected from it.",
              "The nearest laboratory analogue for our account of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in healthy participants is \u201crecognition without identification\u201d (RWI)\u2014a line of reasoning began by Brown and Marsh [2].",

              "A predominant view is that familiarity is experienced along a continuum, such that people can evaluate the strength of familiarity, but that recollection is an all-or-nothing state [20].",
              "These issues are critical for the neuroscience of memory since they pertain to different brain areas\u2014the hippocampus and a network of associated brain regions mainly within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is responsible for recollection, and a more isolated perirhinal region is responsible for familiarity [21].",

              "This converges on the idea that, rather than de\u0301ja\u0300 vu being driven by the mismatch of current experience with similar previous perceptual experiences, it is an illusory epistemic feeling arising from the alteration of higher order processing as a result of seizure activity.",

              "Unfortunately, however, as we have seen, such patients are uncommon and invasive brain recording methods cannot be used ad hoc for research purposes.",

              "It is an illusion merely of prior occurrence.",
              "Our definition suggests that it is not a rich evocative experience based on the activation of a network of regions, but merely a glitch in the sensation of familiarity which is decoupled from current processing, thoughts, and goals.",
              "De\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu, on the other hand, is a longer experience where the epistemic feeling is one of mental time travel and of partial retrieval of context.",
              "In such forms of de\u0301ja\u0300 experience the person may have time to reflect on the phenomena and search for the source of the prior experience, and as they do so, they may have the sensation that the experience is unraveling, or that they actually experienced the present moment before as a dream or imagining.",
              "Prescience, the feeling that they know what is about to happen, will commonly be felt.",
              "This feeling of what is about to happen actually resonates with recent views of the hippocampal system as part of a remember-imagining system which generates dynamic mental representations from disperse cortical sites for both past and future events [73].",
              "Most critically, a de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu experience, in comparison to a de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experience, will feature emotions (usually negative) and on the whole will feel more intense than a de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experience.",
              "We have also tentatively proposed a third category of experience, stemming from the evidence in this review that de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences appear along a continuum with memory retrieval.",
              "In essence, the chief difference between de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu and involuntary memory will be that the subject is certain of a defined prior episode, that is, their experience maps onto a definite event in their past.",
              "But there will also be no striking clash of mental evaluations\u2014involuntary memories, whilst possibly being intrusive or distressing, do not produce a decoupling of epistemic feelings and content.",
              "It will feel like a memory\u2014and it will contain information which allows it to be experienced as such.",
              "These involuntary memories may be either true or false recollections, but they will be bound by a sort of coherence in keeping with the reconstructive nature of personal episodic memories [57, 74].",
              "The classifications in Table 2 have been generated by consideration of the data presented in this review, but also by expectations of the phenomenology and purpose of recollection and familiarity.",
              "The definition of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu seems rather basic and unremarkable, but we suggest that this is the experience which is closest to healthy de\u0301ja\u0300 vu\u2014a brief mental state which does not involve the activation of a large neural network.",
              "It does resonate with the process of familiarity too\u2014which is seen as a mere assessment of prior occurrence, which if sufficiently strong triggers other processes and a conscious memory search.",
              "It is likely, that just as familiarity can be thought of as a trace strength process, so can de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, with stronger and weaker forms. We return to this comparison with the trace strength and dual process debate below.",
              "Of course, the value of any such classification system is the extent to which it is used and helps us understand data, which is a priority for future research.",
              "As a rule, family doctors, clinical neuropsychologists, and neurologists alike would see epilepsy as the most likely cause of an elevated level of de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences (for an overview of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in neurology, see [75]).",
              "Other causes of the experience to a pathological degree not discussed here include substance abuse [76], depersonalization or derealisation [77, 78], or migraine [79].",
              "We are aware of cases of debilitating de\u0301ja\u0300 vu which seem to derive from clinical levels of anxiety in cognitively intact people, and this is an area of research worthy of further investigation.",
              "For the most part, the de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences in TLE are unremarkable.",
              "However, a handful of recent case reports document the occurrence of more debilitating forms of de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences.",
              "For example, Cohen et al.",
              "[80] report a man with a long history of complex TLE, who after experiencing a concussion following a seizure, began to encounter vivid intrusions of traumatic events.",
              "However, investigation of his history and questioning his family revealed that although aspects of these events did occur, the memories he was recalling were not veridical.",
              "Moreover, the traumatic and distressing characteristics of these false intrusions were sufficient for a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
              "According to his wife the intrusion of these memories was precipitated by seizures, suggesting that abnormal medial temporal ictal activity created an integration of different sources of information.",
              "We return to false memories in TLE below.",
              "Murai and Fukao [81] also report a case where a close relationship was observed between TLE, unusual experiential phenomenon, and psychiatric symptoms. They describe a 23-year-old male TLE patient who experienced de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu like interictal psychotic episodes.",
              "Initially, he only reported experiencing de\u0301ja\u0300 vu auras, but this had developed into a reduplicative paramnesia in which he persistently felt like he was reliving an isolated four year period of his life.",
              "This constant cycle of interpreting his current world as a replay of past events became so debilitating that the patient had attempted suicide on a number of occasions.",
              "The authors suggested that his initial de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences were likely to have arisen from mild abnormalities in the mesial temporal familiarity circuit, but chronic epileptiform activity may have resulted in neuroplastic regenerative changes involving the hippocampus and a distributed memory network responsible for recollection.",
              "In an attempt to differentiate de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu from hallucinatory memories, we have suggested that involuntary memories contain visual imagery\u2014and it is this that possibly allows the experient to feel that they have retrieved a memory, rather than having a de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu.",
              "De\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu may have a sense of pastness and of some prior context and an expectation of what will happen next, but without the generation of material which can corroborate the experience, in this sense recall of information is partial and inaccessible, such as with the ToT.",
              "In sum, within epilepsy, if it were possible to better classify de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences, we think that it would give some indication of whether familiarity or recollective networks were involved in the epileptic activity.",
              "Certainly, de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu, prescience and emotional states are, we think, indicative of a larger network being affected by epileptic changes.",
              "The clinical examination of consciousness is a contentious one (see [82]), but possibly the forms of consciousness represented in familiarity and recollection are somewhat better specified and more extensively researched than others, and offer an opportunity to begin to classify the dreamy state further.",
              "This surely would have clinical repercussions in understanding epileptic loci and the impact certain forms of epilepsy have on subjective experience.",
              "We started this paper with the aim of examining the familiarity processes in TLE, and how they might be behind the de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences in this group.",
              "We took as our starting point the contemporary definition of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu which hinges upon familiarity, and drew upon theoretical mechanisms of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in healthy groups.",
              "An examination of the literature suggests that chronic RWI is not behind de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences in TLE.",
              "There are several strands to this argument.",
              "First we have observed that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in TLE does not appear to be data driven, but persists whatever stimulus is being attended to [42].",
              "Second, seizure and nonseizure-related forms of de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences can be differentiated by TLE patients [34].",
              "This suggests that there is seizure-like cause of the phenomenon, and a more \u201cnormal\u201d form.",
              "Third, we might expect that if a recognition failure is behind de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, then those people who had de\u0301ja\u0300 vu should have poorer memories, which is not generally observed [36].",
              "Finally, our own clinical experience is that people with TLE have de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in objectively novel locations and experiences.",
              "The RWI account requires only for a similarity between a previous event and a subsequent experience which goes undetected.",
              "In very novel situations with little or no overlap with any prior experience, we would not expect de\u0301ja\u0300 vu to occur, but our own experience is that this is just when de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is most likely to be experienced.",
              "That said, RWI experiments are relatively straight forward, and it is a research priority to examine the neural substrates of such effects in comparison to de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, and to test groups of TLE people who do and do not experience de\u0301ja\u0300 vu on RWI tasks.",
              "Our alternative account is the decoupled familiarity hypothesis, where familiarity is experienced in a way that is at odds with the outputs of current processing.",
              "By our account, in a de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experience, familiarity is free-floating and unrelated to the sensed environment, and not triggered by the environment\u2014it is a random top-down brain event.",
              "This is an idea which receives some support from parahippocampal hypometabolism findings, structural damage and cortical stimulation in TLE.",
              "Spatt [13] produced a similar parahippocampal account of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, but his account emphasised the role of the familiarity system in pattern matching.",
              "According to the pattern-matching account, de\u0301ja\u0300 vu arises because a present experience is erroneously matched to a prior experience.",
              "The limitation of this erroneous pattern matching account is that it fails to explain the clash in evaluations experienced in de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "One aspect of the pattern matching account is that it should also generate false memories, on the occasions when the false match is very strong.",
              "However, our impression is that false memory syndromes are rare in TLE, and, although this issue remains ripe for further research, it seems that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is not related to the generation of false memories and confabulation (but see the single case reported in [80]).",
              "We also started this paper with the aim of elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in TLE.",
              "We find that there is generally a large number of brain regions responsible for the generation of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in epilepsy.",
              "Many studies converge on parahippocampal regions, but as the field advances, larger networks of regions are being identified [61].",
              "Our view is that there is imprecision in the neural regions described as a direct consequence of a lack of precision in the definitions of de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences.",
              "Along with other authors, we suggest that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu-de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu, and retrieval of fragmentary images and emotions probably lie along a continuum.",
              "A research priority would be to begin to use common definitions and examples across laboratories and participants.",
              "Because so much research outside the de\u0301ja\u0300 vu literature differentiates experiences of recollection and familiarity, we suggest that this is a good place to start.",
              "We also propose that the field begins to consider de\u0301ja\u0300 vu-like fragmentary images retrieved unintentionally in TLE as involuntary memories [83, 84].",
              "Table 2 gives an overview of the differences between these states, and could form the beginnings of definitions for use by others.",
              "In sum, in finding some support for our decoupled familiarity hypothesis, it makes sense from a memory theory point of view that decoupled recollection should occur too\u2014hence our theory of de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu.",
              "Our final concluding remark considers whether de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences in TLE might illuminate the processes at work in \u201chealthy\u201d de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "We have previously criticised studies using RWI (e.",
              "g., [3]) on the grounds that laboratory memory experiments may be contaminated by social desirability in the levels of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu reporting, and that the sensations produced are insipid versions of what occurs in daily life [9].",
              "On the other hand, using TLE to understand de\u0301ja\u0300 vu has been criticised on the grounds that healthy de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is unlikely to derive from seizure-like activity (even though there seem to be definite physiological triggers for de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, such as stress or fatigue [1]).",
              "In support of the difference between healthy and epileptic de\u0301ja\u0300 vu are the reports which show people with TLE can differentiate between seizure related and \u201chealthy\u201d de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "Like forms of the de\u0301ja\u0300 experience itself, there may be a continuum of experience between healthy and TLE experiences, and again, the true nature of these experiences may never be elucidated without hypotheses based on neuroscientific models and a consensus amongst researchers regarding definitions.",
              "Certainly, the classification of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu we have attempted here will be of use to de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences of any aetiology.",
              "De\u0301ja\u0300 experiences in epilepsy do reveal something about the working of the brain.",
              "Within epilepsy, restricted activation of memory networks used for memory retrieval on a physiological level results in peculiar experiential phenomena-restricted (or artificially isolated) activation of the familiarity network leads to de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, and activation of a wider network, again, restricted insofar as it does not lead to complete retrieval, leads to de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu.",
              "Thus, de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences expose the nature of the circuitry and the epistemic feelings associated with retrieval processes.",
              "For future work, it would be interesting to consider neuromodulation in de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences, since it appears there can be pharmacological causes which lead to de\u0301ja\u0300 vu [69, 76].",
              "Similarly, a number of authors have pinpointed specific neuro-oscillations in the theta range as being critical in the activation of de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences [61, 63].",
              "On a more theoretical level, the nature of the networks involved in de\u0301ja\u0300 vu and de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu echo those supposedly for the separate memory experiences (and processes) of familiarity and recollection.",
              "In fact, there is debate as to whether familiarity and recollection lie along a continuum (e.",
              "g., [85, 86]) or represent two distinct processes (e.",
              "g., [87, 88]).",
              "The most recent work by Bartolomei et al.",
              "[61] suggests a network account of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, which is similar to the idea that familiarity and recollection lie on a unidimensional scale, with their differences being captured in the notion of trace strength.",
              "According to single-process accounts, high-strength memory traces can be retrieved with the sensation of recollection (or at least \u201chigh confidence\u201d), whereas a low-strength memory traces elicit mere familiarity with the cue.",
              "Chauvel et al.'",
              "s studies seem to address this issue from a direct electrophysiological viewpoint.",
              "The \u201ctrace strength\u201d in these experiments could be thought of literally, as the level of current applied to the cortex.",
              "Their results suggest that the larger the initial stimulation the more extensive the discharge to surrounding regions (e.",
              "g., [57, 58]).",
              "This leads to a more nuanced view of whether human recognition memory relies on dual or single processes\u2014trace strength at one specific point predicts the extent of activation to more dispersed and specialized circuits in concert with the original stimulated point.",
              "Thus, the coactivation and synchronization of brain areas seen in after discharges leading to de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu and involuntary memories may represent an account of how a putatively single trace can recruit multiple brain regions and mental representations to produce recollection, which by our view, would be anatomically and procedurally separate from the sensation of familiarity.",
              "Artificially induced de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences in epileptic patients seem an ideal test of single-versus dual-process accounts of recognition memory in humans.",

              "An aura is an unusual sensation that you feel before a seizure starts.",
              "Not everyone experiences an aura.",
              "An aura is a part of a focal aware seizure, meaning you\u2019re awake and aware while the symptoms occur.",
              "They typically last from a few seconds to two minutes.",
              "Sensations you may feel during an aura include: Sometimes, temporal lobe seizures progress to another type of seizure, such as a focal impaired awareness seizure.",
              "During this seizure, you lose some degree of awareness for typically 30 seconds to 2 minutes.",
              "Symptoms of focal impaired awareness seizures include: In rare cases, a temporal lobe seizure can develop into a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.",
              "During a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, there\u2019s stiffening and shaking of your entire body with loss of awareness.",
              "Sometimes, there\u2019s loss of bladder control or biting of your tongue with these seizures.",
              "This seizure affects both sides of your brain and is also called a convulsion.",
              "It used to be known as a grand mal seizure.",
              "Causes of temporal lobe epilepsy include: Epilepsy can be life-threatening in a couple of situations: Your healthcare provider will ask questions about your medical history and your seizures \u2014 how long they lasted;",
              "what you felt before, during and after the seizure;",
              "where you were and what happened before the seizure started;",
              "and if something seemed to trigger the seizure (examples of triggers include stress, lack of sleep, flashing lights, intense exercise and loud music).",
              "Your healthcare provider might also want to talk to people who were with you during a seizure to gather their observations.",
              "It can be helpful to have someone videotape your seizure to show your healthcare provider and to keep a diary of when your seizures occur.",
              "Tests that are used in diagnosing temporal lobe epilepsy include: Treatments for temporal lobe epilepsy include medications, diet, surgery, laser and electrical brain stimulator devices.",
              "Many medications are available to treat temporal lobe seizures.",
              "Your healthcare provider might try one or more medications and different dosages over months to find the approach that\u2019s best for you.",
              "Up to two-thirds of people with temporal lobe epilepsy have their seizures controlled with medications.",
              "Because some antiseizure medications are linked to birth defects, let your healthcare provider know if you\u2019re pregnant or planning to become pregnant.",
              "Another treatment approach is a very specific change in diet.",
              "The ketogenic diet is a diet high in fat and very low in carbohydrates.",
              "It\u2019s sometimes tried if medications aren\u2019t successful in controlling your seizures.",
              "Surgery is considered only after several attempts of medication have failed or a tumor or lesion responsible for the seizures has been identified.",
              "If an MRI shows hippocampal sclerosis in the medial temporal lobe and EEGs show seizure activity starts in that area, surgery may cure your seizures.",
              "Temporal lobectomy (removal of your temporal lobe) is the most common type of lobectomy and the most common surgery for epilepsy.",
              "In this procedure, surgeons use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide the use of a laser.",
              "The laser is directed at scar tissue in the temporal lobe region that\u2019s causing seizures.",
              "The laser uses heat to destroy the tissue that\u2019s causing the seizures.",
              "This surgery involves using 3D computerized imaging and precisely focused radiation beams to destroy the nerve cells that are misfiring and causing the seizures.",
              "If two or more medications have not adequately controlled seizures and surgery isn\u2019t an option, another option is nerve stimulation devices.",
              "These devices work in much the same way as a heart pacemaker monitors and respond to abnormal heart rhythms. There are three types of stimulators.",
              "No medications or treatments can prevent epilepsy.",
              "However, because some seizures develop from other health events \u2014 for example, as a result of brain injuries, heart attacks and strokes \u2014 you can take some precautions to reduce your risk of developing seizures.",
              "The more seizures you have and the longer you have them, the greater your risk of a decreased quality of life, depression, anxiety and memory impairment.",
              "Medication is successful in controlling seizures in about two-thirds of people with temporal lobe epilepsy.",
              "For the other third, surgery helps about 70% become seizure-free.",
              "Medication isn\u2019t successful in controlling seizures in about 75% of people who have mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.",
              "However, 75% of these individuals are seizure-free following surgery.",
              "If surgery doesn\u2019t work or if you\u2019re not a candidate for surgery, electrical brain stimulation devices can be tried.",
              "If you\u2019ve had a seizure or think you might\u2019ve had a seizure, you should see your healthcare provider.",
              "If you have already been diagnosed with temporal lobe seizures, call your healthcare provider or seizure specialist if: Stay with the person who is having the seizure and pay attention to exactly what is happening and how long it lasts.",
              "Don\u2019t hold the person down, but try to keep them away from dangerous situations and move nearby objects out of the way.",
              "Speak calmly to the person who is having the seizure, during the seizure and afterward.",
              "Don\u2019t put anything in their mouth.",

              "Call 911 if the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes \u2014 or, if you\u2019re familiar with the person\u2019s seizure history, if the seizure lasts significantly longer than usual.",
              "If you think it\u2019s their first seizure, call 911.",
              "Also call 911 if the person has another seizure right after the first one ends, is injured during the seizure, is having trouble breathing or asks you to get medical help.",

              "You know, that strange sensation of having already experienced something happening in the present moment?",
              "De\u0301ja\u0300 vu has long fascinated scientists.",
              "Below, we dive into the world of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu research, exploring the latest insights from neuroscience and specifically the work of Akira O'Connor, a neuroresearcher at the University of St Andrews.",
              "An oddity of human memory, de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is more than just a fleeting feeling of familiarity.",
              "According to O'Connor, it involves a unique awareness that this familiarity is misplaced: \"De\u0301ja\u0300 vu is a conflict between the sensation of familiarity and the awareness that the familiarity is incorrect.",
              "And the awareness that you're being tricked makes de\u0301ja\u0300 vu so unique compared to other memorable events.\"",
              "This understanding highlights the phenomenon's complexity and sets it apart from ordinary memory recall.",
              "De\u0301ja\u0300 vu shares some of the same attributes as delusion.",
              "Within a delusion, there is a belief that is not supported by facts, and it continues to be a product of thought for an individual, with the person having a strong belief that cannot be changed or amended with facts of evidence.",
              "In the context of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, forms of delusion involve the misleading effects of perception resulting from illusions.",
              "An illusion is a distortion of the senses resulting from a skewed perception of reality, which is common for many people to experience in the context of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "Various illusions manifest through our senses (excluding vision) when experiencing de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "Many physical details that seem credible, however, can soon be discredited;",
              "in this way, de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is akin to a poorly-executed magic trick.",
              "Contrary to popular belief, de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is not a memory error.",
              "Neuroscientists have made significant progress in unraveling the neuroscience behind de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, although no single agreed-upon model exists.",
              "According to O'Connor, de\u0301ja\u0300 vu occurs when brain areas, such as the temporal lobe, send signals to the frontal decision-making regions, indicating that an experience is repeating itself.",
              "The frontal regions then evaluate the consistency of this signal with past experiences.",
              "If there is no prior experience, the realization of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu occurs.",
              "O'Connor explains, \"Experiencing de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is probably a good thing for most people.",
              "It's a sign that the fact-checking brain regions are working well, preventing you from misremembering events.\"",
              "Several factors can influence the occurrence of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "Fatigue and stress have been identified as potential contributors.",
              "When the brain is tired, its internal neuronal systems may struggle to regulate themselves, leading to a higher likelihood of misfirings and the sensation of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "O'Connor notes, \"When your brain is fatigued like this, your neuronal firing is more likely to be a bit off and result in de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.\"",
              "Dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with signaling familiarity, also plays a role in de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences.",
              "O'Connor explains, \"Dopamine is what\u2019s called an excitatory neurotransmitter.",
              "And when we talk about the brain regions signaling familiarity, those neurons would have dopaminergic action.\"",
              "This may explain why drugs that affect dopamine levels, both recreational and medicinal, often induce elevated reports of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "Age is another factor that influences the frequency of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences, as younger people tend to experience it more frequently than older individuals.",
              "This can be attributed to stronger neural activity and healthier fact-checking frontal regions in younger brains.",
              "As we age, our ability to notice errors, including instances of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, may decline.",
              "O'Connor remarks, \"It\u2019s exciting that younger people get more de\u0301ja\u0300 vu;",
