              "\u201cWe have moved from a society in the 1950s and 1960s, in which race was more consequential than family income, to one today in which family income appears more determinative of educational success than race,\u201d said Sean F.",

              "In particular, I investigate the extent to which the rising income inequality of the last four decades has been paralleled by a similar increase in the income achievement gradient.",
              "As the income gap between high- and low-income families has widened, has the achievement gap between children in high- and low-income families also widened?",
              "The answer, in brief, is yes.",
              "The achievement gap between children from high- and low-income families is roughly 30 to 40 percent larger among children born in 2001 than among those born twenty-five years earlier.",
              "In fact, it appears that the income achievement gap has been growing for at least fifty years, though the data are less certain for cohorts of children born before 1970.",
              "In this chapter, I describe and discuss these trends in some detail.",
              "In addition to the key finding that the income achievement gap appears to have widened substantially, there are a number of other important findings.",
              "First, the income achievement gap (defined here as the average achievement difference between a child from a family at the 90th percentile of the family income distribution and a child from a family at the 10th percentile) is now nearly twice as large as the black-white achievement gap.",
              "Fifty years ago, in contrast, the black-white gap was one and a half to two times as large as the income gap.",
              "Second, as Greg Duncan and Katherine Magnuson note in chapter 3 of this volume, the income achievement gap is large when children enter kindergarten and does not appear to grow (or narrow) appreciably as children progress through school.",
              "Third, although rising income inequality may play a role in the growing income achievement gap, it does not appear to be the dominant factor.",
              "The gap appears to have grown at least partly because of an increase in the association between family income and children's academic achievement for families above the median income level: a given difference in family incomes now corresponds to a 30 to 60 percent larger difference in achievement than it did for children born in the 1970s.",
              "Moreover, evidence from other studies suggests that this may be in part a result of increasing parental investment in children's cognitive development.",
              "Finally, the growing income achievement gap does not appear to be a result of a growing achievement gap between children with highly and less-educated parents.",
              "Indeed, the relationship between parental education and children's achievement has remained relatively stable during the last fifty years, whereas the relationship between income and achievement has grown sharply.",
              "Family income is now nearly as strong as parental education in predicting children's achievement.",

              "This pattern will continue if poor countries such as India continue to quickly converge on income levels prevailing in high-income countries and this convergence outweighs any widening of within-country distributions (Hellebrandt & Mauro, 2015).",
              "Yet that would not quiet grievances about inequality.",
              "On the contrary, the middle class in industrialized economies, one of the world\u2019s most vocal and powerful constituencies, has seen global growth benefit high earners in their economies along with the expanding middle class in emerging economies, while their own incomes have stagnated.",
              "Their sense of being shortchanged is increasingly recognized as a source of political instability.",
              "Since politics is organized principally around the nation state, it is the level and change in inequality within countries that is the most potent source of tension and debate.",

              "In the former, the trend is clear\u2014nearly all developed economies have seen inequality rise over the past generation.",
              "In Anglophone countries, rising inequality has been especially pronounced at the top end of the distribution, with the top 1 percent of earners seeing their share of national income rise.",

              "This redistributive effect tends to be greater in developed countries than in developing countries, where government is typically a smaller share of the economy.",
              "In most advanced economies, redistribution through taxes and benefits grew over the past generation, offsetting some but not all of the increase in market inequality.",
              "However, these effects have diminished on average since the late 1990s, due to policy choices such as the application of more stringent criteria to government benefits (OECD, 2011).",
              "Public policies can also shape the distribution of market income.",
              "For instance, weakened employment protection, such as rules regarding sick leave and severance pay, has contributed to widening inequality over this period.",

              "Modern technology substitutes for many of the jobs and tasks traditionally performed by unskilled workers, while acting as a complement to skilled workers.",
              "In advanced countries, trade reinforces this effect by encouraging specialization in high-skill sectors in which those economies have a comparative advantage.",
              "The same logic should see income inequality narrow in developing economies that specialize in low-skill sectors.",
              "However, in practice, skilled workers in developing economies may take those jobs, so that distributions widen (Maskin, 2015).",
              "By substituting for unskilled workers, technology has not only increased the premium on skills, but increased the role of capital in production.",
              "Historically the share of income that accrues to workers relative to capital owners was stable, but since the 1980s, it has declined across most countries and industries as technology has made capital goods ever cheaper (Karabarbounis & Neiman, 2013).",
              "This adds to inequality, as capital ownership is especially unequal and generates large investment income for many of the same individuals already earning high wages (Atkinson & Lakner, 2013).",

              "For instance, while digital platforms for taxis (Uber), retail (Amazon), and accommodation (AirBnB) are themselves quasi-monopolies, they have simultaneously lowered barriers to entry for self-employed drivers, sellers, and would-be hoteliers, creating highly contestable markets.",

              "Evidence is emerging of the hollowing out of labor markets in developing economies.",
              "Finally, globalization has encouraged a race to the bottom on some regulations and redistributive policies, as the mobility of firms, investment, and skilled workers compels governments to match the conditions of their competitors so as to retain and attract business (Bertola & Lo Prete, 2008).",

              "The economy is being transformed by digital technologies, especially in artificial intelligence, that are rapidly changing how we live and work.",
              "But this transformation poses a troubling puzzle: these technologies haven\u2019t done much to grow the economy, even as income inequality worsens.",
              "Productivity growth, which economists consider essential to improving living standards, has largely been sluggish since at least the mid-2000s in many countries.",
              "Why are these technologies failing to produce more economic growth?",
              "Why aren\u2019t they fueling more widespread prosperity?",
              "To get at an answer, some leading economists and policy experts are looking more closely at how we invent and deploy AI and automation\u2014and identifying ways we can make better choices.",
              "In an essay called \u201cThe Turing Trap: The Promise & Peril of Human-Like Artificial Intelligence,\u201d Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, writes of the way AI researchers and businesses have focused on building machines to replicate human intelligence.",
              "The title, of course, is a reference to Alan Turing and his famous 1950 test for whether a machine is intelligent: Can it imitate a person so well that you can\u2019t tell it isn\u2019t one?",
              "Ever since then, says Brynjolfsson, many researchers have been chasing this goal.",
              "But, he says, the obsession with mimicking human intelligence has led to AI and automation that too often simply replace workers, rather than extending human capabilities and allowing people to do new tasks.",
              "For Brynjolfsson, an economist, simple automation, while producing value, can also be a path to greater inequality of income and wealth.",
              "The excessive focus on human-like AI, he writes, drives down wages for most people \u201ceven as it amplifies the market power of a few\u201d who own and control the technologies.",
              "The emphasis on automation rather than augmentation is, he argues in the essay, the \u201csingle biggest explanation\u201d for the rise of billionaires at a time when average real wages for many Americans have fallen.",
              "Brynjolfsson is no Luddite.",
              "His 2014 book, coauthored with Andrew McAfee, is called The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies.",
              "But he says the thinking of AI researchers has been too limited.",

              "\u2019\u201d In the long run, he argues, far more value is created by using AI to produce new goods and services, rather than simply trying to replace workers.",
              "But he says that for businesses, driven by a desire to cut costs, it\u2019s often easier to just swap in a machine than to rethink processes and invest in technologies that take advantage of AI to expand the company\u2019s products and improve the productivity of its workers.",
              "Recent advances in AI have been impressive, leading to everything from driverless cars to human-like language models.",
              "Guiding the trajectory of the technology is critical, however.",
              "Because of the choices that researchers and businesses have made so far, new digital technologies have created vast wealth for those owning and inventing them, while too often destroying opportunities for those in jobs vulnerable to being replaced.",
              "These inventions have generated good tech jobs in a handful of cities, like San Francisco and Seattle, while much of the rest of the population has been left behind.",
              "But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.",
              "Daron Acemoglu, an MIT economist, provides compelling evidence for the role automation, robots, and algorithms that replace tasks done by human workers have played in slowing wage growth and worsening inequality in the US.",
              "In fact, he says, 50 to 70% of the growth in US wage inequality between 1980 and 2016 was caused by automation.",
              "That\u2019s mostly before the surge in the use of AI technologies.",
              "And Acemoglu worries that AI-based automation will make matters even worse.",
              "Early in the 20th century and during previous periods, shifts in technology typically produced more good new jobs than they destroyed, but that no longer seems to be the case.",
              "One reason is that companies are often choosing to deploy what he and his collaborator Pascual Restrepo call \u201cso-so technologies,\u201d which replace workers but do little to improve productivity or create new business opportunities.",
              "At the same time, businesses and researchers are largely ignoring the potential of AI technologies to expand the capabilities of workers while delivering better services.",
              "Acemoglu points to digital technologies that could allow nurses to diagnose illnesses more accurately or help teachers provide more personalized lessons to students.",
              "Government, AI scientists, and Big Tech are all guilty of making decisions that favor excessive automation, says Acemoglu.",
              "Federal tax policies favor machines.",
              "While human labor is heavily taxed, there is no payroll tax on robots or automation.",

              "\u201d To make such \u201ctremendous changes,\u201d she adds, you need social buy-in.",
              "Instead, says Coyle, resentment is simmering among many as the benefits are perceived to go to elites in a handful of prosperous cities.",
              "In the US, for instance, during much of the 20th century the various regions of the country were\u2014in the language of economists\u2014\u201cconverging,\u201d and financial disparities decreased.",
              "Then, in the 1980s, came the onslaught of digital technologies, and the trend reversed itself.",
              "Automation wiped out many manufacturing and retail jobs.",
              "New, well-paying tech jobs were clustered in a few cities.",
              "According to the Brookings Institution, a short list of eight American cities that included San Francisco, San Jose, Boston, and Seattle had roughly 38% of all tech jobs by 2019.",
              "New AI technologies are particularly concentrated: Brookings\u2019s Mark Muro and Sifan Liu estimate that just 15 cities account for two-thirds of the AI assets and capabilities in the United States (San Francisco and San Jose alone account for about one-quarter).",
              "The dominance of a few cities in the invention and commercialization of AI means that geographical disparities in wealth will continue to soar.",
              "Not only will this foster political and social unrest, but it could, as Coyle suggests, hold back the sorts of AI technologies needed for regional economies to grow.",
              "Part of the solution could lie in somehow loosening the stranglehold that Big Tech has on defining the AI agenda.",
              "That will likely take increased federal funding for research independent of the tech giants.",
              "Muro and others have suggested hefty federal funding to help create US regional innovation centers, for example.",
              "A more immediate response is to broaden our digital imaginations to conceive of AI technologies that don\u2019t simply replace jobs but expand opportunities in the sectors that different parts of the country care most about, like health care, education, and manufacturing.",
              "The fondnesss that AI and robotics researchers have for replicating the capabilities of humans often means trying to get a machine to do a task that\u2019s easy for people but daunting for the technology.",
              "Making a bed, for example, or an espresso.",
              "Or driving a car.",
              "Seeing an autonomous car navigate a city\u2019s street or a robot act as a barista is amazing.",
              "But too often, the people who develop and deploy these technologies don\u2019t give much thought to the potential impact on jobs and labor markets.",
              "Anton Korinek, an economist at the University of Virginia and a Rubenstein Fellow at Brookings, says the tens of billions of dollars that have gone into building autonomous cars will inevitably have a negative effect on labor markets once such vehicles are deployed, taking the jobs of countless drivers.",
              "What if, he asks, those billions had been invested in AI tools that would be more likely to expand labor opportunities?",
              "When applying for funding at places like the US National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, Korinek explains, \u201cno one asks, \u2018How will it affect labor markets?",
              "\u2019\u201d Katya Klinova, a policy expert at the Partnership on AI in San Francisco, is working on ways to get AI scientists to rethink the ways they measure success.",
              "\u201cWhen you look at AI research, and you look at the benchmarks that are used pretty much universally, they\u2019re all tied to matching or comparing to human performance,\u201d she says.",
              "That is, AI scientists grade their programs in, say, image recognition against how well a person can identify an object.",
              "Such benchmarks have driven the direction of the research, Klinova says.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that what has come out is automation and more powerful automation,\u201d she adds.",
              "\u201cBenchmarks are super important to AI developers\u2014especially for young scientists, who are entering en masse into AI and asking, \u2018What should I work on?",
              "\u2019\u201d But benchmarks for the performance of human-machine collaborations are lacking, says Klinova, though she has begun working to help create some.",
              "Collaborating with Korinek, she and her team at Partnership for AI are also writing a user guide for AI developers who have no background in economics to help them understand how workers might be affected by the research they are doing.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s about changing the narrative away from one where AI innovators are given a blank ticket to disrupt and then it\u2019s up to the society and government to deal with it,\u201d says Klinova.",

              "Several studies seem to suggest that deregulation raises overall market efficiency \u2013 for example, Jayaratne and Strahan (1996) who look at bank branching deregulation in the US, or Gerardi et al (2010) who consider the deregulation and securitisation in US credit markets in the early 1980s.",
              "However, Clemons and Weber (1990) find that the UK Big Bang deregulation was indeed followed by reduced transaction costs (lower trading fees and bid-ask spreads).",

              "Overall, the Big Bangs distinguish themselves not only due to the level or speed of deregulations, but also because of political ambition \u2013 these policies sought to move the focus of world finance to their metropolis.",
              "The ambitions for the London and Tokyo stock exchanges clearly show that the intentions of these policies were not just to catch up with the international standard of financial markets;",

              "Our main finding is that, compared to these synthetic control groups, the income shares of top earners increased substantially in both the UK and Japan as a result of the Big Bangs.",
              "Five years after the deregulation, the effect on the top decile was an increase of 20% in the UK and 15% in Japan, whereas the top percentile increased by almost 30% in the UK compared to 10% in Japan, as shown in Figures 1 and 2.",

              "Top income trends in Japan The synthetic controls we are able to create from this dataset match the pre-treatment trends well for Japan, but somewhat less so for the UK, where two pre-treatment divergences occur a few years before the deregulation.",
              "Hence, the point estimate for the British top 10% and 5% income groups should be read conservatively.",
              "However, in a number of sensitivity checks \u2013 for example, using different control variables when selecting synthetic controls, running \u2018placebo tests\u2019 on non-treated countries, and examining post-treatment developments \u2013 we find that our main results are robust in all these dimensions.",
              "We are able to do a more detailed study of where in the top distribution this increase occurs by splitting up the larger top income shares and re-calibrating synthetic controls for the specific populations between the 90th and 95th percentiles, the 95th to the 99th percentiles and the lower 9 thousandth of the top percentile in the income distribution.",
              "This specification, as shown in Figure 3, gives evidence of somewhat diverging patterns across the UK and Japan.",
              "Figure 3.",
              "Differences in deregulation effects across top income groups In the UK case, the deregulation impact documented for the top decile is accounted for almost totally by the top 5 percentiles, whereas the bottom half of the top decile did not change much.",
              "Splitting up the top 5, in turn, shows that the top percentile and the next 4 percentiles stand for almost equal amounts of the total income share rise.",
              "In Japan, both halves of the top decile benefit from deregulation, and the majority of the top 5 percentile\u2019s increased share can be attributed to the group below the top percentile.",

              "Our finding of an over 15% increase in the top decile earnings confirm that financial deregulation has a large impact on the aggregate share of top income earnings, also outside of the US.",
