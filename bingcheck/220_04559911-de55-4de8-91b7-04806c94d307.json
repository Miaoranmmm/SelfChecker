It can have negative impacts on your personal, school, or work lives, such as causing stress, anxiety, poor performance, and low self-esteem[^1^].\n\nThere are different types of procrastination based on the main perceived issue causing the behavior, such as perfectionism, fear of change, lack of motivation, poor time management, or unrealistic expectations[^1^].\n\nAccording to various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^], some of the most effective and scientifically-proven methods for overcoming procrastination are:\n\n- Identifying the role of procrastination in your life and how it affects your goals and well-being\n- Dealing with your fear of failure, success, or making mistakes by challenging your faulty beliefs and embracing imperfection\n- Focusing on your \"why\" or the purpose and benefits of completing the task\n- Breaking up large projects into smaller and manageable tasks with clear deadlines and rewards\n- Making a list of things you need to do and prioritizing them according to their importance and urgency\n- Getting rid of distractions and creating a conducive environment for work\n- Getting started on the task even if you don't feel like it or don't have all the information\n- Seeking help or support from others when you feel stuck or overwhelmed\n- Using positive self-talk and affirmations to boost your confidence and motivation\n- Tracking your progress and celebrating your achievements\n- Forgiving yourself for past procrastination and learning from your mistakes\n\nTo implement these strategies in your daily life, you can use various tools and techniques such as:\n\n- A planner or calendar to schedule your tasks and deadlines\n- A timer or app to set work and break intervals (such as the Pomodoro technique)\n- A journal or app to record your thoughts, feelings, and actions related to procrastination\n- A buddy or coach to hold you accountable and provide feedback\n- A course or book to learn more about procrastination and how to overcome it\n\nI hope this helps you improve your productivity and well-being.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "What is particularly important as a take-away message is how our focus must change during our goal pursuit, and this change in focus must be strategic.",
              "At times, particularly in the early stages of a project or for long-term goals, we need a process focus to build confidence through frequent rewards, reducing the effects of temporal discounting by taking the focus off of the distal outcome, and reducing fear of failure that may result when we look at how far we have yet to go.",
              "At the same time, an outcome focus is required when the task at hand is particularly aversive \u2013when our visceral reaction is \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d \u2013 so that the importance of the goal or the consequences of not finishing might offset the desire to procrastinate to cope.",

              "For a lot of people acquiring this insight about how procrastination protects them from feeling like they are not able enough, and keeping it in mind when they are tempted to fall into familiar, unproductive, procrastinating habits goes a long way to solving the problem.",
              "For instance, two psychologists, Jane Burka and Lenora Yuen, who have helped many people overcome procrastination, report in their article, \"Mind Games Procrastinators Play\" (Psychology Today, January, 1982), that for many students \"understanding the hidden roots of procrastination often seems to weaken them\" (p.",

              "There are some time management techniques that are well suited to overcoming procrastination and others that can make it worse.",
              "Those that reduce anxiety and fear and emphasize the satisfaction and rewards of completing tasks work best.",
              "Those that arc inflexible, emphasize the magnitude of tasks and increase anxiety can actually increase procrastination and are thus counter-productive.",
              "For instance, making a huge list of \"things to do\" or scheduling every minute of your day may INCREASE your stress and thus procrastination.",

              "By productive reasons I mean reasons for learning and achieving that lead to positive, productive, satisfying feelings and actions.",
              "These reasons are in contrast to engaging in a task out of fear of failing, or not making your parents angry, or not looking stupid, or doing better than other people to \"show off.\"",
              "While these are all reasons - often very powerful ones - for doing something, they are not productive since they evoke maladaptive, often negative feelings and actions.",
              "For example, if you are concerned with not looking dumb you may not ask questions, delve into new areas, try new methods, or take the risks necessary to learn new things and reach new heights.",

              "Other people's goals for you are not goals at all, but obligations.",
              "Another key to overcoming procrastination is to stay actively engaged in your classes.",
              "If you are passive in class you're probably not \"getting into\" the course and its topics, and that weakens your motivation.",
              "What's more, if you are passive you are probably not making as much sense out of the course and course materials as you could.",
              "Nonsense and confusion are not engaging;",
              "in fact, they are boring and frustrating.",

              "Instead, try (1) seeking out what is interesting and relevant to you in the course materials, (2) setting your own purpose for every reading and class session, and (3) asking yourself (and others) questions about what you are learning.",

              "After categorizing your tasks by priority (as M, C, and W or A, B, and C), you can begin sequencing the tasks in order of how you plan to complete them, keeping in mind any task dependencies that might impact that order.",
