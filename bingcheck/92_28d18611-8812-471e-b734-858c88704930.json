    "response": "That's a great question. The \"I Have a Dream\" speech delivered by Martin Luther King Jr. was inspired by several sources, including his own personal experiences, his faith, his vision for racial justice, and his previous speeches. According to some of his aides and speechwriters[^1^] [^2^], King had used the phrase \"I have a dream\" several times before in other speeches, but it was not part of the original draft for the March on Washington speech. In fact, one of his advisers, Wyatt Walker, told him not to use it because it was \"trite\" and \"cliche\"[^1^]. However, King decided to improvise and include the phrase after he was encouraged by gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, who shouted from behind him: \"Tell them about the dream, Martin!\"[^2^]. King then departed from his prepared text and delivered one of the most memorable and powerful speeches in history[^3^] [^4^] [^5^], using the phrase \"I have a dream\" as a refrain to express his hopes for a future of racial harmony and equality. The speech was widely praised and considered a turning point in the civil rights movement. It also helped secure the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964[^4^].",

              "28, 1963 during the \u201cMarch on Washington.",
              "\u201d The speech was televised live to an audience of millions.",
              "\u201cHe was not just speaking to African Americans, but to all Americans\u201d ~ Leroy Dorsey Dorsey, associate dean for inclusive excellence and strategic initiatives in the College of Liberal Arts, said one of the reasons the speech stands above all of King\u2019s other speeches \u2013 and nearly every other speech ever written \u2013 is because its themes are timeless.",
              "\u201cIt addresses issues that American culture has faced from the beginning of its existence and still faces today: discrimination, broken promises, and the need to believe that things will be better,\u201d he said.",
              "Powerful Use of Rhetorical Devices Dorsey said the speech is also notable for its use of several rhetorical traditions, namely the Jeremiad, metaphor-use and repetition.",
              "The Jeremiad is a form of early American sermon that narratively moved audiences from recognizing the moral standard set in its past to a damning critique of current events to the need to embrace higher virtues.",
              "\u201cKing does that with his invocation of several \u2018holy\u2019 American documents such as the Emancipation Proclamation and Declaration of Independence as the markers of what America is supposed to be,\u201d Dorsey said.",
              "\u201cThen he moves to the broken promises in the form of injustice and violence.",
              "And he then moves to a realization that people need to look to one another\u2019s character and not their skin color for true progress to be made.",

              "\u201cMetaphors can be used to connect an unknown or confusing idea to a known idea for the audience to better understand,\u201d he said.",
              "For example, referring to founding U.",
              "S.",
              "documents as \u201cbad checks\u201d transformed what could have been a complex political treatise into the simpler ideas that the government had broken promises to the American people and that this was not consistent with the promise of equal rights.",
              "The third rhetorical device found in the speech, repetition, is used while juxtaposing contrasting ideas, setting up a rhythm and cadence that keeps the audience engaged and thoughtful, Dorsey said.",
              "\u201cI have a dream\u201d is repeated while contrasting \u201csons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners\u201d and \u201cjudged by the content of their character\u201d instead of \u201cjudged by the color of their skin.",
              "\u201d The device was used also with \u201clet freedom ring\u201d which juxtaposes states that were culturally polar opposites \u2013 Colorado, California and New York vs. Georgia, Tennessee and Mississippi.",
              "Words That Moved A Movement The March on Washington and King\u2019s speech are widely considered turning points in the Civil Rights Movement, shifting the demand and demonstrations for racial equality that had mostly occurred in the South to a national stage.",
              "Dorsey said the speech advanced and solidified the movement because \u201cit became the perfect response to a turbulent moment as it tried to address past hurts, current indifference and potential violence, acting as a pivot point between the Kennedy administration\u2019s slow response and the urgent response of the \u2018marvelous new militancy\u2019 [those fighting against racism].",
              "\u201d What made King such an outstanding orator were the communication skills he used to stir audience passion, Dorsey said.",
              "\u201cWhen you watch the speech, halfway through he stops reading and becomes a pastor, urging his flock to do the right thing,\u201d he said.",
              "\u201cThe cadence, power and call to the better nature of his audience reminds you of a religious service.",

              "\u201cHe was not just speaking to African Americans in that speech, but to all Americans, because he understood that the country would more easily rise together when it worked together,\u201d he said.",

              "They were marching for several reasons, including jobs (many of them were out of work), but the main reason was freedom: King and many other Civil Rights leaders sought to remove segregation of black and white Americans and to ensure black Americans were treated the same as white Americans.",
              "1963 was the centenary of the Emancipation Proclamation, in which then US President Abraham Lincoln (1809-65) had freed the African slaves in the United States in 1863.",
              "But a century on from the abolition of slavery, King points out, black Americans still are not free in many respects.",
              "\u2018I Have a Dream\u2019: summary King begins his speech by reminding his audience that it\u2019s a century, or \u2018five score years\u2019, since that \u2018great American\u2019 Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.",
              "This ensured the freedom of the African slaves, but Black Americans are still not free, King points out, because of racial segregation and discrimination.",
              "America is a wealthy country, and yet many Black Americans live in poverty.",
              "It is as if the Black American is an exile in his own land.",
              "King likens the gathering in Washington to cashing a cheque: in other words, claiming money that is due to be paid.",
              "Next, King praises the \u2018magnificent words\u2019 of the US Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.",
              "King compares these documents to a promissory note, because they contain the promise that all men, including Black men, will be guaranteed what the Declaration of Independence calls \u2018inalienable rights\u2019: namely, \u2018life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u2019.",
              "King asserts that America in the 1960s has \u2018defaulted\u2019 on this promissory note: in other words, it has refused to pay up.",
              "King calls it a \u2018sacred obligation\u2019, but America as a nation is like someone who has written someone else a cheque that has bounced and the money owed remains to be paid.",
              "But it is not because the money isn\u2019t there: America, being a land of opportunity, has enough \u2018funds\u2019 to ensure everyone is prosperous enough.",
              "King urges America to rise out of the \u2018valley\u2019 of segregation to the \u2018sunlit path of racial justice\u2019.",
              "He uses the word \u2018brotherhood\u2019 to refer to all Americans, since all men and women are God\u2019s children.",
              "He also repeatedly emphasises the urgency of the moment.",
              "This is not some brief moment of anger but a necessary new start for America.",
              "However, King cautions his audience not to give way to bitterness and hatred, but to fight for justice in the right manner, with dignity and discipline.",
              "Physical violence and militancy are to be avoided.",
              "King recognises that many white Americans who are also poor and marginalised feel a kinship with the Civil Rights movement, so all Americans should join together in the cause.",
              "Police brutality against Black Americans must be eradicated, as must racial discrimination in hotels and restaurants.",
              "States which forbid Black Americans from voting must change their laws.",
              "Martin Luther King then comes to the most famous part of his speech, in which he uses the phrase \u2018I have a dream\u2019 to begin successive sentences (a rhetorical device known as anaphora).",
              "King outlines the form that his dream, or ambition or wish for a better America, takes.",
              "His dream, he tells his audience, is \u2018deeply rooted\u2019 in the American Dream: that notion that anybody, regardless of their background, can become prosperous and successful in the United States.",
              "King once again reminds his listeners of the opening words of the Declaration of Independence: \u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.",
              "\u2019 In his dream of a better future, King sees the descendants of former Black slaves and the descendants of former slave owners united, sitting and eating together.",
              "He has a dream that one day his children will live in a country where they are judged not by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character.",
              "Even in Mississippi and Alabama, states which are riven by racial injustice and hatred, people of all races will live together in harmony.",
              "King then broadens his dream out into \u2018our hope\u2019: a collective aspiration and endeavour.",
              "King then quotes the patriotic American song \u2018My Country, \u2019Tis of Thee\u2019, which describes America as a \u2018sweet land of liberty\u2019.",
              "King uses anaphora again, repeating the phrase \u2018let freedom ring\u2019 several times in succession to suggest how jubilant America will be on the day that such freedoms are ensured.",
              "And when this happens, Americans will be able to join together and be closer to the day when they can sing a traditional African-American hymn: \u2018Free at last.",
              "Free at last.",
              "Thank God almighty, we are free at last.",
              "\u2019 \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019: analysis Although Martin Luther King\u2019s speech has become known by the repeated four-word phrase \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019, which emphasises the personal nature of his vision, his speech is actually about a collective dream for a better and more equal America which is not only shared by many Black Americans but by anyone who identifies with their fight against racial injustice, segregation, and discrimination.",
              "Nevertheless, in working from \u2018I have a dream\u2019 to a different four-word phrase, \u2018this is our hope\u2019.",
              "The shift is natural and yet it is a rhetorical masterstroke, since the vision of a better nation which King has set out as a very personal, sincere dream is thus telescoped into a universal and collective struggle for freedom.",
              "What\u2019s more, in moving from \u2018dream\u2019 to a different noun, \u2018hope\u2019, King suggests that what might be dismissed as an idealistic ambition is actually something that is both possible and achievable.",
              "No sooner has the dream gathered momentum than it becomes a more concrete \u2018hope\u2019.",
              "In his \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019 speech, King was doing more than alluding to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s signing of the Emancipation Proclamation one hundred years earlier.",
              "The opening words to his speech, \u2018Five score years ago\u2019, allude to a specific speech Lincoln himself had made a century before: the Gettysburg Address.",
              "In that speech, delivered at the Soldiers\u2019 National Cemetery (now known as Gettysburg National Cemetery) in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in November 1863, Lincoln had urged his listeners to continue in the fight for freedom, envisioning the day when all Americans \u2013 including Black slaves \u2013 would be free.",
              "His speech famously begins with the words: \u2018Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.",
              "\u2019 \u2018Four score and seven years\u2019 is eighty-seven years, which takes us back from 1863 to 1776, the year of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
              "So, Martin Luther King\u2019s allusion to the words of Lincoln\u2019s historic speech do two things: they call back to Lincoln\u2019s speech but also, by extension, to the founding of the United States almost two centuries before.",
              "Although Lincoln and the American Civil War represented progress in the cause to make all Americans free regardless of their ethnicity, King makes it clear in \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019 that there is still some way to go.",
              "In the last analysis, King\u2019s speech is a rhetorically clever and emotionally powerful call to use non-violent protest to oppose racial injustice, segregation, and discrimination, but also to ensure that all Americans are lifted out of poverty and degradation.",
              "But most of all, King emphasises the collective endeavour that is necessary to bring about the world he wants his children to live in: the togetherness, the linking of hands, which is essential to make the dream a reality.",

              "She had recorded several versions of the song, but they were relatively tame compared to the heights she could reach in front of a congregation.",
              "Now, in the minutes before King was to speak, it was once again Holy Ghost time \u2013 the type of performance where Jackson surrendered not just her voice but her body to the moment, bending and twisting her robust frame as she reached for the notes.",

              "Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Odetta, the Freedom Singers and Marian Anderson also had performed, but it was Jackson who seized the day with a song that had particularly deep resonance in the African-American community.",

              "s \"I Have a Dream\" speech affected Americans most of all.",
              "His goading of a nation to live up to the democratic principles of its founders was a sharp display of America's private grief.",
              "The wrongs he set out to right were internal and shaming - American sins that stretched back to the days of slavery.",
              "When he rose to speak, King was clearly aiming his remarks at his fellow Americans.",
              "But King's dignified appeal to the better nature of his countrymen had a resonance far wider than just the United States.",
              "When he addressed what he called \"the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation,\" he would inadvertently set off a worldwide movement for racial emancipation.",
              "Tangible evidence of the long march he set off on 50 years ago can be found in the endless roads and civic facilities around the world to which the name Martin Luther King has been appended - celebrating the American civil rights leader's universal cry for a more generous and humane world.",
              "Africans found a particularly poignant message in King's plea for racial tolerance and his declaration that \"the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.\"",
              "It is no surprise that there is a Martin Luther King Road in Lusaka, Zambia, and a Martin Luther King Street in Mpumalanga, South Africa.",
              "King's appeal to the goodness in Americans and the struggle for black liberation in South Africa led by Nelson Mandela were made of the same cloth.",
              "King's insistence on non-violence stemmed from his devotion to the ideas of pacifist civil disobedience preached by Mahatma Gandhi as a means to throw off British rule in India.",
              "The link between the two strands of dignified, peaceful, powerful dissent can be found celebrated all over India, as in the naming of Martin Luther King Sarani, or Street, in the fancy Park Street area of Calcutta.",
              "Harder to fathom, perhaps, is the plethora of Martin Luther King public monuments in France, places like Parc Martin Luther King in the tony Parisian neighborhood of Batignolles, once the home of the Impressionist painter E\u0301douard Manet, and the Colle\u0300ge Martin Luther King in Villiers-le-Bel.",
              "King could not have imagined how readily his name would be commandeered by liberal white politicians to boast the impeccability of their progressive credentials.",
              "How else to explain the Martin Luther King Adventure Playground in Islington, North London?",
              "The power of King's message 50 years ago can be seen in the way the BBC in London is celebrating what most Americans think of as a purely domestic event.",
              "The British national broadcaster has distilled the essence of King's lasting appeal with a broadcast that has recruited dissident world leaders, peacemakers and protesters to each read aloud a part of King's speech a more earnest iteration of the \"We Are The World\" format previously used by pop musicians to raise money for disaster relief.",

              "Spoken in tones of hushed deliberation, in barely 1,600 words, King dared the racists to diminish the meaning and importance of his message.",
              "He pitched his appeal for tolerance and fairness by stressing the historical dimensions of the eternal grievances of African-Americans left unrectified by the Civil War.",
              "By stressing that \"1963 is not an end but a beginning,\" however, he understood that equally important to the meaning of the words he chose was the age in which they were spoken.",

              "They were marching for several reasons, including jobs (many of them were out of work), but the main reason was freedom: King and many other Civil Rights leaders sought to remove segregation of black and white Americans and to ensure black Americans were treated the same as white Americans.",
              "1963 was the centenary of the Emancipation Proclamation, in which then US President Abraham Lincoln (1809-65) had freed the African slaves in the United States in 1863.",
              "But a century on from the abolition of slavery, King points out, black Americans still are not free in many respects.",
              "\u2018I Have a Dream\u2019: summary King begins his speech by reminding his audience that it\u2019s a century, or \u2018five score years\u2019, since that \u2018great American\u2019 Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.",
              "This ensured the freedom of the African slaves, but Black Americans are still not free, King points out, because of racial segregation and discrimination.",
              "America is a wealthy country, and yet many Black Americans live in poverty.",
              "It is as if the Black American is an exile in his own land.",
              "King likens the gathering in Washington to cashing a cheque: in other words, claiming money that is due to be paid.",
              "Next, King praises the \u2018magnificent words\u2019 of the US Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.",
              "King compares these documents to a promissory note, because they contain the promise that all men, including Black men, will be guaranteed what the Declaration of Independence calls \u2018inalienable rights\u2019: namely, \u2018life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u2019.",
              "King asserts that America in the 1960s has \u2018defaulted\u2019 on this promissory note: in other words, it has refused to pay up.",
              "King calls it a \u2018sacred obligation\u2019, but America as a nation is like someone who has written someone else a cheque that has bounced and the money owed remains to be paid.",
              "But it is not because the money isn\u2019t there: America, being a land of opportunity, has enough \u2018funds\u2019 to ensure everyone is prosperous enough.",
              "King urges America to rise out of the \u2018valley\u2019 of segregation to the \u2018sunlit path of racial justice\u2019.",
              "He uses the word \u2018brotherhood\u2019 to refer to all Americans, since all men and women are God\u2019s children.",

              "Physical violence and militancy are to be avoided.",
              "King recognises that many white Americans who are also poor and marginalised feel a kinship with the Civil Rights movement, so all Americans should join together in the cause.",
              "Police brutality against Black Americans must be eradicated, as must racial discrimination in hotels and restaurants.",
              "States which forbid Black Americans from voting must change their laws.",
              "Martin Luther King then comes to the most famous part of his speech, in which he uses the phrase \u2018I have a dream\u2019 to begin successive sentences (a rhetorical device known as anaphora).",
              "King outlines the form that his dream, or ambition or wish for a better America, takes.",
              "His dream, he tells his audience, is \u2018deeply rooted\u2019 in the American Dream: that notion that anybody, regardless of their background, can become prosperous and successful in the United States.",
              "King once again reminds his listeners of the opening words of the Declaration of Independence: \u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.",
              "\u2019 In his dream of a better future, King sees the descendants of former Black slaves and the descendants of former slave owners united, sitting and eating together.",

              "Even in Mississippi and Alabama, states which are riven by racial injustice and hatred, people of all races will live together in harmony.",
              "King then broadens his dream out into \u2018our hope\u2019: a collective aspiration and endeavour.",

              "The shift is natural and yet it is a rhetorical masterstroke, since the vision of a better nation which King has set out as a very personal, sincere dream is thus telescoped into a universal and collective struggle for freedom.",
              "What\u2019s more, in moving from \u2018dream\u2019 to a different noun, \u2018hope\u2019, King suggests that what might be dismissed as an idealistic ambition is actually something that is both possible and achievable.",

              "In his \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019 speech, King was doing more than alluding to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s signing of the Emancipation Proclamation one hundred years earlier.",
              "The opening words to his speech, \u2018Five score years ago\u2019, allude to a specific speech Lincoln himself had made a century before: the Gettysburg Address.",
              "In that speech, delivered at the Soldiers\u2019 National Cemetery (now known as Gettysburg National Cemetery) in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in November 1863, Lincoln had urged his listeners to continue in the fight for freedom, envisioning the day when all Americans \u2013 including Black slaves \u2013 would be free.",

              "C.",
              "in 1963, the speech is a powerful rallying cry for racial equality and for a fairer and equal world in which African Americans will be as free as white Americans.",
              "If you\u2019ve ever stayed up till the small hours working on a presentation you\u2019re due to give the next day, tearing your hair out as you try to find the right words, you can take solace in the fact that as great an orator as Martin Luther King did the same with one of the most memorable speeches ever delivered.",
              "He reportedly stayed up until 4am the night before he was due to give his \u2018I Have a Dream\u2019, writing it out in longhand.",
              "You can read the speech in full here.",
              "\u2018I Have a Dream\u2019: background The occasion for King\u2019s speech was the march on Washington, which saw some 210,000 African American men, women, and children gather at the Washington Monument in August 1963, before marching to the Lincoln Memorial.",
              "They were marching for several reasons, including jobs (many of them were out of work), but the main reason was freedom: King and many other Civil Rights leaders sought to remove segregation of black and white Americans and to ensure black Americans were treated the same as white Americans.",
              "1963 was the centenary of the Emancipation Proclamation, in which then US President Abraham Lincoln (1809-65) had freed the African slaves in the United States in 1863.",
              "But a century on from the abolition of slavery, King points out, black Americans still are not free in many respects.",
              "\u2018I Have a Dream\u2019: summary King begins his speech by reminding his audience that it\u2019s a century, or \u2018five score years\u2019, since that \u2018great American\u2019 Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.",
              "This ensured the freedom of the African slaves, but Black Americans are still not free, King points out, because of racial segregation and discrimination.",
              "America is a wealthy country, and yet many Black Americans live in poverty.",
              "It is as if the Black American is an exile in his own land.",
              "King likens the gathering in Washington to cashing a cheque: in other words, claiming money that is due to be paid.",
              "Next, King praises the \u2018magnificent words\u2019 of the US Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.",
              "King compares these documents to a promissory note, because they contain the promise that all men, including Black men, will be guaranteed what the Declaration of Independence calls \u2018inalienable rights\u2019: namely, \u2018life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u2019.",
              "King asserts that America in the 1960s has \u2018defaulted\u2019 on this promissory note: in other words, it has refused to pay up.",
              "King calls it a \u2018sacred obligation\u2019, but America as a nation is like someone who has written someone else a cheque that has bounced and the money owed remains to be paid.",
              "But it is not because the money isn\u2019t there: America, being a land of opportunity, has enough \u2018funds\u2019 to ensure everyone is prosperous enough.",
              "King urges America to rise out of the \u2018valley\u2019 of segregation to the \u2018sunlit path of racial justice\u2019.",
              "He uses the word \u2018brotherhood\u2019 to refer to all Americans, since all men and women are God\u2019s children.",
              "He also repeatedly emphasises the urgency of the moment.",
              "This is not some brief moment of anger but a necessary new start for America.",
              "However, King cautions his audience not to give way to bitterness and hatred, but to fight for justice in the right manner, with dignity and discipline.",
              "Physical violence and militancy are to be avoided.",
              "King recognises that many white Americans who are also poor and marginalised feel a kinship with the Civil Rights movement, so all Americans should join together in the cause.",
              "Police brutality against Black Americans must be eradicated, as must racial discrimination in hotels and restaurants.",
              "States which forbid Black Americans from voting must change their laws.",
              "Martin Luther King then comes to the most famous part of his speech, in which he uses the phrase \u2018I have a dream\u2019 to begin successive sentences (a rhetorical device known as anaphora).",
              "King outlines the form that his dream, or ambition or wish for a better America, takes.",
              "His dream, he tells his audience, is \u2018deeply rooted\u2019 in the American Dream: that notion that anybody, regardless of their background, can become prosperous and successful in the United States.",
              "King once again reminds his listeners of the opening words of the Declaration of Independence: \u2018We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.",
              "\u2019 In his dream of a better future, King sees the descendants of former Black slaves and the descendants of former slave owners united, sitting and eating together.",
              "He has a dream that one day his children will live in a country where they are judged not by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character.",
              "Even in Mississippi and Alabama, states which are riven by racial injustice and hatred, people of all races will live together in harmony.",
              "King then broadens his dream out into \u2018our hope\u2019: a collective aspiration and endeavour.",
              "King then quotes the patriotic American song \u2018My Country, \u2019Tis of Thee\u2019, which describes America as a \u2018sweet land of liberty\u2019.",
              "King uses anaphora again, repeating the phrase \u2018let freedom ring\u2019 several times in succession to suggest how jubilant America will be on the day that such freedoms are ensured.",
              "And when this happens, Americans will be able to join together and be closer to the day when they can sing a traditional African-American hymn: \u2018Free at last.",

              "28, 1963 during the \u201cMarch on Washington.",
              "\u201d The speech was televised live to an audience of millions.",
              "\u201cHe was not just speaking to African Americans, but to all Americans\u201d ~ Leroy Dorsey Dorsey, associate dean for inclusive excellence and strategic initiatives in the College of Liberal Arts, said one of the reasons the speech stands above all of King\u2019s other speeches \u2013 and nearly every other speech ever written \u2013 is because its themes are timeless.",
              "\u201cIt addresses issues that American culture has faced from the beginning of its existence and still faces today: discrimination, broken promises, and the need to believe that things will be better,\u201d he said.",
              "Powerful Use of Rhetorical Devices Dorsey said the speech is also notable for its use of several rhetorical traditions, namely the Jeremiad, metaphor-use and repetition.",
              "The Jeremiad is a form of early American sermon that narratively moved audiences from recognizing the moral standard set in its past to a damning critique of current events to the need to embrace higher virtues.",
              "\u201cKing does that with his invocation of several \u2018holy\u2019 American documents such as the Emancipation Proclamation and Declaration of Independence as the markers of what America is supposed to be,\u201d Dorsey said.",
              "\u201cThen he moves to the broken promises in the form of injustice and violence.",
              "And he then moves to a realization that people need to look to one another\u2019s character and not their skin color for true progress to be made.",

              "S.",
              "documents as \u201cbad checks\u201d transformed what could have been a complex political treatise into the simpler ideas that the government had broken promises to the American people and that this was not consistent with the promise of equal rights.",
              "The third rhetorical device found in the speech, repetition, is used while juxtaposing contrasting ideas, setting up a rhythm and cadence that keeps the audience engaged and thoughtful, Dorsey said.",
              "\u201cI have a dream\u201d is repeated while contrasting \u201csons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners\u201d and \u201cjudged by the content of their character\u201d instead of \u201cjudged by the color of their skin.",
              "\u201d The device was used also with \u201clet freedom ring\u201d which juxtaposes states that were culturally polar opposites \u2013 Colorado, California and New York vs. Georgia, Tennessee and Mississippi.",
              "Words That Moved A Movement The March on Washington and King\u2019s speech are widely considered turning points in the Civil Rights Movement, shifting the demand and demonstrations for racial equality that had mostly occurred in the South to a national stage.",
              "Dorsey said the speech advanced and solidified the movement because \u201cit became the perfect response to a turbulent moment as it tried to address past hurts, current indifference and potential violence, acting as a pivot point between the Kennedy administration\u2019s slow response and the urgent response of the \u2018marvelous new militancy\u2019 [those fighting against racism].",

              "\u201cHe was not just speaking to African Americans in that speech, but to all Americans, because he understood that the country would more easily rise together when it worked together,\u201d he said.",

              "By Nicholas Wapshott Aug 28 (Reuters) - It would be easy to assume that the stirring words of Martin Luther King Jr.'",
              "s \"I Have a Dream\" speech affected Americans most of all.",
              "His goading of a nation to live up to the democratic principles of its founders was a sharp display of America's private grief.",
              "The wrongs he set out to right were internal and shaming - American sins that stretched back to the days of slavery.",
              "When he rose to speak, King was clearly aiming his remarks at his fellow Americans.",
              "But King's dignified appeal to the better nature of his countrymen had a resonance far wider than just the United States.",
              "When he addressed what he called \"the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation,\" he would inadvertently set off a worldwide movement for racial emancipation.",
              "Tangible evidence of the long march he set off on 50 years ago can be found in the endless roads and civic facilities around the world to which the name Martin Luther King has been appended - celebrating the American civil rights leader's universal cry for a more generous and humane world.",
              "Africans found a particularly poignant message in King's plea for racial tolerance and his declaration that \"the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.\"",
              "It is no surprise that there is a Martin Luther King Road in Lusaka, Zambia, and a Martin Luther King Street in Mpumalanga, South Africa.",
              "King's appeal to the goodness in Americans and the struggle for black liberation in South Africa led by Nelson Mandela were made of the same cloth.",
              "King's insistence on non-violence stemmed from his devotion to the ideas of pacifist civil disobedience preached by Mahatma Gandhi as a means to throw off British rule in India.",
              "The link between the two strands of dignified, peaceful, powerful dissent can be found celebrated all over India, as in the naming of Martin Luther King Sarani, or Street, in the fancy Park Street area of Calcutta.",
              "Harder to fathom, perhaps, is the plethora of Martin Luther King public monuments in France, places like Parc Martin Luther King in the tony Parisian neighborhood of Batignolles, once the home of the Impressionist painter E\u0301douard Manet, and the Colle\u0300ge Martin Luther King in Villiers-le-Bel.",
              "King could not have imagined how readily his name would be commandeered by liberal white politicians to boast the impeccability of their progressive credentials.",
              "How else to explain the Martin Luther King Adventure Playground in Islington, North London?",
              "The power of King's message 50 years ago can be seen in the way the BBC in London is celebrating what most Americans think of as a purely domestic event.",
              "The British national broadcaster has distilled the essence of King's lasting appeal with a broadcast that has recruited dissident world leaders, peacemakers and protesters to each read aloud a part of King's speech a more earnest iteration of the \"We Are The World\" format previously used by pop musicians to raise money for disaster relief.",
              "It will be heard by the BBC's audience of 239 million worldwide.",

              "He pitched his appeal for tolerance and fairness by stressing the historical dimensions of the eternal grievances of African-Americans left unrectified by the Civil War.",
              "By stressing that \"1963 is not an end but a beginning,\" however, he understood that equally important to the meaning of the words he chose was the age in which they were spoken.",

              "Dorsey said the speech advanced and solidified the movement because \u201cit became the perfect response to a turbulent moment as it tried to address past hurts, current indifference and potential violence, acting as a pivot point between the Kennedy administration\u2019s slow response and the urgent response of the \u2018marvelous new militancy\u2019 [those fighting against racism].",
              "\u201d What made King such an outstanding orator were the communication skills he used to stir audience passion, Dorsey said.",
