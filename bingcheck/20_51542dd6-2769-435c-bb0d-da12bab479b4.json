    "response": "That's a very interesting question. According to the search results, there are different ways to measure the size of an organism, such as mass, volume, area, length, height, or genome size. Depending on the criteria, different organisms can claim the title of the largest living organism on Earth.\n\nOne possible candidate is the **aspen tree** whose colonies of clones can grow up to **8 kilometres (5 mi) long** and weigh **13 million pounds**. The largest such colony is **Pando**, in the Fishlake National Forest in Utah[^2^] [^1^]. It is also considered to be one of the oldest living organisms on Earth, with an estimated age of at least **14,000 years**[^2^].\n\nAnother possible candidate is a type of **fungus** called **Armillaria ostoyae**, which grows underground and forms a network of mycelia that can infect and kill trees. One specimen in Malheur National Forest in Oregon covers **3.7 square miles (2,400 acres; 9.6 km 2)** and is colloquially called the \"**Humongous Fungus**\"[^4^]. It is also estimated to be around **2,400 years old**[^1^].\n\nA third possible candidate is a giant marine plant of the genus **Posidonia**, which forms seagrass meadows that can spread over large areas and have a long lifespan. One such plant, **Posidonia oceanica**, discovered in the Mediterranean near the Balearic Islands, Spain, may be the oldest living organism in the world, with an estimated age of **100,000 years**[^2^] . It also covers an area of about **200 km 2 (77 sq mi)**[^2^].\n\nSo, depending on how you define size, any of these organisms could be considered the largest living organism on Earth. They are all amazing examples of nature's diversity and resilience.",

              "Pando (Latin for \"I spread\")[1] is a clonal organism representing an individual male quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) that spans 106 acres and is both the largest tree by weight and the largest tree by landmass, and is also the largest known aspen clone.",
              "Pando was identified as a single living organism because each of its stems possess identical genetic markers.",
              "[2] Each of its estimated 47,000 stems (ramets) are generally connected by a massive interconnected root system that coordinates energy production, defense and regeneration across its expanse.",
              "[3] Located in the Fremont River Ranger District of the Fishlake National Forest along the transition zone between of the Colorado Plateau and Basin and Range[4] in south-central Utah, United States, Pando lives 0.",
              "43 miles west of Fish Lake, the largest natural mountain freshwater lake in Utah.",
              "[5] Pando occupies approximately 106 acres (43 ha) and is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000 tonnes (6,000,000 kg),[6] or 13.",
              "2 million pounds, making it the heaviest known organism.",
              "[7][8] While the terms \"organism\" or \"plant\" have been used to describe the superlative quality of the tree, Pando is an aspen clone, and colloquially, tree lovers simply call the botanical wonder the \"Pando Tree\".",
              "While the General Sherman Tree is the largest single stem tree, systems of classification to define the largest trees vary considerably, leading to some confusion about Pando's status in the tree world.",
              "For example, within the United States, the Official Register of Champion Trees defines the largest trees in a species specific way, in that case, Pando is the largest aspen tree (Populus tremuloides).",
              "In forestry, the largest trees are measured by the greatest volume of a single stem, regardless of species.",
              "No large tree classification exists today to qualify Pando's size as it is the largest aspen clone, largest tree by weight and land mass combined.",
              "While many emphasize that Pando is the largest clonal organism, Redwoods also can reproduce via cloning.",
              "In addition, many non-plants vie for that distinction.",
              "Some have stated Pando is the largest plant, however that distinction is owed to a sea grass colony in the South Pacific, Posidonia australis.",
              "A recent discovery whose scale of operation was only verified in 2008, little is known about Pando's origins and how its genetic integrity has been sustained over such a long time (between 9,000 and 12,000 years).",
              "Researchers have argued that Pando\u2019s future is also uncertain due to a combination of factors including drought, grazing, and fire suppression.",
              "[9][10] Today, Friends of Pando,[11] in partnership with independent scientists, community leaders, and the United States Forest Service work together to study, monitor and protect the tree .",
              "Other organizations that study and work to study and protect Pando include Western Aspen Alliance[12] and Grand Canyon Trust[13] in the private sector, and the Utah Department of Wildlife Resources[14] in the governmental sector.",
              "The Pando tree was identified in 1976 by Jerry Kemperman and Burton Barnes.",
              "[15][16] In a posthumous biography by Burton Barnes' colleague, Daniel Kashian details the tree's discovery: As a part of his aspen work in the West, Burt began to examine an extremely large trembling aspen clone southwest of Fish Lake, Utah, in the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
              "Using aerial photography and the same morphological differentiation techniques he developed for aspen at UMBS for his dissertation, Burt concluded that the aspen forest that covered about 106 acres was a single aspen clone, quite possibly the \u201cworld\u2019s largest organism.",
              "\u201d Other than a single publication about aspen clone size and another great story to tell his students, Burt\u2019s studies on the Fish Lake clone were relatively obscure.",
              "Work by Fishlake National Forest to understand and protect the tree began in 1987, according to interviews and articles written by Fishlake Forest as well as accounts gathered by Friends of Pando.",
              "[17] Based off of Barnes and Kempermans's 1976 paper, Michael Grant, Jeffrey Mitton, and Yan Linhart of the University of Colorado at Boulder re-examined the clone in 1992, naming it \"Pando\" and claiming it to be the world's largest organism by weight.",
              "[1] Both teams of researchers described Pando as a single male aspen clone based on its morphological characteristics such as pollen production, leaves, and root structure.",
              "A large scale genetic sampling and analysis was published in 2008 by Jennifer DeWoody of the US Forest Service, Carol Rowe, Valerie Hipkins, and Karen Mock of Utah State University, which confirmed previous morphological analysis by Barnes, Kemperman, Mitton Grant and Linhart and verified Pando was in fact a single clonal colony operating as one tree spreading out across a 106-acre expanse.",
              "[18] In the late 1987, Fishlake National Forest began work to remove diseased trees and promote new growth on the yet-to-be-named tree using coppicing,[19] mechanical stimulation,[20] and ground fire to simultaneously remove diseased stems while stimulating regeneration.",
              "[21] In 1993, Fishlake National Forest began work on the \"Aspen Regeneration Project\",[22] installing fences to help control deer and elk who threatened to destroy the productive results of the regeneration project.",
              "Today, 53 acres of Pando is protected by 8-foot fences to control populations of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and elk (Cervus canadensis), and to control human use, such as permitted grazing by domestic cattle (Bos taurus).",
              "Regeneration rates in portions of the \"Aspen Regeneration Project\" which started in the 1990's, and was expanded in 2014 showed promise based on photographic evidence and repeated survey plots by land managers, scientists and conservation groups between 1993 and today.",
              "[23] Despite this, many have argued more work needs to be done to control wildlife, as Pando is surrounded by 700 square miles of defacto wildlife preserve managed by people, groups and agencies who do not have Pando's sustainability as a central concern in their land management policies.",
              "Paul Rogers and Darren McAvoy of Utah State University completed an assessment of Pando's status in 2018 and stressed the importance of reducing herbivory by mule deer as critical to conserving Pando for the future.",
              "[10] In 2019, Rogers and Jan S\u030cebesta surveyed other vegetation within Pando besides aspen, finding additional support for their 2018 conclusion that interactions between browsing and past and ongoing management may have had adverse effects on Pando's long-term resilience to change.",
              "[24] In 2023, a team of researchers, land managers, wildlife biologists and citizen scientists groups began long term programs to monitor deer and elk using GPS collars and wildlife cameras to better understand wildlife browsing on the tree.",
              "[25] Most agree, based on Barnes' work and later work, that Pando encompasses 42.",
              "89 hectares (106 acres), weighs an estimated 6,000 metric tons (6,600 short tons) or 13.",
              "2 million pounds, and features an estimated 47,000 stems, which die individually and are replaced by genetically identical stems that are sent up from the tree's vast root system, a process known as \"suckering\".",
              "[2][5] The root system is estimated to be several thousand years old, with habitat modeling suggesting a maximum age of 14,000 years.",
              "[26][27] Individual stems do not typically live more than 100\u2013130 years old.",
              "Mitton and Grant summarize the development of stems in aspen clones:[7] .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "quaking aspen regularly reproduces via a process called suckering.",
              "An individual stem can send out lateral roots that, under the right conditions, send up other erect stems;",
              "from all above-ground appearances the new stems look just like individual trees.",
              "The process is repeated until a whole stand, of what appear to be individual trees, forms. This collection of multiple stems, called ramets, all form one, single, genetic individual, usually termed a clone.",

              "The Posidonia has a very high carbon absorption capacity, being able to soak up 15 times more carbon dioxide every year than a similar sized piece of the Amazon rainforest.",
              "[4] Posidonia oceanica has roots (which mainly serve to anchor the plant to the substrate), rhizome and tapeform leaves.",
              "The rhizomes, up to 1 cm thick, grow both horizontally (plagiotropic rhizomes), and vertically (orthotropic rhizomes).",
              "The former, thanks to the presence at the bottom of lignited roots up to 15 cm long, anchor the plant to the substrate.",
              "The latter, which increase height, have the function of combatting sanding due to continuous sedimentation.",
              "The two types of growth give rise to the so-called \"kill\", a terrace formation that consists of a network of strata of rhizomes, roots and trapped sediments.",
              "In this way, posidonias colonise an environment that algae could hardly occupy due to the lack of roots.",
              "The leaves arise from orthotropic rhizomes, are cyntiform and bright green in colour that turns brown over time.",
              "They can reach a length of approximately 1.",
              "5 metres high.",
              "On average they have a width of 1 cm and have 13 to 17 parallel ribs.",

              "They are organised in bushes of 6 or 7 leaves, with the oldest on the outside and the youngest on the inside.",
              "The leaves are divided into three categories: Posidonia oceanica reproduces both sexually and asexually (by stolons).",
              "Sexual reproduction occurs through the production of flowers and fruits.",

              "The androecium consists of three stamens with short anthers.",
              "Flowering depends on environmental factors (light and temperature) and endogenous factors (age and size of the plant) and takes place in September and October in the meadows closest to the sea surface, while in the deepest ones it is postponed for two months.",
              "Pollen inside the anthers is spherical in shape, but becomes filamentous as soon as it is released into the water.",
              "There are no recognition mechanisms between pollen and stigma that prevent self-fertilisation.",

              "When it rots, it releases a seed (coated by a thin membrane, but without a true and proper tegument), which falls to the bottom and, if it finds the right conditions of depth, stability and type of sediment, germinates and gives rise to a new plant.",
              "In order for it to be consolidated, it is necessary that in finds a moisturised substrate.",
              "Humidification consists of the degradation of plant remains, so the plant can be implanted in \"soils\" previously colonised by other plants, such as macroalgae or other phanerogams. Thus, a true ecological succession is generated in which posidonia represents the last stage.",
              "Germination begins with the release of a small white root of radical pole and a leaf of the apical pole.",
              "With sexual reproduction, the plant colonises new areas, diffuses meadows in other areas and guarantees genetic variability.",
              "Asexual reproduction by stolons, which allows the expansion of meadows, is carried out through plagiargiotropic rhizomes, which grow about 7 cm a year and colonise new spaces.",

              "Posidonia oceanica, commonly known as Neptune grass or Mediterranean tapeweed, is a seagrass species that is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea.",
              "It forms large underwater meadows that are an important part of the ecosystem.",
              "The fruit is free floating and known in Italy as \"the olive of the sea\" (l'oliva di mare[2]).",
              "Balls of fibrous material from its foliage, known as egagropili or Neptune balls,[3] wash up to nearby shorelines.",
              "The Posidonia has a very high carbon absorption capacity, being able to soak up 15 times more carbon dioxide every year than a similar sized piece of the Amazon rainforest.",
              "[4] Posidonia oceanica has roots (which mainly serve to anchor the plant to the substrate), rhizome and tapeform leaves.",
              "The rhizomes, up to 1 cm thick, grow both horizontally (plagiotropic rhizomes), and vertically (orthotropic rhizomes).",
              "The former, thanks to the presence at the bottom of lignited roots up to 15 cm long, anchor the plant to the substrate.",
              "The latter, which increase height, have the function of combatting sanding due to continuous sedimentation.",
              "The two types of growth give rise to the so-called \"kill\", a terrace formation that consists of a network of strata of rhizomes, roots and trapped sediments.",
              "In this way, posidonias colonise an environment that algae could hardly occupy due to the lack of roots.",
              "The leaves arise from orthotropic rhizomes, are cyntiform and bright green in colour that turns brown over time.",
              "They can reach a length of approximately 1.",
              "5 metres high.",
              "On average they have a width of 1 cm and have 13 to 17 parallel ribs.",
              "The apexes are rounded and are often lost by the action of waves and currents.",
              "They are organised in bushes of 6 or 7 leaves, with the oldest on the outside and the youngest on the inside.",
              "The leaves are divided into three categories: Posidonia oceanica reproduces both sexually and asexually (by stolons).",
              "Sexual reproduction occurs through the production of flowers and fruits.",
              "The flowers are hermaphrodite and are grouped in a herringbone-shaped inflorescence, green in colour and contained between floral bracts.",
              "The peduncle binds to the rhizome in the centre of the bunch.",
              "The gynaecium is formed by a unilocular ovary that continues with a style and ends in the stigma.",
              "The androecium consists of three stamens with short anthers.",
              "Flowering depends on environmental factors (light and temperature) and endogenous factors (age and size of the plant) and takes place in September and October in the meadows closest to the sea surface, while in the deepest ones it is postponed for two months.",
              "Pollen inside the anthers is spherical in shape, but becomes filamentous as soon as it is released into the water.",
              "There are no recognition mechanisms between pollen and stigma that prevent self-fertilisation.",
              "Pollination is hydrophilic and can lead to fruit formation, although some of them do not reach maturation, which occurs after six months.",
              "Once ripe, the fruits separate and float on the surface.",
              "The fruit, slightly fleshy and called in some places \"sea olive\", is similar to a drupe and has a porous pericarp and rich in an oily substance that allows flotation.",
              "When it rots, it releases a seed (coated by a thin membrane, but without a true and proper tegument), which falls to the bottom and, if it finds the right conditions of depth, stability and type of sediment, germinates and gives rise to a new plant.",
              "In order for it to be consolidated, it is necessary that in finds a moisturised substrate.",
              "Humidification consists of the degradation of plant remains, so the plant can be implanted in \"soils\" previously colonised by other plants, such as macroalgae or other phanerogams. Thus, a true ecological succession is generated in which posidonia represents the last stage.",
              "Germination begins with the release of a small white root of radical pole and a leaf of the apical pole.",
              "With sexual reproduction, the plant colonises new areas, diffuses meadows in other areas and guarantees genetic variability.",
              "Asexual reproduction by stolons, which allows the expansion of meadows, is carried out through plagiargiotropic rhizomes, which grow about 7 cm a year and colonise new spaces.",
              "The high accumulation of sediments and the reduction of the space available for horizontal growth stimulates the vertical growth of the rhizomes, thus forming the bushes.",
              "Posidonia growth rate is amongst the lowest of marine angiosperm with its horizontal rhizome's growing from 1-6 centimetres per year, whilst the vertical rhizomes grow from 0.",
              "1 to 4 centimetres per year.",
              "And to grow a new leaf it takes approximately 50.",
              "68 days, exceptionally lower than other types of seagrass like Zostera noltii, which takes an approximate 13.",
              "71 days.",
              "The genus Posidonia is named after Poseidon, the Greek god of the seas, while oceanica refers to its former wide distribution.",
              "Carl Linnaeus gave the first botanical description of this species in Systema Naturae, although the genus was then named Zostera.",
              "The APG system (1998) and APG II system (2003) accept the genus as constituting the sole genus in the family Posidoniaceae, which it places in the order Alismatales, in the clade monocots.",

              "Leaves are arranged in groups, with older leaves on the outside, longer and differing in form from the younger leaves they surround.",
              "The rhizome type stems are found in two forms: one growing up to 150 centimetres (59 in) beneath the sand and the other rising above the sand.",
              "All stems are approximately 10 millimetres (0.",

              "[10][11][12] Dead rhizomes with olive-mill waste are used for compost.",
              "[13] This species is found only in the Mediterranean Sea, where it is in decline, occupying an area of about 3% of the basin.",
              "This corresponds to a surface area of about 38,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi).",
              "Posidonia grows best in clean waters, and its presence is a marker for lack of pollution.",
              "[14] The presence of Posidonia can be detected by the masses of decomposing leaves on beaches.",
              "Such plant material has been used for composting, but Italian laws prohibit the use of marine algae and plants for this purpose.",
              "[15] The UNESCO World Heritage Site around the Balearic Islands of Mallorca and Formentera includes about 55,000 hectares (140,000 acres) of Posidonia oceanica, which has global significance because of the amount of carbon dioxide it absorbs, given the effect of carbon dioxide on climate change.",
              "However, the meadows are being threatened by rising temperatures, which slows down its growth, as well as damage from anchors.",
              "[16] The characteristics of the Posidonia plant, its growth dynamics and the large amount of biomass produced, are factors that can sustain very diverse plant and animal communities.",
              "Distinguished are: epiphytic communities (that is, bacteria, algae and bryozoa that colonise the surface of the leaves and rhizomes of the plant), vagile and sessile animal communities and communities of detritivorous organisms. Along the leaf, successions and neighbourhoods that follow the age of the leaf can be identified.",
              "Diatoms and bacteria are implanted near the base of the leaf and on the young leaves.",
              "Subsequently, in the central part, red and brown fouling algae are implanted, while above the incrustants and in the apical area live erect filamentous algae.",
              "Epiphytic communities are consumed by gastropod molluscs, amphipod crustaceans and polychaetes, and play a very important role in the food chain of Posidonia meadows, taking into account the fact that few organisms are able to feed directly from the plant tissue, little appetising for herbivores due to the high percentage Epiphytes, however, can also damage the plant.",
              "In fact, by increasing weight, they can cause premature fall of the leaves, decrease light and also hinder gas exchanges and the absorption of nutrients through the leaves.",
              "Posidonia has been used for about twenty years as a biological indicator.",
              "In fact, the plant has all the characteristics of a good bioindicator: Therefore, through the study of meadows it is possible to know quite reliably the environmental quality of coastal marine waters.",
              "Generally, the methods of studying Posidonia meadows are four: There is a close relationship between the depth of the lower limit and the transparency of water.",
              "As for density, it depends on the depth at which the meadow is located, the luminous intensity and the type of substrate.",
              "According to the density of the foliar fascicles, measured in number of bushes / m2, meadows are divided into 5 classes.",
              "Phenological analyses allow to study different useful parameters to describe the state of health of plants: Lepidochronological analysis consists of the study of the life cycles of P.",
