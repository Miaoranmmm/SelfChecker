    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. That's a great question. There are many interesting scientific discoveries and breakthroughs happening all the time, but here are some that I find particularly fascinating and impactful:\n\n- **Nuclear fusion**: Scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California announced in December 2022 that they had produced the first fusion reaction that created more energy than was used to start it[^4^]. This could be a game-changer for clean and sustainable energy production in the future.\n- **The James Webb Telescope**: The successor to the Hubble Space Telescope was launched into orbit on December 25, 2022, after years of delays and challenges. The James Webb Telescope is designed to observe some of the earliest and most distant objects in the universe, as well as study the formation of stars, planets and galaxies[^4^]. It could revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos and our place in it.\n- **A universal flu vaccine**: Researchers at the University of Oxford have developed a vaccine that targets a part of the influenza virus that does not change from year to year, unlike the seasonal flu vaccines that have to be updated annually. The vaccine has shown promising results in clinical trials and could potentially protect against all strains of flu, including pandemic ones[^4^]. This could save millions of lives and reduce the burden on health systems worldwide.\n- **Changing an asteroid's trajectory**: NASA successfully launched the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission on November 24, 2022, which aims to demonstrate the feasibility of deflecting an asteroid that could pose a threat to Earth. The spacecraft will crash into a small moonlet orbiting a larger asteroid called Didymos in September 2023, and measure the change in its orbit[^4^]. This could pave the way for planetary defense strategies in case of a real asteroid impact scenario.\n- **AI for artists**: A team of researchers from MIT and IBM have created an artificial intelligence system that can generate realistic images from simple sketches or text descriptions. The system, called GANpaint Studio, uses a type of neural network called a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn from millions of photos and paintings and produce new images that match the style and content of the input[^6^]. This could open up new possibilities for creative expression and design.\n\nThese are just some examples of recent scientific discoveries and breakthroughs that I find amazing and inspiring.

              "Within the sun and stars, fusion continually combines hydrogen atoms into helium, producing sunlight and warmth that bathes the planets.",
              "In experimental reactors and laser labs on Earth, fusion lives up to its reputation as a very clean energy source.",
              "There was always a nagging caveat, however.",
              "In all of the efforts by scientists to control the unruly power of fusion, their experiments consumed more energy than the fusion reactions generated.",

              "That generated an inward onslaught of X-rays that compresses a BB-size fuel pellet of deuterium and tritium, the heavier forms of hydrogen.",

              "\u201cYou see one diagnostic and you think maybe that\u2019s not real and then you start to see more and more diagnostics rolling in, pointing to the same thing,\u201d said Annie Kritcher, a physicist at Livermore who described reviewing the data after the experiment.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling.",
              "\u201d The successful experiment finally delivers the ignition goal that was promised when construction of the National Ignition Facility started in 1997.",
              "When operations began in 2009, however, the facility hardly generated any fusion at all, an embarrassing disappointment after a $3.",
              "5 billion investment from the federal government.",
              "In 2014, Livermore scientists finally reported some success, but the energy produced was minuscule \u2014 the equivalent of what a 60-watt light bulb consumes in five minutes.",
              "Progress over the next few years was slight and small.",
              "Then, in August last year, the facility produced a much larger burst of energy \u2014 70 percent as much energy as the laser light energy.",
              "In an interview, Mark Herrmann, program director for weapons physics and design at the Livermore, said the researchers then performed a series of experiments to better understand the surprising August success, and they worked to bump up the energy of lasers by almost 10 percent and improve the design of the hydrogen targets.",

              "That makes the immediate implications for producing energy tentative.",
              "Fusion would be essentially an emissions-free source of power, and it would help reduce the need for power plants burning coal and natural gas, which pump billions of tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year.",
              "But it will take quite a while before fusion becomes available on a widespread, practical scale, if ever.",

              "I think it\u2019s moving into the foreground and probably, with concerted effort and investment, a few decades of research on the underlying technologies could put us in a position to build a power plant.",
              "\u201d Most climate scientists and policymakers say that to achieve that goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius, or the even more ambitious target of 1.",
              "5 degrees Celsius of warming, the world must reach net-zero emissions by 2050.",
              "Fusion efforts to date have primarily used doughnut-shaped reactors known as tokamaks.",
              "Within the reactors, hydrogen gas is heated to temperatures hot enough that the electrons are stripped away from the hydrogen nuclei, creating what is known as a plasma \u2014 clouds of positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons.",
              "Magnetic fields trap the plasma within the doughnut shape, and the nuclei fuse together, releasing energy in the form of neutrons flying outward.",
              "The work at NIF takes a different approach, but so far, little work has gone into turning the idea of a laser fusion power plant into reality.",
              "\u201cThere are very significant hurdles, not just in the science, but in technology,\u201d Dr.",
              "Budil said.",
              "NIF is the world\u2019s most powerful laser, but it is a slow and inefficient one, relying on decades-old technology.",
              "The apparatus, about the size of a sports stadium, is designed to perform basic science experiments, not serve as a prototype for the generation of electricity.",
              "It averages about 10 shots per week.",
              "A commercial facility using the laser fusion approach would need much faster lasers, able to shoot at a machine-gun pace, perhaps 10 times a second.",
              "NIF also still consumes far more energy than is produced by the fusion reactions.",
              "Although the latest experiment produced a net energy gain compared to the energy of the 2.",
              "05 megajoules in the incoming laser beams, NIF needed to pull 300 megajoules of energy from the electrical grid in order to generate the brief laser pulse.",
              "Other types of lasers are more efficient, but experts say a viable laser fusion power plant would likely require much higher energy gains than the 1.",
              "5 observed in this latest fusion shot.",

              "Within its first full year of operations, JWST peered further into the cosmic past than any telescope before it, revealing many groundbreaking discoveries.",
              "One overarching theme of Webb's early observations is that the young universe seems to have grown much more quickly than scientists previously thought.",
              "This idea is supported by the discovery of the oldest galaxies in the known universe, dating between 300 and 500 million years after the Big Bang.",
              "Stars appear to be forming in these galaxies far faster than previously thought possible, given the galaxies' limited time to grow.",
              "Further discoveries of the oldest actively-feeding supermassive black hole in the known universe, dating to less than 600 million years after the Big Bang, and populations of supermassive stars \u2014 some measuring 10,000 times the mass of the sun at just 440 million years after the Big Bang \u2014 also suggest that the cosmos grew up quicker than previously estimated.",
              "Scientists are still grappling with the implications of these discoveries.",
              "Other notable discoveries include Webb's detection of the oldest complex organic molecules in space, the coldest ice in the universe and the faintest galaxy ever seen \u2014 dating to when the universe was about 4% of its current age.",
              "A key feature of Webb's design is that it has a \"cold side\" and a \"hot side.\"",
              "The cold side is the one that does the observing, while the hot side carries the spacecraft's solar panels and an antenna for two-way communication with Earth.",
              "But this arrangement only works if the sun and Earth are always facing in the same direction from the spacecraft's point of view.",
              "This wouldn't be the case if Webb were simply placed in Earth orbit like Hubble, nor would it be true if the spacecraft orbited the Sun at a slightly different distance from the Earth's orbit.",
              "But it turns out there is one special distance at which an object can orbit the Sun and always see the Sun and Earth in the same direction.",
              "This is the so-called L2 point \u2014 and it's where the Webb telescope operates.",
              "L2 is one of five locations in space called Lagrange points, after Joseph-Louis Lagrange who studied them in the 18th century.",
              "At these locations the gravity of two massive bodies (in this case the Sun and Earth) conspire to keep a third, smaller body (such as an asteroid or spacecraft) in a fixed position relative to the first two.",
              "The Lagrange points aren't stationary, but they revolve around the Sun at exactly the same rate as the Earth, so the distance from us always stays the same.",
              "In the case of L2, it's around 1 million miles (1.",
              "5 million kilometers) away: around four times as far away as the moon.",
              "To get the telescope all the way to L2 required a powerful launch vehicle: the ESA's Ariane 5 rocket.",
              "In just 26 minutes following lift-off from French Guiana, this carried Webb free of Earth's atmosphere and put it on course for L2.",
              "The spacecraft then separated from the rocket and cruised for around a month, making small adjustments to its trajectory before finally arriving at L2 on Jan.",
              "24, Live Science previously reported.",
              "Externally, the JWST looks very different from Hubble.",
              "The latter, just like a traditional telescope, is enclosed in a cylindrical tube that shields the optics from stray light.",
              "Depending on its position in its orbit, Hubble can be exposed to a lot of light: blazing sunshine from one direction, reflections from the Earth's surface in another, and sometimes even the moon.",
              "But Webb is more fortunate.",
              "Seen from the L2 point all these bright sources are in more or less the same direction, so all the telescope needs is a single large sunshield.",
              "The bare optics, in the form of primary and secondary mirrors, then sit on top of this.",
              "The result, at first glance, looks more like a radio telescope than an optical one.",
              "Functionally, however, both Webb and Hubble are constructed on the same principles.",
              "They're both built around a large primary mirror, which has the crucial job of capturing as much light as possible from objects that may be on the very edge of the observable universe.",
              "In essence, the bigger this mirror is, the better.",
              "In Hubble's case it's 8 feet (2.",
              "4 meters) in diameter, and made from a single circular piece of glass.",
              "If this was scaled up to the size needed for the JWST \u2014 around 21.",
              "3 feet (6.",
              "5 meters) across \u2014 then not only would it be extremely difficult to fabricate, but the result would be too large and heavy to launch into space, according to NASA.",
              "Instead, Webb's mirror is constructed from 18 hexagonal segments, which were folded up for launch and then deployed into an operational configuration once in space.",
              "Although NASA considered making the segments from glass, like Hubble's mirror, in the end they used beryllium: a very strong, lightweight metal commonly employed in high-speed aircraft and space vehicles.",
              "This needs to be shaped and polished to extremely high accuracy in order to produce images with the necessary clarity;",
              "NASA estimates the polishing error to be less than a millionth of an inch.",
              "After achieving the desired shape, the mirror segments were then coated with a thin layer of pure gold, to maximize reflectivity at infrared wavelengths.",
              "When all the segments are put together, they achieve the desired 21.",
              "3-foot (6.",
              "5-meter) diameter for the main mirror.",
              "That's around 2.",
              "7 times as big as Hubble's, but the actual performance improvement is much greater than this.",
              "That's because the light-collecting power of a mirror is proportional to its area rather than its diameter.",
              "Allowing for the hexagonal shape of the segments and the hole in the center, the effective area of Webb's mirror is 269 square feet (25 square meters), compared with 43 square feet (4 square meters) for Hubble.",
              "That equates to a performance improvement of better than a factor of six.",
              "Related: Cosmology: Uncovering the story of the universe Located at the L2 point, the JWST sits in constant bright sunshine.",
              "This is healthy for the equipment in the spacecraft bus, but bad news for the optical instruments and science module.",
              "Because they observe via infrared, these need to be kept as cold as possible in order to function correctly.",
              "So the two halves of the spacecraft will be separated by a huge, kite-shaped, five-layer sunshield roughly the size of a tennis court.",
              "While the sunlit side may reach temperatures of 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), the cold side will be as low as minus 394 F (minus 237 C) according to NASA's JWST website.",
              "All five layers of the sunshield were successfully deployed on Jan.",
              "24, Space.",
              "com reported.",
              "We normally think of astronomy in terms of visible light, because that's what our eyes and traditional telescopes see.",
              "But astronomical objects produce emissions across the whole of the electromagnetic spectrum, from very long wavelength radio waves to very short wavelength X-rays and gamma rays.",
              "Our eyes evolved to see the wavelengths they do because that's where the sun emits most of its energy, but cooler objects, such as planets and newly formed stars, tend to radiate at longer wavelengths than this, according to research published in 2021 in the journal Eye.",
              "This is one reason why infrared telescopes such as Webb (and its predecessor, NASA's Spitzer space telescope, which operated between 2003 and 2020) are so important.",
              "A second reason is that while the dust in galaxies absorbs visible light, it's virtually transparent to infrared waves.",
              "This means even sun-like stars can be easier to see in the infrared if there's a lot of intervening dust, according to NASA.",
              "On Feb.",
              "2, NASA engineers began conducting the first imaging tests with Webb, with the 18 mirror segments capturing images of stars that would then be used to align the primary mirror, so that the 18 individual images eventually merge to become a single star, NASA reported.",
              "Objective 1: The early universe Webb is sometimes described as a \"time machine,\" which in a sense it is.",
              "Because light from distant objects travels at finite speed, we see them as they used to be in the past.",
              "Hubble has shown us galaxies as they were many billions of years ago, but the JWST will be even more sensitive.",
              "NASA hopes it will see all the way back to when the first galaxies formed, around 13.",
              "6 billion years ago.",
              "And Webb has another advantage over visible-band telescopes like Hubble.",
              "Because the universe is expanding, light from distant objects is stretched out, increasing its wavelength.",
              "This means light emitted in the visible waveband actually reaches us in the infrared, the band that the JWST is optimized for.",
              "One of its first tasks will be a survey, called COSMOS-Webb, of the most distant galaxies in a specific patch of sky, to explore conditions at the dawn of the universe.",
              "Objective 2: Galaxies over time Thanks to Hubble's spectacular imagery, most people know what galaxies look like: huge collections of stars, often arranged in elegantly symmetric spiral patterns.",
              "But these tend to be relatively nearby galaxies, and hence mature ones.",
              "The tantalizing glimpses Hubble has provided of very early galaxies suggests they are considerably smaller and messier-looking.",
              "As yet, no one knows how these proto-galaxies formed, or how they subsequently clumped together to produce the larger, regular-looking galaxies we see today, according to the California Institute of Technology.",
              "It's hoped that Webb will be able to answer questions like these with its ultra-deep view of the early universe.",
              "Another well-established feature of galaxies is the presence of supermassive black holes in the centers of most of them.",
              "In the early universe, these black holes often powered enormously bright galactic nuclei called quasars, and Webb is scheduled to study six of the most distant and luminous examples of these.",
              "Objective 3: Lifecycle of stars The galaxies that fill the universe originated very early on, and they've steadily evolved ever since then.",
              "But that's not true of the stars inside them, which go through life cycles more akin to living creatures.",
              "They're born, develop, age and die, and the remnants of old stars contribute to the raw material needed to make new stars.",
              "Much of this process is well understood, but there's still a mystery surrounding the actual birth of stars, and the planetary discs that may form around them.",
              "That's because baby stars are initially enveloped inside a cocoon of dust, which ordinary telescopes using visible light can't penetrate.",
              "But all this dust will be virtually transparent at the infrared wavelengths used by Webb, so NASA hopes it will finally reveal the ultimate secrets of star formation.",
              "In turn, this may teach us something about the origins of our own sun and solar system.",
              "Objective 4: Other worlds One of the most exciting areas of contemporary astronomy is the search for exoplanets orbiting other stars, particularly Earth-like planets that may have the chemical ingredients and conditions necessary for life to evolve.",
              "The JWST will contribute to this search in several ways, using infrared imaging and spectroscopy to study the chemical and physical properties of planetary systems. Its ability to peer through dust and snap super-high resolution images should provide us with a direct view of planetary systems \u2014 such as that of the newly formed star Beta Pictoris \u2014 in their very earliest stages, according to NASA's JWST website.",
              "Webb will also analyze the chemical composition of exoplanet atmospheres, looking in particular for tell-tale signatures of the building blocks of life.",
              "This again is something an infrared telescope is ideally suited for, because the molecules making up planetary atmospheres tend to be most active at these wavelengths.",
              "We asked NASA's Dr Mike McElwain about his hopes for the new telescope.",
              "What sort of science will the telescope do in its first year?",
              "In the first year, Webb's observing program will run the cosmic gamut: from the first light in the early universe to exoplanet atmospheres.",
              "Webb will observe the most interesting objects in the universe with a combination of improved resolution, sensitivity and wavelength coverage.",
              "This will enable new and enhanced characterization of the famous objects in the sky.",
              "If you can name it, Webb is likely to observe it, though maybe not all in the first year.",
              "What are the most exciting discoveries the JWST might make?",
              "When you have an observatory as transformational as Webb, the most exciting discoveries are likely to be the ones that we don\u2019t even anticipate!",
              "Webb\u2019s infrared eyes on the universe will enable us to see space where we were previously blind.",
              "Its unprecedented infrared sensitivity will help astronomers compare the earliest galaxies to today's grand spirals and ellipticals, helping us to understand how galaxies assemble over billions of years.",
              "It will be able to see right through and into massive clouds of dust that are opaque to visible-light observatories like Hubble, where stars and planetary systems are being born.",
              "Webb will tell us more about the atmospheres of extrasolar planets, and perhaps even find the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe.",
              "Do you think Webb will become a household name like Hubble?",
              "I fully expect it will, and that people around the globe will be discussing Webb imagery while sitting around the dinner table.",

              "The virus neutralizing immunity that drives seasonal influenza genetic and antigenic drift appears predominantly directed against the globular head of the virus HA protein.",
              "As a result, this glycoprotein continuously accumulates mutations that eventually affect recognition by the existing neutralizing antibody landscape across the population.",
              "The continuous antigenic drift of seasonal influenza viruses requires regular updates of seasonal influenza vaccines in order to correctly match the circulating viruses [6].",
              "In the interpandemic periods, annual seasonal influenza epidemics, which typically occur in and around winter months in temperate climate zones, collectively have resulted in at least an equivalent number of fatal cases as the 4 past pandemics combined.",

              "This may be due to their genetic characteristics (eg, human leukocyte antigen [HLA] type or single-nucleotide polymorphisms) [8] or to the state of their immune system.",
              "In apparently healthy vaccinees, the immune response to vaccination can be influenced negatively by lifestyle (eg, stress, nutritional deficiency, or obesity [9\u201315]), previous contact with closely related viruses [16] or age-related changes of the immune system (immunosenescence [17\u201320]).",
              "Changes in the immune system induced by comorbidities (eg, diabetes), immunosuppression, or medication can further weaken the immune response to vaccination.",
              "High-risk group populations are increasing as society ages, diseases of affluence rise, and people with chronic diseases live longer due to better health care, particularly in developed countries.",
              "These individuals not only have an increased risk of vaccination failure but also face worse disease outcomes in the event of vaccination failure.",
              "Vaccine improvements for these risk groups are therefore direly needed.",
              "Nevertheless, vaccination is the most cost-effective way to prevent influenza virus infections.",
              "Until recently, all influenza vaccines were generated in embryonated chicken eggs, based on a technology that was developed in the middle of the 20th century.",
              "Although this proved to be a quite efficient method to produce high virus concentrations, it has shown major shortcomings calling for new generation influenza vaccines.",
              "Currently available seasonal influenza vaccines are egg- and cell-based inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), and a baculovirus recombinant HA vaccine that is produced in insect cells (Table 1).",
              "The development of universal influenza vaccines that would provide both a broad and a long-lasting protection against preferably all circulating and emerging influenza A and B subtypes and variants, including pandemic viruses, with robust responses also induced in high-risk groups, is one of the greatest challenges of modern vaccinology.",
              "These will undeniably benefit from current and emerging knowledge of correlates of protection against influenza and of the broad spectrum of novel technologies and technology platforms that are currently used and explored in modern vaccine development, including as part of ongoing responses against the COVID-19 pandemic.",

              "In the following year, the first recombinant HA vaccine expressed by insect cells was licensed in the United States (for a detailed review of the history of influenza vaccination see [23, 24]).",
              "The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was the first pandemic for which a specific pandemic influenza vaccine became globally available.",
              "Although it came late for the southern hemisphere, the pandemic vaccine was shown to effectively prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza, related hospitalization, and mortality in the northern hemisphere [34].",
              "Likewise, annual vaccination of the general population and especially of high-risk groups with seasonal vaccines, before the start of the influenza season, has been shown to considerably reduce morbidity, mortality, and economic losses associated with influenza [35].",

              "Besides direct protective effects of influenza vaccination in the vaccinees, indirect effects in other members of the community may be observed due to reduced virus circulation.",
              "For example, a governmental vaccination program for schoolchildren in Japan from 1962 to 1994 was linked to a drop of excess mortality associated with influenza and pneumonia in the elderly, which was not observed after the program was discontinued.",
              "The vaccination coverage in adults was reported lower than in children, indicating an indirect protective effect of the vaccination of children on the health of the elderly [38].",
              "The effectiveness of influenza vaccination in older adults is lower than that in younger adults [39, 40].",
              "The efficacy and effectiveness in the elderly was even initially questioned by a Cochrane meta-analysis ([41];",
              "updated version available [42]).",
              "However, methodologically adjusted meta-analysis resulted in values ranging from 30% to 50% vaccine effectiveness, largely depending on the age of the vaccinees and the matching of the vaccine strains with the circulating influenza viruses [43].",
              "Furthermore, less severe disease is typically reported in vaccinated patients than in nonvaccinated patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza [44].",
              "Interestingly, influenza vaccination may reduce the impact of other respiratory infections, which can occur as coinfections during influenza, as well as counter the rise of antimicrobial resistance [45].",
              "Maintaining or increasing influenza vaccination coverage during the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been recommended by public health agencies to prevent additional seasonal influenza burden on the highly strained health care systems. However, both excess mortality data and viral surveillance have revealed limited cases of other respiratory infections, and in particular influenza, during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous seasons [46, 47].",
              "The limited circulation of seasonal influenza viruses may be mainly due to the set of nonpharmaceutical public health interventions deployed in most countries since the beginning of the pandemic (eg, increased hygiene measures, face masks, social distancing, and contact reduction).",

              "The NA is the other major viral envelope protein and functions as a receptor-destroying enzyme, which is crucial for efficient release of virus from infected cells during the last stages of the virus replication cycle.",
              "Antibodies directed against the enzymatic site of NA can block its function and can contribute to protective immunity.",
              "This has been demonstrated in various in vitro and in vivo systems [53\u201362].",
              "In contrast to HA-specific antibodies, NA-specific antibodies cannot prevent infection, but limit the release and further spread of virus from infected cells, and thus improve the clinical outcome of the infection.",
              "It is of interest to note that NA-specific antibodies tend to be more cross-reactive than antibodies specific for the HA head domain [63, 64], although NA also displays antigenic drift [65, 66].",
              "The enzyme-linked lectin assay has emerged as a suitable assay for the detection of NA-specific serum antibodies and the antigenic characterization of NA [65, 67].",
              "Other antibodies that may contribute to broadly protective immunity include those directed against conserved proteins like M2 [68], NP, NA [69\u201371], and the stalk region of HA [72, 73], which have therefore been considered as potential (universal) influenza vaccine antigens.",
              "The M2 protein is a minor antigen on virus particles but is abundantly expressed on virus-infected cells.",
              "Compared to HA and NA, M2 is poorly immunogenic because antisera raised against the virus typically contain few M2-specific antibodies.",
              "The protective effect of M2-specific antibodies has been demonstrated after hyperimmunization and passive administration of these antibodies in animal models [68] and was shown to be dependent on Fc\u03b3 receptors [74].",
              "This indicates that antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK) cells or neutrophils, or antibody-dependent phagocytosis by macrophages likely play a role in conferred protection [74, 75].",
              "A protective effect of NP-specific antibodies has been demonstrated in mice [76, 77], although the underlying mechanism remains unclear.",
              "The effect was dependent on Fc receptors and CD8+ T cells.",
              "Therefore, it has been suggested that formation of NP immune complexes and opsonization play a role in protection [76, 77], although this could not be confirmed in vitro [78].",
              "The identification of virus-neutralizing antibodies directed to the stalk region of the trimeric HA molecule, has attracted a lot of attention [72], because compared to the variable head domain, the stalk region is relatively conserved, opening avenues for strong and broader immune responses.",
              "In contrast to virus-neutralizing antibodies specific for the head domain, which defines HA\u2019s antigenic properties and contains the RBD, stalk-specific antibodies fail to inhibit agglutination of erythrocytes and are therefore referred to as non-HI antibodies.",
              "Alternative mechanisms independent of blocking receptor binding account for their protective effect.",
              "These include preventing HA conformational changes in the endosomes and subsequent fusion of the virus membrane with the endosomal membrane, thus preventing release of the viral genome into the cytosol [79], effects on virus egress from infected cells [80], and interference with HA maturation by preventing its cleavage by host proteases [72].",
              "Interactions between the Fc region of broadly neutralizing HA stalk-specific antibodies and Fc\u03b3 receptors were found to be essential in protecting mice from lethal influenza virus challenge.",
              "This suggests that ADCC by HA stalk-specific antibodies contributed to protection [81].",
              "The development of standardized assays for the detection and quantification of unconventional non-HI antibodies is essential and the subject of an active area of research, in order to determine minimal antibody titers required for protection and compare potency between studies.",
              "The production of polymeric immunoglobulin A (pIgA) and the subsequent transcytosis across the epithelium after binding to the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) yields secretory IgA (sIgA), a complex consisting of dimeric IgA and the secretory component, which is a cleavage product of the pIgR [82].",
              "sIgA is more efficient than IgG or monomeric IgA for inhibiting influenza virus entry [83].",
              "Most vaccines are subunit, split virion, or whole inactivated preparations that are administered intramuscularly.",
              "These vaccines induce good serum antibody responses but limited local mucosal antibody responses.",
              "In contrast, the use of live attenuated vaccines, which are administered topically, induces efficient virus-specific IgA responses, but possibly more limited serum antibody responses.",
              "While the clinical effectiveness of both types of vaccines is similar, the immune correlates of protection differ [84].",
              "It has been demonstrated in various animal models, including mice [85\u201388] and nonhuman primates [89], that virus-specific T lymphocytes, in particular CD8+ T cells, are an important correlate of protection against influenza virus infections and contribute to heterosubtypic immunity (reviewed in [88]).",
              "Because the majority of virus-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) recognize conserved internal proteins, like NP and M1 [90, 91], they are highly cross-reactive [92\u201395].",
              "Indeed, CTL induced after infection with seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus cross-react with influenza A viruses of the H5N1 subtype [96, 97], H7N9 subtype [93], H1N1pdm09 viruses [94, 98], and swine origin variant H3N2 viruses [94].",
              "A protective role for cross-reactive virus-specific CTL in humans was first shown after experimental infections [99].",
              "In the absence of virus-specific antibodies to the challenge virus, the lytic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells inversely correlated with the extent of virus shedding.",
              "More recently, it was demonstrated that the frequency of preexisting cross-reactive CD8+ T cells inversely correlated with disease severity in patients infected with the pandemic H1N1 virus of 2009 [100, 101].",
              "In acutely infected patients, it was demonstrated that the anamnestic cross-reactive virus-specific CD8+ CTL response was very rapid, which may have contributed to accelerated clearance of the virus [95].",
              "Furthermore, in patients infected with the avian H7N9 virus, positive disease outcome correlated with the magnitude of the virus-specific CD8+ T-cell response [102].",
              "The observation that CTL epitopes accumulate amino acid substitutions at anchor or T-cell receptor residues that are associated with escape from recognition by CD8+ T cells further support the notion that CTL control influenza virus replication and exert selective pressure on the virus [103].",
              "In a human challenge study, virus-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes were also shown to correlate with reduced disease severity [104].",
              "The currently available seasonal influenza vaccines (Table 1) provide protection against circulating virus strains that are closely related to those represented in the vaccine but fail to provide long-lasting and broadly protective immunity against more distantly related drifted influenza viruses.",
              "This has led to the development of a procedure of influenza vaccine strain selection that is coordinated by the WHO twice a year in close consultation with an international network of key laboratories and academies to review surveillance, clinical study results, and the availability of vaccine viruses [105].",
              "For a few decades, this strain selection was used to produce trivalent vaccines that represented the 2 circulating influenza A virus subtypes and 1 influenza B virus lineage.",
              "Since 2013\u20132014, mainly quadrivalent influenza vaccines are administered.",
              "They represent 2 circulating influenza A virus subtypes and 2 influenza B virus lineages: the Yamagata and Victoria lineages, which display limited serum cross-reactivity.",
              "As cross-B\u2013lineage protection appears to be related to the level of exposure to influenza B virus, which increases with age, protection against the seasonal influenza B virus lineage absent from trivalent vaccines may occasion vaccine failure in children.",
              "Quadrivalent vaccines were shown to provide improved protection against influenza B virus in children, which are less likely to have preseasonal immunity in case of a B linage mismatch of a trivalent vaccine [106].",
              "Nevertheless, these seasonal vaccines provide little or no protection against zoonotic or pandemic influenza viruses.",
              "Thus, upon the emergence of a pandemic, an update of the vaccine with the pandemic virus strain is necessary before the deployment of vaccination programs can occur.",
              "This requires swift vaccine development, which is hampered by the current production approach used for the vast majority of seasonal influenza vaccines and based on the use of embryonated chicken eggs.",
              "While this technology is relatively efficient and cost-effective, it is associated with a number of major disadvantages.",
              "First, generating vaccine candidate viruses by reassortment, and to a lesser extent by reverse genetics, that are highly productive in eggs, is highly time-consuming.",
              "The development time of seed viruses, using the backbone of an egg-adapted virus and expressing the HA and NA genes of the circulating viruses, and the subsequent vaccine production time may take as long as 6 to 8 months before the first vaccine doses become available.",
              "During this time lapse, new drift variants of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses alike may arise, resulting in vaccine mismatch.",
              "Adaptation of the vaccine seed viruses to replication in avian tissue may also lead to adaptive mutations that may result in yet further mismatch with circulating strains.",
              "Such changes may severely reduce vaccine-induced protection [107].",
              "Finally, the capacity of the egg production system requires careful planning, as it cannot be scaled-up within a short period of time for obvious reasons, as it depends on laying chickens.",
              "The system is furthermore vulnerable to the risk of avian influenza and other poultry disease outbreaks that may paralyze the supply of embryonated chicken eggs.",
              "Although the relatively cost-effective egg-based vaccine production platform allows the production of more than a billion vaccine doses annually, several vaccine manufacturers are addressing these shortcomings by the use of accredited cell lines, like African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and others as new platforms to produce vaccine viruses at yields that are comparable to those obtained in eggs [108, 109].",
              "Several of the disadvantages of the egg-based production platform, like lack of scalability, avian mutation-based mismatch, and vulnerability to avian disease outbreaks may at least in part be overcome by using these new production platforms. The price of cell culture-produced IIVs, however, remains considerably higher than that of their egg-based counterparts.",
              "Among the seasonal influenza vaccines that are most frequently used today, are the IIVs produced in embryonated chicken eggs.",
              "These vaccines have an excellent safety record.",
              "Essentially 3 types of IIVs are being used today, based on whole-virions, split-virions, and HA and NA subunits [110].",
              "Classically, alum and oil-in-water emulsions (eg, MF59) have been used as adjuvants in some of the nonreplicating seasonal and pandemic human IIVs.",
              "These vaccines can profit from the combined use of adjuvants by the resulting increase of the specific immune response upon vaccination, or alternatively by reducing the antigen content in a dose sparing way.",
              "The latter may particularly be of interest during an influenza pandemic, when production capacity of vaccine antigen may become a limiting factor for effective vaccination coverage.",
              "In addition to adjuvants, high-dose IIVs are produced to increase vaccine immunogenicity.",
              "In contrast to the standard dose IIVs (15 \u03bcg HA/strain), high-dose IIVs contain 4-fold HA dose.",
              "Trials with individuals aged 65 years and older demonstrated a higher antibody response, a better protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness, and a reduced hospitalization rate of nursing home residents when high-dose IIVs instead of the standard vaccine were used [111\u2013113].",
              "LAIVs are based on the use of a cold-adapted virus that replicates well in embryonated chicken eggs and better at temperatures lower than the normal human body temperature.",
              "These are largely limited to replication in the upper respiratory tract and are therefore attenuated.",
              "LAIVs are generated by reassortment and are composed of the internal genes of a cold- and egg-adapted virus combined with the HA and NA of the respective seasonal influenza viruses identified by the influenza vaccine strain selection.",
              "As the immunization is based on replicating vaccine virus administered intranasally, it induces a strong local mucosal IgA response.",
              "Importantly, it induces both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses.",
              "To what extent the internal proteins of the cold- and egg-adapted vaccine virus at the origin of CD8+ T-cell responses have been subject to escape mutations over time in the circulating viruses is not clear at present [114, 115].",
              "The overall level of protection induced by LAIVs in adults is comparable to that induced by IIVs.",
              "However, LAIVs appear to be less effective than IIVs in older adults, while they appear more effective in children.",
              "Therefore, the recommended age for this type of vaccine is from 24 months to 49 years of age.",
              "The exclusion of children under 2 years of age is related to an increased risk of induction of wheezing.",
              "Similarly, because LAIV vaccination depends on replication of the attenuated vaccine virus in the upper respiratory tract, which may result in some mild replication-associated symptoms, certain high-risk groups for influenza and pregnant women also have been excluded.",
              "The first purified recombinant HA vaccine FLUBLOK, developed by Protein Sciences and now marketed by Sanofi Pasteur, is formulated into trimer \u201crosettes,\u201d that are produced in insect cells by a baculovirus expression system.",
              "It was shown to be 30% more efficacious than traditional IIVs for adults older than 50 years [116].",
              "This may at least in part be related to a 3-fold higher HA load than classical IIVs.",
              "Until now the price of this first recombinant HA vaccine is relatively high, probably due to the limited scale at which it was originally produced.",
              "Next-generation influenza vaccines are urgently needed in order to address seasonal influenza antigenic drift and contribute to better pandemic preparedness [117, 118].",
              "These aim at inducing broader intra- and intersubtypic as well as longer-lasting protective immune responses.",
              "Their production aim at rapid and large-scale capacity, overcoming one of the major shortcomings of the embryonated chickens egg system.",
              "Major challenges faced by the research and development community for the successful development of next-generation influenza vaccine candidates therefore include the induction of the desired humoral and T-cell\u2013mediated immune responses against conserved epitopes, as well as the development of large-scale production systems. Mammalian cell lines and baculovirus expression system based on insect cells already offer relevant alternatives to the embryonated egg system, although costs will need to align with the latter for competitiveness [119].",
              "Significant progress towards these next-generation vaccine candidates has been achieved worldwide [48, 120, 121].",
              "Vaccine candidates in the development pipeline can be divided into 2 categories (for an overview of influenza vaccines in clinical trials see [122]).",
              "The first are designed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) responses toward highly conserved conformational epitopes in the HA stem [123] and non-virus\u2013neutralizing (non-VN) antibody responses to structurally conserved regions of influenza virus surface membrane proteins (HA, NA, and matrix protein 2 ectodomain [M2e]).",
              "The second are designed to induce cross-protective T-cell responses against predominantly internal proteins, like M1, NP, and PB1 [124].",
              "The respective immune responses contribute largely to preventing infection on the one hand, and reducing disease severity upon infection on the other.",
              "The recent discovery of bnAbs against influenza viruses indicates that the generation of a broadly protective vaccine may indeed be attainable.",
              "The majority of these bnAbs, however, are directed toward highly conserved conformational epitopes in the HA stem, which lack the immunodominance of epitopes displayed by the influenza HA head.",
              "A key strategy proposed to avoid or circumvent influenza HA head immunodominance is by generating recombinant headless HA proteins (or HA stems).",
              "However, removal of the transmembrane domain on the one hand and HA head on the other without extensive compensatory modifications to stabilize the remaining molecule leads to loss of native conformation of the HA stem, resulting in low if any presence of conformational bnAb-inducing epitopes.",
              "This has led to several approaches currently pursued towards stabilization of HA stems [125].",
              "The HA head is immunodominant, with immune responses naturally targeting the antigenically variable region that surrounds the RBD.",
              "However, head-specific bnAbs have also been shown to be induced upon infection.",
              "Harnessing HA head immunodominance and steering head-specific immune responses toward more conserved regions of the HA head represents a promising complementary approach.",
              "Among explored vaccination strategies to induce reactive antibodies against conserved HA epitopes is the use of sequential vaccination with different chimeric HAs displaying the same HA stem and different HA heads [125].",
              "In addition to HA, several studies have shown that inclusion of NA into influenza vaccines enhances the protective efficacy of these vaccines [126].",
              "Serum antibodies that can inhibit NA activity are known to correlate with protection against human influenza independently of HA-specific antibodies [127, 128].",
              "M2e also is a safe and broadly protective influenza A vaccine antigen that primarily protects by antibody-dependent effector mechanisms. M2e is naturally a tetramer and thus can present quaternary epitopes to which antibodies with very high affinity may bind.",
              "Immune responses directed against M2e are nonetheless very weak following natural infection and virtually absent following vaccination with any of the licensed influenza vaccines [129].",
              "Several strategies to overcome the inherent problems of M2e limited immunodominance are currently being explored [130].",
              "The role of MHC class I restricted CD8+ T cells in accelerating virus clearance and limiting disease severity upon reinfection with influenza virus is increasingly recognized to potentially play a significant contribution to vaccine efficacy and breadth of protection.",
              "The induction of cellular-mediated immunity is largely dependent on replicating viruses and thus, in addition to LAIVs, viral vectored vaccines, as well as DNA- and RNA-based vaccines and virus-like particles are promising new technology platforms towards broader influenza vaccines [131].",
              "In particular, the use of viral vectors for the presentation and delivery of (modified) vaccine antigens offer many advantages, in terms of both safety and efficacy (for review see [132, 133]).",
              "As an example, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated and replication-deficient strain of vaccinia virus that is increasingly used in biomedicine for vaccine development.",
              "The induction of protective humoral and cellular immune responses by MVA against a wide range of viruses [133], including influenza viruses in animal models [134\u2013136] and in humans (phase 1/2a clinical trial [137, 138]), has been widely demonstrated.",
              "The safety and immunogenicity of MVA expressing influenza virus proteins was furthermore confirmed in elderly persons [139].",
              "MVA vector vaccines rapidly induce strong antigen-specific CD4+ T helper cell as well as CD8+ effector T-cell immunity, leading to robust and durable protective immune responses.",

              "Up to now, only 6 adjuvants have been licensed in combination with influenza vaccines (Alum, MF59, AS03, AF03, virosomes and heat labile enterotoxin) but not all are currently in use [25].",

              "For instance, multiple studies indicate that the addition of the oil-in-water adjuvant MF59 leads to a faster and higher antibody induction and a better cellular immune repose compared to nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines [146, 148, 150, 151].",
              "MF59 was reported to provoke proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as chemoattractants (eg, CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL8) and to contribute to the recruitment, activation, and maturation of antigen-presenting cells (eg, dendritic cell and macrophages) at the injection site [25, 152].",

              "The Asteroid Hit by NASA Seems to Be Moving Strangely, High School ...",
              "Sections After the DART spacecraft made contact with Dimorphos last year, the space rock\u2019s orbit is declining more than expected, according to preliminary research Carlyn Kranking Assistant Editor, Science and Innovation Nearly a year has passed since NASA deliberately crashed a $300 million spacecraft into an asteroid.",
              "In a first-of-its-kind feat, the agency\u2019s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) craft slammed into the space rock Dimorphos at 14,000 miles per hour on September 26, 2022.",
              "Dimorphos orbits another asteroid called Didymos, and while neither object posed a threat to Earth, the feat showed the world that NASA could nudge an asteroid and alter its trajectory\u2014an action that might come in handy if a planetary defense scenario were to materialize in the future.",
              "The tiny-but-mighty DART craft shortened Dimorphos\u2019 orbital period, or the time it takes to circle Didymos, by about 33 minutes.",
              "It looked like a tidy conclusion to a tale of success, but according to new research, the story didn\u2019t end there.",
              "From September to early November last year, a high school teacher and his students used the observatory at their California school to study the asteroid, and they found its orbit had decreased by another full minute compared to NASA\u2019s numbers, reports New Scientist\u2019s Jonathan O\u2019Callaghan.",
              "The finding brought the asteroid\u2019s orbital period to 34 minutes shorter than it was pre-impact.",
              "\u201cThat was inconsistent at an uncomfortable level,\u201d Jonathan Swift, a math and science teacher at the Thacher School who took part in the research, tells New Scientist.",
              "\u201cWe tried our best to find the crack in what we had done, but we couldn\u2019t find anything.",
              "\u201d Dimorphos\u2019 unexpected behavior is not a cause for alarm\u2014the asteroid still poses no threat to Earth\u2014but it could teach scientists more about asteroid deflection.",
              "Prior to DART, no other mission had ever conducted a planetary defense test, so Dimorphos is the only real-world example to learn from.",
              "The mission always had uncertainties.",
              "\u201cIf an asteroid were constructed as a monolithic rock, similar to the rocks we find on the ground, the deflection and calculations would be straightforward,\u201d Peter Veres, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian, who was not involved in the study, tells Smithsonian magazine in an email.",
              "\u201cInstead, we already knew from ground-based observations and several space missions that asteroids are often rubble piles\u2014loosely aggregated spheres of large and small boulders, dust and sometimes ice, with numerous empty spaces.",
              "\u201d Hitting one of these asteroids, Veres says, is almost more like striking a sponge than a rock, and it\u2019s harder to predict the impact\u2019s results.",
              "Swift\u2019s team shared their surprising new research at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in June and posted a preprint of their paper on the online server Arxiv in August.",
              "According to Veres, the team relied on a widely used method and gathered enough data points to conclude that Dimorphos\u2019 orbit is degrading.",
              "As for why this may be happening, scientists only have guesses so far.",
              "One idea is that Dimorphos was once tidally locked to Didymos\u2014meaning that, like Earth\u2019s moon, the same side of the satellite always faced its host.",
              "But now, after the DART mission, this alignment might have been broken, causing Dimorphos to tumble around as the system\u2019s tidal forces change its orbit.",
              "If this is the case, Veres says, Dimorphos will likely settle back into a tidally locked state over time.",
              "Perhaps more likely, however, is the second idea, as Harrison Agrusa, a DART team member at the Co\u0302te d\u2019Azur Observatory in France who was not involved in the new research, tells New Scientist.",
              "Material disturbed from Dimorphos during impact might have orbited the asteroid for a while before falling back to its surface, resulting in more collisions that reduced its orbital period even further.",
              "If the new findings are true, this wouldn\u2019t be the first unintended consequence of NASA\u2019s DART mission.",
              "Over the year since the ill-fated spacecraft met its doom at Dimorphos, researchers have been learning increasingly more about the crash\u2019s effects.",
              "Following the DART collision, the Hubble Space Telescope made 18 observations of Dimorphos and Didymos.",
              "But one of the images revealed an \u201cunexpected development\u201d: The impacted asteroid had not one, but two tails of debris coming off of it, per the European Space Agency.",
              "The first part of the tail appeared shortly after DART smashed into Dimorphos, and photographers on Earth captured an image of it: a trail of debris that stretched for some 6,000 miles.",
              "Hubble revealed a second, more northern tail formed sometime between October 2 and 8, 2022, roughly one to two weeks after the impact.",
              "Astronomers aren\u2019t exactly sure why this double tail was created, though the trait is common in active asteroids and comets.",
              "Then, this year, researchers studying Dimorphos got another shock: The asteroid was surrounded by a \u201cboulder swarm\u201d of rock fragments that got broken off during the NASA spacecraft\u2019s collision, according to a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters in July.",
              "The cloud of newly made space debris consists of 37 boulders that range in size from 3 feet to 22 feet across.",
              "While some amount of ejected material from the crash was expected, last year\u2019s collision was not meant to blow Dimorphos to smithereens.",
              "In the event of a real asteroid threat, blasting pieces from the rock might actually increase the danger to Earth, sending a \u201ccluster of threatening boulders heading in our direction,\u201d per NASA.",
              "But in the case of Dimorphos, none of these newly created rocks can damage our home planet\u2014they\u2019re all too far away.",
              "And right now, they\u2019re moving at about half a mile per hour, or the walking speed of a giant tortoise.",
              "Scientists have hypothesized these rocks either broke off from Dimorphos at the impact site after the crash or were shaken from the asteroid due to seismic waves caused by the spacecraft\u2019s impact.",
              "These boulders are \u201canother mystery that could be related to the unexpected behavior\u201d of Dimorphos revealed in the new study, Veres says.",
              "Dimorphos, at roughly 6.",
              "8 million miles away, is just one of several space objects that astronomers have their eyes on.",
              "According to NASA\u2019s latest count, published August 31, surveys have identified more than 32,000 near-Earth asteroids, or those that come within 30 million miles of our planet\u2019s orbit.",
              "The agency estimates some 14,000 near-Earth asteroids larger than 140 meters might still be undiscovered, as well as 50 massive ones that measure more than one kilometer across.",
              "Still, the likelihood of an impact is low\u2014over the next century, no known asteroid poses a significant threat to Earth, NASA wrote in June.",
              "The object known to be the highest risk to our planet is an asteroid called 2009 FD\u2014and even that rock has only a 1 in 714, or less than 2 percent, chance of hitting Earth in the year 2185.",
              "But asteroids are more than just flying potential hazards\u2014they could also hold natural resources such as water, precious metals and organic material that might one day fuel space exploration or enable manufacturing for missions.",
              "NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is slated to return to Earth later this month, toting a piece of the asteroid Bennu that it collected and is carrying back from more than 46 million miles away.",
              "The sample could reveal information on the dawn of our solar system, as well as the properties of asteroids that could potentially collide with our planet.",
              "Space agencies will also continue to study Dimorphos in the coming years, watching the consequences of the DART mission unfold.",
              "The European Space Agency plans to launch its Hera spacecraft in October 2024, which will rendezvous with Dimorphos in December 2026 and potentially get a much clearer idea of what happened after the crash.",
              "Meanwhile, the DART team has been making its own observations of the asteroid over the last year, and it will release its findings within the next few weeks.",
              "These, like the new data from California, are expected to show that Dimorphos\u2019 orbital period has continued to drop\u2014but only by about 15 seconds, New Scientist reports.",
              "\u201cThe Didymos-Dimorphos system has not been forgotten, and we will learn a lot of new outcomes and theories in upcoming weeks,\u201d Veres says.",
              "\u201cAll the unexpected findings from the DART mission will help us comprehend how such impacts function and prepare for an effective kinetic impact mission should one ever be necessary to divert an object that could potentially be on a direct collision course with Earth.",
