    "response": "There have been many technological advancements in the field of prosthetics that have improved the quality of life for amputees. Some of the major ones are:\n\n- **Sensory feedback**: This allows amputees to feel sensations such as touch, pressure, and temperature from their prosthetic limbs. For example, a system developed by Integrum AB in Sweden uses electrodes implanted in the muscles and nerves of the amputated arm to transmit signals from force sensors in the prosthetic thumb to the brain[^1^] [^2^].\n- **Artificial intelligence**: This enables amputees to control their prosthetic limbs more intuitively and naturally by using machine learning algorithms that adapt to their individual preferences and movements. For example, a system developed by COAPT in Chicago uses sensors placed on the stump of the amputated arm to capture an array of commands coming from the brain and translate them into prosthetic motions[^3^] [^4^].\n- **3-D printing**: This allows for more customized and affordable prosthetic devices that can be tailored to the specific needs and anatomy of each amputee. For example, a company called Open Bionics in the UK uses 3-D scanning and printing to create lightweight and realistic-looking bionic hands that can be controlled by muscle signals[^1^] [^4^].\n\nThese are just some of the examples of how new technology advancements have enhanced the modern prosthetic devices and made them more functional, comfortable, and lifelike for amputees.",

              "Finally, in an optimal sensory feedback restoration device, all the communication between the controller, stimulator and prosthesis sensors need to be in quasi-real time with an unperceivable delay (as in the mammalian somatosensory system).",
              "Human peripheral nerves are cable-like structures in which the axons are grouped through protective sheets of connective tissue (called endoneurium).",
              "Groups of axons (also named fibres) are organized into fascicles, which in turn are disposed into bundles.",
              "The nerve itself is enfolded in a protective sheet (called the epineurium), which is loosely connected to the bundles inside, enabling the fascicles to move.",
              "The nerve can thus deform under an external pressure.",
              "Afferent fibres convey the information from the periphery to the brain, and efferent fibres from the brain to the periphery.",

              "There are four types of tactile fibre and they are connected to four different mechanoreceptors in the glabrous skin (Fig.",
              "2b).",
              "Fast-adapting type I (FAI) and type II (FAII) fibres respond only during dynamic phases of tissue deformation (for example, when there is contact with a surface).",
              "Accordingly, intraneural electrical stimulation of these afferents usually elicits perception of intermittent tapping/flutter17.",
              "Slowly adapting type I (SAI) and type II (SAII) fibres respond to sustained deformations of the skin.",
              "SAI fibres encode static or low-frequency changes in tissue deformation (for example, maintaining contact with a surface) and evoke sensations of sustained pressure with electrical stimulation17.",
              "SAII fibres encode for skin stretches and generally, when stimulated, do not elicit a sensation17.",
              "FAI fibres are the most numerous (Fig.",
              "2c).",
              "Type I fibres have smaller receptive fields\u2014that is, the extent of skin activating the receptor in presence of a tactile stimulus\u2014compared with type II afferents (Fig.",

              "Afferents innervate the skin progressively more towards the distal part of the extremities (Fig.",

              "In the foot, also the lateral part of the sole is more innervated than the medial one18.",
              "Tactile afferents deliver messages to the central nervous system, in two manners19: the rate code (the intensity of a stimulus is proportional to the firing rate of the fibre) and the population code (the intensity of a stimulus is proportional to the number of fibres that are activated).",
              "These strategies are used, for example, to convey the information of intensity of a stimulus19.",
              "Combinations or variations of these strategies are adopted to provide the brain with more sophisticated touch features.",
              "Embossed letters are coded through a spatial code: subgroups of fibres fire when they get in contact with a protuberance on an object, while others do not.",
              "Very small textures are communicated to the brain through a temporal code (that is, an exact sequence of spikes)20.",
              "Direct contact force or shape are encoded by the spike latency code: two groups of fibres fire with a specific latency21.",
              "Proprioceptors are responsible for the senses of posture and movement of the trunk and limbs, as well as of the sense of force.",
              "There are three main types of proprioceptive fibre in the muscles that are connected to two main proprioceptors22.",
              "(1) Type Ia fibres are connected to muscle spindles (which are embedded within the muscle fibres and make up the bulk of the muscle) and give information on the length of the muscle and the velocity of its change.",
              "(2) Type II fibres are similar to type Ia fibres but they only code for the length of the muscle.",
              "(3) Type Ib fibres are connected to Golgi tendon organs (embedded within the tendons) and give information on the force exerted by the muscles.",
              "Stimulation of these fibres does not often elicit a sensation23.",
              "These proprioceptors can be activated or inhibited through vibrations over muscle tendons22.",
              "Joint receptors are connected to slowly adapting afferents, and evoke a sensation of displacement or a deep sensation from the joint when targeted with electrical stimulation23.",
              "Cutaneous stimulation of amputees\u2019 remaining extremities, not innervated by the afferents once connected to the missing limbs, is an example of technology that restores non-somatotopic sensations.",
              "Devices based on this technique (also named sensory remapping) have been developed and tested with volunteers24,25.",
              "Users are usually provided with coded stimuli (such as modulation of pulse rate) and learn to relate these codes to specific sensory information, for example, pinch force26.",
              "However, intensive cognitive load is usually required for a user to correctly interpret the coded signal27.",
              "Other problems of the approaches using remapped mechano-, vibro-tactile or electro-cutaneous feedback include: artefacts on the recoding system used for the prosthesis control due to the stimulation28, the miniaturization of the systems, power consumption and the quality of the sensation elicited, which is not very pleasant.",
              "These issues probably prevent the clinical adoption of such technologies, despite the great advantage of not requiring any surgical intervention.",
              "The design of a sensory feedback restoration device varies for upper- and lower-limb amputees.",
              "The sciatic nerve, which innervates the foot and lower leg, is more than twice as large as the median and ulnar nerves, which run to the fingers and palms, and it is also difficult to reach through the big leg muscles.",
              "The density and placement of the receptors are different between upper and lower limbs.",
              "Upper-limb amputees can use their intact hand for almost all activities, while amputees that are missing part of the leg cannot ambulate without a prosthesis.",
              "A failed manipulation can lead to a broken glass, whereas a failed step could lead to a fall.",
              "A more proximal amputation entails a greater disability7,8 (different levels of amputations are depicted in Fig.",
              "1), as persons with a more proximal amputation have less of a residual neuromuscular structure to interface via different surgery and implantable approaches.",
              "Also, more proximal levels of amputation require more complexity in the sensory feedback restoration, as larger amounts of information need to be transmitted;",
              "for example, the proprioception from the prosthetic knee is not needed for a transtibial amputee.",
              "As the peripheral nervous tissue is composed of a matrix of optimally integrated axons and connective tissues, it is reasonably stiff;",
              "however, at the same time, it is soft, as axons and bundles can slide on each other guaranteeing accommodation to the movements of the body by bending and stretching.",

              "It shows that the inability of many studies to speak to the issue of meaningful performance improvements in real-life scenarios is caused by the complexity of the interactions of supplementary sensory feedback with other types of feedback along with other portions of the motor control process.",
              "To do this, the present manuscript frames the question of supplementary feedback from the perspective of computational motor control, providing a brief review of the main advances in that field over the last 20 years.",
              "It then separates the studies on the closed-loop prosthesis control into distinct categories, which are defined by relating the impact of feedback to the relevant components of the motor control framework, and reviews the work that has been done over the last 50+ years in each of those categories.",

              "A caveat with this approach is that stimulation, which is clearly perceived during investigation of the perception threshold when the subject is seated and focused, may not be perceivable during active object manipulation.",
              "The cognitive effort required by performing pick and lift repetitions may have hindered perception at the initial stage of interaction with the object, where the amplitude of the stimulation was proportional to the grasping force, and therefore low.",
              "The fact that using Continuous stimulation feedback slowed down subjects S2 and S3 may be evidence for such effect, arguably because subjects waited for the stimulation to become more clearly perceivable before proceeding with the lifting phase.",
              "In contrast, Hybrid mode, with the bio-inspired initial burst of pulses delivered at contact20, avoided this problem and possibly guided the subjects\u2019 attention to the subsequent continuous feedback.",

              "In addition, this study contributes with more data comparing machine learning controlled prosthetics with Direct Controlled prosthetics.",
              "In recent years, multiarticulate myoelectric prosthetic hands controlled using machine learning (ML) algorithms have been brought from the labs to the clinics by both commercial enterprises [1,2,3] and research groups [4,5,6,7,8].",
              "ML control can reveal the full potential of multiarticulate hands, as the clinical standard two-site \u201cDirect Control\u201d (DC) scheme is currently one of the main limiting factors in prosthetic control.",
              "In contrast to DC, ML control does not require isolated subsequent electromyographic (EMG) signals derived from two electrodes to control all available grip modes, but utilizes more intuitive control generated by patterns of muscle contractions [9].",
              "However, ML control currently suffers from robustness issues while DC is faster in tasks that only require one degree of freedom (DoF) [4, 6].",
              "The benefit of ML control is that the user does not need to actively switch between DoFs or grips.",
              "Unlike DC, ML control is not based on a direct mapping from each muscle to a direction in a DoF: it performs a complex mapping between EMG activity and control commands, thus allowing the user to generate a potentially larger set of control commands.",
              "EMG patterns are measured on the residual muscles in the stump using an array of electrodes, commonly between four to eight, then features are calculated from the EMG and used as input for a learning algorithm which maps the features to prosthetic control commands.",
              "ML control should lead to the utilisation of at least a few DoFs and grips.",
              "Use of more DoFs might reduce compensatory movements of the trunk and shoulders which are areas with many complaints for people with upper limb absence [10].",
              "Therefore, ML control might lead to better function and reduce the risk of pain and further impairment.",
              "Independent of whether DC or ML control is used, user training is required to skilfully control a myoelectric prosthesis.",
              "For DC, training focuses on contracting the two muscles used independently from each other and on executing switching commands.",
              "For ML control training focuses on adapting the (phantom) movements used for control to achieve the most distinct EMG patterns, and on performing the movements consistently [8, 11, 12].",
              "A coach assists the trainee in selecting how the movement(s) should be adapted by studying the feature space.",

              "g. flexing the little finger) the generated EMG pattern changes and becomes more distinct from other movements.",
              "We refer to this training scheme as conventional training.",
              "Conventional training has some drawbacks.",
              "Firstly, training requires a coach, which restricts training to the clinic leading to increased costs and limited training exposure.",
              "Furthermore, coaching relies on declarative statements such as \u201cwhen doing the pinch, flex the phantom little finger\u201d which induces an internal focus of attention (i.",
              "e. focus on body parts) that, compared to an external focus of attention (i.",
              "e. focus on the result), may lead to slower and less accurate motor performance as well as increased cognitive effort [13].",
              "Lastly, the possible separation of EMG patterns is limited by using movements that correspond to the actuation of the prosthesis (e.",

              "We observed that some participants prioritised using the additional DoF over completing the tasks as fast as possible.",
              "While participants knew that the outcome of the tasks was time, they also were encouraged to utilise both DoFs during functional training.",

              "We suggest future studies include more training and home training in order for participants to achieve good control.",
              "To provide additional data for comparing DC with ML control, we performed baseline measurements as proposed by Resnik et al.",

              "Similarly, to Resnik et al.",
              "we found that DC control seems to outperform ML control.",
              "However, it should be noted that all participants in our study had several years of experience using their own DC prosthesis and were nai\u0308ve to both the prosthesis hand used in the current study as well as ML control.",
              "Therefore, it is possible that with sufficient training participants would have been able to achieve better performance with ML control than with DC.",
              "A study by Kuiken et al.",
              "supports this claim [4].",
              "In their study, they showed that after one month of home use, participants tended to have better performance using ML control than DC.",
              "Future research should investigate longer training periods and/or home trials using the same prosthesis and control algorithm.",
              "A serious game as proposed in this study might be beneficial for such studies as participants can train at home without supervision using such games.",
              "During this study we learned several new things we believe are helpful for future training studies using ML control.",
              "Firstly, pre-training before performance assessments ensures that participants have some basic control and understand the basic concepts of ML control.",
              "Secondly, the importance of the socket fit should not be underestimated.",
              "Any non-ideal fit in terms of user comfort or electrode\u2013skin contact will likely have a drastic negative impact on control performance.",
              "In pilot testing we had used sockets made of plaster under the guidance of an orthopaedic technician and while initial results were promising, the plaster sockets were not robust enough when applying weight to the prosthesis which led to noise in the EMG and discomfort.",
              "We therefore advise any research group to manufacture professional sockets in trials with prolonged (home) use.",
              "Thirdly, increasing DoFs gradually appeared to be a good way to ease participants into ML control and made the transition from DC to ML control easier.",
              "Lastly, including functional training as part of the training scheme gave participants the opportunity to learn how external factors like weight and posture affects control which helped them to adapt.",
              "The main limitations of this study are the limited sample size and the number of training sessions.",
              "While we recruited eight participants, half of them dropped out of the study for various reasons.",
              "Unfortunately, due to limited resources, we were unable to find new participants to replace those that dropped out of the study.",
              "In terms of the number of training sessions, we made a trade-off between resources, providing sufficient training and making participant recruitment feasible.",
              "We believe recruiting participants will become more difficult if more training sessions are added, but from our results it is also evident that additional training sessions are needed.",
              "We suggest that future research combines training sessions with a lengthy home trial.",
              "In our case, a home-trial was not feasible due to time constraints, limited financial resources, hardware availability and safety issues.",
              "Given that there are now at least two commercial ML control systems on the market in Europe and in the US, it should be feasible in future research to conduct a lengthy home-trial.",
              "Finally, our study only provides quantitative data which does not capture the users\u2019 satisfaction with the training scheme and the control.",
              "Such data could be measured using qualitative methods such as questionnaires which might reveal a preference for either control method which is not directly related to the functional performance we captured.",
              "To conclude, we have shown that serious games might be used for ML control training with the target population, as we found similar results in the game group compared to the conventional group.",
              "In addition, we found no consistent improvement in terms of EMG separability and consistency and no improvements in functional outcomes.",

              "It\u2019s also becoming clear that much of our attention has been focused on devices that don\u2019t fully reflect the technology\u2019s potential impact on amputees\u2019 lives.",
              "We see the daring aesthetics that can be achieved via 3D printers, and we read about the uplifting humanitarian projects.",

              "It\u2019s an elaborately engineered machine that\u2019s fabricated on industrial-grade 3D printers using state-of-the-art composites, high-level sensors, and advanced algorithms. Time will tell whether the TrueLimb endures as a prosthetic solution, but it\u2019s already established as a credible competitor in its market.",
              "A corresponding staple of mass media coverage involves the widespread disbursement of 3D-printed limbs in developing regions at little or no cost.",
              "These devices improve the lives of thousands of amputees who would otherwise lack access to even a basic prosthesis.",
              "But because they\u2019re virtually given away, they feed the belief that 3D printers can only manufacture rudimentary, low-cost gadgets.",

              "However, this powerful procedure is now being used among patients with transradial, transfemoral, and transtibial amputations to optimize myoelectric prosthesis functionality (in the upper extremity) and to prevent and treat painful neuromas (in the upper and lower extremities) [18, 30, 31, 32\u2022, 33, 34\u2022\u2022, 35].",

              "Plasticity of the human brain has potential to allow for greater control and feedback from new prosthetic devices.",
              "Sensory feedback provided by targeted reinnervation has been demonstrated to cause sensory cortical remapping, resulting in reorganization that may be advantageous for sensory feedback devices [37, 39].",
              "Like targeted muscle reinnervation, the regenerated peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) is a surgical technique that matches amputated peripheral nerves with denervated muscle grafts.",
              "Unlike TMR, the muscle targets used for RPNI are small (less than 40 mm \u00d7 20 mm \u00d7 5 mm) devascularized muscle grafts taken from either the amputated limb or elsewhere in the body and transposed to the residual limb.",
              "The transected nerves are sutured to the center of the graft and the graft is then tubularized [40].",
              "Over time, axonal regeneration occurs and the graft is reinnervated and revascularized [41].",
              "While RPNI was initially developed to provide peripheral nerve signals for myoelectric prosthesis control [42\u2022, 43], it has been successfully used to prevent and treat symptomatic neuromas and phantom pain [44, 45].",

              "Sensory feedback allows individuals to interact with their environment.",
              "Not surprisingly, a lack of sensory feedback has been cited as a cause of prosthesis rejection [47, 48].",
              "When direct sensory feedback is not provided by a prosthetic device, the patient must rely on other sensory inputs to direct the prosthesis and manipulate objects [36, 38, 49\u201351].",
              "Environment feedback is obtained by prosthetic users visually (77%), acoustically (67%), and using residual limb sensation (57%) [38, 50, 51].",
              "When using a body-powered limb, tactile feedback is generated by activation of the harness when opening the terminal device or when flexing the elbow.",
              "When it is available, tactile feedback by the prosthesis increases the amputee\u2019s sense of sense of self-identification with the prosthesis [36, 49].",
              "Many sensory implants are undergoing research and development.",
              "These range from implants placed on or within peripheral nerves to those that directly stimulate the somatosensory cortex.",
              "Cuff electrodes (surgically implanted electrodes that are wrapped around a peripheral nerve) preserve nerve integrity, have been used on human subjects in multiple studies, and have shown long-term stability but lack the high selectivity of more invasive electrodes [49, 52, 53, 54\u2022, 55].",
              "In contrast, implants containing thin filaments, which are surgically inserted into a nerve, provide more selectivity but may result in intraneural scarring, which may reduce their utility and longevity [49, 54\u2022, 56, 57].",
              "New implantation techniques including syringe injection (as opposed to surgical implantation) are under development as new materials and smaller devices are refined [58].",
              "Some implants, including the USEA, have been able to simultaneously provide both sensation (light touch and proprioception) and motor control of prostheses [22\u2022\u2022, 23].",
              "Despite these promising advances, implanted sensory technology is still under investigation and will require further study prior to routine clinical use [54\u2022].",
