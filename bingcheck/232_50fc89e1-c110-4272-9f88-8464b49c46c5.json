    "query": "What is the history and cultural significance behind the traditional Mexican celebration of Dia de los Muertos, and how has it evolved over time to become a prominent aspect of Mexican culture and identity?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Dia de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a Mexican holiday that celebrates and honors the lives of the deceased relatives and friends. It is a blend of Mesoamerican ritual, European religion and Spanish culture, and it is celebrated each year from October 31 to November 2[^1^]. \n\nThe origins of Dia de los Muertos go back some 3,000 years, to the rituals of the Aztecs and other Nahua people who lived in what is now central Mexico. They believed that death was an integral part of life, and that the souls of the dead could visit their loved ones in the mortal world during a brief window each year[^2^]. They also believed that the dead had to go through nine challenging levels in the Land of the Dead before reaching their final resting place[^1^].\n\nWhen the Spanish conquistadores arrived in Mexico in the 16th century, they brought with them their Catholic beliefs and traditions, such as All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day, which were celebrated on November 1 and 2. These dates coincided with the Nahua rituals honoring the dead, and over time, a syncretism of cultures and customs emerged[^1^]. \n\nToday, Dia de los Muertos is celebrated globally by people of Mexican ancestry and others who appreciate its meaning and beauty. The holiday involves various traditions, such as visiting gravesites, making altars or ofrendas for the dead, leaving offerings of food, drink, flowers and personal items, dressing up in costumes and skull makeup, and participating in parades and festivals[^1^] [^2^]. The holiday is also a way of affirming the role of individuals within society and reinforcing the political and social status of Mexico's indigenous communities[^3^].\n\nDia de los Muertos has evolved over time to become a prominent aspect of Mexican culture and identity. It reflects the diversity and richness of Mexico's history and heritage, as well as its resilience and creativity in the face of adversity. It also expresses a universal human desire to connect with our ancestors and celebrate the cycle of life[^2^].",

              "You can also include a representation of the four elements, so a candle or copal \u2013 incense \u2013 for fire, a cup of water, and then the wind and earth might be represented by papel picado.",
              "Some people, depending on where you are in the world, go to the cemetery to build their altars.",
              "But, because of migration, sometimes we're not in the places where our loved ones are buried, so you make the altars in your home.",
              "But many people do it differently: Some people have full-on parties, and some people have a velacio\u0301n, or observance, which means you just honor your loved ones not necessarily with prayer, but in a solemn space.",
              "In those two days, you spend time with those memories.",
              "And you don't leave the altar up for days, because it's sacred.",
              "You take the time to close the ceremony or that moment of engagement with your memories and those ancestors who are no longer with us.",
              "Q: Di\u0301a de los Muertos is often conflated with Halloween, despite having no connection to that holiday.",
              "Why do you think that happens, and why can it be problematic to associate the two?",
              "A: I think it's just because of the time of year \u2013 they're both in the fall.",
              "I started seeing people dress up and they would say, \"I'm Di\u0301a de los Muertos for Halloween,\" and it would be so clear to me that they had no idea what they were talking about.",
              "It would be different to dress up as a catrin or a catrina, which is an embodiment of a calaca, or a skeleton.",
              "But because they start conflating the two, you see people not only dressing up as \"Di\u0301a de los Muertos\" for Halloween, but you also see Halloween parties with altars.",
              "They should be different things.",
              "Q: The calaveras, or skulls, and calacas, or skeletons, have become icons of Di\u0301a de los Muertos.",
              "How did that originate, and what do the symbols mean?",
              "A: I couldn't tell you exactly when people started using these, but I'm assuming it has to do with the early 20th-century political artist Jose\u0301 Posada, who started making these calacas that we're familiar with now, drawing from his sort of play on life and death and war and poverty and culture.",
              "Drawing on that tradition, people started using face-painting as an example of life and death, so you'll see that.",
              "At the most basic level, the skulls represent a departed spirit.",
              "While we're drawing from an ancestral tradition, it's not like the sugar skulls were there when these traditions, practices and rituals started.",
              "But culture and traditions evolve.",
              "This imagery is one of the most obvious ways to convey this notion of life and death, our mortality as humans, and our constant dance with life and death.",
              "Q: How can people learn more about the traditions or even participate?",
              "A: There are some really great books out there.",

              "Mourning can be a very isolating thing, and some people want to be in community to connect with others going through a similar experience.",
              "Or, you can make your own altar and it can just be very simple \u2013 a candle and a photo.",
              "I think that's a beautiful way to keep those people we love present and to teach our families about them.",
              "I have a daughter, and she might not have known my father but because I bring him into my home every year, she feels connected to him.",

              "My father passed away suddenly when I was 20, and it was just such a life-changing experience that I needed to find a way to remain connected to him.",
              "Around that time is when I also started learning more about this tradition and learning more about how to create the altar and what it signifies.",
              "For me, it was a tradition that I started to do that then expanded to my immediate family.",
              "And now it's something that my daughter can say she was raised with because I've been making altars with her for her entire life.",
              "This year, I'll be thinking about all of the families who have lost loved ones to COVID, and I'll be thinking about my own personal losses this year.",

              "By: Iva\u0301n Roma\u0301n Updated: October 18, 2023 | Original: October 29, 2020 The Day of the Dead or Di\u0301a de Muertos is an ever-evolving holiday that traces its earliest roots to the Aztec people in what is now central Mexico.",
              "The Aztecs used skulls to honor the dead a millennium before the Day of the Dead celebrations emerged.",
              "Skulls, like the ones once placed on Aztec temples, remain a key symbol in a tradition that has continued for more than six centuries in the annual celebration to honor and commune with those who have passed on.",
              "Once the Spanish conquered the Aztec empire in the 16th century, the Catholic Church moved Indigenous celebrations and rituals honoring the dead throughout the year to the Catholic dates commemorating All Saints Day and All Souls Day on November 1 and 2.",
              "In what became known as Di\u0301a de Muertos on November 2, the Latin American Indigenous traditions and symbols to honor the dead fused with non-official Catholic practices and notions of an afterlife.",
              "The same happened on November 1 to honor children who had died.",
              "In these ceremonies, people build altars in their homes with ofrendas, offerings to their loved ones\u2019 souls.",
              "Candles light photos of the deceased and items left behind.",
              "Families read letters and poems and tell anecdotes and jokes about the dead.",
              "Offerings of tamales, chiles, water, tequila and pan de muerto, a specific bread for the occasion, are lined up by bright orange or yellow cempasu\u0301chil flowers, marigolds, whose strong scent helps guide the souls home.",
              "Copal incense, used for ceremonies back in ancient times, is lit to draw in the spirits.",
              "Clay molded sugar skulls are painted and decorated with feathers, foil and icing, with the name of the deceased written across the foreheads.",
              "Altars include all four elements of life: water, the food for earth, the candle for fire, and for wind, papel picado, colorful tissue paper folk art with cut out designs to stream across the altar or the wall.",
              "Some families also include a Christian crucifix or an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico\u2019s patron saint in the altar.",
              "In Mexico, families clean the graves at cemeteries, preparing for the spirit to come.",
              "On the night of November 2, they take food to the cemetery to attract the spirits and to share in a community celebration.",
              "Bands perform and people dance to please the visiting souls.",
              "\u201cPeople are really dead when you forget about them, and if you think about them, they are alive in your mind, they are alive in your heart,\u201d says Mary J.",
              "Andrade, a journalist and author of eight books about the Day of the Dead.",
              "\u201cWhen people are creating an altar, they are thinking about that person who is gone and thinking about their own mortality, to be strong, to accept it with dignity.",
              "\u201d Honoring and communing with the dead continued throughout the turbulent 36 years that 50 governments ruled Mexico after it won its independence from Spain in 1821.",
              "When the Mexican Liberal Party led by Benito Jua\u0301rez won the War of Reform in December 1860, the separation of church and state prevailed, but Di\u0301a de Muertos remained a religious celebration for many in the rural heartland of Mexico.",
              "Elsewhere, the holiday became more secular and popularized as part of the national culture.",
              "Some started the holiday\u2019s traditions as a form of political commentary.",
              "Like the funny epitaphs friends of the deceased told in their homes to honor them, some wrote calaveras literarias (skulls literature)\u2014short poems and mock epitaphs\u2014to mock living politicians or political criticism in the press.",
              "\u201cThis kind of thing happens alongside the more intimate observation of the family altar,\u201d says Claudio Lomnitz, an anthropologist at Columbia University and author of Death and the Idea of Mexico.",
              "\u201cThey are not in opposition to one another.",
              "\u201d In Mexico\u2019s thriving political art scene in the early 20th century, printmaker and lithographer Jose Guadalupe Posada put the image of the calaveras or skulls and skeletal figures in his art mocking politicians, and commenting on revolutionary politics, religion and death.",
              "His most well-known work, La Calavera Catrina, or Elegant Skull, is a 1910 zinc etching featuring a female skeleton.",
              "The satirical work was meant to portray a woman covering up her Indigenous cultural heritage with a French dress, a fancy hat, and lots of makeup to make her skin look whiter.",
              "The title sentence of his original La Catrina leaflet, published a year before the start of the Mexican Revolution in 1911, read \u201cThose garbanceras who today are coated with makeup will end up as deformed skulls.",
              "\u201d La Catrina became the public face of the festive Di\u0301a de Muertos in processions and revelry.",
              "Mexican painter Diego Rivera placed a Catrina in an ostentatious full-length gown at the center his mural, completed in 1947, portraying the end of Mexico\u2019s Revolutionary War.",
              "La Catrina\u2019s elegant clothes of a \u201cdandy\u201d denote a mocking celebration, while her smile emerging through her pompous appearance reminds revelers to accept the common destiny of mortality.",
              "Over decades, celebrations honoring the dead\u2014skulls and all\u2014spread north into the rest of Mexico and throughout much of the United States and abroad.",
              "Schools and museums from coast to coast exhibit altars and teach children how to cut up the colorful papel picado folk art to represent the wind helping souls make their way home.",
              "In the 1970s, the Chicano Movement tapped the holiday\u2019s customs with public altars, art exhibits and processions to celebrate Mexican heritage and call out discrimination.",
              "In the 1980s, Day of the Dead altars were set up for victims of the AIDS epidemic, for the thousands of people who disappeared during Mexico\u2019s drug war and for those lost in Mexico\u2019s 1985 earthquake.",
              "In 2019, mourners set up a giant altar with ofrendas, or offerings, near a Walmart in El Paso, Texas where a gunman targeting Latinos killed 22 people.",
              "As Lomnitz explains, one reason why more and more people may be taking part in Di\u0301a de Muertos celebrations is that the holiday addresses a reality that is rarely acknowledged by modern cultures\u2014our own mortality.",
              "\u201cIt creates a space for communication between the living and the dead.",
              "Where else do people have that?",

              "holiday.",
              "But the two holidays express fundamentally different beliefs.",
              "While Halloween has its origins in Christian tradition, Day of the Dead has indigenous roots as a celebration of the Aztec goddess of death.",
              "Day of the Dead can be traced back to the native peoples of central and southern Mexico, the regions where I conduct my archaeological research.",
              "When the Spanish arrived in central Mexico 500 years ago, the region had millions of indigenous inhabitants.",
              "The conquistadores largely characterized them as Aztecs because, at the time, they were united under the expansive Aztec empire.",
              "According to colonial period records, the Aztec empire was formed in A.",
              "D.",
              "1427, only about a century before the arrival of Spanish .",
              "But the celebration that Mexicans now call Di\u0301a de los Muertos almost certainly existed many centuries earlier, perhaps originating with the Toltec people of central Mexico.",
              "In any case, by the time the Spanish conquistadors invaded in 1519, the Aztecs recognized a wide pantheon of gods, which included a goddess of death and the underworld named Mictecacihuatl.",
              "She was celebrated throughout the entire ninth month of the Aztec calendar, a 20-day month that corresponded roughly to late July and early August.",
              "Aztec mythology tells that Mictecacihuatl was sacrificed as a baby and magically grew to adulthood in the underworld, where she married.",
              "With her husband, she presided over the underworld.",
              "Mictecacihuatl \u2013 who is often depicted with flayed skin and a gaping, skeletal jaw \u2013 was linked to both death and resurrection.",
              "According to one myth, Mictecacihuatl and her husband collected bones so that they might be returned to the land of the living and restored by the gods.",
              "The Aztecs appeased these fearsome underworld gods by burying their dead with food and precious objects.",
              "Archaeologists and historians know relatively little about the details of the month-long celebration of Mictecacihuatl, but say it likely involved burning incense, song and dance, and blood sacrifice \u2013 customary practices in many Aztec rituals.",
              "The Spanish invaders of Mexico were Catholic, and they worked hard to evangelize native peoples.",
              "To stamp out lingering indigenous beliefs, they demolished religious temples, burned indigenous idols and destroyed Aztec books.",
              "But indigenous people in Mexico, as across the Americas, resisted Spanish efforts to eradicate their culture.",
              "Instead, they often blended their own religious and cultural practices with those imposed on them by the Spanish.",
              "Perhaps the best-known symbol of the ethnic and cultural mixing that defines modern Mexico is La Virgen de Guadalupe, a uniquely Mexican Virgin Mary.",
              "Many Mexican Catholics believe that in 1531 the Virgin appeared to Juan Diego, an indigenous Mexican farmer, and in his native language of Nahuatl told him to build a shrine to her.",
              "Today the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City is among the world\u2019s most visited holy sites.",
              "Day of the Dead is almost certainly a similar case of blended cultures.",
              "Spanish conquerors faced difficulty in convincing native peoples to give up their rituals honoring death goddess Mictecihuatl.",
              "The compromise was to move these indigenous festivities from late July to early November to correspond with Allhallowtide \u2013 the three-day Christian observance of All Saints\u2019 Eve, All Saints\u2019 Day and All Souls\u2019 Day.",
              "With this move, the holiday was nominally connected to Catholicism.",
              "But many practices and beliefs associated with the worship of the dead remained deeply indigenous.",

              "\u201d These include homemade sugar skulls, decorated home altars, the fantastical spirit animals called alebrijes and images of convivial calaveras \u2013 skeletons \u2013 enjoying the afterlife in their finest regalia.",
              "The use of Mexican marigolds to adorn altars and graves on Day of the Dead probably has indigenous origins.",

              "Many indigenous peoples across Mesoamerica had altars in their houses or patios.",
              "These were used to perform household rituals, worship gods and communicate with ancestors.",
              "The bones, skulls and skeletons that are so iconic of Day of the Dead are fundamentally indigenous, too.",
              "Many Aztecs gods were depicted as skeletal.",

              "The dead must pass many challenges, such as crossing a mountain range where the mountains crash into each other, a field with wind that blows flesh-scraping knives, and a river of blood with fearsome jaguars.",

              "By Leigh Thelmadatter for Mexico News Daily One of the most ubiquitous manifestations of Day of the Dead is the ofrenda, a word that can be translated both as \u201caltar\u201d and \u201coffering\u201d because it is indeed both.",
              "These highly decorated tables filled with food, photos, candles, whimsical figures and more have their origins in the Mesoamerican belief that the dead return home once a year.",
              "Mexicans prepare for that occasion not in dread but rather as a family reunion.",
              "The ritual is millennia old, but it has seen some significant changes in the past century.",
              "Essentially, it has been extended from a home or small-community ritual to a major expression of mexicanidad or Mexican identity.",
              "Despite its connection with the afterworld, Day of the Dead altars are not considered religious and are not part of official Catholic rites.",
              "They developed as one of many examples of syncretism between indigenous and European beliefs.",
              "Aerial view of the altar set up in Mexico City\u2019s main zo\u0301calo in 2021.",
              "Ofrendas are set up not only in homes but also in more public places like cemeteries.",
              "Graves are cleaned and repaired for the occasion, and many families spend hours here, sometimes even the night.",
              "Other notable locations can host ofrendas as well, the most famous of which is Lake Pa\u0301tzcuaro in Michoaca\u0301n.",
              "The rise of setting up ofrendas in public spaces has much to do with the federal government\u2019s promotion of a concept of Mexican identity promoted after the Revolution.",
              "The new government\u2019s Education Ministry allied with artists and others starting in the 1920s to promote a national identity based on indigenous as well as European roots.",
              "This might seem obvious today, but back then, it was a radical idea.",
              "Among many other elements of traditional culture, images of ofrendas found their way into art and publications, and the altars themselves began to appear in schools and other public places.",
              "But why has this particular expression of mexicanidad become so popular all over Mexico and even beyond?",
              "First, you do not need to believe that spirits literally return on November 2 to find significance in remembering lost loved ones.",
              "Being mostly divorced from its religious roots and crossing many social and ethnic lines, ofrendas can exist in more secular situations and supported by public entities.",
              "In essence, ofrendas found in schools, museums and government buildings are a cultural and social activity meant to emphasize shared bonds.",
              "Until the 1980s, these altars were not common in northern Mexico because norten\u0303os have a different pre-Hispanic heritage and a modern culture more influenced by Mexico\u2019s northern neighbor.",
              "But with a strong rise in the popularity of Halloween, federal cultural authorities were alarmed.",
              "A new push to promote Day of the Dead was initiated, with public altars serving as focal points for community activities as an alternative to a \u201cdegenerate\u201d gringo party.",
              "The effort has been largely successful.",
              "The holiday is part of the Mexican consciousness in all parts of the country, even if the north still keeps certain aspects of Halloween such as costumes.",
              "Public ofrendas are based on the ones that have been built in homes for millenia, especially in areas still maintaining strong local traditions.",
              "They are most often sponsored by a local government, which provides at least materials and sometimes labor.",
              "These ofrendas are larger than their home counterparts, and depending on budget, can be monumental, covering entire plazas.",
              "But these altars are not always large-scale.",
              "Authorities may decide to make substitutions, such as lights instead of candles, for safety reasons.",
              "More striking, perhaps, is the addition of new elements.",
              "Photos of notables who have recently died, as well as images related to local and national history are natural extensions of the traditional ofrenda concept.",
              "The appearance of elements related to the local economy is not uncommon either, especially if that commodity is a foodstuff.",
              "The popularity of animated skeletal figures means that these altars can also pay homage to local dance and other culturally important activities.",
              "In central Mexico, ofrendas can be surrounded by intricate arrangements of colored sawdust and other materials to create temporary \u201ccarpets,\u201d a tradition taken from processions.",
              "In areas where Day of the Dead activities are relatively recent, ofrendas are more likely to integrate decorations made of plastics and other modern materials and even include light and sound displays.",
