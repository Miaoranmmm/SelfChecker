    "query": "What was the most expensive artwork ever sold at an auction, and what makes it so valuable?",
    "response": "According to the search results, the most expensive artwork ever sold at an auction is **Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Salvator Mundi**, which sold for **$450.3 million** on November 15, 2017 at Christie\u2019s[^1^] [^2^]. The painting depicts Jesus Christ as the savior of the world, holding a crystal orb and blessing the viewer with his right hand. It is one of the few surviving paintings by Leonardo da Vinci and has a long and complex history of ownership and restoration. It is considered a masterpiece of Renaissance art and a rare example of Leonardo's religious paintings[^1^] [^2^].\n\nSome of the factors that make this painting so valuable are:\n\n- Its artistic quality and significance: Leonardo da Vinci was one of the most influential and innovative artists of his time, and his paintings are admired for their realism, expression, and technique. Salvator Mundi is a stunning example of his skill and style, showing his mastery of light, shadow, anatomy, perspective, and symbolism[^1^] [^2^].\n- Its rarity and provenance: Leonardo da Vinci painted very few works in his lifetime, and only about 15 of them are known to exist today. Salvator Mundi is the only one in private hands, making it extremely rare and desirable for collectors. The painting also has a fascinating history of ownership, passing through the hands of kings, nobles, merchants, and dealers over the centuries. It was once part of the royal collection of King Charles I of England, and later belonged to King Louis XIV of France. It was lost for many years until it was rediscovered in 2005 and authenticated as a genuine Leonardo after extensive research and restoration[^1^] [^2^].\n- Its market demand and competition: The painting attracted a lot of attention and interest from buyers around the world when it was put up for auction in 2017. It was marketed as \"the last da Vinci\" and \"the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 21st century\". The bidding war lasted for 19 minutes and involved at least six bidders who drove up the price to a record-breaking level. The identity of the buyer remains unknown, but some reports suggest that it was purchased by a Saudi prince on behalf of the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum[^1^] [^2^].\n\nThese are some of the reasons why Salvator Mundi is the most expensive artwork ever sold at an auction.",

              "Given the incredible price and the geopolitical mysteries surrounding its new ownership (it is reported to have been purchased by Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammad bin Salman as a gift to the Louvre Abu Dhabi), all manner of conspiracy theories have surfaced around the painting.",
              "Much attention has focused on whether the extensively restored painting can be considered a Leonardo original at all, and one of the biggest questions concerns the crystal orb that Christ holds, which symbolizes the earth and is a key element of any composition featuring the \u201cSalvator Mundi,\u201d Latin for \u201cSavior of the World.",
              "\u201d For instance, Michael Daley, director of ArtWatch UK, noted that one of his reasons for thinking the painting was not a Leonardo original was the fact that the orb didn\u2019t refract light realistically, even though supposedly later copies of the painting did.",

              "1499\u20131510.",
              "[n 1] Long thought to be a copy of a lost original veiled with overpainting, it was rediscovered, restored, and included in a major exhibition of Leonardo's work at the National Gallery, London, in 2011\u20132012.",
              "[2] Auction house Christie's stated just after selling the work in 2017 that most leading scholars consider it to be an original work by Leonardo, but this attribution has been disputed by other leading specialists, some of whom propose that he only contributed certain elements;",
              "and others who believe that the extensive damage prevents a definitive attribution.",
              "The painting depicts Jesus Christ in an anachronistic blue Renaissance dress, making the sign of the cross with his right hand, while holding a transparent, non-refracting crystal orb in his left, signaling his role as Salvator Mundi and representing the 'celestial sphere' of the heavens.",
              "Approximately thirty copies and variations of the work by pupils and followers of Leonardo have been identified.",
              "[3] Two preparatory chalk and ink drawings of the drapery by Leonardo are held in the British Royal Collection.",
              "[4][5] The painting was sold at auction for US$450.",
              "3 million on 15 November 2017 by Christie's in New York to Prince Badr bin Abdullah Al Saud, setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.",
              "Prince Badr allegedly made the purchase on behalf of Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism,[6][7] but shortly thereafter it was reported that he was a stand-in bidder for his close ally, the Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
              "[8] The painting has not been publicly exhibited since the 2017 Christie's auction, and since late 2020 has been in storage in Saudi Arabia reportedly awaiting a museum and cultural center to be completed in Al-'Ula.",
              "[9][10] Art historians have suggested several possibilities for when the work was executed and who the patron may have been.",
              "Auction house Christie's stated that it was probably commissioned around 1500, shortly after King Louis XII of France conquered the Duchy of Milan and took control of Genoa in the Second Italian War;",
              "Leonardo himself moved from Milan to Florence in 1500.",
              "[11][12] The art historian Luke Syson agrees, dating the painting to c.",
              "1499, though Martin Kemp and Frank Zo\u0308llner date the work to c.",
              "1504\u20131510 and c.",
              "1507 or later respectively.",
              "[n 1] Based on their similarity in style and materials to the studies for The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne, Carlo Pedretti dates the drapery studies in the Royal Collection, and thus the painting, to 1510\u20131515.",
              "[13] Because of the specificity of the subject, Leonardo's Salvator Mundi was probably commissioned by a specific patron rather than produced on speculation.",
              "[14] Isabella d'Este, Duchess of Milan, is cited as a possible patron as in 1504 she had wished to commission from Leonardo a \"youthful Christ of around twelve years, of that age that he had when he disputed in the Temple\", though Salvator Mundi shows a more mature Christ.",
              "[4][13][n 2] Carlo Pedretti notes that Isabella d'Este was a guest of Leonardo's patron Giuliano de'Medici in 1514 and so may have convinced the artist to complete the commission at that time.",
              "[13] Martin Kemp does not draw conclusions, but likewise discusses the possibility of Isabella d'Este as patron \u2013 though he also considers the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, Charles VIII of France, and others.",
              "[15] Joanne Snow-Smith argued that Leonardo painted the Salvator Mundi for Louis XII of France and his consort, Anne of Brittany.",
              "[16] This view was echoed by the British Royal Collection in their 2018 exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing and is supported by the early French provenance of many of the copies of the Salvator Mundi.",
              "[4][5] The painting would have been used in the context of personal devotion, as were other panels of this size and subject in the sixteenth century.",
              "[17][16] Indeed, Snow-Smith emphasizes in her writings the devotional relationship that Louis XII and Anne of Brittany had with the Salvator Mundi as a subject[18][n 3] and Frank Zo\u0308llner discussed the painting's relationship to French illuminated manuscripts in the practice of early sixteenth-century personal devotion and prayer.",
              "[22] It is possible that the painting was recorded in a 1525 inventory of Salai\u0300's estate as \"Christo in mondo de uno Dio padre\", though it is unclear to which Salvator Mundi this might refer.",
              "[14] The provenance of the painting breaks after 1530.",
              "[3] The Salvator Mundi as an image type predates Leonardo.",
              "Thus, Martin Kemp argues that on one hand Leonardo was constrained in his composition by the expected iconography of the Salvator Mundi, but on the other hand, he was able to use the image as a vehicle for spiritual communication between the spectator and the likeness of Christ.",
              "[17] The composition has its sources in Byzantine art, the imagery of which further developed in northern Europe before finding its place in the Italian states.",
              "[n 4] Snow-Smith relates the development of the Salvator Mundi to Byzantine iconography and narratives of images of Christ \"not made by human hands\".",
              "[24] Such acheiropoeta would include the Mandylion of Edessa, the Keramidion, and the Veil of Veronica.",
              "[25] Although the Salvator Mundi has its origins in the acheiropoeta, Snow-Smith discusses, the Salvator Mundi emerged in the fifteenth century through such intermediate subjects as Christ as Pantocrator, Christ in Majesty, and The Last Judgement, which like the acheiropoeta betray their Byzantine origins through their frontal depictions of Christ.",
              "[26] The frontality of Christ is shared by other images of Christ and God the Father in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, including in 'portrait' images of Christ, which feature only Christ at half-length and without the orb or blessing gesture, as well as in images of 'Christ Blessing' which does not show Christ holding an orb.",
              "[27] Images of Christ holding a sphere became widely popular following Charlemagne's adoption of the globus cruciger and the scepter.",
              "[27][n 5] The earliest true Salvator Mundi images are found in northern Europe.",
              "[n 6] Indeed, the iconography of the Salvator Mundi came to fruition in paintings such as Robert Campin's Blessing Christ and Praying Virgin and in the central panel of Rogier van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, before such images became common in Italy later in the fifteenth century.",
              "[n 7] Works by such artists as Antonello da Messina and his Christ Blessing betray the influence of Northern artists in the Italian states.",
              "[29][30] The earliest Italian example of a Salvator Mundi is likely to be Simone Martini's Salvator Mundi Surrounded by Angels at the Palais des Papes, Avignon.",
              "This image shows Christ at full length rather than the bust-length portrayals of later paintings of the Salvator Mundi.",
              "[n 8] The image of Salvator Mundi later became well known in Italy, and especially Venice, through the archetype from Giovanni Bellini, now known only through copies.",
              "[30] This includes Andrea Previtali's 1519 painting at the National Gallery, London.",
              "[31] Another fifteenth-century example can be seen in the Palazzo Ducale in Urbino in the very damaged painting by Melozzo da Forli\u0300.",
              "It has been suggested that Leonardo based his composition on this specific example.",
              "[16][29][n 9] There are at least thirty copies and variations of the painting executed by Leonardo's pupils and followers, as counted by Robert Simon.",
              "[3][n 10] The large number of these paintings is an important part of the pedigree of Leonardo's painting[3] and emphasizes that there must have been an original by Leonardo from which they were copied.",
              "[34] The most significant and widely discussed among these is the painting formerly in the de Ganay collection, as this one shares most closely the same composition and demonstrates the highest technical skill of Leonardo's pupils.",
              "This is so much the case that Joanne Snow-Smith proposed it to be the original painting in 1978.",
              "[34][35][n 11] The many other copies found in Naples, Detroit, Warsaw, Zu\u0308rich and other public and private collections contain various attributions to members of Leonardo's pupils and followers.",
              "[34][38] Some versions differ significantly from the original.",
              "Two examples can be found in the form of a 'portrait' such as in Salai\u0301's 1511 painting, as well as in a painting sold at Sotheby's on 5 December 2018, both of which use Leonardo's Salvator Mundi as their model but which do not employ the iconography of the blessing hand or globe.",
              "[n 12] Other artists use the same model but for other subjects, as is the case with Leonardo's Spanish follower Fernando Ya\u0301n\u0303ez de la Almedina and the Eucharistic Christ now at the Museo del Prado.",
              "[40] Leonardo's studio and his followers likewise produced at least four Salvator Mundi panels depicting a youthful Christ who is less frontal in his pose and who holds a terrestrial globe.",
              "[41][n 13] These are largely from Leonardo's Milanese following rather than from members of his studio,[43][n 14] though the variant in Rome can reasonably be attributed to his pupil Marco d'Oggiono.",
              "[n 15] This painting seems to have been at James Hamilton's Chelsea Manor in London from 1638 to 1641.",
              "After participating in the English Civil War, Hamilton was executed on 9 March 1649 and some of his possessions were taken to the Netherlands to be sold.",
              "[47] The Bohemian artist Wenceslaus Hollar could have made his engraved copy, dated 1650, in Antwerp at that time.",
              "[11][n 17] It was also recorded in Henrietta Maria's possession in 1649,[47][n 18] the same year her husband Charles I was executed, on 30 January.",
              "The painting was included in an inventory of the Royal Collection,[n 19] valued at \u00a330, and Charles's possessions were put up for sale under the English Commonwealth.",
              "The painting was sold to a creditor in 1651, returned to Charles II after the English Restoration in 1660,[51] and included in an inventory of Charles's possessions at the Palace of Whitehall in 1666.",
              "It was inherited by James II, and may have remained with him until it passed to his mistress Catherine Sedley,[11] whose illegitimate daughter with James became the third wife of John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham.",
              "The duke's illegitimate son, Sir Charles Herbert Sheffield, auctioned the painting in 1763[51] along with other artworks from Buckingham House when the building was sold to George III.",
              "The painting was probably placed in a gilded frame in the nineteenth century, in which it remained until 2005.",
              "[52] It is probably the painting bought by the British collector Francis Cook in 1900 from J.",
              "C.",
              "Robinson for his collection at Doughty House in Richmond, London.",
              "[53][54] The painting had been damaged by previous restoration attempts and was attributed to Bernardino Luini, a follower of Leonardo.",
              "[51] Sir Francis Cook, 4th Baronet, Cook's great-grandson, sold it at auction in 1958 for \u00a345[55] as a work by Leonardo's pupil Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, to whom the painting remained attributed until 2011.",
              "[56] The original painting by Leonardo was thought to have been destroyed or lost around 1603.",
              "[58] In 1978, Joanne Snow-Smith argued that the copy in the collection of the Marquis Jean-Louis de Ganay in Paris was the lost original, based on, among other things, its similarity to Leonardo's Saint John the Baptist.",
              "[n 21] While Snow-Smith was thorough in her research in regard to the provenance of the painting and its relationship to Hollar, few art historians were convinced of her attribution.",
              "[36][n 22] In 2005, a Salvator Mundi was presented at an auction at the St.",
              "Charles Gallery auction house in New Orleans, consigned from the estate of the Baton Rouge businessman Basil Clovis Hendry Sr.",
              "[61] It had been heavily overpainted, to the point where the painting resembled a copy, and was, before restoration, described as \"a wreck, dark and gloomy\".",
              "[62] It was acquired by a consortium of art dealers that included Alexander Parish and Robert Simon, a specialist in Old Masters.",
              "[63][64][65] The consortium paid $1,175 for the painting.",
              "[66][n 23] The consortium believed there was a possibility that this seemingly low-quality work might be Leonardo's long-missing original;",
              "[69] as a consequence, in April 2005 they commissioned Dianne Dwyer Modestini at New York University to oversee the restoration.",
              "When Modestini began removing the overpainting with acetone at the beginning of the restoration process, she discovered that at some point a stepped area of unevenness near Christ's face had been shaved down with a sharp object, and also levelled with a mixture of gesso, paint, and glue.",
              "[52] Using infrared photographs Simon had taken of the painting, Modestini discovered a pentimento (a trace of an earlier composition), which had the blessing hand's thumb in a straight, rather than curved, position.",
              "[52] The discovery that Christ had two thumbs on his right hand was crucial.",
              "This pentimento showed that the original artist had reconsidered the position of the figure;",
              "such a second thought is considered evidence of an original, rather than a copy, as a painting copied from the finished original would not have such an alteration partway through the painting process.",
              "[70] Modestini proceeded to have the panel specialist Monica Griesbach chisel off a woodworm-infested marouflaged panel, which had caused the painting to break into seven pieces.",
              "Griesbach reassembled the painting with adhesive and wood slivers.",
              "[52] In late 2006, Modestini began her restoration effort.",
              "[52] The art historian Martin Kemp was critical of the result: \"Both thumbs\" of the painting's raw state \"are rather better than the one painted by Dianne\".",
              "[70] Other experts have also been critical of the extensive level of restoration undertaken by Modestini, and that it had impeded any attribution of the work (and some calling it a \"contemporary work\" or a \"masterpiece by Modestini\").",
              "[71] From November 2011 through February 2012, the painting was exhibited at the National Gallery, London, as an autograph work by Leonardo, after authentication by that gallery.",
              "[63][65][72][n 24] The painting was stored at the Dallas Museum of Art for the remainder of 2012 while museum leadership attempted and failed to raise the necessary funds to purchase the painting.",
              "[74] In May 2013, the Swiss dealer Yves Bouvier purchased the painting for just over US$75 million in a private sale brokered by Sotheby's, New York.",
              "The painting was then sold to the Russian collector Dmitry Rybolovlev for US$127.",

              "[113] Isaacson writes that In one respect, it is rendered with beautiful scientific precision, but Leonardo failed to paint the distortion that would occur when looking through a solid clear orb at objects that are not touching the orb.",
              "Solid glass or crystal, whether shaped like an orb or a lens, produces magnified, inverted, and reversed images.",
              "Instead, Leonardo painted the orb as if it were a hollow glass bubble that does not refract or distort the light passing through it.",
              "[114] Isaacson believes that this was \"a conscious decision on Leonardo's part\",[115] and speculates that either Leonardo felt a more accurate portrayal would be distracting, or that \"he was subtly trying to impart a miraculous quality to Christ and his orb.\"",
              "[114] Kemp agrees that \"To show the full effects of the sphere on the drapery behind would have been grotesque in a functioning devotional image\".",
              "[113] Kemp further states that the doubled outline of the heel of the hand holding the sphere\u2014which the restorer described as a pentimento\u2014is an accurate rendering of the double refraction produced by a transparent calcite (or rock crystal) sphere.",

              "Christ's blessing hand appears to be in sharp focus, whereas his face\u2014though altered or damaged to some extent\u2014is in soft focus.",
              "In his manuscript of 1508\u20131509 known as Paris Manuscript D,[121] Leonardo explored theories of vision, optics of the eye, and theories relating to shadow, light, and colour.",

              "[122] Christie's lists the ways scholars confirmed the attribution to Leonardo da Vinci: The reasons for the unusually uniform scholarly consensus that the painting is an autograph work by Leonardo are several, including the previously mentioned relationship of the painting to the two autograph preparatory drawings in Windsor Castle;",

              "Furthermore, the extraordinary quality of the picture, especially evident in its best-preserved areas, and its close adherence in style to Leonardo's known paintings from circa 1500, solidifies this consensus.",
              "[11][123] According to Robert Simon, \"Leonardo painted the Salvator Mundi with walnut oil rather than linseed oil, as all the other artists in that period did .",

              "[127][96][128][129] Delieuvin differentiated the picture from other studio versions \u2013 including the Ganay version that appeared in the Louvre's Leonardo exhibition \u2013 by the presence of subtle underpainting, numerous pentimenti, and pictorial quality.",
              "He concludes: All these factors invite us to privilege the idea of a work that is entirely autograph, sadly damaged by the poor conservation of the work and by previous restorations which were too brutal.",
              "[127] In the discussion of the scientific evidence, Ravaud and Eveno write: The examination of the Salvator Mundi seems to us to demonstrate that the painting was indeed executed by Leonardo.",
              "It is essential in this context to distinguish the original parts from those that have been changed or repainted and this is indeed what was carried out during this study notably by using X-ray fluorescence.",

              "The way in which the painting was placed on the market also gave rise to concern.",
              "[132][138][139] Zo\u0308llner also explains that the quality of Salvator Mundi surpasses other known versions;",

              "[143] The Louvre's inability to comment on the matter in the interim, however, led to speculation that its absence was due to doubts over its full attribution to the artist.",
              "[143][144] In November 2021, scholars at the Museo del Prado included the painting under \"attributed works, workshop of authorized and supervised by Leonardo\" in the catalogue for Leonardo and the Copy of the Mona Lisa.",

              "[148] More precisely, Franck now attributes the painting to Salai\u0300 jointly with Boltraffio: in effect, the work's infrared reflectogram betrays a very singular sketching-out technique, never seen in any of Leonardo's original paintings, yet encountered in Salai\u0300's Head of Christ of 1511 in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, a composition close to the Saudi Salvator Mundi and signed by the artist.",
              "This claim is also supported by the fact that a stricto sensu Salvator Mundi painting is recorded in Salai\u0300's posthumous inventory of the estate established in Milan on 25 April 1525.",

              "Salvator Mundi (Latin for 'Savior of the World') is a painting attributed in whole or in part to the Italian High Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, dated to c.",
              "1499\u20131510.",
              "[n 1] Long thought to be a copy of a lost original veiled with overpainting, it was rediscovered, restored, and included in a major exhibition of Leonardo's work at the National Gallery, London, in 2011\u20132012.",
              "[2] Auction house Christie's stated just after selling the work in 2017 that most leading scholars consider it to be an original work by Leonardo, but this attribution has been disputed by other leading specialists, some of whom propose that he only contributed certain elements;",
              "and others who believe that the extensive damage prevents a definitive attribution.",
              "The painting depicts Jesus Christ in an anachronistic blue Renaissance dress, making the sign of the cross with his right hand, while holding a transparent, non-refracting crystal orb in his left, signaling his role as Salvator Mundi and representing the 'celestial sphere' of the heavens.",
              "Approximately thirty copies and variations of the work by pupils and followers of Leonardo have been identified.",
              "[3] Two preparatory chalk and ink drawings of the drapery by Leonardo are held in the British Royal Collection.",
              "[4][5] The painting was sold at auction for US$450.",
              "3 million on 15 November 2017 by Christie's in New York to Prince Badr bin Abdullah Al Saud, setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.",
              "Prince Badr allegedly made the purchase on behalf of Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism,[6][7] but shortly thereafter it was reported that he was a stand-in bidder for his close ally, the Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
              "[8] The painting has not been publicly exhibited since the 2017 Christie's auction, and since late 2020 has been in storage in Saudi Arabia reportedly awaiting a museum and cultural center to be completed in Al-'Ula.",
              "[9][10] Art historians have suggested several possibilities for when the work was executed and who the patron may have been.",
              "Auction house Christie's stated that it was probably commissioned around 1500, shortly after King Louis XII of France conquered the Duchy of Milan and took control of Genoa in the Second Italian War;",
              "Leonardo himself moved from Milan to Florence in 1500.",
              "[11][12] The art historian Luke Syson agrees, dating the painting to c.",
              "1499, though Martin Kemp and Frank Zo\u0308llner date the work to c.",
              "1504\u20131510 and c.",
              "1507 or later respectively.",
              "[n 1] Based on their similarity in style and materials to the studies for The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne, Carlo Pedretti dates the drapery studies in the Royal Collection, and thus the painting, to 1510\u20131515.",
              "[13] Because of the specificity of the subject, Leonardo's Salvator Mundi was probably commissioned by a specific patron rather than produced on speculation.",
              "[14] Isabella d'Este, Duchess of Milan, is cited as a possible patron as in 1504 she had wished to commission from Leonardo a \"youthful Christ of around twelve years, of that age that he had when he disputed in the Temple\", though Salvator Mundi shows a more mature Christ.",
              "[4][13][n 2] Carlo Pedretti notes that Isabella d'Este was a guest of Leonardo's patron Giuliano de'Medici in 1514 and so may have convinced the artist to complete the commission at that time.",
              "[13] Martin Kemp does not draw conclusions, but likewise discusses the possibility of Isabella d'Este as patron \u2013 though he also considers the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, Charles VIII of France, and others.",
              "[15] Joanne Snow-Smith argued that Leonardo painted the Salvator Mundi for Louis XII of France and his consort, Anne of Brittany.",
              "[16] This view was echoed by the British Royal Collection in their 2018 exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing and is supported by the early French provenance of many of the copies of the Salvator Mundi.",
              "[4][5] The painting would have been used in the context of personal devotion, as were other panels of this size and subject in the sixteenth century.",
              "[17][16] Indeed, Snow-Smith emphasizes in her writings the devotional relationship that Louis XII and Anne of Brittany had with the Salvator Mundi as a subject[18][n 3] and Frank Zo\u0308llner discussed the painting's relationship to French illuminated manuscripts in the practice of early sixteenth-century personal devotion and prayer.",
              "[22] It is possible that the painting was recorded in a 1525 inventory of Salai\u0300's estate as \"Christo in mondo de uno Dio padre\", though it is unclear to which Salvator Mundi this might refer.",
              "[14] The provenance of the painting breaks after 1530.",
              "[3] The Salvator Mundi as an image type predates Leonardo.",
              "Thus, Martin Kemp argues that on one hand Leonardo was constrained in his composition by the expected iconography of the Salvator Mundi, but on the other hand, he was able to use the image as a vehicle for spiritual communication between the spectator and the likeness of Christ.",
              "[17] The composition has its sources in Byzantine art, the imagery of which further developed in northern Europe before finding its place in the Italian states.",
              "[n 4] Snow-Smith relates the development of the Salvator Mundi to Byzantine iconography and narratives of images of Christ \"not made by human hands\".",
              "[24] Such acheiropoeta would include the Mandylion of Edessa, the Keramidion, and the Veil of Veronica.",
              "[25] Although the Salvator Mundi has its origins in the acheiropoeta, Snow-Smith discusses, the Salvator Mundi emerged in the fifteenth century through such intermediate subjects as Christ as Pantocrator, Christ in Majesty, and The Last Judgement, which like the acheiropoeta betray their Byzantine origins through their frontal depictions of Christ.",
              "[26] The frontality of Christ is shared by other images of Christ and God the Father in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, including in 'portrait' images of Christ, which feature only Christ at half-length and without the orb or blessing gesture, as well as in images of 'Christ Blessing' which does not show Christ holding an orb.",
              "[27] Images of Christ holding a sphere became widely popular following Charlemagne's adoption of the globus cruciger and the scepter.",
              "[27][n 5] The earliest true Salvator Mundi images are found in northern Europe.",
              "[n 6] Indeed, the iconography of the Salvator Mundi came to fruition in paintings such as Robert Campin's Blessing Christ and Praying Virgin and in the central panel of Rogier van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, before such images became common in Italy later in the fifteenth century.",
              "[n 7] Works by such artists as Antonello da Messina and his Christ Blessing betray the influence of Northern artists in the Italian states.",
              "[29][30] The earliest Italian example of a Salvator Mundi is likely to be Simone Martini's Salvator Mundi Surrounded by Angels at the Palais des Papes, Avignon.",
              "This image shows Christ at full length rather than the bust-length portrayals of later paintings of the Salvator Mundi.",
              "[n 8] The image of Salvator Mundi later became well known in Italy, and especially Venice, through the archetype from Giovanni Bellini, now known only through copies.",
              "[30] This includes Andrea Previtali's 1519 painting at the National Gallery, London.",
              "[31] Another fifteenth-century example can be seen in the Palazzo Ducale in Urbino in the very damaged painting by Melozzo da Forli\u0300.",
              "It has been suggested that Leonardo based his composition on this specific example.",
              "[16][29][n 9] There are at least thirty copies and variations of the painting executed by Leonardo's pupils and followers, as counted by Robert Simon.",
              "[3][n 10] The large number of these paintings is an important part of the pedigree of Leonardo's painting[3] and emphasizes that there must have been an original by Leonardo from which they were copied.",
              "[34] The most significant and widely discussed among these is the painting formerly in the de Ganay collection, as this one shares most closely the same composition and demonstrates the highest technical skill of Leonardo's pupils.",
              "This is so much the case that Joanne Snow-Smith proposed it to be the original painting in 1978.",
              "[34][35][n 11] The many other copies found in Naples, Detroit, Warsaw, Zu\u0308rich and other public and private collections contain various attributions to members of Leonardo's pupils and followers.",
              "[34][38] Some versions differ significantly from the original.",
              "Two examples can be found in the form of a 'portrait' such as in Salai\u0301's 1511 painting, as well as in a painting sold at Sotheby's on 5 December 2018, both of which use Leonardo's Salvator Mundi as their model but which do not employ the iconography of the blessing hand or globe.",
              "[n 12] Other artists use the same model but for other subjects, as is the case with Leonardo's Spanish follower Fernando Ya\u0301n\u0303ez de la Almedina and the Eucharistic Christ now at the Museo del Prado.",
              "[40] Leonardo's studio and his followers likewise produced at least four Salvator Mundi panels depicting a youthful Christ who is less frontal in his pose and who holds a terrestrial globe.",
              "[41][n 13] These are largely from Leonardo's Milanese following rather than from members of his studio,[43][n 14] though the variant in Rome can reasonably be attributed to his pupil Marco d'Oggiono.",
              "[n 15] This painting seems to have been at James Hamilton's Chelsea Manor in London from 1638 to 1641.",
              "After participating in the English Civil War, Hamilton was executed on 9 March 1649 and some of his possessions were taken to the Netherlands to be sold.",
              "[47] The Bohemian artist Wenceslaus Hollar could have made his engraved copy, dated 1650, in Antwerp at that time.",
              "[11][n 17] It was also recorded in Henrietta Maria's possession in 1649,[47][n 18] the same year her husband Charles I was executed, on 30 January.",
              "The painting was included in an inventory of the Royal Collection,[n 19] valued at \u00a330, and Charles's possessions were put up for sale under the English Commonwealth.",
              "The painting was sold to a creditor in 1651, returned to Charles II after the English Restoration in 1660,[51] and included in an inventory of Charles's possessions at the Palace of Whitehall in 1666.",
              "It was inherited by James II, and may have remained with him until it passed to his mistress Catherine Sedley,[11] whose illegitimate daughter with James became the third wife of John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham.",
              "The duke's illegitimate son, Sir Charles Herbert Sheffield, auctioned the painting in 1763[51] along with other artworks from Buckingham House when the building was sold to George III.",
              "The painting was probably placed in a gilded frame in the nineteenth century, in which it remained until 2005.",
              "[52] It is probably the painting bought by the British collector Francis Cook in 1900 from J.",
              "C.",
              "Robinson for his collection at Doughty House in Richmond, London.",
              "[53][54] The painting had been damaged by previous restoration attempts and was attributed to Bernardino Luini, a follower of Leonardo.",
              "[51] Sir Francis Cook, 4th Baronet, Cook's great-grandson, sold it at auction in 1958 for \u00a345[55] as a work by Leonardo's pupil Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, to whom the painting remained attributed until 2011.",
              "[56] The original painting by Leonardo was thought to have been destroyed or lost around 1603.",
              "[58] In 1978, Joanne Snow-Smith argued that the copy in the collection of the Marquis Jean-Louis de Ganay in Paris was the lost original, based on, among other things, its similarity to Leonardo's Saint John the Baptist.",
              "[n 21] While Snow-Smith was thorough in her research in regard to the provenance of the painting and its relationship to Hollar, few art historians were convinced of her attribution.",
              "[36][n 22] In 2005, a Salvator Mundi was presented at an auction at the St.",
              "Charles Gallery auction house in New Orleans, consigned from the estate of the Baton Rouge businessman Basil Clovis Hendry Sr.",
              "[61] It had been heavily overpainted, to the point where the painting resembled a copy, and was, before restoration, described as \"a wreck, dark and gloomy\".",
              "[62] It was acquired by a consortium of art dealers that included Alexander Parish and Robert Simon, a specialist in Old Masters.",
              "[63][64][65] The consortium paid $1,175 for the painting.",
              "[66][n 23] The consortium believed there was a possibility that this seemingly low-quality work might be Leonardo's long-missing original;",
              "[69] as a consequence, in April 2005 they commissioned Dianne Dwyer Modestini at New York University to oversee the restoration.",
              "When Modestini began removing the overpainting with acetone at the beginning of the restoration process, she discovered that at some point a stepped area of unevenness near Christ's face had been shaved down with a sharp object, and also levelled with a mixture of gesso, paint, and glue.",
              "[52] Using infrared photographs Simon had taken of the painting, Modestini discovered a pentimento (a trace of an earlier composition), which had the blessing hand's thumb in a straight, rather than curved, position.",
              "[52] The discovery that Christ had two thumbs on his right hand was crucial.",
              "This pentimento showed that the original artist had reconsidered the position of the figure;",
              "such a second thought is considered evidence of an original, rather than a copy, as a painting copied from the finished original would not have such an alteration partway through the painting process.",
              "[70] Modestini proceeded to have the panel specialist Monica Griesbach chisel off a woodworm-infested marouflaged panel, which had caused the painting to break into seven pieces.",
              "Griesbach reassembled the painting with adhesive and wood slivers.",
              "[52] In late 2006, Modestini began her restoration effort.",
              "[52] The art historian Martin Kemp was critical of the result: \"Both thumbs\" of the painting's raw state \"are rather better than the one painted by Dianne\".",
              "[70] Other experts have also been critical of the extensive level of restoration undertaken by Modestini, and that it had impeded any attribution of the work (and some calling it a \"contemporary work\" or a \"masterpiece by Modestini\").",
              "[71] From November 2011 through February 2012, the painting was exhibited at the National Gallery, London, as an autograph work by Leonardo, after authentication by that gallery.",
              "[63][65][72][n 24] The painting was stored at the Dallas Museum of Art for the remainder of 2012 while museum leadership attempted and failed to raise the necessary funds to purchase the painting.",
              "[74] In May 2013, the Swiss dealer Yves Bouvier purchased the painting for just over US$75 million in a private sale brokered by Sotheby's, New York.",
              "The painting was then sold to the Russian collector Dmitry Rybolovlev for US$127.",
              "5 million.",
              "[75][76][77] The price that Rybolovlev paid was therefore significantly higher, well beyond the 2 percent commission Bouvier was supposed to receive, according to Rybolovlev himself.",
              "[78][79][80] Consequently, this sale\u2014along with several other sales Bouvier made to Rybolovlev\u2014created a legal dispute between Rybolovlev and Bouvier,[81] as well as between the original dealers of the painting and Sotheby's.",
              "In 2016, the dealers sued Sotheby's for the difference of the sale, arguing that they were shortchanged.",
              "The auction house has denied knowing that Rybolovlev was the intended buyer, and sought to dismiss the lawsuit.",
              "[82] In 2018, Rybolovlev also sued Sotheby's for $380 million, alleging that the auction house knowingly participated in a defrauding scheme by Bouvier, in which the painting played a part.",
              "[83] Rybolovlev's lawyers believe email exchanges between Bouvier and Sotheby's confirmed this.",
              "[84] The painting was exhibited in Hong Kong, London, San Francisco, and New York in 2017, and then sold at auction at Christie's in New York on 15 November 2017 for $450,312,500,[n 25] a new record price for an artwork (the hammer price was $400 million, plus $50.",
              "3 million in fees).",
              "[88][89] The purchaser was identified as the Saudi Arabian prince Badr bin Abdullah.",
              "[90][91] In December 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Prince Badr was an intermediary for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,[8] but Christie's and Saudi officials re-stated that Prince Badr acted on behalf of Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism for display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.",
              "[6][92] In September 2018, the painting's scheduled exhibition at the Louvre Abu Dhabi[93][94] was announced as indefinitely postponed.",
              "[95] Instead, in 2018 the Saudi crown prince secretly shipped the painting to Paris,[96] on loan to curators at the Louvre, where it was analysed by the Centre for Research and Restoration of Museums of France[97] and was expected to be hung in the Louvre's large Leonardo da Vinci exhibition which opened in October 2019.",
              "[96][98] But the Saudis demanded that it be hung next to the Mona Lisa, which was impossible for security reasons, and the painting was shipped back to Saudi Arabia.",
              "[98][96] It hung in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's yacht Serene until late 2020, when it was removed to a secret Saudi location while the yacht was in a Dutch shipyard for maintenance.",
              "[98] The painting is being kept in storage until a new museum is built to house it;",
              "[99] the museum and gallery will be in a complex called Wadi AlFann in Al-'Ula, expected to be completed in 2024.",
              "[9][10] About a year into her restoration effort, Dianne Dwyer Modestini noted that colour transitions in the subject's lips were \"perfect\" and that \"no other artist could have done that\".",
              "Upon studying the Mona Lisa for comparison, she concluded that \"The artist who painted her was the same hand that had painted the Salvator Mundi\".",
              "[52] Since then, she has disseminated high-resolution images and technical information online for the scholarly community and public.",
              "[100] In 2006 Nicholas Penny, director of the National Gallery, wrote that he and some of his colleagues considered the work an autograph Leonardo, but that \"some of us consider that there may be [parts] which are by the workshop\".",

              "[11][62][104][105] Several features in the painting have led to the positive attribution: a number of pentimenti are evident, most notably the position of the right thumb.",
              "The sfumato effect of the face\u2014evidently achieved in part by manipulating the paint using the heel of the hand\u2014is typical of many works by Leonardo.",

              "Furthermore, the pigments and the walnut panel upon which the work was executed are consistent with other Leonardo paintings.",
              "[107] Additionally, the hands in the painting are very detailed, something for which Leonardo is known: he would dissect the limbs of the deceased in order to study them and render body parts in an extremely lifelike manner.",
              "[108] One of the world's leading Leonardo experts, Martin Kemp,[109][110] who helped authenticate the work, said that he knew immediately upon first viewing the restored painting that it was the work of Leonardo: \"It had that kind of presence that Leonardos have .",

              "[112] It also shows no reflection.",
              "[113] Isaacson writes that In one respect, it is rendered with beautiful scientific precision, but Leonardo failed to paint the distortion that would occur when looking through a solid clear orb at objects that are not touching the orb.",
              "Solid glass or crystal, whether shaped like an orb or a lens, produces magnified, inverted, and reversed images.",
              "Instead, Leonardo painted the orb as if it were a hollow glass bubble that does not refract or distort the light passing through it.",
              "[114] Isaacson believes that this was \"a conscious decision on Leonardo's part\",[115] and speculates that either Leonardo felt a more accurate portrayal would be distracting, or that \"he was subtly trying to impart a miraculous quality to Christ and his orb.\"",
              "[114] Kemp agrees that \"To show the full effects of the sphere on the drapery behind would have been grotesque in a functioning devotional image\".",
              "[113] Kemp further states that the doubled outline of the heel of the hand holding the sphere\u2014which the restorer described as a pentimento\u2014is an accurate rendering of the double refraction produced by a transparent calcite (or rock crystal) sphere.",
              "[n 26][106] However, this continues outside the globe itself.",

              "occasionally, they appear to be made of translucent glass, or show landscapes within them.",
              "The orb in Leonardo's painting, Kemp says, has \"an amazing series of glistening little apertures\u2014they're like bubbles, but they're not round\u2014painted very delicately, with just a touch of impasto, a touch of dark, and these little sort of glistening things, particularly around the part where you get the back reflections\".",
              "These are the characteristic features of rock crystal, on which Leonardo was an avid expert.",
              "He had been asked to evaluate vases that Isabella d'Este[n 27] had thought of purchasing, and greatly admired the properties of the mineral.",

              "[106] Another aspect of Leonardo's painting Kemp studied was depth of field, or shallow focus.",
              "Christ's blessing hand appears to be in sharp focus, whereas his face\u2014though altered or damaged to some extent\u2014is in soft focus.",
              "In his manuscript of 1508\u20131509 known as Paris Manuscript D,[121] Leonardo explored theories of vision, optics of the eye, and theories relating to shadow, light, and colour.",
              "In the Salvator Mundi, he deliberately placed an emphasis on parts of the picture over others.",
              "Elements in the foreground are seen in focus, while elements further from the picture plane, such as the subject's face, are barely in focus.",
              "Paris Manuscript D shows that Leonardo was investigating this particular phenomenon around the turn of the century.",
              "Combined, the intellectual aspects, optical aspects, and the use of semi-precious minerals are distinctive features of Leonardo's oeuvre.",
              "[106] \"There is extraordinary consensus it is by Leonardo,\" said the former co-chairman of old master paintings at Christie's, Nicholas Hall: \"This is the most important old master painting to have been sold at auction in my lifetime.\"",
              "[122] Christie's lists the ways scholars confirmed the attribution to Leonardo da Vinci: The reasons for the unusually uniform scholarly consensus that the painting is an autograph work by Leonardo are several, including the previously mentioned relationship of the painting to the two autograph preparatory drawings in Windsor Castle;",
              "its correspondence to the composition of the 'Salvator Mundi' documented in Wenceslaus Hollar's etching of 1650;",
              "and its manifest superiority to the more than 20 known painted versions of the composition.",
              "Furthermore, the extraordinary quality of the picture, especially evident in its best-preserved areas, and its close adherence in style to Leonardo's known paintings from circa 1500, solidifies this consensus.",
              "[11][123] According to Robert Simon, \"Leonardo painted the Salvator Mundi with walnut oil rather than linseed oil, as all the other artists in that period did .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "In fact, he wrote about using walnut oil, as it was a new advanced technique.\"",
              "[124] Simon also states that ultraviolet imaging reveals that the darker areas of the painting are mostly owing to the restoration;",
              "the rest is original paint.",
              "[125] The art critic Ben Lewis, who disputes a full attribution to Leonardo, admits that his authorship of the work is possible, owing to the originality of the face, which has \"something modern about it\".",

              ".",

              "In his preface, the museum's director Jean-Luc Martinez states that \"The results of the historical and scientific study presented in this publication allow us to confirm the attribution of the work to Leonardo da Vinci, an appealing hypothesis which was initially presented in 2010 and which has sometimes been disputed\".",
              "[127][96][128][129] Delieuvin differentiated the picture from other studio versions \u2013 including the Ganay version that appeared in the Louvre's Leonardo exhibition \u2013 by the presence of subtle underpainting, numerous pentimenti, and pictorial quality.",
              "He concludes: All these factors invite us to privilege the idea of a work that is entirely autograph, sadly damaged by the poor conservation of the work and by previous restorations which were too brutal.",
              "[127] In the discussion of the scientific evidence, Ravaud and Eveno write: The examination of the Salvator Mundi seems to us to demonstrate that the painting was indeed executed by Leonardo.",
              "It is essential in this context to distinguish the original parts from those that have been changed or repainted and this is indeed what was carried out during this study notably by using X-ray fluorescence.",
              "Examination under a microscope revealed very skilful execution, notably in the skin colouring and in the curls of the hair, and great refinement notably in the depiction of the relief of the embroidery [knotwork].",

              "The number of changes made during the creation of the work also plead in favour of an autograph work.",
              "The first version of the central 'plastron' with a pointed form, is immediately comparable to the central part of the tunic in the Windsor drawing and to our knowledge is not seen anywhere else.",
              "In addition, the movement of the thumb was also noted in the St.",
              "John by Leonardo.",
              "After intensive studies of the other Leonardo works in the Louvre's collection it seems to us that a number of the techniques observed in the Salvator Mundi are typical of Leonardo\u2014the originality of the preparation, the use of ground glass and the remarkable use of vermillion in the hair and shadows.",

              "[130][115][131] Jacques Franck, a Paris-based art historian and Leonardo specialist who has studied the Mona Lisa out of the frame multiple times, stated: \"The composition doesn't come from Leonardo, he preferred twisted movement.",
              "It's a good studio work with a little Leonardo at best, and it's very damaged.",
              "It's been called 'the male Mona Lisa', but it doesn't look like it at all.\"",
              "[122] Michael Daley, the director of ArtWatch UK, doubts the Salvator Mundi's authenticity and theorizes that it may be the prototype of a subject painted by Leonardo:[132][133] \"This quest for an autograph prototype Leonardo painting might seem moot or vain: not only do the two drapery studies comprise the only accepted Leonardo material that might be associated with the group, but within the Leonardo literature there is no documentary record of the artist ever having been involved in such a painting project.\"",
              "[132] Carmen Bambach, a specialist in Italian Renaissance art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, questioned full attribution to Leonardo: \"having studied and followed the picture during its conservation treatment, and seeing it in the context in the National Gallery exhibition, much of the original painting surface may be by Boltraffio, but with passages done by Leonardo himself, namely Christ's proper right blessing hand, portions of the sleeve, his left hand and the crystal orb he holds.\"",
              "[134][135] In 2019, Bambach criticised Christie's for its claim that she was one of the experts who had attributed the painting to Leonardo.",
              "In her 2019 book Leonardo da Vinci Rediscovered, she is even more specific, attributing most of the work to Boltraffio, \"with only 'small retouchings' by the master himself\".",
              "[136] Matthew Landrus, an art historian at the University of Oxford, agreed with the concept of parts of the painting being executed by Leonardo (\"between 5 and 20%\"), but attributes the painting to Leonardo's studio assistant Bernardino Luini, noting Luini's ability in painting gold tracery.",

              "Secondly, the Salvator Mundi in its present state exhibits a strongly developed sfumato technique that corresponds more closely to the manner of a talented Leonardo pupil active in the 1520s than to the style of the master himself.",
              "The way in which the painting was placed on the market also gave rise to concern.",
              "[132][138][139] Zo\u0308llner also explains that the quality of Salvator Mundi surpasses other known versions;",
              "however, [It] also exhibits a number of weaknesses.",
              "The flesh tones of the blessing hand, for example, appear pallid and waxen as in a number of workshop paintings.",

              "[142] The New York Times reported in April 2021 that the non-appearance was because the French were unwilling to meet Saudi demands that the painting be hung alongside the Mona Lisa.",
              "[143] The Louvre's inability to comment on the matter in the interim, however, led to speculation that its absence was due to doubts over its full attribution to the artist.",
              "[143][144] In November 2021, scholars at the Museo del Prado included the painting under \"attributed works, workshop of authorized and supervised by Leonardo\" in the catalogue for Leonardo and the Copy of the Mona Lisa.",
              "The Prado curator Ana Gonzales Monzo wrote in the catalog that the Ganay-collection copy of the Salvador Mundi was likely the closest to Leonardo's original design, and that it was likely done by the same artist that painted the Prado copy of the Mona Lisa.",
              "The curator of the Louvre's 2019\u201320 Leonardo exhibition, Vincent Delieuvin, wrote in the Prado catalog that the painting had \"details of surprisingly poor quality\", and that \"It is to be hoped that a future permanent display of the work will allow it to be reanalyzed with greater objectivity\".",
              "[145][146] The British art historian Charles Hope dismissed the attribution to Leonardo entirely in a January 2020 analysis of the painting's quality and provenance.",
              "He doubted that Leonardo would have painted a work where the eyes were not level and the drapery undistorted by a crystal orb.",
              "He added, \"The picture itself is a ruin, with the face much restored to make it reminiscent of the Mona Lisa.\"",
              "Hope condemned the National Gallery's involvement in Simon's \"astute\" marketing campaign.",
              "[147] In August 2020, Jacques Franck, who had previously called the portrait \"a good studio work with a little Leonardo at best\",[122] cited its \"childishly conceived left hand\", as well as the \"oddly long and thin nose, the simplified mouth [and] the over shadowy neck\" as evidence that Leonardo did not paint it.",
              "[148] More precisely, Franck now attributes the painting to Salai\u0300 jointly with Boltraffio: in effect, the work's infrared reflectogram betrays a very singular sketching-out technique, never seen in any of Leonardo's original paintings, yet encountered in Salai\u0300's Head of Christ of 1511 in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, a composition close to the Saudi Salvator Mundi and signed by the artist.",
              "This claim is also supported by the fact that a stricto sensu Salvator Mundi painting is recorded in Salai\u0300's posthumous inventory of the estate established in Milan on 25 April 1525.",

              "He was known to be fastidious in personal care, keeping a beard neat and trim in later age, and to dress in colorful clothing in styles that dismissed current customs. The 16th-century writer Giorgio Vasari indicated that Leonardo cared little for money but was very generous toward his friends and assistants.",
              "He had an exceedingly inquisitive mind and made strenuous efforts to become erudite in languages, natural science, mathematics, philosophy, and history, among other subjects.",

              "The unique fame that Leonardo enjoyed in his lifetime and that, filtered by historical criticism, has remained undimmed to the present day rests largely on his unlimited desire for knowledge, which guided all his thinking and behaviour.",
              "An artist by disposition and endowment, he considered his eyes to be his main avenue to knowledge;",
              "to Leonardo, sight was man\u2019s highest sense because it alone conveyed the facts of experience immediately, correctly, and with certainty.",
              "Hence, every phenomenon perceived became an object of knowledge, and saper vedere (\u201cknowing how to see\u201d) became the great theme of his studies.",

              "From about 1483 to 1486, he worked on the altar painting The Virgin of the Rocks, a project that led to 10 years of litigation between the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, which commissioned it, and Leonardo;",
              "for uncertain purposes, this legal dispute led Leonardo to create another version of the work in about 1508.",

              "The role of most of these associates is unclear, leading to the question of Leonardo\u2019s so-called apocryphal works, on which the master collaborated with his assistants.",

              "Leonardo painted on a variety of surfaces.",
              "He sometimes used wet plaster or sometimes painted on dry stone wall.",
              "He usually used hand-made oil paints, from ground pigments.",
              "Later in life he used tempura from eggwhites and worked on canvas, board, or, again, stone (if he was painting a mural).",
              "As he began to paint, Leonardo would first create a detailed underpainting in a neutral gray or brown, then apply his colors in layer after layer of transparent glazes on top\u2014using a limited range of tones.",

              "According to Leonardo da Vinci biographer Walter Isaacson, this method also \"allowed him to produce luminous tones.",
              "The light would pass through the layers and reflect back from the primer coat, making it seem as if the light was emanating from the figures and objects themselves.\"",
              "On his palette were muted, earthy browns, greens, and blues within a narrow tonal range.",
              "This helped give a sense of unity to the elements in the painting.",

              "\"Leonardo's version of the technique involved varying the darkness of a color by adding black pigments rather than making it a more saturated or richer hue.",
              "\u201d Soft, gentle lighting was crucial to his paintings.",
              "Facial features were not strongly defined or outlined but conveyed by soft, blended variations in tone and color.",

              "His father was a wealthy lawyer, and his mother was a peasant woman.",

              "He could not legally bear his father\u2019s surname, so he was named after his native village, Vinci.",
              "[1] While he received little or no formal education as a child, at 15, he was apprenticed to Andrea del Verrocchio (1435\u20131488).",
              "He was one of the leading artists of his day and greatly influenced the young Leonardo, especially in his dynamic representations of the human figure.",
              "After completing his apprenticeship, he became an assistant to Verrocchio, and his extraordinary skills became well-known.",
              "His artistic style was considered to be extraordinarily original because of his unique use of light and shade.",
              "[2] In either 1477/1488, Leonardo set up his studio and soon was receiving significant commissions.",
              "He was accused of being gay at this time, and if he had been found guilty, he could have been executed.",
              "Leonardo had the charges dropped, but his reputation suffered.",
              "In 1481 his reputation rebounded after he painted the Adoration of the Magi.",
              "This work made him famous in Florence and beyond.",
              "However, the work was unfinished because he was invited to Milan by its powerful Duke.",

              "At this time, he produced one of the most famous works in all art history, the Last Supper.",

              "It would have taken a huge, nearly delusional leap of imagination to see a Leonardo lurking underneath the mess, yet that is exactly how the painting's story concluded.",

              "So how did they find factual evidence?",
              "According to the many Leonardo experts who examined Salvator Mundi during various stages of cleaning, several tangible characteristics stood out immediately: The fingers were especially significant because, as Oxford Leonardo expert Martin Kemp put it, \"All the versions of the 'Salvator Mundi' have rather tubular fingers.",
              "What Leonardo had done, and the copyists and imitators didn't pick up, was to get just how the knuckle sort of sits underneath the skin.\"",
              "In other words, the artist was so well-versed in anatomy that he had studied it, most probably via dissection.",
              "Again, characteristics are not material evidence.",
              "To prove that Salvator Mundi is a long lost Leonardo, researchers had to uncover facts.",
              "The provenance of the painting, including some lengthy gaps, was pieced together from its time in the collection of Charles II until 1763 (when it was sold at auction), and then from 1900 to the present day.",
              "It was compared to two preparatory drawings, housed in the Royal Library at Windsor, that Leonardo made for it.",
              "It was also compared to some 20 known copies and found to be superior to all of them.",
              "The most compelling evidence was uncovered during the cleaning process when several pentimenti (alterations by the artist) became apparent: one visible, and the others through infrared imagery.",
              "Additionally, the pigments and the walnut panel itself are consistent with other Leonardo paintings.",
              "It should also be noted that the way the new owners went about seeking evidence and a consensus earned them the respect of Leonardo experts.",
              "Salvator Mundi was given the \"kid-glove\" treatment by those who cleaned and restored it, even though the owners weren't certain what they had.",
              "And when the time came to begin researching and reaching out to experts, it was done quietly and methodically.",
              "The entire process took nearly seven years, so this wasn't a case of some dark horse candidate bursting onto the scene, a criticism that La Bella Principessa is still struggling to overcome.",
              "Salvator Mundi was painted in oils on a walnut panel.",
              "Leonardo naturally had to deviate just a bit from the traditional formula for a Salvator Mundi painting.",
              "For example, note the orb resting in Christ's left palm.",
              "In Roman Catholic iconography, this orb was painted as brass or gold, may have had vague landforms mapped on it, and was topped by a crucifix \u2014 hence its Latin name globus cruciger.",
              "We know that Leonardo was a Roman Catholic, as were all of his patrons.",
              "However, he eschews the globus cruciger for what appears to be a sphere of rock crystal.",
              "Why?",
              "Lacking any word from Leonardo, we can only theorize.",
              "He was constantly trying to tie the natural and spiritual worlds together, a\u0301 la Plato, and in fact, made quite a few drawings of Platonic Solids for Pacioli's De Divina Proportione.",
              "We know, too, that he studied the as-yet-to-be-named science of optics whenever the mood struck him.",
              "Perhaps he wanted to have a bit of fun.",
              "It is distorted to the point that Christ appears to have a double-wide heel.",

              "Or maybe Leonardo was just showing off;",

              "This sale shattered all previous records for artworks sold at auction or privately.",
              "Previous to that, the last recorded amount on Salvator Mundi was \u00a345 in 1958, when it sold at auction, was attributed to Leonardo's pupil Boltraffio, and was in horrible condition.",

              "[n 1] Long thought to be a copy of a lost original veiled with overpainting, it was rediscovered, restored, and included in a major exhibition of Leonardo's work at the National Gallery, London, in 2011\u20132012.",
              "[2] Auction house Christie's stated just after selling the work in 2017 that most leading scholars consider it to be an original work by Leonardo, but this attribution has been disputed by other leading specialists, some of whom propose that he only contributed certain elements;",
              "and others who believe that the extensive damage prevents a definitive attribution.",
              "The painting depicts Jesus Christ in an anachronistic blue Renaissance dress, making the sign of the cross with his right hand, while holding a transparent, non-refracting crystal orb in his left, signaling his role as Salvator Mundi and representing the 'celestial sphere' of the heavens.",

              "[8] The painting has not been publicly exhibited since the 2017 Christie's auction, and since late 2020 has been in storage in Saudi Arabia reportedly awaiting a museum and cultural center to be completed in Al-'Ula.",
              "[9][10] Art historians have suggested several possibilities for when the work was executed and who the patron may have been.",
              "Auction house Christie's stated that it was probably commissioned around 1500, shortly after King Louis XII of France conquered the Duchy of Milan and took control of Genoa in the Second Italian War;",
              "Leonardo himself moved from Milan to Florence in 1500.",
              "[11][12] The art historian Luke Syson agrees, dating the painting to c.",
              "1499, though Martin Kemp and Frank Zo\u0308llner date the work to c.",
              "1504\u20131510 and c.",
              "1507 or later respectively.",
              "[n 1] Based on their similarity in style and materials to the studies for The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne, Carlo Pedretti dates the drapery studies in the Royal Collection, and thus the painting, to 1510\u20131515.",
              "[13] Because of the specificity of the subject, Leonardo's Salvator Mundi was probably commissioned by a specific patron rather than produced on speculation.",
              "[14] Isabella d'Este, Duchess of Milan, is cited as a possible patron as in 1504 she had wished to commission from Leonardo a \"youthful Christ of around twelve years, of that age that he had when he disputed in the Temple\", though Salvator Mundi shows a more mature Christ.",
              "[4][13][n 2] Carlo Pedretti notes that Isabella d'Este was a guest of Leonardo's patron Giuliano de'Medici in 1514 and so may have convinced the artist to complete the commission at that time.",
              "[13] Martin Kemp does not draw conclusions, but likewise discusses the possibility of Isabella d'Este as patron \u2013 though he also considers the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, Charles VIII of France, and others.",
              "[15] Joanne Snow-Smith argued that Leonardo painted the Salvator Mundi for Louis XII of France and his consort, Anne of Brittany.",
              "[16] This view was echoed by the British Royal Collection in their 2018 exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing and is supported by the early French provenance of many of the copies of the Salvator Mundi.",
              "[4][5] The painting would have been used in the context of personal devotion, as were other panels of this size and subject in the sixteenth century.",
              "[17][16] Indeed, Snow-Smith emphasizes in her writings the devotional relationship that Louis XII and Anne of Brittany had with the Salvator Mundi as a subject[18][n 3] and Frank Zo\u0308llner discussed the painting's relationship to French illuminated manuscripts in the practice of early sixteenth-century personal devotion and prayer.",
              "[22] It is possible that the painting was recorded in a 1525 inventory of Salai\u0300's estate as \"Christo in mondo de uno Dio padre\", though it is unclear to which Salvator Mundi this might refer.",
              "[14] The provenance of the painting breaks after 1530.",
              "[3] The Salvator Mundi as an image type predates Leonardo.",
              "Thus, Martin Kemp argues that on one hand Leonardo was constrained in his composition by the expected iconography of the Salvator Mundi, but on the other hand, he was able to use the image as a vehicle for spiritual communication between the spectator and the likeness of Christ.",
              "[17] The composition has its sources in Byzantine art, the imagery of which further developed in northern Europe before finding its place in the Italian states.",
              "[n 4] Snow-Smith relates the development of the Salvator Mundi to Byzantine iconography and narratives of images of Christ \"not made by human hands\".",
              "[24] Such acheiropoeta would include the Mandylion of Edessa, the Keramidion, and the Veil of Veronica.",
              "[25] Although the Salvator Mundi has its origins in the acheiropoeta, Snow-Smith discusses, the Salvator Mundi emerged in the fifteenth century through such intermediate subjects as Christ as Pantocrator, Christ in Majesty, and The Last Judgement, which like the acheiropoeta betray their Byzantine origins through their frontal depictions of Christ.",
              "[26] The frontality of Christ is shared by other images of Christ and God the Father in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, including in 'portrait' images of Christ, which feature only Christ at half-length and without the orb or blessing gesture, as well as in images of 'Christ Blessing' which does not show Christ holding an orb.",
              "[27] Images of Christ holding a sphere became widely popular following Charlemagne's adoption of the globus cruciger and the scepter.",
              "[27][n 5] The earliest true Salvator Mundi images are found in northern Europe.",
              "[n 6] Indeed, the iconography of the Salvator Mundi came to fruition in paintings such as Robert Campin's Blessing Christ and Praying Virgin and in the central panel of Rogier van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, before such images became common in Italy later in the fifteenth century.",
              "[n 7] Works by such artists as Antonello da Messina and his Christ Blessing betray the influence of Northern artists in the Italian states.",
              "[29][30] The earliest Italian example of a Salvator Mundi is likely to be Simone Martini's Salvator Mundi Surrounded by Angels at the Palais des Papes, Avignon.",
              "This image shows Christ at full length rather than the bust-length portrayals of later paintings of the Salvator Mundi.",
              "[n 8] The image of Salvator Mundi later became well known in Italy, and especially Venice, through the archetype from Giovanni Bellini, now known only through copies.",
              "[30] This includes Andrea Previtali's 1519 painting at the National Gallery, London.",
              "[31] Another fifteenth-century example can be seen in the Palazzo Ducale in Urbino in the very damaged painting by Melozzo da Forli\u0300.",
              "It has been suggested that Leonardo based his composition on this specific example.",
              "[16][29][n 9] There are at least thirty copies and variations of the painting executed by Leonardo's pupils and followers, as counted by Robert Simon.",
              "[3][n 10] The large number of these paintings is an important part of the pedigree of Leonardo's painting[3] and emphasizes that there must have been an original by Leonardo from which they were copied.",
              "[34] The most significant and widely discussed among these is the painting formerly in the de Ganay collection, as this one shares most closely the same composition and demonstrates the highest technical skill of Leonardo's pupils.",
              "This is so much the case that Joanne Snow-Smith proposed it to be the original painting in 1978.",
              "[34][35][n 11] The many other copies found in Naples, Detroit, Warsaw, Zu\u0308rich and other public and private collections contain various attributions to members of Leonardo's pupils and followers.",
              "[34][38] Some versions differ significantly from the original.",
              "Two examples can be found in the form of a 'portrait' such as in Salai\u0301's 1511 painting, as well as in a painting sold at Sotheby's on 5 December 2018, both of which use Leonardo's Salvator Mundi as their model but which do not employ the iconography of the blessing hand or globe.",
              "[n 12] Other artists use the same model but for other subjects, as is the case with Leonardo's Spanish follower Fernando Ya\u0301n\u0303ez de la Almedina and the Eucharistic Christ now at the Museo del Prado.",

              "The sfumato effect of the face\u2014evidently achieved in part by manipulating the paint using the heel of the hand\u2014is typical of many works by Leonardo.",

              "Furthermore, the pigments and the walnut panel upon which the work was executed are consistent with other Leonardo paintings.",
              "[107] Additionally, the hands in the painting are very detailed, something for which Leonardo is known: he would dissect the limbs of the deceased in order to study them and render body parts in an extremely lifelike manner.",
              "[108] One of the world's leading Leonardo experts, Martin Kemp,[109][110] who helped authenticate the work, said that he knew immediately upon first viewing the restored painting that it was the work of Leonardo: \"It had that kind of presence that Leonardos have .",

              "[106] Kemp also states: However skilled Leonardo's followers and imitators might have been, none of them reached out into such realms of \"philosophical and subtle speculation\".",
              "We cannot reasonably doubt that here, we are in the presence of the painter from Vinci.",
              "[111] In his biography of Leonardo, Walter Isaacson notes that the celestial sphere that Christ is holding does not correspond to the way such an orb would realistically look.",
              "[112] It also shows no reflection.",
              "[113] Isaacson writes that In one respect, it is rendered with beautiful scientific precision, but Leonardo failed to paint the distortion that would occur when looking through a solid clear orb at objects that are not touching the orb.",
              "Solid glass or crystal, whether shaped like an orb or a lens, produces magnified, inverted, and reversed images.",
              "Instead, Leonardo painted the orb as if it were a hollow glass bubble that does not refract or distort the light passing through it.",
              "[114] Isaacson believes that this was \"a conscious decision on Leonardo's part\",[115] and speculates that either Leonardo felt a more accurate portrayal would be distracting, or that \"he was subtly trying to impart a miraculous quality to Christ and his orb.\"",
              "[114] Kemp agrees that \"To show the full effects of the sphere on the drapery behind would have been grotesque in a functioning devotional image\".",
              "[113] Kemp further states that the doubled outline of the heel of the hand holding the sphere\u2014which the restorer described as a pentimento\u2014is an accurate rendering of the double refraction produced by a transparent calcite (or rock crystal) sphere.",
              "[n 26][106] However, this continues outside the globe itself.",
              "[113] Kemp further notes that the orb \"sparkles with a series of internal inclusions (or pockets of air)\"\u2014evidence in support of its being solid.",
              "[116] More recently, the globe has been also interpreted as a magnifying instrument consisting of a vitreous globe filled with water (which in nature would also distort the background).",

              "Noest suggests that the three painted specks represent celestial bodies.",
              "[113] Other versions or copies of the Salvator Mundi often depict a brass, solid spherical orb, terrestrial globe, or globus cruciger;",
              "occasionally, they appear to be made of translucent glass, or show landscapes within them.",
              "The orb in Leonardo's painting, Kemp says, has \"an amazing series of glistening little apertures\u2014they're like bubbles, but they're not round\u2014painted very delicately, with just a touch of impasto, a touch of dark, and these little sort of glistening things, particularly around the part where you get the back reflections\".",
              "These are the characteristic features of rock crystal, on which Leonardo was an avid expert.",
              "He had been asked to evaluate vases that Isabella d'Este[n 27] had thought of purchasing, and greatly admired the properties of the mineral.",
              "[106] Iconographically, the crystal sphere relates to the heavens.",
              "[116][103] In Ptolemaic cosmology, the stars were embedded in a fixed celestial crystalline sphere (composed of aether), with the spherical Earth at the center of the universe.",
              "\"So what you've got in the Salvator Mundi\", Kemp states, \"is really 'a savior of the cosmos', and this is a very Leonardesque transformation.\"",
              "[106] Another aspect of Leonardo's painting Kemp studied was depth of field, or shallow focus.",
              "Christ's blessing hand appears to be in sharp focus, whereas his face\u2014though altered or damaged to some extent\u2014is in soft focus.",
              "In his manuscript of 1508\u20131509 known as Paris Manuscript D,[121] Leonardo explored theories of vision, optics of the eye, and theories relating to shadow, light, and colour.",
              "In the Salvator Mundi, he deliberately placed an emphasis on parts of the picture over others.",
              "Elements in the foreground are seen in focus, while elements further from the picture plane, such as the subject's face, are barely in focus.",
              "Paris Manuscript D shows that Leonardo was investigating this particular phenomenon around the turn of the century.",
              "Combined, the intellectual aspects, optical aspects, and the use of semi-precious minerals are distinctive features of Leonardo's oeuvre.",
              "[106] \"There is extraordinary consensus it is by Leonardo,\" said the former co-chairman of old master paintings at Christie's, Nicholas Hall: \"This is the most important old master painting to have been sold at auction in my lifetime.\"",
              "[122] Christie's lists the ways scholars confirmed the attribution to Leonardo da Vinci: The reasons for the unusually uniform scholarly consensus that the painting is an autograph work by Leonardo are several, including the previously mentioned relationship of the painting to the two autograph preparatory drawings in Windsor Castle;",
              "its correspondence to the composition of the 'Salvator Mundi' documented in Wenceslaus Hollar's etching of 1650;",
              "and its manifest superiority to the more than 20 known painted versions of the composition.",
              "Furthermore, the extraordinary quality of the picture, especially evident in its best-preserved areas, and its close adherence in style to Leonardo's known paintings from circa 1500, solidifies this consensus.",
              "[11][123] According to Robert Simon, \"Leonardo painted the Salvator Mundi with walnut oil rather than linseed oil, as all the other artists in that period did .",

              "the rest is original paint.",
              "[125] The art critic Ben Lewis, who disputes a full attribution to Leonardo, admits that his authorship of the work is possible, owing to the originality of the face, which has \"something modern about it\".",

              "[127][96][128][129] Delieuvin differentiated the picture from other studio versions \u2013 including the Ganay version that appeared in the Louvre's Leonardo exhibition \u2013 by the presence of subtle underpainting, numerous pentimenti, and pictorial quality.",
              "He concludes: All these factors invite us to privilege the idea of a work that is entirely autograph, sadly damaged by the poor conservation of the work and by previous restorations which were too brutal.",
              "[127] In the discussion of the scientific evidence, Ravaud and Eveno write: The examination of the Salvator Mundi seems to us to demonstrate that the painting was indeed executed by Leonardo.",
              "It is essential in this context to distinguish the original parts from those that have been changed or repainted and this is indeed what was carried out during this study notably by using X-ray fluorescence.",

              "[71] In Paris, the Louvre's request for the Salvator Mundi to be exhibited in its Leonardo da Vinci exhibition of 2019\u20132020[141] was reportedly met without response.",
              "[142] The New York Times reported in April 2021 that the non-appearance was because the French were unwilling to meet Saudi demands that the painting be hung alongside the Mona Lisa.",
              "[143] The Louvre's inability to comment on the matter in the interim, however, led to speculation that its absence was due to doubts over its full attribution to the artist.",
              "[143][144] In November 2021, scholars at the Museo del Prado included the painting under \"attributed works, workshop of authorized and supervised by Leonardo\" in the catalogue for Leonardo and the Copy of the Mona Lisa.",
              "The Prado curator Ana Gonzales Monzo wrote in the catalog that the Ganay-collection copy of the Salvador Mundi was likely the closest to Leonardo's original design, and that it was likely done by the same artist that painted the Prado copy of the Mona Lisa.",
              "The curator of the Louvre's 2019\u201320 Leonardo exhibition, Vincent Delieuvin, wrote in the Prado catalog that the painting had \"details of surprisingly poor quality\", and that \"It is to be hoped that a future permanent display of the work will allow it to be reanalyzed with greater objectivity\".",
              "[145][146] The British art historian Charles Hope dismissed the attribution to Leonardo entirely in a January 2020 analysis of the painting's quality and provenance.",
              "He doubted that Leonardo would have painted a work where the eyes were not level and the drapery undistorted by a crystal orb.",
              "He added, \"The picture itself is a ruin, with the face much restored to make it reminiscent of the Mona Lisa.\"",
              "Hope condemned the National Gallery's involvement in Simon's \"astute\" marketing campaign.",
              "[147] In August 2020, Jacques Franck, who had previously called the portrait \"a good studio work with a little Leonardo at best\",[122] cited its \"childishly conceived left hand\", as well as the \"oddly long and thin nose, the simplified mouth [and] the over shadowy neck\" as evidence that Leonardo did not paint it.",
              "[148] More precisely, Franck now attributes the painting to Salai\u0300 jointly with Boltraffio: in effect, the work's infrared reflectogram betrays a very singular sketching-out technique, never seen in any of Leonardo's original paintings, yet encountered in Salai\u0300's Head of Christ of 1511 in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, a composition close to the Saudi Salvator Mundi and signed by the artist.",
              "This claim is also supported by the fact that a stricto sensu Salvator Mundi painting is recorded in Salai\u0300's posthumous inventory of the estate established in Milan on 25 April 1525.",
              "[149] In November 2020, a newly discovered drawing of Christ surfaced, possibly by Leonardo and with notable differences from the painting.",
              "According to the Leonardo scholar Annalisa Di Maria, \"[This] is the true face of Salvator Mundi.",
              "[It] recalls everything in the drawings of Leonardo\", pointing to the similar three-quarters view used in his presumed self-portrait.",
              "She continued, \"[Leonardo] could never have portrayed such a frontal and motionless character.\"",
              "Kemp indicated that before he could review the drawing, he \"would need to see if it is drawn left-handed\".",
              "[150] The rediscovered painting by Leonardo generated considerable interest within the media and general public amid its pre-auction viewings in Hong Kong, London, San Francisco and New York, as well as after the sale.",
              "More than 27,000 people saw the work in person before the auction: the highest number of pre-sale viewers for an individual work of art, according to Christie's.",
              "[130] The sale was the first time Christie's had used an outside agency to advertise an artwork.",
              "Approximately 4,500 people stood in line to preview the work in New York the weekend prior to the sale.",
              "[130] The sensationalism of the painting following the sale led to it being a common subject in popular culture and discourse online.",
              "As Brian Boucher described, \"the internet went a little bonkers\" in response to the sale, leading to sarcastic and humorous comments and memes on Twitter, Instagram and other social media sites.",
              "[151] Similarly, Stephanie Eckardt noted how \"the ongoing saga of Salvator Mundi indisputably\" belongs in \"the meme canon.\"",
              "[152] In an article in the Art Market Monitor, Marion Maneker compared the sensationalism around Salvator Mundi to the media coverage surrounding the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911.",
              "Just as the international media sensationalism lifted the painting to a high international status, she argued, so too did Christie's marketing campaign and media sensationalism lead to its high sales price.",
              "[153] Alexandra Kim of the Harvard Crimson similarly described the reason for the painting's newfound fame: Why are we still so adamantly curious [about Salvator Mundi]?",
              "The New York Times, The Guardian, and more have covered this painting and its aftermath.",
              "It now seems that the drama surrounding this infamous painting has created a whole new work of art larger than the Salvator Mundi itself.",
              "The attention has grossly inflated its value: the more we discuss the work, the more curious we are until it becomes a shining ball of artistic enlightenment.",
              "[154] The narratives surrounding the painting have piqued the interest of filmmakers and playwrights.",
              "In July 2020, the company Caiola Productions announced that it was working on the production of a Broadway musical based on the history of Leonardo's Salvator Mundi.",
              "[n 28] In April 2021, Antoine Vitkine directed a feature-length documentary entitled The Savior for Sale, focusing on the painting and its exclusion from the 2019\u20132020 Leonardo exhibition at the Louvre.",
              "[127] Shortly afterward, in June 2021, Andreas Koefoed's documentary The Lost Leonardo premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, exploring how the painting became the most expensive ever sold and the trail of buyers involved, the debate around its attribution and provenance, and its failure to appear at the 2019\u20132020 Louvre exhibition.",

              "One of the great Renaissance painters, Leonardo da Vinci continually tested artistic traditions and techniques.",
              "He created innovative compositions, investigated anatomy to accurately represent the human body, considered the human psyche to illustrate character, and experimented with methods of representing space and three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface.",
              "The result of his inexhaustible curiosity is many unfinished projects but also some of the most lifelike, complex, and tender representations of human nature.",
              "His experiments influenced the art of his successors and often became the standard of representation in subsequent centuries.",
              "At his death in 1519, Leonardo left many notebooks filled with jottings and sketches but very few finished works.",
              "Some of his pieces were completed by assistants, but others were lost, destroyed, or overpainted.",
              "Below are 10 examples of some of his most well-known surviving works.",
              "The world\u2019s most famous artwork, the Mona Lisa draws thousands of visitors to the Louvre Museum each day, many of whom are compelled by the sitter\u2019s mysterious gaze and enigmatic smile.",
              "The seemingly ordinary portrait of a young woman dressed modestly in a thin veil, somber colors, and no jewelry might also confound its viewers, who may wonder what all the fuss is about.",
              "The painting\u2019s simplicity belies Leonardo\u2019s talent for realism.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly modeled face shows his skillful handling of sfumato, an artistic technique that uses subtle gradations of light and shadow, rather than line, to model form.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric reveal Leonardo\u2019s tireless patience in recreating his studied observations.",
              "Moreover, the sitter\u2019s perplexing expression only adds to her realism.",
              "Her smile might be engaging or it might be mocking\u2014viewers can\u2019t quite figure it out because, like a human, she is a complex figure, embodying contrary characteristics simultaneously.",
              "One of the most famous paintings in the world, the Last Supper was commissioned by Ludovico Sforza, duke of Milan and Leonardo\u2019s patron during his first stay in that city, for the Dominican monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie.",
              "Depicting a sequential narrative, Leonardo illustrates several closely connected moments in the Gospels, including Matthew 26:21\u201328, in which Jesus declares that one of the Apostles will betray him and then institutes the Eucharist.",
              "Leonardo, who was intrigued by the manner in which a man\u2019s character can reveal itself in posture, expression, and gesture, depicted each disciple\u2019s unique reaction to the declaration.",
              "The Apostles\u2019 postures rise, fall, extend, and intertwine as they appear to whisper, yell, grieve, and debate around Jesus, who sits serenely in the center.",
              "Because of Leonardo\u2019s experimental painting technique, in which he used tempera or oil paint on two layers of preparatory ground, the work began to disintegrate soon after he finished it.",
              "Viewers, however, can still recognize it as a complex study of varied human emotion, revealed in a deceptively simple composition.",
              "Leonardo\u2019s pen-and-ink drawing Vitruvian Man comes from one of the many notebooks that he kept on hand during his mature years.",
              "It is accompanied by notes, written in mirror script, on the ideal human proportions that the Roman architect Vitruvius laid out in a book on architecture from the 1st century BCE.",
              "The drawing illustrates Vitruvius\u2019s theory that the ideal human could fit within a circle and a square, two irreconcilable shapes.",
              "Leonardo resolved the concept by drawing a male figure in two superimposed positions\u2014one with his arms outstretched to fit in a square and another with his legs and arms spread in a circle.",
              "The work shows not only Leonardo\u2019s effort to understand significant texts but also his desire to expand on them.",
              "He was not the first to illustrate Vitruvius\u2019s concepts, but his drawing later became the most iconic, partly because its combination of mathematics, philosophy, and art seemed a fitting symbol of the Renaissance.",
              "The drawing is now housed in the Gallerie dell\u2019Accademia, Venice, where it is not typically on display but kept in a climate-controlled archive.",
              "Long regarded as a self-portrait, the red chalk drawing of an old man with long wavy hair and a beard has been reproduced to such an extent that it defines how most people think of Leonardo\u2019s appearance.",
              "Yet some scholars argue that the figure, with its craggy features, furrowed brow, and downcast eyes, appears much older than the age Leonardo ever reached;",
              "Leonardo died at age 67.",
              "They propose that the drawing may be one of his grotesque drawings, sketches he habitually made in his notebooks of people with eccentric features.",
              "Whomever the portrait represents, it is a departure from Leonardo\u2019s often captivating subjects, yet he managed to imbue the figure with the nobility and wisdom of a mature age.",
              "Based on stylistic evidence, many scholars consider the painting The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre the first of two paintings that Leonardo made of an apocryphal legend in which the Holy Family meets Saint John the Baptist as they flee to Egypt from Herod\u2019s Massacre of the Innocents.",
              "Leonardo was involved in years of litigation with the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, which commissioned the work, and the dispute eventually led Leonardo to paint another version of the subject about 1508, which is now housed in the National Gallery of London.",
              "The first painting shows the ways in which Leonardo ushered in the High Renaissance.",
              "Early paintings from this period often depicted figures in linear arrangements, separate from one another, and stiff in form.",
              "In The Virgin of the Rocks, however, the figures of the Virgin Mary, the Christ Child, the infant John, and an archangel are arranged in a pyramidal composition, and they not only convincingly occupy a space but interact with one another through gestures and glances.",
              "A youthful Mary sits on the ground in a mysterious rocky landscape, not on a throne as so many early Renaissance paintings depicted her.",
              "Her body has movement\u2014it seems to sway as she tilts her head protectively toward the infant John, who kneels in prayer at the left, and she looks as if she nudges him over to the Christ Child at the right.",
              "Jesus, in turn, blesses John as an archangel, seen in a complex pose from the back, points toward John and glances inscrutably outward at the viewer.",
              "Leonardo also notably excluded traditional holy signifiers\u2014halos for Mary and Christ and a staff for John\u2014so that the Holy Family appears less divine and more human.",
              "Head of a Woman, a small brush drawing with pigment, depicts a young woman with her head tilted and her eyes downcast.",
              "Her posture recalls the Virgin Mary in Leonardo\u2019s The Virgin of the Rocks, suggesting that the drawing may have served as a model.",
              "The drawing\u2019s nickname, La scapigliata, translates to \u201cdisheveled\u201d and refers to the young woman\u2019s wayward strands of hair.",
              "The loosely sketched tendrils and shoulders contrast with the highly finished face, where Leonardo gently modeled the woman\u2019s delicate features, from her heavy eyelids to her tender lips.",
              "It reveals Leonardo\u2019s fluid means of working, utilizing both expressive drawing to create form and controlled layering to provide detail.",
              "Many art historians identify the youthful woman in Lady with an Ermine as Cecilia Gallerani, the mistress of Leonardo\u2019s patron, Ludovico Sforza, duke of Milan.",
              "The ermine was often used as an emblem for the duke.",
              "The woman turns her head to the right, her bright eyes seemingly directed toward something outside the frame.",
              "Although the painting has been heavily overpainted, notably the dark background, it nonetheless reveals Leonardo\u2019s knowledge of anatomy and his ability to represent character in posture and expression.",
              "He captures the girl\u2019s youth and genial nature in her guileless features, attentive gaze, and tender embrace of the ermine, which sits with its head cocked regally and alert.",
              "Her slender hand reveals the complicated bone structure beneath the skin, just as the head of the ermine suggests the skull underneath the finely rendered fur.",

              "Many pundits remarked on the poor skill used to represent Jesus\u2019 face;",
              "the stiff posture, which was so unlike the Renaissance master\u2019s characteristic twisting poses;",
              "and the unconvincing representation of the glass globe, which, if solid, would have reflected a distorted view of its holder, an optical trick that Leonardo would have known about.",
              "Christie\u2019s, the auction house that managed the sale, dismissed the criticisms, noting that any lack of craft was the result of heavy restoration in previous centuries and pointed to the soft modeling of Jesus\u2019 right hand and the finesse of his tight curls, both characteristics that resembled Leonardo\u2019s technique.",
              "The auction house also asserted that conservators had confirmed that the painting was made of the same materials that Leonardo would have used, notably ultramarine, an expensive high-quality blue pigment often reserved exclusively for virtuosos.",
              "The attribution debate continued well after the sale, but the interest in the work and the large sum paid at auction attested to Leonardo\u2019s enduring celebrity and to his powerful position in the art history canon five centuries after his death.",

              "It is one of Leonardo\u2019s earliest works, finished when he was in his early 20s, and shows some of the unconventional methods he would use throughout his career.",
              "Inspired by his Northern contemporaries, Leonardo broke with tradition by depicting the solemn young woman in a three-quarter pose rather than the customary profile, and thus he may have been the first Italian artist to paint such a composition.",
              "He continued to use the three-quarter view in all of his portraits, including the Mona Lisa, and it quickly became the standard for portraiture, so ubiquitous that viewers take it for granted today.",
              "Leonardo may also have used his fingers when the paint was still tacky to model Ginevra\u2019s face, as suggested by the fingerprints found in the paint surface.",
              "On the reverse side of the painting, a wreath of laurel and palm encircles a sprig of juniper (ginepro in Italian\u2014a pun on the sitter\u2019s name), and a scroll bearing the Latin phrase \u201cbeauty adorns virtue\u201d entwines each of the flora.",
              "The truncated appearance of the reverse side suggests that the painting may have been cut at the bottom, possibly because of damage from water or fire.",
              "Some scholars speculate that the portrait on the obverse would have included Ginevra\u2019s hands and propose that a silverpoint study of arms and hands housed at Windsor Castle may have served as a preliminary drawing.",
              "Some scholars believe that The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne was Leonardo\u2019s last painting, and in this work he used many of the conventions that he had established throughout his career to depict three generations of the Holy Family\u2014Saint Anne, her daughter, the Virgin Mary, and the Christ Child.",

              "Contrasting with the knowing infant Leonardo depicted in The Virgin of the Rocks, the Christ figure in the The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne appears innocent, demonstrating playful juvenile behavior and showing a trusting expression as he returns his mother\u2019s gaze.",
              "The interactions between the figures feels intimate and reveals Leonardo\u2019s ability to represent convincing human relationships.",
              "The painting also shows Leonardo\u2019s lifelong interest in believably representing three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface.",
              "As in many of Leonardo\u2019s paintings, the figures sit amid a fantastical landscape.",
              "Using aerial perspective, a technique that he wrote about in his Treatise on Painting, Leonardo created the illusion of distance by painting the rocky formations in the background so that they appear blue-gray and less detailed than the landscape of the foreground.",
              "He used this technique in many of the landscapes of his earlier works, including the Mona Lisa and The Virgin of the Rocks."

              "[n 1] Long thought to be a copy of a lost original veiled with overpainting, it was rediscovered, restored, and included in a major exhibition of Leonardo's work at the National Gallery, London, in 2011\u20132012.",
              "[2] Auction house Christie's stated just after selling the work in 2017 that most leading scholars consider it to be an original work by Leonardo, but this attribution has been disputed by other leading specialists, some of whom propose that he only contributed certain elements;",
              "and others who believe that the extensive damage prevents a definitive attribution.",
              "The painting depicts Jesus Christ in an anachronistic blue Renaissance dress, making the sign of the cross with his right hand, while holding a transparent, non-refracting crystal orb in his left, signaling his role as Salvator Mundi and representing the 'celestial sphere' of the heavens.",
              "Approximately thirty copies and variations of the work by pupils and followers of Leonardo have been identified.",
              "[3] Two preparatory chalk and ink drawings of the drapery by Leonardo are held in the British Royal Collection.",
              "[4][5] The painting was sold at auction for US$450.",
              "3 million on 15 November 2017 by Christie's in New York to Prince Badr bin Abdullah Al Saud, setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.",
              "Prince Badr allegedly made the purchase on behalf of Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism,[6][7] but shortly thereafter it was reported that he was a stand-in bidder for his close ally, the Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
              "[8] The painting has not been publicly exhibited since the 2017 Christie's auction, and since late 2020 has been in storage in Saudi Arabia reportedly awaiting a museum and cultural center to be completed in Al-'Ula.",
              "[9][10] Art historians have suggested several possibilities for when the work was executed and who the patron may have been.",
              "Auction house Christie's stated that it was probably commissioned around 1500, shortly after King Louis XII of France conquered the Duchy of Milan and took control of Genoa in the Second Italian War;",
              "Leonardo himself moved from Milan to Florence in 1500.",
              "[11][12] The art historian Luke Syson agrees, dating the painting to c.",

              "1504\u20131510 and c.",
              "1507 or later respectively.",
              "[n 1] Based on their similarity in style and materials to the studies for The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne, Carlo Pedretti dates the drapery studies in the Royal Collection, and thus the painting, to 1510\u20131515.",
              "[13] Because of the specificity of the subject, Leonardo's Salvator Mundi was probably commissioned by a specific patron rather than produced on speculation.",
              "[14] Isabella d'Este, Duchess of Milan, is cited as a possible patron as in 1504 she had wished to commission from Leonardo a \"youthful Christ of around twelve years, of that age that he had when he disputed in the Temple\", though Salvator Mundi shows a more mature Christ.",
              "[4][13][n 2] Carlo Pedretti notes that Isabella d'Este was a guest of Leonardo's patron Giuliano de'Medici in 1514 and so may have convinced the artist to complete the commission at that time.",
              "[13] Martin Kemp does not draw conclusions, but likewise discusses the possibility of Isabella d'Este as patron \u2013 though he also considers the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, Charles VIII of France, and others.",
              "[15] Joanne Snow-Smith argued that Leonardo painted the Salvator Mundi for Louis XII of France and his consort, Anne of Brittany.",
              "[16] This view was echoed by the British Royal Collection in their 2018 exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing and is supported by the early French provenance of many of the copies of the Salvator Mundi.",
              "[4][5] The painting would have been used in the context of personal devotion, as were other panels of this size and subject in the sixteenth century.",
              "[17][16] Indeed, Snow-Smith emphasizes in her writings the devotional relationship that Louis XII and Anne of Brittany had with the Salvator Mundi as a subject[18][n 3] and Frank Zo\u0308llner discussed the painting's relationship to French illuminated manuscripts in the practice of early sixteenth-century personal devotion and prayer.",
              "[22] It is possible that the painting was recorded in a 1525 inventory of Salai\u0300's estate as \"Christo in mondo de uno Dio padre\", though it is unclear to which Salvator Mundi this might refer.",
              "[14] The provenance of the painting breaks after 1530.",
              "[3] The Salvator Mundi as an image type predates Leonardo.",
              "Thus, Martin Kemp argues that on one hand Leonardo was constrained in his composition by the expected iconography of the Salvator Mundi, but on the other hand, he was able to use the image as a vehicle for spiritual communication between the spectator and the likeness of Christ.",
              "[17] The composition has its sources in Byzantine art, the imagery of which further developed in northern Europe before finding its place in the Italian states.",
              "[n 4] Snow-Smith relates the development of the Salvator Mundi to Byzantine iconography and narratives of images of Christ \"not made by human hands\".",
              "[24] Such acheiropoeta would include the Mandylion of Edessa, the Keramidion, and the Veil of Veronica.",
              "[25] Although the Salvator Mundi has its origins in the acheiropoeta, Snow-Smith discusses, the Salvator Mundi emerged in the fifteenth century through such intermediate subjects as Christ as Pantocrator, Christ in Majesty, and The Last Judgement, which like the acheiropoeta betray their Byzantine origins through their frontal depictions of Christ.",
              "[26] The frontality of Christ is shared by other images of Christ and God the Father in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, including in 'portrait' images of Christ, which feature only Christ at half-length and without the orb or blessing gesture, as well as in images of 'Christ Blessing' which does not show Christ holding an orb.",
              "[27] Images of Christ holding a sphere became widely popular following Charlemagne's adoption of the globus cruciger and the scepter.",
              "[27][n 5] The earliest true Salvator Mundi images are found in northern Europe.",
              "[n 6] Indeed, the iconography of the Salvator Mundi came to fruition in paintings such as Robert Campin's Blessing Christ and Praying Virgin and in the central panel of Rogier van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, before such images became common in Italy later in the fifteenth century.",
              "[n 7] Works by such artists as Antonello da Messina and his Christ Blessing betray the influence of Northern artists in the Italian states.",
              "[29][30] The earliest Italian example of a Salvator Mundi is likely to be Simone Martini's Salvator Mundi Surrounded by Angels at the Palais des Papes, Avignon.",
              "This image shows Christ at full length rather than the bust-length portrayals of later paintings of the Salvator Mundi.",
              "[n 8] The image of Salvator Mundi later became well known in Italy, and especially Venice, through the archetype from Giovanni Bellini, now known only through copies.",
              "[30] This includes Andrea Previtali's 1519 painting at the National Gallery, London.",
              "[31] Another fifteenth-century example can be seen in the Palazzo Ducale in Urbino in the very damaged painting by Melozzo da Forli\u0300.",
              "It has been suggested that Leonardo based his composition on this specific example.",
              "[16][29][n 9] There are at least thirty copies and variations of the painting executed by Leonardo's pupils and followers, as counted by Robert Simon.",
              "[3][n 10] The large number of these paintings is an important part of the pedigree of Leonardo's painting[3] and emphasizes that there must have been an original by Leonardo from which they were copied.",
              "[34] The most significant and widely discussed among these is the painting formerly in the de Ganay collection, as this one shares most closely the same composition and demonstrates the highest technical skill of Leonardo's pupils.",
              "This is so much the case that Joanne Snow-Smith proposed it to be the original painting in 1978.",
              "[34][35][n 11] The many other copies found in Naples, Detroit, Warsaw, Zu\u0308rich and other public and private collections contain various attributions to members of Leonardo's pupils and followers.",
              "[34][38] Some versions differ significantly from the original.",
              "Two examples can be found in the form of a 'portrait' such as in Salai\u0301's 1511 painting, as well as in a painting sold at Sotheby's on 5 December 2018, both of which use Leonardo's Salvator Mundi as their model but which do not employ the iconography of the blessing hand or globe.",
              "[n 12] Other artists use the same model but for other subjects, as is the case with Leonardo's Spanish follower Fernando Ya\u0301n\u0303ez de la Almedina and the Eucharistic Christ now at the Museo del Prado.",
              "[40] Leonardo's studio and his followers likewise produced at least four Salvator Mundi panels depicting a youthful Christ who is less frontal in his pose and who holds a terrestrial globe.",
              "[41][n 13] These are largely from Leonardo's Milanese following rather than from members of his studio,[43][n 14] though the variant in Rome can reasonably be attributed to his pupil Marco d'Oggiono.",
              "[n 15] This painting seems to have been at James Hamilton's Chelsea Manor in London from 1638 to 1641.",
              "After participating in the English Civil War, Hamilton was executed on 9 March 1649 and some of his possessions were taken to the Netherlands to be sold.",
              "[47] The Bohemian artist Wenceslaus Hollar could have made his engraved copy, dated 1650, in Antwerp at that time.",
              "[11][n 17] It was also recorded in Henrietta Maria's possession in 1649,[47][n 18] the same year her husband Charles I was executed, on 30 January.",
              "The painting was included in an inventory of the Royal Collection,[n 19] valued at \u00a330, and Charles's possessions were put up for sale under the English Commonwealth.",
              "The painting was sold to a creditor in 1651, returned to Charles II after the English Restoration in 1660,[51] and included in an inventory of Charles's possessions at the Palace of Whitehall in 1666.",
              "It was inherited by James II, and may have remained with him until it passed to his mistress Catherine Sedley,[11] whose illegitimate daughter with James became the third wife of John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham.",
              "The duke's illegitimate son, Sir Charles Herbert Sheffield, auctioned the painting in 1763[51] along with other artworks from Buckingham House when the building was sold to George III.",
              "The painting was probably placed in a gilded frame in the nineteenth century, in which it remained until 2005.",
              "[52] It is probably the painting bought by the British collector Francis Cook in 1900 from J.",

              "Robinson for his collection at Doughty House in Richmond, London.",
              "[53][54] The painting had been damaged by previous restoration attempts and was attributed to Bernardino Luini, a follower of Leonardo.",
              "[51] Sir Francis Cook, 4th Baronet, Cook's great-grandson, sold it at auction in 1958 for \u00a345[55] as a work by Leonardo's pupil Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, to whom the painting remained attributed until 2011.",
              "[56] The original painting by Leonardo was thought to have been destroyed or lost around 1603.",
              "[58] In 1978, Joanne Snow-Smith argued that the copy in the collection of the Marquis Jean-Louis de Ganay in Paris was the lost original, based on, among other things, its similarity to Leonardo's Saint John the Baptist.",
              "[n 21] While Snow-Smith was thorough in her research in regard to the provenance of the painting and its relationship to Hollar, few art historians were convinced of her attribution.",
              "[36][n 22] In 2005, a Salvator Mundi was presented at an auction at the St.",
              "Charles Gallery auction house in New Orleans, consigned from the estate of the Baton Rouge businessman Basil Clovis Hendry Sr.",
              "[61] It had been heavily overpainted, to the point where the painting resembled a copy, and was, before restoration, described as \"a wreck, dark and gloomy\".",
              "[62] It was acquired by a consortium of art dealers that included Alexander Parish and Robert Simon, a specialist in Old Masters.",
              "[63][64][65] The consortium paid $1,175 for the painting.",
              "[66][n 23] The consortium believed there was a possibility that this seemingly low-quality work might be Leonardo's long-missing original;",
              "[69] as a consequence, in April 2005 they commissioned Dianne Dwyer Modestini at New York University to oversee the restoration.",
              "When Modestini began removing the overpainting with acetone at the beginning of the restoration process, she discovered that at some point a stepped area of unevenness near Christ's face had been shaved down with a sharp object, and also levelled with a mixture of gesso, paint, and glue.",
              "[52] Using infrared photographs Simon had taken of the painting, Modestini discovered a pentimento (a trace of an earlier composition), which had the blessing hand's thumb in a straight, rather than curved, position.",
              "[52] The discovery that Christ had two thumbs on his right hand was crucial.",
              "This pentimento showed that the original artist had reconsidered the position of the figure;",
              "such a second thought is considered evidence of an original, rather than a copy, as a painting copied from the finished original would not have such an alteration partway through the painting process.",
              "[70] Modestini proceeded to have the panel specialist Monica Griesbach chisel off a woodworm-infested marouflaged panel, which had caused the painting to break into seven pieces.",
              "Griesbach reassembled the painting with adhesive and wood slivers.",
              "[52] In late 2006, Modestini began her restoration effort.",
              "[52] The art historian Martin Kemp was critical of the result: \"Both thumbs\" of the painting's raw state \"are rather better than the one painted by Dianne\".",
              "[70] Other experts have also been critical of the extensive level of restoration undertaken by Modestini, and that it had impeded any attribution of the work (and some calling it a \"contemporary work\" or a \"masterpiece by Modestini\").",
              "[71] From November 2011 through February 2012, the painting was exhibited at the National Gallery, London, as an autograph work by Leonardo, after authentication by that gallery.",
              "[63][65][72][n 24] The painting was stored at the Dallas Museum of Art for the remainder of 2012 while museum leadership attempted and failed to raise the necessary funds to purchase the painting.",
              "[74] In May 2013, the Swiss dealer Yves Bouvier purchased the painting for just over US$75 million in a private sale brokered by Sotheby's, New York.",
              "The painting was then sold to the Russian collector Dmitry Rybolovlev for US$127.",
              "5 million.",
              "[75][76][77] The price that Rybolovlev paid was therefore significantly higher, well beyond the 2 percent commission Bouvier was supposed to receive, according to Rybolovlev himself.",
              "[78][79][80] Consequently, this sale\u2014along with several other sales Bouvier made to Rybolovlev\u2014created a legal dispute between Rybolovlev and Bouvier,[81] as well as between the original dealers of the painting and Sotheby's.",
              "In 2016, the dealers sued Sotheby's for the difference of the sale, arguing that they were shortchanged.",
              "The auction house has denied knowing that Rybolovlev was the intended buyer, and sought to dismiss the lawsuit.",
              "[82] In 2018, Rybolovlev also sued Sotheby's for $380 million, alleging that the auction house knowingly participated in a defrauding scheme by Bouvier, in which the painting played a part.",
              "[83] Rybolovlev's lawyers believe email exchanges between Bouvier and Sotheby's confirmed this.",
              "[84] The painting was exhibited in Hong Kong, London, San Francisco, and New York in 2017, and then sold at auction at Christie's in New York on 15 November 2017 for $450,312,500,[n 25] a new record price for an artwork (the hammer price was $400 million, plus $50.",
              "3 million in fees).",
              "[88][89] The purchaser was identified as the Saudi Arabian prince Badr bin Abdullah.",
              "[90][91] In December 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Prince Badr was an intermediary for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,[8] but Christie's and Saudi officials re-stated that Prince Badr acted on behalf of Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism for display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.",
              "[6][92] In September 2018, the painting's scheduled exhibition at the Louvre Abu Dhabi[93][94] was announced as indefinitely postponed.",
              "[95] Instead, in 2018 the Saudi crown prince secretly shipped the painting to Paris,[96] on loan to curators at the Louvre, where it was analysed by the Centre for Research and Restoration of Museums of France[97] and was expected to be hung in the Louvre's large Leonardo da Vinci exhibition which opened in October 2019.",
              "[96][98] But the Saudis demanded that it be hung next to the Mona Lisa, which was impossible for security reasons, and the painting was shipped back to Saudi Arabia.",
              "[98][96] It hung in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's yacht Serene until late 2020, when it was removed to a secret Saudi location while the yacht was in a Dutch shipyard for maintenance.",
              "[98] The painting is being kept in storage until a new museum is built to house it;",
              "[99] the museum and gallery will be in a complex called Wadi AlFann in Al-'Ula, expected to be completed in 2024.",
              "[9][10] About a year into her restoration effort, Dianne Dwyer Modestini noted that colour transitions in the subject's lips were \"perfect\" and that \"no other artist could have done that\".",
              "Upon studying the Mona Lisa for comparison, she concluded that \"The artist who painted her was the same hand that had painted the Salvator Mundi\".",
              "[52] Since then, she has disseminated high-resolution images and technical information online for the scholarly community and public.",
              "[100] In 2006 Nicholas Penny, director of the National Gallery, wrote that he and some of his colleagues considered the work an autograph Leonardo, but that \"some of us consider that there may be [parts] which are by the workshop\".",
              "[52] Penny conducted a side-by-side study of the Salvator Mundi and the Virgin of the Rocks in 2008.",
              "Martin Kemp later said of the meeting, \"I left the studio thinking Leonardo must be heavily involved\", and that \"No one in the assembly was openly expressing doubt that Leonardo was responsible for the painting.\"",
              "[52] In a 2011 consensus decision facilitated by Penny, the attribution to Leonardo was agreed upon unequivocally.",
              "[56][101] By July 2011, separate press release documents were issued by the owners' publicity representative and the National Gallery, officially announcing the \"new discovery\".",
              "[56][102] Once it was cleaned and restored, the painting was compared with, and found superior to, twenty other versions of the composition.",
              "[citation needed] It was on display in the National Gallery's exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan from November 2011 to February 2012.",
              "[11][62][104][105] Several features in the painting have led to the positive attribution: a number of pentimenti are evident, most notably the position of the right thumb.",
              "The sfumato effect of the face\u2014evidently achieved in part by manipulating the paint using the heel of the hand\u2014is typical of many works by Leonardo.",
              "[106] The way the ringlets of hair and the knotwork across the stole have been handled is also seen as indicative of Leonardo's style.",
              "Furthermore, the pigments and the walnut panel upon which the work was executed are consistent with other Leonardo paintings.",
              "[107] Additionally, the hands in the painting are very detailed, something for which Leonardo is known: he would dissect the limbs of the deceased in order to study them and render body parts in an extremely lifelike manner.",
              "[108] One of the world's leading Leonardo experts, Martin Kemp,[109][110] who helped authenticate the work, said that he knew immediately upon first viewing the restored painting that it was the work of Leonardo: \"It had that kind of presence that Leonardos have .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "that uncanny strangeness that the later Leonardo paintings manifest.\"",
              "Of the better-preserved parts, such as the hair, Kemp notes: \"It's got that kind of uncanny vortex, as if the hair is a living, moving substance, or like water, which is what Leonardo said hair was like\".",
              "[106] Kemp also states: However skilled Leonardo's followers and imitators might have been, none of them reached out into such realms of \"philosophical and subtle speculation\".",
              "We cannot reasonably doubt that here, we are in the presence of the painter from Vinci.",
              "[111] In his biography of Leonardo, Walter Isaacson notes that the celestial sphere that Christ is holding does not correspond to the way such an orb would realistically look.",
              "[112] It also shows no reflection.",
              "[113] Isaacson writes that In one respect, it is rendered with beautiful scientific precision, but Leonardo failed to paint the distortion that would occur when looking through a solid clear orb at objects that are not touching the orb.",
              "Solid glass or crystal, whether shaped like an orb or a lens, produces magnified, inverted, and reversed images.",
              "Instead, Leonardo painted the orb as if it were a hollow glass bubble that does not refract or distort the light passing through it.",
              "[114] Isaacson believes that this was \"a conscious decision on Leonardo's part\",[115] and speculates that either Leonardo felt a more accurate portrayal would be distracting, or that \"he was subtly trying to impart a miraculous quality to Christ and his orb.\"",
              "[114] Kemp agrees that \"To show the full effects of the sphere on the drapery behind would have been grotesque in a functioning devotional image\".",
              "[113] Kemp further states that the doubled outline of the heel of the hand holding the sphere\u2014which the restorer described as a pentimento\u2014is an accurate rendering of the double refraction produced by a transparent calcite (or rock crystal) sphere.",
              "[n 26][106] However, this continues outside the globe itself.",
              "[113] Kemp further notes that the orb \"sparkles with a series of internal inclusions (or pockets of air)\"\u2014evidence in support of its being solid.",
              "[116] More recently, the globe has been also interpreted as a magnifying instrument consisting of a vitreous globe filled with water (which in nature would also distort the background).",
              "[117][113] Andre\u0301 J.",
              "Noest suggests that the three painted specks represent celestial bodies.",
              "[113] Other versions or copies of the Salvator Mundi often depict a brass, solid spherical orb, terrestrial globe, or globus cruciger;",
              "occasionally, they appear to be made of translucent glass, or show landscapes within them.",
              "The orb in Leonardo's painting, Kemp says, has \"an amazing series of glistening little apertures\u2014they're like bubbles, but they're not round\u2014painted very delicately, with just a touch of impasto, a touch of dark, and these little sort of glistening things, particularly around the part where you get the back reflections\".",
              "These are the characteristic features of rock crystal, on which Leonardo was an avid expert.",
              "He had been asked to evaluate vases that Isabella d'Este[n 27] had thought of purchasing, and greatly admired the properties of the mineral.",
              "[106] Iconographically, the crystal sphere relates to the heavens.",
              "[116][103] In Ptolemaic cosmology, the stars were embedded in a fixed celestial crystalline sphere (composed of aether), with the spherical Earth at the center of the universe.",
              "\"So what you've got in the Salvator Mundi\", Kemp states, \"is really 'a savior of the cosmos', and this is a very Leonardesque transformation.\"",
              "[106] Another aspect of Leonardo's painting Kemp studied was depth of field, or shallow focus.",
              "Christ's blessing hand appears to be in sharp focus, whereas his face\u2014though altered or damaged to some extent\u2014is in soft focus.",
              "In his manuscript of 1508\u20131509 known as Paris Manuscript D,[121] Leonardo explored theories of vision, optics of the eye, and theories relating to shadow, light, and colour.",
              "In the Salvator Mundi, he deliberately placed an emphasis on parts of the picture over others.",
              "Elements in the foreground are seen in focus, while elements further from the picture plane, such as the subject's face, are barely in focus.",
              "Paris Manuscript D shows that Leonardo was investigating this particular phenomenon around the turn of the century.",
              "Combined, the intellectual aspects, optical aspects, and the use of semi-precious minerals are distinctive features of Leonardo's oeuvre.",
              "[106] \"There is extraordinary consensus it is by Leonardo,\" said the former co-chairman of old master paintings at Christie's, Nicholas Hall: \"This is the most important old master painting to have been sold at auction in my lifetime.\"",
              "[122] Christie's lists the ways scholars confirmed the attribution to Leonardo da Vinci: The reasons for the unusually uniform scholarly consensus that the painting is an autograph work by Leonardo are several, including the previously mentioned relationship of the painting to the two autograph preparatory drawings in Windsor Castle;",
              "its correspondence to the composition of the 'Salvator Mundi' documented in Wenceslaus Hollar's etching of 1650;",
              "and its manifest superiority to the more than 20 known painted versions of the composition.",
              "Furthermore, the extraordinary quality of the picture, especially evident in its best-preserved areas, and its close adherence in style to Leonardo's known paintings from circa 1500, solidifies this consensus.",
              "[11][123] According to Robert Simon, \"Leonardo painted the Salvator Mundi with walnut oil rather than linseed oil, as all the other artists in that period did .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "In fact, he wrote about using walnut oil, as it was a new advanced technique.\"",
              "[124] Simon also states that ultraviolet imaging reveals that the darker areas of the painting are mostly owing to the restoration;",
              "the rest is original paint.",
              "[125] The art critic Ben Lewis, who disputes a full attribution to Leonardo, admits that his authorship of the work is possible, owing to the originality of the face, which has \"something modern about it\".",
              "[125] Kemp says: I don't rule out the possibility of studio participation .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "But I cannot define any areas that I would say are studio work.",
              "[126] An examination of the painting had been conducted by the Centre for Research and Restoration of Museums of France (C2RMF) for the Louvre in June 2018.",
              "A publication was prepared by the Louvre and printed in 2019 in case the Louvre had the chance to present the painting in its exhibition, and was temporarily available in the Louvre bookshop.",
              "It contains essays by Vincent Delieuvin, the chief curator of paintings at the Louvre, and Myriam Eveno and Elisabeth Ravaud from the Louvre's laboratory C2RMF.",
              "In his preface, the museum's director Jean-Luc Martinez states that \"The results of the historical and scientific study presented in this publication allow us to confirm the attribution of the work to Leonardo da Vinci, an appealing hypothesis which was initially presented in 2010 and which has sometimes been disputed\".",
              "[127][96][128][129] Delieuvin differentiated the picture from other studio versions \u2013 including the Ganay version that appeared in the Louvre's Leonardo exhibition \u2013 by the presence of subtle underpainting, numerous pentimenti, and pictorial quality.",
              "He concludes: All these factors invite us to privilege the idea of a work that is entirely autograph, sadly damaged by the poor conservation of the work and by previous restorations which were too brutal.",
              "[127] In the discussion of the scientific evidence, Ravaud and Eveno write: The examination of the Salvator Mundi seems to us to demonstrate that the painting was indeed executed by Leonardo.",
              "It is essential in this context to distinguish the original parts from those that have been changed or repainted and this is indeed what was carried out during this study notably by using X-ray fluorescence.",
              "Examination under a microscope revealed very skilful execution, notably in the skin colouring and in the curls of the hair, and great refinement notably in the depiction of the relief of the embroidery [knotwork].",
              "Radiography showed up the same very faint outlines as in the St.",
              "Anne, Mona Lisa and St.",
              "John the Baptist, characteristic of Leonardo's work after 1500.",
              "The number of changes made during the creation of the work also plead in favour of an autograph work.",
              "The first version of the central 'plastron' with a pointed form, is immediately comparable to the central part of the tunic in the Windsor drawing and to our knowledge is not seen anywhere else.",
              "In addition, the movement of the thumb was also noted in the St.",
              "John by Leonardo.",
              "After intensive studies of the other Leonardo works in the Louvre's collection it seems to us that a number of the techniques observed in the Salvator Mundi are typical of Leonardo\u2014the originality of the preparation, the use of ground glass and the remarkable use of vermillion in the hair and shadows.",
              "These latest elements all plead in favour of a late work by Leonardo, after St.",
              "John the Baptist, and dating from the second Milan period.",
              "[127] Some respected experts on Renaissance art question the full attribution of the painting to Leonardo.",
              "[130][115][131] Jacques Franck, a Paris-based art historian and Leonardo specialist who has studied the Mona Lisa out of the frame multiple times, stated: \"The composition doesn't come from Leonardo, he preferred twisted movement.",
              "It's a good studio work with a little Leonardo at best, and it's very damaged.",
              "It's been called 'the male Mona Lisa', but it doesn't look like it at all.\"",
              "[122] Michael Daley, the director of ArtWatch UK, doubts the Salvator Mundi's authenticity and theorizes that it may be the prototype of a subject painted by Leonardo:[132][133] \"This quest for an autograph prototype Leonardo painting might seem moot or vain: not only do the two drapery studies comprise the only accepted Leonardo material that might be associated with the group, but within the Leonardo literature there is no documentary record of the artist ever having been involved in such a painting project.\"",
              "[132] Carmen Bambach, a specialist in Italian Renaissance art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, questioned full attribution to Leonardo: \"having studied and followed the picture during its conservation treatment, and seeing it in the context in the National Gallery exhibition, much of the original painting surface may be by Boltraffio, but with passages done by Leonardo himself, namely Christ's proper right blessing hand, portions of the sleeve, his left hand and the crystal orb he holds.\"",
              "[134][135] In 2019, Bambach criticised Christie's for its claim that she was one of the experts who had attributed the painting to Leonardo.",
              "In her 2019 book Leonardo da Vinci Rediscovered, she is even more specific, attributing most of the work to Boltraffio, \"with only 'small retouchings' by the master himself\".",
              "[136] Matthew Landrus, an art historian at the University of Oxford, agreed with the concept of parts of the painting being executed by Leonardo (\"between 5 and 20%\"), but attributes the painting to Leonardo's studio assistant Bernardino Luini, noting Luini's ability in painting gold tracery.",
              "[137] Frank Zo\u0308llner, the author of the catalogue raisonne\u0301 Leonardo da Vinci.",
              "The Complete Paintings and Drawings,[138] writes: This attribution is controversial primarily on two grounds.",
              "Firstly, the badly damaged painting had to undergo very extensive restoration, which makes its original quality extremely difficult to assess.",
              "Secondly, the Salvator Mundi in its present state exhibits a strongly developed sfumato technique that corresponds more closely to the manner of a talented Leonardo pupil active in the 1520s than to the style of the master himself.",
              "The way in which the painting was placed on the market also gave rise to concern.",
              "[132][138][139] Zo\u0308llner also explains that the quality of Salvator Mundi surpasses other known versions;",
              "however, [It] also exhibits a number of weaknesses.",
              "The flesh tones of the blessing hand, for example, appear pallid and waxen as in a number of workshop paintings.",
              "Christ's ringlets also seem to me too schematic in their execution, the larger drapery folds too undifferentiated, especially on the right-hand side .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "It will probably only be possible to arrive at a more informed verdict on this question after the results of the painting's technical analyses have been published in full.",
              "[132][138][140] In a subsequent interview for the 2021 documentary The Lost Leonardo, Zo\u0308llner said: \"You have the old parts of the painting which are original\u2014these are by pupils\u2014and the new parts of the painting, which look like Leonardo, but they are by the restorer.",
              "In some part, it's a masterpiece by Dianne Modestini\".",
              "[71] In Paris, the Louvre's request for the Salvator Mundi to be exhibited in its Leonardo da Vinci exhibition of 2019\u20132020[141] was reportedly met without response.",
              "[142] The New York Times reported in April 2021 that the non-appearance was because the French were unwilling to meet Saudi demands that the painting be hung alongside the Mona Lisa.",
              "[143] The Louvre's inability to comment on the matter in the interim, however, led to speculation that its absence was due to doubts over its full attribution to the artist.",
              "[143][144] In November 2021, scholars at the Museo del Prado included the painting under \"attributed works, workshop of authorized and supervised by Leonardo\" in the catalogue for Leonardo and the Copy of the Mona Lisa.",
              "The Prado curator Ana Gonzales Monzo wrote in the catalog that the Ganay-collection copy of the Salvador Mundi was likely the closest to Leonardo's original design, and that it was likely done by the same artist that painted the Prado copy of the Mona Lisa.",
              "The curator of the Louvre's 2019\u201320 Leonardo exhibition, Vincent Delieuvin, wrote in the Prado catalog that the painting had \"details of surprisingly poor quality\", and that \"It is to be hoped that a future permanent display of the work will allow it to be reanalyzed with greater objectivity\".",
              "[145][146] The British art historian Charles Hope dismissed the attribution to Leonardo entirely in a January 2020 analysis of the painting's quality and provenance.",
              "He doubted that Leonardo would have painted a work where the eyes were not level and the drapery undistorted by a crystal orb.",
              "He added, \"The picture itself is a ruin, with the face much restored to make it reminiscent of the Mona Lisa.\"",
              "Hope condemned the National Gallery's involvement in Simon's \"astute\" marketing campaign.",
              "[147] In August 2020, Jacques Franck, who had previously called the portrait \"a good studio work with a little Leonardo at best\",[122] cited its \"childishly conceived left hand\", as well as the \"oddly long and thin nose, the simplified mouth [and] the over shadowy neck\" as evidence that Leonardo did not paint it.",
              "[148] More precisely, Franck now attributes the painting to Salai\u0300 jointly with Boltraffio: in effect, the work's infrared reflectogram betrays a very singular sketching-out technique, never seen in any of Leonardo's original paintings, yet encountered in Salai\u0300's Head of Christ of 1511 in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, a composition close to the Saudi Salvator Mundi and signed by the artist.",
              "This claim is also supported by the fact that a stricto sensu Salvator Mundi painting is recorded in Salai\u0300's posthumous inventory of the estate established in Milan on 25 April 1525.",
              "[149] In November 2020, a newly discovered drawing of Christ surfaced, possibly by Leonardo and with notable differences from the painting.",
              "According to the Leonardo scholar Annalisa Di Maria, \"[This] is the true face of Salvator Mundi.",
              "[It] recalls everything in the drawings of Leonardo\", pointing to the similar three-quarters view used in his presumed self-portrait.",
              "She continued, \"[Leonardo] could never have portrayed such a frontal and motionless character.\"",
              "Kemp indicated that before he could review the drawing, he \"would need to see if it is drawn left-handed\".",
              "[150] The rediscovered painting by Leonardo generated considerable interest within the media and general public amid its pre-auction viewings in Hong Kong, London, San Francisco and New York, as well as after the sale.",
              "More than 27,000 people saw the work in person before the auction: the highest number of pre-sale viewers for an individual work of art, according to Christie's.",
              "[130] The sale was the first time Christie's had used an outside agency to advertise an artwork.",
              "Approximately 4,500 people stood in line to preview the work in New York the weekend prior to the sale.",
              "[130] The sensationalism of the painting following the sale led to it being a common subject in popular culture and discourse online.",
              "As Brian Boucher described, \"the internet went a little bonkers\" in response to the sale, leading to sarcastic and humorous comments and memes on Twitter, Instagram and other social media sites.",
              "[151] Similarly, Stephanie Eckardt noted how \"the ongoing saga of Salvator Mundi indisputably\" belongs in \"the meme canon.\"",
              "[152] In an article in the Art Market Monitor, Marion Maneker compared the sensationalism around Salvator Mundi to the media coverage surrounding the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911.",
              "Just as the international media sensationalism lifted the painting to a high international status, she argued, so too did Christie's marketing campaign and media sensationalism lead to its high sales price.",
              "[153] Alexandra Kim of the Harvard Crimson similarly described the reason for the painting's newfound fame: Why are we still so adamantly curious [about Salvator Mundi]?",
              "The New York Times, The Guardian, and more have covered this painting and its aftermath.",
              "It now seems that the drama surrounding this infamous painting has created a whole new work of art larger than the Salvator Mundi itself.",
              "The attention has grossly inflated its value: the more we discuss the work, the more curious we are until it becomes a shining ball of artistic enlightenment.",
              "[154] The narratives surrounding the painting have piqued the interest of filmmakers and playwrights.",
              "In July 2020, the company Caiola Productions announced that it was working on the production of a Broadway musical based on the history of Leonardo's Salvator Mundi.",

              "Home Film Art Books Music TV Style Identities Designed The Collection More Somewhere in Saudi Arabia, hidden away by order of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, is the world's most expensive painting, Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi.",
              "Or is it?",
              "No one in the art world knows for sure where the painting is.",
              "Most observers agree that it is likely stashed in the Middle East, but some have speculated that it is stored in a tax-free zone in Geneva or even on the Prince's half-a-billion-dollar yacht.",
              "Is it even a Leonardo at all?",
              "The image of Christ as The Saviour of the World was billed as The Last da Vinci at Christie's 2017 auction, where it sold for a record $450 million (\u00a3342 million) to a proxy for bin Salman (yes, that bin Salman, whom the CIA found responsible for ordering the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi).",
              "But even then, many Leonardo experts were dubious that the painting had more than a few brush strokes by him, and those doubts have ramped up ever since.",
              "More like this: - The world's greatest art detective - The men who Leonardo da Vinci loved - The detail that unlocks the Mona Lisa Veiled in layers of mystery and international intrigue, the story of the Salvator Mundi is an ongoing, endlessly fascinating saga, told in two new documentaries, The Lost Leonardo and Saviour for Sale: Da Vinci's Lost Masterpiece?",
              ", which play out with all the drama and suspense of a detective story.",
              "They arrive in the wake of Ben Lewis's high-profile 2019 book, The Last Leonardo, and dozens of articles.",
              "The painting, which dates to around 1500, was lost to history for more than 200 years, was damaged and badly restored, and was sold and resold as a minor work, probably by a Leonardo acolyte.",
              "But now the Salvator Mundi has become the poster boy for the volatile mix of money, power and geopolitics that defines the art world today.",
              "\"When we chose the title,\" Andreas Dalsgaard, a producer and a writer of The Lost Leonardo, tells BBC Culture, \"the inspiration was partly that the painting is lost right now and the truth is lost, but it was also inspired by movies like the Indiana Jones movies that are full of treasures and treasure hunts.\"",
              "This possibly-Leonardo treasure's route to fame began when it surfaced at an obscure New Orleans auction house in 2005 and was bought by two New York dealers for a measly $1,175.",
              "They brought it to Dianne Modestini, a highly respected restorer, who removed decades of grime and overpainting, and was the first to suspect it might be a true Leonardo.",
              "Art restorer Dianne Modestini in a scene from The Lost Leonardo, one of two new documentaries about the Salvator Mundi (Credit: Sony Pictures Classics/Entertainment Pictures) With its sleek narrative and a wide range of voices from dealers to art historians to investigative journalists, The Lost Leonardo is the better of the two films, and benefits greatly from using Modestini as its main character.",
              "She is a captivating, elegant presence on screen, with a whispery voice and wide eyes behind signature black or red-framed glasses.",
              "She spent years restoring the painting, and passionately defends its authenticity in precise detail, pointing out the pentimento under Christ's thumb or a curve of his mouth that could only be Leonardo's.",
              "But many experts think she did a drastic over-restoration.",
              "In the film, the art historian Frank Zo\u0308llner, who has compiled a catalogue raisonne\u0301 of Leonardo's paintings, wryly calls the Salvator Mundi \"a masterpiece by Dianne Modestini,\" who made it \"more Leonardesque than Leonardo had done.\"",
              "For her part, Modestini has documented her work and the scientific studies of the painting, and published them online.",
              "Most experts today agree the painting was probably produced by assistants in Leonardo's workshop, where he added some finishing touches \u2013 a common practice.",
              "But uncertainty is key to the appeal of every version of the story, as Lewis tells BBC Culture: \"Nobody knows if it is a Leonardo, so you too can play the game, you can do your own Da Vinci Code on the Salvator Mundi.\"",
              "Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi was sold by Christie's in 2017 for a record-breaking $450 million (Credit: Photo by Ilya S Savenok/Getty Images for Christie's Auction House) The quality of the painting itself divides people.",
              "The US art critic Jerry Saltz rails in The Lost Leonardo that \"it's not even a good painting\", much less a great Leonardo, while true believers gush that seeing it in person is a transcendent experience.",
              "(Maybe so, but in the films and other reproduced images it does have a more cloying look).",
              "Some of the most eye-opening commentary in both films isn't even about art.",
              "In The Lost Leonardo, Evan Beard, a Bank of America executive who deals with art as investment, talks about the common buyers' motive of using artworks as collateral for other financial manoeuvres.",
              "The film doesn't take a stand on the painting's attribution, but makes it clear that museums, dealers and potential buyers had millions to gain \u2013 along with incalculable prestige \u2013 by choosing to believe it is a true Leonardo.",
              "'Colourful characters' A major turning point came when the painting was controversially displayed as an authentic Leonardo at a 2011 exhibition at the National Gallery in London.",
              "In both films, Luke Syson, the curator of the show, stands by his decision.",
              "But many experts on camera and elsewhere in the press think he leapt to an early conclusion.",
              "Alison Cole, editor of The Art Newspaper, has written extensively about the painting and saw it at the National Gallery.",
              "She tells BBC Culture, \"Since then, Dianne Modestini continued to work on it.",
              "But when I saw it, it didn't sit comfortably with me as an autograph Leonardo.\"",
              "Nonetheless, the exhibition went a long way toward legitimising a shaky attribution.",
              "Two years later, some colourful characters entered the game.",
              "Yves Bouvier, a Swiss art dealer, bought the painting from the New York dealers for $83 million, reportedly on behalf of his client, a Russian oligarch named Dmitry Rybolovlev, though this is disputed by Mr Bouvier.",
              "Within two days he sold it to Rybolovlev for $127.",
              "5 million.",
              "In The Lost Leonardo, a grinning Bouvier says his exploits are just business as usual: \"you buy low and you sell high.\"",
              "(Swiss authorities investigated him for defrauding Rybolovlev over several artworks, but this year closed the case without charging him.)",
              "Soon, the painting was on its way to Christie's.",
              "The Christie's sale itself was a highly staged drama, beginning with a marketing video that showed not the painting but the faces of observers \u2013 most are ordinary people but one of them is Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 looking reverently at the image as if they were seeing Christ himself.",
              "The buyer was anonymous, but the New York Times soon revealed him to be acting for bin Salman, a discovery that catapulted the painting into the geopolitical realm.",
              "At the time bin Salman was trying to burnish Saudi Arabia's image by loosening a few restrictions.",
              "Most art world observers thought the Salvator Mundi would be the centrepiece of a new museum or art centre in the region, but the painting has not been glimpsed in public since.",
              "It came close.",
              "The Louvre very much wanted to include it in its grand exhibition to celebrate Leonardo's 500th anniversary in 2019.",
              "Bin Salman himself visited President Emmanuel Macron in Paris while the loan was dangling in the balance.",
              "As late as the press preview of the show, there was an empty space on the wall waiting for the Salvator Mundi, but it never arrived.",
              "The New York Times confirmed rumours that the Louvre wouldn't accede to bin Salman's demand that his painting be displayed in the same room as the Mona Lisa, giving it near-equal status.",
              "French President Emmanuel Macron pictured in 2018 with the owner of the Leonardo, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (Credit: Photo by Bandar Algaloud/Getty Images) \"The Louvre is supported by the government, the ministry of culture and ultimately Macron,\" Cole tells BBC Culture.",
              "\"And it is involved therefore in the politics around culture.",
              "So if Saudi Arabia decides that culture is going to be the way it opens up and the Salvator Mundi is going to be a key player in that strategy and the Louvre is offering to exhibit it, then all those things are tied up together.\"",
              "Cole was the first to report, in March 2020, the existence of a 46-page booklet the Louvre prepared for publication but never released, which asserts that the piece is an authentic Leonardo.",
              "Because the Louvre cannot comment on privately-owned works it has not displayed, the book can't be published, and at first, Cole says, the museum denied its existence.",
              "Scandals and conspiracies Antoine Vitkine's film Saviour for Sale is most notable for some explosive additions about what might have happened behind the scenes at the Louvre.",
              "The documentary covers much of the same ground as The Lost Leonardo, but less stylishly, with too many stock establishing shots of cities.",
              "It suffers from not having Modestini or some other compelling central figure.",
              "But it does have two anonymous sources, their faces hidden on camera, identified as high-ranking French government officials who had access to the Louvre's studies of the painting and to the French-Saudi negotiations.",
              "One of the sources says the Louvre concluded that Leonardo merely \"contributed to the painting,\" but that bin Salman would only approve the loan if the Salvator Mundi were labelled an authentic Leonardo.",
              "The source says he advised the government that \"exhibiting under the Saudi conditions would be like laundering a piece that cost $450 million\".",
              "The Louvre and the National Gallery refused to comment for either film.",
              "The two documentaries arrive at a time when films, podcasts and pop culture itself seem fascinated by art crimes, mysteries and forgeries.",
              "In the past year two documentaries, the engaging Made You Look and the pedestrian Driven to Abstraction, tackled the case of the Knoedler Gallery in New York, which for nearly two decades sold forgeries supposedly by 20th-Century masters including Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.",
              "Knowingly or not?",
              "That is still a question.",
              "The Netflix series This Is a Robbery delves into the 1990 theft of masterworks including a Rembrandt from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.",
              "The series is full of conspiracy theories about the never-solved robbery.",
              "And Lewis has a new eight-episode podcast, Art Bust: Scandalous Stories of the Art World, which promises stories of \"the ugliest crimes, the biggest scandals and the murky in-between.\"",
              "The subjects range from Inigo Philbrick, criminally charged with defrauding clients by selling more than 100% of shares in artworks, to a golden Egyptian coffin whose smuggled past came to light after Kim Kardashian was photographed next to it at the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute gala.",
              "The Met has since returned the coffin to Egypt.",
              "That these tales can work in a podcast, where no one can even see the work being described, suggests how much the allure of today's art-crime stories is in the skulduggery and mystery, not aesthetics.",
              "A scene from Saviour for Sale, a second documentary about the Salvator Mundi, by French journalist Antoine Vitkine (Credit: Zadig Productions) Many factors seem to have converged to create this flourishing moment for true art crime.",
              "There is so much information in the public sphere that everyone can have the illusion of being an insider.",
              "There are more and more platforms for telling stories.",
              "And Lewis points out that as the art market has enlarged, our world view itself has changed.",
              "The general attitude toward art crime, he says, used to be shrugged off as \"it's billionaires spending money, crooking each other\", but today there is a realisation that \"no, you can't loot that country's entire cultural heritage\".",
              "Amidst all these delightfully tangled histories, nothing rivals the Salvator Mundi.",
              "Unless new documentation surfaces (unlikely after all these centuries), or a new scientific method of authentication arrives (also tricky because the work has been so damaged), the mystery may prove eternal.",
              "\"I'm absolutely sure that six months down the road or a year, there's going to be some kind of new information, whether true or not, that's going to blow up everywhere in the news media,\" Dalsgaard says.",
              "\"As long as this painting is hidden from the world and the future and fate of this painting is unknown, it's going to be clouded in a realm of mystery and the world will be ready to read anything new.",

              "The piece had been inadequately restored and heavily overpainted.",

              "The painting certainly does not inspire the same contemplation or admiration that Leonardo's other works do.",
              "While many critics later noted that the Salvator Mundi has interesting passages, including the soft modeling of Jesus\u2019 right hand and the finesse of his tight curls, they doubted that the work was entirely by Leonardo.",
              "The attribution continues to be a subject of debate among scholars and critics.",
              "Those who question the painting\u2019s attribution to Leonardo not only consider the depiction of Jesus as having feeble features, but they also describe the head-on composition as stiff and unlike Leonardo\u2019s characteristic twisting poses.",

              "Indeed, a version of the painting in Moscow\u2019s Pushkin Museum was certainly part of the English royal collection, for it is stamped with \u201cCR\u201d (for Carolus Rex) on the back of its support.",
              "It is more likely that this painting, which is attributed to Giampietrino, a pupil of Leonardo\u2019s, is the one referred to in the Charles I inventory.",

              "Until now, it was thought that the painting was \u201cpossibly\u201d made for Leonardo\u2019s patron King Louis XII of France and his consort Anne of Brittany, who \u201cmost likely\u201d commissioned it from the artist soon after the French conquest of Milan, around 1500 (according to the sale catalogue published by Christie\u2019s in November 2017).",

              "It is a richly suggestive narrative: made for a king and fit for a king.",
              "Scholars propose that when the French princess Henrietta Maria married King Charles I in 1625, she may have brought the picture with her, and that it remained in her Greenwich apartments\u2014as royal property\u2014until the king\u2019s execution in 1649.",
              "It has been identified with \u201cA peece of Christ done by Leonardo\u201d (recorded in the Commonwealth Sale of 1651).",
              "But now, new research by the 17th-century specialist Jeremy Wood situates a Salvator Mundi by Leonardo in the Chelsea home of James, 3rd Marquis, later 1st Duke of Hamilton, between 1638 and 1641, rather than in Queen Henrietta\u2019s chambers.",

              "\u201cTherefore, I consider there is a strong possibility that this painting was seen at Chelsea House and chosen by the king at some point between 1638 and 1641, finding its way to the queen\u2019s apartments at Greenwich.",

              "(Indeed, in 1649 and 1650, Hollar made a number of etchings after Italian paintings that were available to him in the original.)",
              "Wenceslaus Hollar claimed to have etched the Salvator Mundi \u201cfrom the original\u201d while he was in exile in Antwerp Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, Toronto There is even an intriguing possible piece of evidence to support this: in a shipping crate containing Hamilton\u2019s pictures there was a \u201cChrist holding up his two fingers\u201d, but without an attribution.",
              "The shortage of other candidates in the Hamilton collection, Wood believes, makes this at least an avenue worth exploring.",
              "Dalivalle places this hypothesis among the \u201cred herrings\u201d that will be fully addressed in the forthcoming book Leonardo\u2019s Salvator Mundi and the Collecting of Leonardo in the Stuart Courts, co-authored by Dalivalle, the US art dealer Robert Simon and the Leonardo expert Martin Kemp (Oxford University Press)\u2014much-delayed and now due for publication next year.",

              "The writer Ben Lewis, who alerted The Art Newspaper to Woods\u2019s discovery, is also producing a publication on the Salvator Mundi (Ballantine/HarperCollins, 2019), and believes that Wood\u2019s research will \u201csignificantly change the direction of his book\u201d.",
              "Experts will now be scrutinising Hamilton\u2019s collecting habits and asking whether any credible Leonardos\u2014rather than works by his pupils\u2014have emerged from the Venetian collectors and dealers he bought from.",
              "They will also be researching the works that Hamilton inherited from his forebears.",
              "Regarding the subsequent history of Hamilton\u2019s Salvator Mundi, there are two alternatives at issue.",
              "One allows Hamilton\u2019s \u201cChrist: with a Globe in his hande\u201d to pass to Charles I around 1640.",
              "The other allows Hamilton\u2019s picture to go to the Netherlands in 1649.",
              "Hopefully all the pieces will fall into place in time for the Louvre\u2019s Leonardo exhibition in Paris next year (from 24 October 2019), when the painting will be further researched and catalogued."
