    "query": "What is the evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and what are some practical tips for individuals who want to incorporate this practice into their daily routine?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Mindfulness meditation is a practice that involves paying attention to the present moment with openness and curiosity, without judging or reacting to your thoughts and feelings. There is a lot of evidence that mindfulness meditation can help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as improve mental and physical health in general.\n\nAccording to one review of more than 200 studies of mindfulness among healthy people, mindfulness-based therapy was especially effective for reducing stress, anxiety and depression[^2^]. Another study found that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which combines mindfulness with cognitive behavioral therapy, can significantly reduce relapse in people who have had previous episodes of major depression[^2^] [^4^]. Mindfulness meditation can also change the brain in positive ways, such as increasing the volume of gray matter in the hippocampus (a brain area involved in memory) and breaking the connection between two brain regions (the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala) that are involved in stress and anxiety[^3^] [^5^].\n\nSome practical tips for individuals who want to incorporate mindfulness meditation into their daily routine are:\n\n- Start small. You can begin with just a few minutes of meditation per day and gradually increase the duration as you feel more comfortable. You can also use guided meditations from apps, websites or books to help you get started.\n- Choose a time and place that works for you. You can meditate at any time of the day, but some people find it easier to do it in the morning or before bed. You can also meditate anywhere that is quiet and comfortable, such as your bedroom, living room or garden.\n- Be consistent. Try to meditate every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. This will help you develop a habit and make it easier to stick with it. You can also set a reminder on your phone or calendar to help you remember.\n- Be gentle with yourself. Don't worry if your mind wanders or if you feel distracted or restless during meditation. This is normal and part of the process. Just gently bring your attention back to your breath, your body sensations or whatever you are focusing on. Don't judge yourself or get frustrated. Remember that mindfulness is about accepting whatever arises in your experience with kindness and curiosity.\n- Experiment with different types of mindfulness. There are many ways to practice mindfulness, such as focusing on your breath, scanning your body, observing your thoughts and emotions, listening to sounds, looking at objects or doing mindful movements like yoga or walking. You can try different methods and see what works best for you. You can also vary your practice depending on your mood, energy level or situation.",

              "MBIs also perform comparably to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).",
              "The treatment principles of MBIs for anxiety and depression are compatible with those of standard CBT.",
              "Buddhist traditions first explored the concept of mindfulness in broad philosophical terms unfamiliar to most modern readers.",
              "Nevertheless, mindfulness has spread rapidly in Western psychology research and practice, in large part because of the success of standardized mindfulness-based interventions.",
              "1 These interventions, namely mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)2 and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT),3 incorporate the essence of Eastern mindfulness practices into Western cognitive-behavioral practice.",
              "The body of literature on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) has grown exponentially in recent years.",
              "4,5 Despite the popularity of these interventions, the evidence base is still not fully established, in part because this literature is oversaturated with cross-sectional studies, waitlist-controlled trials, and other methodological shortcomings that limit the strength of conclusions that can be drawn from these studies.",
              "1 Considering these weaknesses, clinical researchers have increasingly studied MBIs with more rigorous methodology, allowing for select meaningful conclusions to be drawn from the present body of work.",
              "Recent reviews of well-designed, randomized controlled trials comparing mindfulness treatments (primarily MBSR and MBCT) to active control conditions indicate that MBIs are effective in treating a broad range of outcomes among diverse populations.",
              "6\u201311 These outcomes include clinical disorders and symptoms such as anxiety,8,12,13 risk of relapse for depression,14,15 current depressive symptoms,9 stress,16\u201318 medical and well-being outcomes such as chronic pain,19 quality of life,14,20 and psychological or emotional distress.",
              "21,22 Additionally, MBIs have been shown to work via changes in specific aspects of psychopathology, such as cognitive biases, affective dysregulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.",
              "17,23,24 In addition to the mindfulness-based treatment protocols, mindfulness principles have been integrated into other notable therapeutic interventions such as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)25 and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).",
              "26 Additionally, mindfulness has increasingly been explored within the context of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for emotional disorders.",
              "27 The use of mindfulness in these treatment protocols is markedly different from MBSR and MBCT, in that mindfulness is merely a component of these interventions, whereas it is the core skill taught in mindfulness-based treatments.",
              "Additionally, these treatments include other, non-mindfulness therapeutic ingredients, thus making it difficult to attribute therapeutic effects to mindfulness skills specifically.",
              "1,28 Despite these distinctions, MBIs are quite compatible with the dominant cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy practiced today.",
              "CBT is an umbrella term that refers to a conceptual model of treatment more than any one protocol.",
              "29,30 Mindfulness and acceptance strategies are consistent with general CBT principles, because they target core processes, such as increased emotional awareness and regulation, cognitive flexibility, and goals-based behaviors.",
              "31,32 This is a topic that is outside the boundaries of this chapter, but that is likely to become part of the future of psychotherapy.",
              "As we will discuss throughout this review, mindfulness targets one such core processes that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing anxiety and depression symptom severity, both as the core treatment ingredient, as well as when integrated into other treatments.",
              "The primary aim of this article is to explore the ways in which cognitive and behavioral treatments for depression and anxiety have been advanced by the application of mindfulness practices.",
              "The overarching theoretical premise of MBIs is that, by practicing mindfulness (e.",
              "g. through sitting meditation, yoga, or other mindfulness exercises), individuals will become less reactive to unpleasant internal phenomena but more reflective, which in turn will lead to positive psychological outcomes.",
              "3,33 We will briefly review the most recent literature in mindfulness-based treatments for anxiety and depression, starting with current perspectives in the definition and measurement of mindfulness.",
              "Mindfulness refers to a process that leads to a mental state characterized by nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment experience, including one\u2019s sensations, thoughts, bodily states, consciousness, and the environment, while encouraging openness, curiosity, and acceptance.",
              "34\u201336 Bishop and colleagues (2004)34 distinguished two components of mindfulness, one that involves self-regulation of attention and one that involves an orientation toward the present moment characterized by curiosity, openness, and acceptance.",
              "Mindfulness stands in stark contrast with much of our common daily experience, as the default mode of attention for many individuals is, in fact, non-attention.",
              "Mind wandering is ubiquitous,37 as is the state of mindlessly going through our daily activities, or \u201crunning on autopilot.",
              "\u201d38 When we do manage to focus on internal experiences in the present moment, this attention is often filled with self-critical, ruminative, or otherwise worrisome thoughts and emotions which we then attempt to suppress.",
              "39 Indeed, the experience of attending to one\u2019s present moment can be so aversive that some people prefer almost anything else;",
              "a review of 11 laboratory studies with healthy adults found that most people choose to do mundane tasks, or even receive mild electric shocks over being left alone with their own thoughts.",
              "40 Despite their predominance in our daily life, mindless states have been demonstrated to be maladaptive.",
              "In a large study using ecological momentary assessment data, 37 it was found that approximately 47% of subjects\u2019 waking hours were spent in a state of mind wandering;",
              "furthermore, the authors demonstrated that mind wandering predicts subsequent unhappiness.",
              "In contrast, the capacity to keep one\u2019s mind focused on the present moment is associated with higher psychological well-being.",
              "41 Taken together, these findings suggest that mindfulness is a difficult state to achieve, but is ultimately beneficial.",
              "This skill has been likened to the cognitive science theory of a \u201cdesirable difficulty,\u201d essentially a task that requires expenditure of cognitive resources, but results in higher cognitive flexibility, insight, and self-regulation abilities.",
              "4 Mindfulness is thus both a skill and a practice;",
              "the practice of mindfulness begets the skill of staying mindful.",
              "The stronger one\u2019s ability to adopt a mindful state throughout the perpetual ups and downs of life, the less suffering one will experience.",
              "This basic premise remains the foundation of mindful practices, as it has for centuries;",
              "42 yet when clinical scientists attempt to parse apart the mechanisms of this seemingly simple process, the evidence rapidly becomes messy and ill-defined.",
              "Whichever mechanisms truly underlie mindfulness (see below for a review of key mechanisms), mindfulness practices appear to demonstrate therapeutic effects on emotional well-being, and thus continue to capture the interest of myriad clients, practitioners, and researchers.",
              "The first and perhaps the most well-known mindfulness-based intervention to gain empirical support in the treatment of psychological symptoms is mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn in the early 1980s.",
              "2 MBSR is an 8-week treatment program that is aimed at reducing stress via enhanced mindfulness skills developed through regular meditation practices.",
              "The program consists of weekly 2\u20132.",
              "5-hour group-based meditation classes with a trained teacher, daily audio-guided home practice (approximately 45 min/day), and a day-long mindfulness retreat occurring during the sixth week.",
              "Much of the course content is focused on learning how to mindfully attend to body sensations, using various mind-body meditative practices such as sitting meditation, body scans, gentle stretching, and yoga.",
              "Additionally, the group classes foster discussion of how to apply these mindful practices in daily life, with the ultimate effect of being able to handle stressors in a more adaptive way.",
              "The MBSR program was initially developed to treat medical patients with chronic pain,2 but has since been applied to many other populations of medical and psychiatric patients, as well as community members.",
              "43 Across these various groups, MBSR has consistently been found to be tolerable, with high rates of compliance, program completion, and patient satisfaction.",
              "6,44,45 Studies comparing MBSR to active control conditions have demonstrated that MBIs are superior in reducing anxiety symptoms. Hoge and colleagues46 found that MBSR outperformed an active stress-management education program in a group of individuals with generalized anxiety disorder.",
              "More specifically, individuals in the MBSR group demonstrated significantly more reduction in anxiety symptom severity than the control group, as measured by self-report measures of anxiety as well as anxiety in response to a laboratory social stress challenge task.",
              "The MBSR group demonstrated a pre-post treatment effect size (Cohen\u2019s d) of 1.",
              "06, which is comparable to the effect sizes seen in CBT for anxiety.",
              "These results are supported by select meta-analyses that have demonstrated superiority of MBSR in reducing anxiety and stress relative to heterogenous control conditions.",
              "8,47,48 Pre-post treatment effect sizes for these meta-analyses all fall in the moderate-large range (Hedge\u2019s g ranging from 0.",
              "24 \u2013 1.",
              "54).",
              "MBSR appears to be a safe and effective treatment for the reduction of emotional dysregulation.",
              "Additionally, researchers have adapted the basic principles of the program into modified protocols to treat specific populations and outcomes.",
              "These include mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for depression,15 mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) for drug addiction,49 mindfulness-based relationship enhancement (MBRE) to improve relationship functioning,50 and a mindfulness-based program to foster healthy eating,51 to name just a few.",
              "The most widely researched adaptation of MBSR is mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), originally developed by John Teasdale, Zindel Segal, and Mark Williams to prevent relapse of major depression.",
              "15 As its name implies, MBCT combines elements of both mindfulness training and cognitive therapy to reduce the recurrence of depression.",
              "Mindfulness principles are applied to aid individuals in recognizing deterioration of mood without immediately judging or reacting to this change.",
              "This enhanced internal awareness is then combined with principles of cognitive therapy that teach individuals to disengage from maladaptive patterns of repetitive negative thinking that contribute to depressive symptomatology.",
              "52 Other than this additional cognitive therapy component, MBCT closely follows the structure of MBSR, including the 8-week group-based format, and the length and type of homework assignments.",
              "Since its initial development, several well-designed randomized-controlled trials examining the efficacy of MBCT relative to control conditions have demonstrated that the program is effective in reducing rates of relapse among individuals with major depression.",
              "4 Furthermore, studies looking at individual moderators of treatment outcomes have found that MBCT may be most effective in preventing relapse among individuals with the greatest risk of relapse.",
              "These high-risk individuals include those with four or more previous major depressive episodes (Cohen\u2019s h = 0.",
              "88),53 and those who suffered from maltreatment during childhood.",
              "53,54 In addition to preventing rates of relapse, MBCT has also demonstrated efficacy in reducing current acute depression symptoms (Hedge\u2019s g = 0.",
              "73).",
              "9 In one of these trials, Eisendrath and colleagues55 tested the efficacy of a modified MBCT program for individuals with current treatment-resistant depression.",
              "Results showed that MBCT reduced depressive symptoms posttreatment compared to a well-matched active control program (Health Enhancement Program, or HEP).",
              "Despite these promising findings, the MBCT and control groups did not differ significantly on rates of depression remission, suggesting that the effects of MBCT were not strong enough to impact full disorder remission.",
              "These findings also illustrate the importance of a well-matched control condition.",
              "Until recent years, most trials compared MBIs to waitlist controls, which introduce a multitude of confounding factors that limit the strength of conclusions that can be drawn from these trials.",
              "Given that MBCT was no better than a general health education program in achieving depression remission in this high-quality trial, the results of waitlist-controlled trials should be interpreted with great caution.",
              "MBSR and MBCT are intensive treatment programs requiring a sizeable commitment in terms of both patient and therapist time and training.",
              "In addition to these standardized treatments, mindfulness practices have been applied therapeutically in several other ways.",
              "One popular treatment delivery method is mindfulness meditation retreats, which typically range from 1\u20133 days, but can extend as long as 3 months.",
              "4 These retreats vary greatly in terms of their format and target population, and there is scant research on their short- and long-term effects.",
              "Nevertheless, these retreats are a relatively cost-effective way of delivering intensive and well-controlled doses of a mindfulness intervention, and recent trials have demonstrated promising effects on anxiety, stress, and other measures of psychosocial well-being and health.",
              "56,57 Some investigators have adapted the MBSR treatment protocol into abbreviated 2\u20133-week programs.58,59 These programs have not been examined as thoroughly as the standard 8-week interventions;",
              "however, preliminary evidence indicates that these modest interventions can have beneficial effects on a variety of symptoms, including compassion58 and working memory capacity.",
              "59 It is as yet unclear whether these abbreviated mindfulness interventions can effectively reduce clinical levels of anxiety or depression, though the potential for beneficial effects in a fraction the time warrants further study.",
              "Another emerging adaptation of standard MBIs is even shorter 3- or 4-day lab-based mindfulness training.",
              "60 These brief and highly controlled interventions typically involve 20-to-30-minute group sessions conducted by a trained meditation instructor, and minimal-to-no required practice outside of the lab.",
              "61 Though these mindfulness interventions are too truncated to expect any long-term effects, studies indicate that they can have immediate effects on psychological and neuroendocrine responses to social stress,60 and perceived pain severity in response to noxious heat stimulation.",
              "61 These significant effects after only a few days of mindfulness training are exciting, and future research should explore whether such brief interventions can have similar effects on symptoms of anxiety or depression.",
              "Regardless, these shorter mindfulness interventions offer one clear benefit already in that they afford greater research flexibility to conduct both efficacy and mechanisms-focused trials.",
              "4 Another new development in the mindfulness literature is the recent surge of internet- and app-based MBIs.",
              "These interventions vary a great deal in the treatment length, ranging from 8-week programs that closely mimic the MBSR protocol,62 to 2- or 3-week self-guided interventions with little formal structure.",
              "58,63 Though these technology-delivered interventions are still in their infancy, a recent meta-analysis of 15 RCTs found that, relative to control or waitlist conditions, technology-delivered MBIs had a significant beneficial impact on depression, anxiety, stress, well-being, and mindfulness (Hedge\u2019s g ranging from 0.",
              "22 for anxiety to 0.",
              "51 for stress).",
              "64 Although studies have not yet examined the efficacy of online MBIs compared to in-person approaches, these preliminary findings are promising and warrant further research.",
              "Randomized-controlled trials comparing MBSR to active control conditions indicate that MBSR is moderately-to-largely effective at reducing anxiety and depression symptom severity among individuals with a broad range of medical and psychiatric conditions.",
              "The most comprehensive review to date 6 examined the effects of 209 trials of mindfulness-based interventions among 12,145 patients with a variety of disorders.",
              "The results indicated that MBIs are more effective in reducing psychological and medical symptom severity than waitlist, psychoeducation, supportive psychotherapy, relaxation training, and imagery or suppression techniques.",
              "Post-treatment effect sizes were largest for psychological outcomes, relative to physical or medical outcomes, with the strongest effects found for anxiety, followed by depression.",
              "These beneficial effects remained relatively stable after follow-up periods (ranging from 3 weeks to 3 years, with a median of 28 weeks), though the comparative effect sizes for MBI versus control treatment conditions diminished at follow-up.",
              "6 Collectively, these results indicate that MBIs are more effective than non-evidence-based treatments in reducing anxiety and depression symptom severity among a broad range of treatment-seeking individuals.",
              "However, as noted by Dimidjian and Segal, 65 the field has been limited by a number of methodological gaps that restrict both the reach and relevance of the conclusions that can be drawn from the current literature.",
              "Mindfulness-based treatments and traditional (Beckian) CBT share many similar characteristics.",
              "45 Both aim to reduce psychopathological suffering, and approach this goal with a combination of cognitive and behavioral therapeutic exercises.",
              "Both involve a desensitization of conditioned fear responses, though MBIs approach this effect through sustained attention, while traditional CBT directly focuses on severing the conditioned response through exposure-based processes.",
              "66 Another key similarity between traditional CBT and MBIs is the directive to view one\u2019s internal phenomena (thoughts, feelings, sensations) as temporary and without inherent worth or meaning.",
              "Again, MBIs approach this process through simple observation, whereas traditional CBT involves directly challenging metacognitions about such phenomena.",
              "67 Lastly, both treatments involve relaxation and improvements in self-modulatory efforts,45 though it is unclear whether these effects are attributable to a specific treatment component, or simply engaging in a therapeutic process.",
              "There are also key differences between mindfulness interventions and traditional CBT.",
              "Perhaps the most evident difference is the focus on accepting versus changing maladaptive cognitions.",
              "Although traditional CBT includes elements of both these directives, the overall aim of traditional CBT is to challenge automatic thoughts by holding them up to disconfirming evidence, and then to change them into different thoughts.",
              "68 This \u201ccognitive restructuring\u201d process is antithetical to mindfulness principles, which encourage a complete lack of engagement with one\u2019s cognitive and emotional processes.",
              "Another key distinction is the degree to which each treatment is goal-oriented.",
              "CBT typically begins with the client identifying their primary treatment goals (e.",
              "g. improve mood, reduce maladaptive behaviors), and continues helping them strive toward these goals.",
              "Though clients seek mindfulness-based treatments for similar reasons, the therapeutic process involves little attention to such goals, instead cultivating a seemingly paradoxical attitude of non-striving.",
              "45 Despite these differences, the result of both approaches is ultimately quite similar: By changing one\u2019s perspective on unpleasant thoughts, feelings, or sensations, the individual comes to realize that these internal phenomena are not as dangerous or powerful as previously believed, and the cycle of maladaptive cognitions, emotions, and behaviors gradually weakens.",
              "As we will now discuss, these similarities may perhaps be responsible for the compatibility of mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral treatments.",
              "Before the widespread interest in mindfulness-specific treatments, mindfulness was included as a component of broader evidence-based interventions, such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), cognitive behavioral stress management, and integrative body\u2013mind training.",
              "4 Though these treatments focus on disparate clinical populations and symptoms, efficacy evidence for each suggests that mindfulness training is indeed a key beneficial component of these interventions.",
              "69 We will briefly review the two most common therapies (DBT and ACT) and the role mindfulness plays in each.",
              "Dialectical behavior therapy was developed by Marsha Linehan for the treatment of individuals with borderline personality disorder.",
              "25 This multifaceted intervention is founded on the concept of a unified dialectic, essentially, the view that life is composed of opposing forces which must be simultaneously accepted to achieve beneficial change.",
              "Mindfulness is taught as a skill to help clients recognize and synthesize the key dialectic, namely the contrast between acceptance and change.",
              "Mindfulness skills taught in DBT are similar to those in MBSR, particularly the nonjudgmental observation of internal phenomena;",
              "however, the format in which these skills are taught differs considerably.",
              "Unlike MBSR, which prescribes a specific dose of meditative practice, mindfulness training is one of many skills taught throughout a year-long weekly skills group (other skills include interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance).",
              "Additionally, clients learn mindfulness through numerous exercises, rather than predominantly through meditation as in MBSR.",
              "These exercises include imagery practices (e.",
              "g. imagining the mind is a conveyor belt), breath-focused exercises (e.",
              "g. breath counting, coordinating breaths with footsteps), and various other exercises that encourage clients to practice mindfulness throughout daily tasks such as showering or doing the dishes.",
              "25,45 Clients may choose which mindfulness exercises they wish to practice and when, which allows all individuals to benefit from mindfulness training regardless of their severity or willingness to meditate.",
              "45 Acceptance and commitment therapy was developed by Steve Hayes as a contemporary approach to general adult outpatient psychotherapy based in classic behavior-analytic principles.",
              "26 ACT does not include meditation practices, and rarely uses the term \u2018mindfulness\u2019 in its treatment protocol, but the therapeutic strategies of ACT are practically identical to mindfulness skills as described in this review.",
              "For example, a core principle of ACT is the \u201cobserving self,\u201d in which clients cultivate the ability to simply observe internal phenomena, without attaching to, evaluating, or attempting to change them.",
              "Clients attempt to see themselves as separate from their distressing thoughts, feelings, and sensations, and are encouraged to accept such phenomena as they are, while changing maladaptive behaviors to improve their lives.",
              "26,45 Mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions \u2013 including DBT, ACT, MBSR, and MBCT \u2013 are examples of the so-called \u201cthird-wave\u201d of cognitive-behavioral therapies.",
              "70 After a contentious debate about the meaning, validity, and relevance of the term \u201cthird wave\u201d 4,29 Two prominent representatives from both camps (Steven Hayes and Stefan Hofmann, who is also the first author of this article), recently joined forces based on the evidence and their shared beliefs and values.",
              "The result is a call to redirect clinical practice away from treating medical syndromes and toward focusing on processes and core competencies.",
              "Mindfulness-based interventions target one such process.",

              "Taken together, this review shows that while MBCT is an effective treatment for depression, continued research in the areas of efficacy, mechanisms of action, and dissemination are recommended.",
              "Major depressive disorder (MDD) \u2013 characterized by pervasive and persistent low mood and lack of interest in normally pleasurable activities \u2013 is one of the most common mental health disorders, with high personal and societal costs.",
              "The lifetime prevalence rate of MDD is estimated to be approximately 16% and has a high recurrence rate, ranging from 35% in depressed patients from the general population to 85% in depressed patients from clinical samples.",
              "1,2 As a result of this prevalent and debilitating disorder, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) was developed to reduce depressive relapse for individuals with recurrent MDD.",
              "3 MBCT is a group-based intervention that draws from elements of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).",
              "4,5 Mindfulness is defined as: \u201cthe awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to things as they are\u201d.",
              "6 MBCT includes systematic training in mindfulness meditation by drawing on MBSR, such that patients practice mindfulness exercises (eg, body scans) to become more aware of their thoughts, emotions, and body sensations.",
              "In addition, MBCT contains elements of CBT, such as psycho-education about the role of cognition in depression and exercises to illustrate how one\u2019s thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, induce and maintain depressive symptoms. The combination of mindfulness and CBT used within MBCT is thought to help individuals recognize the automatic activation of dysfunctional cognitive processes, such as ruminative and negative thoughts, and to disengage from these dysfunctional processes with the goal of reducing depressive symptoms and future risk of depressive relapse.",
              "This review summarizes current research pertaining to the efficacy of MBCT in comparison to treatment-as-usual (TAU;",
              "the usual treatment according to accepted standards) and active-control conditions (ACCs) for MDD.",
              "This review also examines mechanisms of change for this therapy and current dissemination practices, and in particular how these identified mediators and dissemination strategies relate to treatment outcomes of MDD.",
              "This narrative review aims to inform clinical practice and steer future research toward enhanced investigation into efficacy, mechanisms of action, and dissemination practices of MBCT for the treatment of MDD.",
              "Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that MBCT, conducted in accordance with the manual, significantly reduces risk of relapse and related symptoms for individuals in depressive remission, and more recently for individuals with current depressive symptomology.",
              "7\u201311 Overall, results have shown that MBCT is effective at reducing the rate of depressive relapse along with a reduction of depressive symptoms. The following will overview results from several systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), exploring the efficacy of MBCT in relation to TAU groups, waitlist control groups, and ACCs for the outcome variables: depressive relapse and depressive symptoms. Empirical evidence supporting the use of MBCT to decrease the risk of depressive relapse started with an initial trial conducted by Teasdale et al in 2000.",
              "12 Teasdale et al found that individuals who were in remission or recovery from major depression had a lower rate of relapse in the MBCT group (40%) compared to the TAU group (66%).",
              "Several studies have also found that individuals in remission or recovery from depression have significantly lower relapse rates in the MBCT plus medication group compared to a medication-alone group.",
              "13,14 In addition, MBCT compared to TAU, has been associated with a reduction in depressive and comorbid symptoms and increased quality of life.",
              "13,14 Further, in 2012, van Aalderen et al found that individuals in the MBCT plus TAU group reported less depressive symptoms, worry and rumination, and increased levels of mindfulness compared to the TAU alone group.",
              "15 More recent work by Forkman et al showed a significant reduction in self-reported suicidal ideation in the MBCT group for individuals with residual depressive symptoms.16 MBCT has also been supported as an effective therapy option.",
              "In 2007, Coelho et al conducted a systematic review of four studies that compared MBCT plus TAU to TAU alone.",
              "8 They concluded that MBCT is a positive addition to TAU for individuals who have experienced three or more depressive episodes.",
              "However, this conclusion was qualified given the need for control groups that are better matched to the MBCT program.",
              "Clarke et al conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in 2015 examining the effect of non-pharmacological interventions on depressive relapse prevention and concluded that MBCT along with CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy were each associated with a significant reduction in relapse compared to controls.",
              "7 However, the authors suggested that the generalizability of these findings warranted caution, given that MBCT was largely tested following medication and may be limited only to patients who had previously recovered from their depression through pharmacological means.",
              "A more recent meta-analysis conducted by Kuyken et al in 2016 analyzed individual patient data from nine published randomized trials of MBCT.",
              "9 Kuyken et al examined the efficacy of MBCT compared with usual care or active treatment groups for patients from a range of sociodemographic backgrounds.",
              "Replicating prior work, results provided evidence that MBCT was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of depressive relapse compared with usual care, with a larger effect being found for individuals with higher levels of depression symptoms at baseline.",
              "The latter finding is consistent with recent trials that have shown MBCT is more effective for people whose depressive symptoms fluctuate and/or who report a history of early adversity.",
              "14,17,18 Kuyken et al also replicated prior work supporting that MBCT does not have differential effects for individuals based on their sex, age, education, or relationship status.",
              "9 The focus thus far has been on preventing depressive relapse.",
              "Depressive symptoms and other related outcomes have also been investigated.",
              "In 2014, Strauss et al conducted a meta-analysis that evaluated 12 studies investigating mindfulness-based interventions for individuals with current anxiety or major depression.",
              "MBCT significantly reduced primary symptom severity for those with current depression, compared to control conditions.",
              "11 More recently, Perestelo-Perez et al conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in 2017 to evaluate the effect of mindfulness-based interventions on ruminative thoughts in individuals with current or past depressive disorders.",
              "10 Results of 11 studies showed that MBCT compared to usual care produced a significant reduction in rumination, independent of the number of past depressive episodes.",
              "Although MBCT has thus far been shown to be effective, one limitation of the aforementioned studies is the absence of an active control group.",
              "To address this limitation, recent studies have compared MBCT to ACCs, exhibiting mixed findings for significant group difference on depressive relapse and related symptoms. Trials including depressive relapse as a primary outcome variable have thus far found no difference between MBCT and ACCs.",
              "For instance, in a 2014 trial, Williams et al compared MBCT to cognitive psychological education (all elements of MBCT except for experiential mindfulness) and TAU in an RCT with individuals who had three or more episodes of recurrent depression.",
              "18 MBCT was only a more effective treatment for relapse prevention in individuals who experienced childhood trauma, but when examining the whole sample MBCT did not show a significant advantage to the ACC or TAU.",
              "Further, in a study conducted by Shallcross et al in 2015, MBCT did not differ from the ACC on variables such as rate of depression relapse, symptom reduction, and life satisfaction.",
              "19 Conversely, in 2014, Meadows et al found more positive results when comparing MBCT to ACCs.",
              "20 Meadows et al found that MBCT combined with depression-relapse active monitoring was superior to depression-relapse active monitoring alone in reducing depressive relapse over a 2-year follow-up for individuals not currently experiencing depressive symptoms but with a history of three or more depressive episodes.",
              "Mixed outcomes for the effectiveness of MBCT compared to ACC have also been found for trials measuring depressive symptoms as the primary outcome variable.",
              "In a recent RCT conducted by Eisendrath et al in 2016, MBCT was compared to a health-enhancement program, which included physical fitness, music therapy, and nutritional education, in individuals with treatment-resistant depression.",
              "21 MBCT was significantly associated with reduced depression-symptom severity compared to the health-enhancement program.",
              "Further, in 2015, Chiesa et al used an RCT to compare MBCT to a psycho-education program in a small sample of 43 patients with depressive disorder who had not achieved remission following the use of antidepressants.",
              "22 Compared to the psycho-education program, individuals in the MBCT group showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, as well as on measures of mindfulness and quality of life.",
              "Conversely, in 2011, Manicavasgar et al found no group differences in outcomes for the treatment of depression between an 8-week MBCT and CBT group for individuals with a current depressive disorder.",
              "23 A more recent meta-analysis conducted by Perestelo-Perez et al compared the effect of MBCT to ACCs on rumination for individuals with a depressive disorder.",
              "10 Using three studies, results indicated that MBCT appeared as effective at reducing rumination as other treatments such as medication, CBT, and behavioral activation.",
              "However, authors recommended caution when interpreting these results given the low number of studies included.",
              "Overall, these analyses provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of MBCT in individuals who are in remission or currently experiencing a depressive episode when compared to TAU;",
              "however, discrepant findings are present when compared to ACCs.",
              "In addition, the conclusions of current research are constrained by several limitations, such as the heterogeneity of the measures used, the need for more appropriate control groups, and the need for more long-term follow up data.",
              "Given the variation in findings and limitations it is important to continue to evaluate the efficacy of MBCT, especially compared to appropriate ACCs.",
              "In addition to evaluating MBCT outcomes, it is important to clarify the mechanisms of action of this intervention.",
              "Kazdin has provided a useful resource for conducting research with the goal of demonstrating mediators and mechanisms of change for psychotherapy.",
              "He defines mechanisms as \u201cthe processes or events that are responsible for change\u201d and underscores the need for greater attention to these lines of research.",
              "24 Perhaps increased collaboration among clinical and neuroscience practitioners may help to shed some light on the neural mechanisms underpinning MBCT.",
              "van der Velden and Roepstorff have called for such alliances to assist in clarifying the processes by which MBCT works.",
              "25 To date, there does not appear to be such a collaboration, but further understanding of these and other underlying processes will certainly allow for optimization of this treatment modality, resulting in enhanced treatment efficacy.",
              "The available RCTs of MBCT for depression provide strong support in favor of MBCT although some have clear limitations along with mixed outcomes.",
              "Given some equivocal findings, the examination of mechanisms of action is preliminary at this point in time, and further research is necessary to strengthen this research area.",
              "Despite a small body of rigorous evaluations of mechanisms of change within mindfulness-based interventions, recent work has been published.",
              "To date, three systematic reviews have been conducted to identify and examine mechanisms of action in mindfulness-based therapies.",
              "Gu et al conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating mechanisms of action underlying mindfulness-based interventions for psychiatric disorders.",
              "26 Rather than including only studies with participants who were diagnosed with MDD, this review included any mental health outcomes.",
              "The results of their analyses showed that both mindfulness and repetitive negative thinking mediated the effects of mindfulness-based interventions for several outcomes including anxiety, depression, general psychopathology, stress, and negative affect.",
              "More recently, Alsubaie et al conducted a systematic review of mechanisms of action in mindfulness-based interventions for individuals with either physical or psychological health conditions.",
              "27 Studies were included if they were trials designed to examine mechanisms of change in MBCT/MBSR in adults with either physical or psychological conditions.",

              "10,28\u201332 Results showed that positive treatment outcomes were mediated by significant increases in mindfulness, rumination, affect, self-compassion, reactivity, and cognitive function.",
              "In a 2015 systematic review specific to MDD, van der Velden et al reviewed 23 clinical trials of MBCT for recurrent MDD to evaluate mechanisms of change.",
              "25 Studies were included if they examined mechanisms in MBCT for MDD, had adult participants, and MBCT was conducted in accordance with the manualized procedures.",
              "The results showed that in 12 of the 23 included studies, MBCT outcome was associated with or predicted by changes in mindfulness, rumination, worry, self-compassion, decentering, and/or meta-awareness.",
              "Given the overlap among mechanisms identified in the reviews, several of the predominant mechanisms of change will be discussed.",
              "Mindfulness is most often defined using Kabat-Zinn\u2019s description of nonjudgmental present moment attention.",
              "33 Perhaps the most important inquiry is whether positive outcomes in MBCT are due to mindfulness being a significant mediator.",
              "Both Alsubaie et al and Gu et al identified RCTs in their systematic reviews showing that MBCT reduces depressive symptoms.26,27 Moreover, these effects appear to be mediated by increases in mindfulness, acceptance, and curiosity even after taking into account heterogeneity of measurement, samples, and outcome assessment.",
              "10,28\u201332,34,35 Repetitive negative thinking involves thinking about negative experiences and is implicated in numerous psychopathologies.",
              "This cognitive pattern is difficult to disengage from and is often conceptualized as worry and rumination;",
              "these two cognitive patterns differ in their temporal orientation.",
              "Worry is typically future-oriented and rumination is past-oriented, and there is significant overlap among these constructs.",
              "36,37 Rumination is a way of coping with distress and refers to repetitively thinking about one\u2019s unpleasant thoughts and feelings and their potential causes and consequences.",
              "38 Rumination can be assessed as a unidimensional construct and/or as separate subscales including reflection and brooding.",
              "39 Across the systematic reviews, three MBCT RCTs have shown that a decrease in depressive symptoms was mediated by rumination, worry, and/or brooding.",
              "10,28,30 The reflective, pondering component of rumination (assessed as reflection in self-report surveys) was not related.",
              "30 Only one RCT has been identified which assessed self-compassion as a possible mediator.",
              "Kuyken et al\u2019s study supported self-compassion as a significant mediator of the positive effects of MBCT for individuals with recurrent depression and more than three depressive episodes.",
              "Specifically, learning self-compassion skills had a mediating role in MBCT for depression such that an increase in self-compassion led to treatment gains over a 15-month follow-up period.",
              "29 Both positive and negative affect have been shown to have mediating roles in the relationship between MBCT and depression.",
              "Two RCTs have indicated that increased positive affect, including pleasant activities and rewarding experiences and a decrease in negative affect have both been implicated in depression reduction.",
              "28,40 Two RCTs included cognitive and emotional reactivity as potential mediators of the effects of MBCT on depressive symptomatology in their analyses.",
              "29,35 These constructs refer to the diathesis-stress model of psychopathology;",
              "specifically, the extent to which a state of distress combined with stress reactivates negative cognitions and affect, putting individuals at risk of a subsequent depressive episode.",
              "41 For individuals with recurrent depressive episodes, reactivity was a significant mediator among MBCT participation and depressive symptoms. Taken together, the results of these three systematic reviews, and an examination of their included RCTs yields strong preliminary evidence for several mechanisms of action in MBCT for individuals with MDD.",
              "These mechanisms include mindfulness, repetitive negative thinking, affect and self-compassion, and cognitive and emotional reactivity.",
              "These mechanisms appear to be fundamentally consistent with the theoretical foundations of mindfulness-based interventions, including MBCT.",
              "The main premise of MBCT is that the development of mindfulness skills can lead to an increase in nonjudgmental acceptance of symptoms, thereby leading to a reduction of such symptoms.3,42 These initial findings likewise support the idea that a reduction in worry and rumination allows for disengagement with symptoms, leading to treatment gains.",
              "Next steps for this line of inquiry should include more in-depth identification and analyses of mechanisms, as well as replication of the few robust studies included here.",
              "Access to MBCT remains a key challenge.",
              "Similar to other empirically supported treatments, the availability of MBCT for the general public is limited, especially outside of large cities.",
              "Positive developments in the area of dissemination include the availability of self-help workbooks.",
              "6,43 There is empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the Williams and Penman (2011) workbook in a sample of students experiencing low mood, stress or anxiety.",
              "44 There are also internet-based approaches, including Mindful Mood Balance, for which there is data supporting efficacy in the reduction of depressive symptoms.45\u201347 Data supporting the use of web-based and other self-help methods are promising for more widespread access to MBCT.",
              "Further, studies evaluating the benefits of home practice when MBCT is delivered in its original group format have found a small association between the amount of home formal meditation practice and outcome.",
              "48 Therefore, what the MBCT participants are doing at home matters in terms of the benefit they gain from MBCT.",
              "Taken together, these studies build support for the ability to deliver MBCT outside of a traditional group setting with formally trained MBCT teachers.",
              "The importance of being able to access MBCT outside of the traditional group setting is particularly important once the level of training of MBCT teachers is considered.",
              "MBCT teachers are required to undergo significant professional training and to have a personal meditation practice.",
              "Segal et al outline a training pathway that includes three phases.",
              "49 The first phase focuses on preparation including readings, teacher training attendance, and residential experiential retreats.",
              "The second phase involves co-facilitating two MBCT classes with an experienced teacher and ongoing supervision.",
              "The final phase focuses on becoming a proficient MBCT teacher through ongoing mindfulness practice, supervision, and training.",
              "These requirements emphasize competence at each phase and imply that a high level of competence is required to become an effective MBCT teacher.",
              "The importance of therapist competence in the delivery of MBCT is a key empirical question.",
              "Therapist competence can be evaluated using the Mindfulness-Based Interventions: Teaching Assessment Criteria (MBI:TAC).",
              "50 The MBI:TAC was developed in the UK and consists of six domains which can each be rated on a scale of one (incompetent) to six (advanced).",
              "Examples of domains include embodiment of mindfulness and conveying course themes.",
              "The six domains can be averaged for a single competence score.",
              "The MBI:TAC is used in the training pathway previously described.",
              "49 However, to date, only one study has empirically evaluated the importance of therapist competence in the delivery of MBCT.",
              "Using the MBI:TAC, Huijbers et al evaluated the impact of teacher competence on the delivery of MBCT at 12 locations in the Netherlands.",
              "51 Patients were all in remission from recurrent depression and had taken antidepressant medication.",
              "Two sessions were randomly selected for viewing from each of 15 teachers and rated by two independent raters.",
              "The final average score for the teachers in this sample was in-between \u201cadvanced beginner\u201d and \u201ccompetent\u201d, with no teachers rated at either extreme (ie, none were rated as incompetent, and none were rated as advanced).",
              "They demonstrated at least moderate agreement between their raters for each domain, supporting the reliability of the MBI:TAC.",
              "Surprisingly, contrary to their hypotheses, teacher competence was not significantly associated with any of the key outcome variables, including reduction of depressive symptoms. Additionally, competence was not significantly related to any mechanisms of change or attendance.",
              "Recall that no therapists were rated as incompetent.",
              "Perhaps attaining a minimal level of competence is the key factor in the delivery of MBCT.",
              "However, this was the first study to empirically evaluate the relationship between therapist competence and outcome, and it was limited in scope considering the homogeneity of the sample.",
              "Notwithstanding these limitations, as well as the necessity for future research on competence with more diverse samples, this study calls into question the rigorous requirements involved in becoming an MBCT teacher, especially when one considers the data supporting the delivery of MBCT via self-help and web-based methods.",
              "If research continues to support that the level of therapist competence does not influence attendance, outcome or process, and that it is possible to deliver MBCT in the absence of a well-trained teacher (in the case of self-help methods), perhaps an even stronger focus on non-traditional methods aimed at greater access will be warranted.",
              "MBCT was developed to reduce depressive relapse in individuals with MDD.",
              "Empirical evidence including systematic reviews of RCTs has indicated that MBCT is an effective intervention in this context.",

              "An increasing number of published studies have shown that there appear to be specific active ingredients in MBCT that are leading to treatment gains.",
              "Mindfulness, one such active ingredient, certainly warrants continued study as our knowledge of different facets of the meditative experience develops.",
              "52 Additionally, there have been some promising results in the area of dissemination, although research on teacher competency is in its infancy, with only one published study to date which did not find an association between competency and outcome.",

              "Consistent with the findings of previous meta-analyses, our work indicates that MBCT provides clear benefit over control conditions (comprising usual care in some studies and active controls in others), through reducing rates of relapse to depression over 60 weeks follow-up.",
              "Extending these findings, MBCT also appears to provide comparable benefits to active treatment controls, in general, and antidepressant controls in particular, although the reduction in risk of relapse to depression was larger for the comparison between MBCT and all control conditions than for MBCT and active treatment controls.",
              "For whom is it most effective?",
              "Across the studies there was no evidence to suggest that the relative benefit of MBCT compared to control conditions was significantly influenced by participant age, gender, sociodemographic status, educational level, participant age of onset of depression or number of prior depressive episodes.",
              "Unfortunately, information on ethnicity was collected inconsistently, but across studies the majority of participants were Caucasian and so it is not clear whether the benefits of MBCT would be similar in samples with greater ethnic and racial diversity.",
              "Participants who were experiencing more depression at entry to treatment showed a greater benefit of MBCT compared with other treatments than those who were less depressed, although those who were less depressed were not disadvantaged by receiving MBCT.",
              "What about safety?",
              "Is MBCT safe?",
              "Along with efficacy, it is important to consider the safety indications for MBCT.",
              "This is a subject Ruth Baer and Willem Kuyken discuss in a separate blog post.",
              "It is also being researched thoughtfully by researchers such as Willoughby Britton and raised by several commentators in the media.",
              "The meta-analysis gathered data on serious adverse events either from the original trial papers or if this data were not reported, directly from the authors.",
              "All the trials had well-trained MBCT teachers and included careful baseline assessment of patients.",
              "As with psychotherapy trials more generally (Duggan, Parry, McMurran, Davidson & Dennis, 2014) information about safety and adverse events has only been collected more recently and the ways in which this information is collected varies somewhat from trial to trial.",
              "Nonetheless, where it was collected these data suggest that rates of serious adverse events were comparable across both MBCT and comparator groups and in no instance was a serious adverse event attributable to MBCT.",
              "This suggests that when MBCT is delivered according to the manual by well-trained MBCT therapists it is safe.",
              "In Summary The results of this meta-analysis are promising and suggest that MBCT can provide a viable relapse prevention intervention for people with a history of recurrent depression.",
              "The findings that there was no evidence to suggest a range of factors such as age and gender significantly influenced the effectiveness of MBCT, and that there was no evidence for an association between MBCT and the occurrence of serious adverse events increases our confidence that MBCT is acceptable for a broad range of people with recurrent depression.",
              "So what does it all mean?",
              "What are the remaining questions?",
              "Although the largest meta-analysis of MBCT for depressive relapse prophylaxis to date, the dataset still only reflects a relatively small number of trials.",
              "It is important to consider how this research fits into the broader research literature, what we don\u2019t yet know and which questions future research might fruitfully address.",
              "Given the prevalence of depression and the fact that the current standard of care for relapse prevention is maintenance medication, there has been a lot of interest in the relative efficacy of MBCT\u2019s preventive effects.",
              "This meta-analysis provides evidence that MBCT (combined with antidepressants or delivered alongside antidepressant tapering/discontinuation) is comparable to maintenance antidepressants alone in preventing subsequent relapse.",
              "It is, however, important to take into account design differences in the four trials that directly compared MBCT to antidepressant arms. In Segal et al.",
              ", (2010) participants who had been treated to remission with antidepressants were randomised to either stay on these, were switched from their antidepressants to a placebo (with participants blinded to which of these two arms they were in), or were randomised to discontinue their medication prior to receiving MBCT.",
              "In both the Kuyken et al.",
              ", trials (2008;",
              "2015), individuals were randomised to continued antidepressant medication or to receive MBCT plus antidepressant tapering, which occurred during treatment.",
              "In the larger trial (2015), tapering or discontinuation of antidepressants occurred in 87% of participants, with 71% stopping antidepressant medication altogether.",
              "Finally Huijbers et al.",
              ", (2015) allowed all participants to stay on their antidepressants with half additionally randomised to receive MBCT.",
              "In this trial 70% of those randomised to receive MBCT and stay on antidepressants adhered to both interventions.",
              "Of those randomised to stay on maintenance antidepressants and NOT receive MBCT, only 60% adhered, with almost a quarter actually accessing and attended 4 or more sessions of MBCT during the trial period.",
              "The results of the meta-analysis tell us that there is a small but significant benefit of MBCT when delivered alongside or as an alternative to antidepressants, in terms of reduced rates of relapse.",
              "However each trial employed a different design and recruited participants with different expectations and preferences, with none reaching statistical significance individually in favour of MBCT.",
              "This means that we need to be careful about drawing premature conclusions concerning the relative effectiveness of MBCT and medication.",
              "We know from clinical experience and qualitative work that people have strong views and preferences around antidepressants (Malpass et al.",
              ", 2009).",
              "Indeed this powerfully shaped recruitment to the studies, and in the Huijbers study the design was changed from the original intention to run a trial with three arms (MBCT alone, maintenance antidepressants alone, and their combination) to two 2-arm trials to accommodate patient preferences (Huijbers et al.",
              ", 2015;",
              "Huijbers et al.",
              ", 2016).",
              "The findings also cannot address the question many people find themselves asking of whether, as someone who is on maintenance antidepressants and chooses to enrol in MBCT in addition, they would then be better off, or worse off, if they chose to come off their antidepressants, all else being equal.",
              "This latter issue is addressed by the second Huijbers two arm pragmatic trial, recently published in the British Journal of Psychiatry.",
              "Huijbers et al.",
              ", (2016) compared rates of relapse in people who were randomised to receive MBCT and then either stay on or come off their antidepressants.",
              "In this trial, those who were randomised to receive MBCT and come off antidepressants fared significantly worse, in terms of relapse to depression, than those who were randomised to receive MBCT and stay on antidepressants i.",
              "e. the combination of the two treatment approaches was superior to MBCT alone.",
              "This finding is not necessarily contradictory to the findings of the meta-analysis \u2013 it addresses a different scenario.",
              "It is also complicated by low levels of protocol adherence in both trial arms (52% in the MBCT + discontinuation arm and 56% in the MBCT + maintenance arm) and very variable quality of MBCT training delivered (only half of the MBCT therapists were rated as competent).",
              "The other issue that is relevant to the interpretation of all tapering trials is the possibility that people tapering or discontinuing antidepressants during and immediately after treatment with MBCT may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) resulting in elevated symptom levels (Riemann, Hertenstein & Schramm, 2015).",
              "This context highlights the complexity of any conclusions we might want to draw from the evidence to date.",
              "We certainly should not be claiming that \u201cMBCT is better than antidepressants.",
              "\u201d Our view is that this would be premature.",
              "Indeed even a large five arm trial comparing all possible MBCT/antidepressant combinations would be unlikely to give a definitive answer to the question of relative superiority because it appears from existing research, including the most recent meta-analysis, that the relative efficacy of MBCT (and hence its likely benefit over alternative treatments) may depend in part on patient preferences and the risk of relapse at the point of entry to the trial (in terms of residual symptoms and/or the presence of other vulnerability factors such as childhood trauma).",
              "Such a trial would be so large and difficult to carry out it is unlikely to ever take place.",
              "Instead, what is needed is careful reading of the trials in the context of the broader research, both quantitative and qualitative, consideration of patient views, preferences and needs and clinical consensus.",
              "The JAMA Psychiatry meta-analysis did not have the power to consider whether residual symptoms moderated the comparison between MBCT and maintenance antidepressants specifically.",
              "Of course we might expect that this would be the case \u2013 people showing partial remission (e.",
              "g. significant residual symptoms) might be expected to benefit more from an additional, psychological, approach to relapse prevention than those in full remission.",
              "It also did not consider how MBCT compares to other psychological interventions since only a single study, the Staying Well After Depression Trial (Williams et al.",
              ", 2014), compared MBCT to an active psychological control treatment.",
              "However there are at least two more recently published studies that speak to this question.",
              "The first, Shallcross et al.",
              ", 2015, compared MBCT to the closely matched Health Enhancement Programme and found no difference in rates of relapse to depression.",
              "The second, a trial by Meadows et al.",
              ", (2014) compared MBCT combined with \u2018depression relapse active monitoring\u2019 (DRAM) to DRAM alone.",
              "In this study, as in the Staying Well trial (Williams et al.",
              ", 2014), antidepressant use was uncontrolled but balanced across trial arms and the analysis showed no significant benefit of MBCT+DRAM over DRAM alone in terms of time to depressive relapse.",
              "We are at a relatively early stage in our understanding of the mechanisms through which MBCT has its therapeutic effects.",
              "That is to say, \u201cWhat are people actually learning in MBCT and how does this help them stay well in the long-term?",
              "\u201d We have done a recent review of this area (van der Velden et al.",
              ", 2015), which identified a number of potential mechanisms of change including alterations in mindfulness, rumination, worry, compassion and meta-awareness.",
              "However there is still a great deal of work to be done to answer these questions and until we do it is difficult to formulate clear hypotheses predicting which individuals might benefit more from MBCT than other psychological interventions.",
              "Nonetheless, on the basis of these trials in the round there is no convincing evidence that MBCT is superior to plausible alternative psychological interventions for individuals with a history of recurrent depression as a whole.",
              "They are all about as effective (or ineffective) as each other.",
              "In many ways this is not surprising.",
              "No single treatment approach will be right for all and most psychological treatments will share common features.",
              "Indeed whilst we can look at the findings of clinical trials to provide evidence, at a population level, of which treatment approaches might most usefully be provided within clinical services, each person remains an individual and a range of predictive variables will need to be taken into account to optimize treatment planning.",
              "Treatment approaches differ not only in their average effects across a population, but also in the relative spread of benefits and harms they produce, what they require in terms of personal commitment, both in the short term and the long term, the specificity of their impact and their consequences for a person\u2019s sense of agency and control over their condition.",

              "Additionally we need to know more about the broad range of potential unexpected and unwanted experiences that may arise in response to any psychological intervention, including MBCT, but which would not be classified according to the adverse/serious adverse event categories utilized in most clinical trials.",

              "What is notable is that across most, if not all trials of acute phase treatments for depression, a sizeable proportion of patients, despite receiving high quality care from well-trained therapists or other medical professionals, suffer relapse/recurrence at unacceptably high rates.",
              "With increased understanding of the demographic and clinical history predictors of treatment response and MBCT\u2019s mechanisms of action we will be better positioned to personalise, sequence and optimise care pathways that will, in turn, optimise prevention (Guidi, Tomba & Fava, 2016).",

              "Possible mechanisms of change for this intervention are in line with its theoretical underpinnings, and include increases in mindfulness and/or decreases in negative repetitive thoughts.",
              "This review provides an overview of current trends in MBCT research, including efficacy and questions regarding the specific effects of MBCT in light of recent comparisons with structurally equivalent control conditions, mechanisms of change, and moderators of treatment outcome.",
              "In addition, future directions are discussed, such as challenges with training an adequate number of therapists and disseminating this therapy.",
              "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by pervasive and persistent low mood and lack of interest in normally pleasurable activities.",
              "These features are accompanied by a range of additional symptoms, such as poor appetite or overeating, insomnia or fatigue, low energy, low self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of death.",
              "1 MDD is highly prevalent, and is associated with considerable impairment in social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning, leading to significant economic and service burdens worldwide.",
              "2 Depression has become a significant health issue, partly because it tends to run a relapsing course.",
              "3 At least half the individuals who have experienced one major depressive episode are at risk of one or more additional episodes, and 80% of people with a history of two episodes are likely to have another recurrence.",
              "1,4 As a result of the challenging nature of treating this disorder, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) was developed to reduce depressive relapse.",
              "MBCT is a manualized group-therapy program that was developed by Zindel Segal, John Teasdale, and Mark Williams, and was designed to address vulnerabilities to depressive relapse for individuals with recurrent MDD.",
              "5,6 MBCT draws from cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and traditional mindfulness practices, as articulated by Kabat-Zinn within his mindfulness-based stress-reduction (MBSR) program.",
              "7 Mindfulness is defined as nonevaluative present-moment awareness, and is used within MBCT to help individuals disengage from their ruminative thoughts and to promote detachment and decentering from depression-related thoughts and feelings.",
              "8 MBCT was developed from a model of cognitive vulnerability that stated that individuals who experience depressive relapses have different patterns of negative thinking from those who do not experience relapses.",
              "According to the model, for those who have previously experienced relapses, small negative mood shifts may produce recurrence, because they can activate patterns of depressive thinking that are similar to the thoughts experienced in previous depressive episodes.",
              "5 MBCT encourages individuals with MDD to become more aware of their internal events (ie, thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations) and to change the ways in which they relate to these thoughts.",
              "For example, individuals are encouraged to view their thoughts as passing events in the mind, rather than treat them as reality.",
              "Disengaging from automatic negative cognitive patterns, such as rumination, reduces the future risk of relapse.",
              "Given the popularity of third-wave behavior therapies characterized by such concepts as mindfulness and acceptance, a review of current trends and future directions of MBCT is required to provide an overview of the state of the research to date.",
              "This review presents current research pertaining to the efficacy of MBCT, especially as it relates to comparisons with active-control conditions (ACCs), mechanisms of change for this therapy, and moderators of treatment outcome, and concludes with a discussion of dissemination.",
              "This narrative review of trends and developments in the field aims to inform clinical practice and provide directions for future research.",
              "There is consistent empirical evidence in support of using MBCT to decrease the risk of depressive relapse.",
              "Beginning with the initial trial of this intervention in 2000, 145 individuals who were in remission or recovery from major depression were randomized to either an 8-week course of MBCT or treatment as usual (TAU).",
              "Participants were followed for 1 year, and the results indicated that of those randomized to MBCT, only 40% relapsed during the follow-up period compared to 66% of those in the TAU group.",
              "9 In 2008, a follow-up study of 123 patients in remission or recovery from major depression who were randomized to either maintenance antidepressant medication or medication plus MBCT showed that the MBCT group had a significantly lower relapse rate over 15 months than the medication-alone group (47% vs 60%).",
              "Also within this study, MBCT was associated with a reduction in depressive and comorbid symptoms and an increase in quality of life.",
              "10 These results were replicated more recently in 2010 by Segal et al.",
              "11 In addition to empirical trials, MBCT has emerged as an effective therapy option in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.",
              "A systematic review conducted by Coelho et al12 in 2007 evaluated the results of four studies that compared MBCT plus TAU to TAU alone.",
              "9,13\u201316 The results of this review culminated in the conclusion that for individuals who have experienced three or more depressive episodes, MBCT is a positive adjunct to TAU.",
              "The authors did qualify this conclusion by noting that there may be issues with control groups, so this conclusion should be interpreted with caution.",
              "Specifically, the trials in this review compared MBCT to TAU, which can only indicate whether some kind of additional treatment action results in a positive change.",
              "The trials did not compare MBCT to other nonpharmaceutical treatments or similar group settings, making it difficult to identify any specific effects of MBCT.",
              "Specifically, in their 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis, Clarke et al examined the effects of nonpharmacological interventions on depressive relapse prevention.",
              "17 Their review culminated in the conclusions that at 12 months, MBCT, CBT, and interpersonal psychotherapy were each associated with a significant reduction in relapse compared to active and inactive controls.",
              "However, the authors concluded that MBCT\u2019s efficacy may be 1) limited to participants who had recovered from their depression via pharmacological means and 2) a nonspecific effect of treatment.",
              "Considering the homogeneity of the trials in this review (ie, the structure, content, and delivery of MBCT) and that the majority of participants were individuals who responded well to pharmacological treatment for depression, the literature could be further developed by testing MBCT with diverse patient populations and varying the treatment delivery.",
              "One of the newer trends in the study of MBCT is the extension of examining depressive relapse as the primary outcome variable to examining depressive symptoms as an outcome variable.",
              "In 2014, Strauss et al18 conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating mindfulness-based interventions for individuals with current anxiety or major depression.",
              "This analysis of 12 studies demonstrated a significant effect associated with MBCT compared to control conditions and MBSR for primary symptom severity for those with current depression.",
              "This particular analysis provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of MBCT with individuals who are currently experiencing a major depressive episode, in addition to the strong evidence in support of MBCT for those who are currently in remission.",
              "Since Coelho et al12 conducted their systematic review in 2007, new research comparing MBCT to more appropriate control groups has been published.",
              "There are early indications that although MBCT is effective, it may not be superior to control groups intended to be structurally equivalent.",
              "Six studies that have compared MBCT to carefully designed ACCs have demonstrated mixed findings for significant group differences for depressive relapse19\u201321 and depressive symptoms.22\u201324 Studies that included depressive relapse as a primary outcome variable have typically indicated no difference between MBCT and ACCs.",
              "For instance, in a large-sample randomized controlled trial with participants who had had three or more episodes of recurrent MDD, Williams et al compared MBCT to cognitive psychological education and TAU.",
              "21 The results of this trial showed that MBCT was superior in preventing relapse for individuals who had experienced childhood trauma, but that MBCT did not show a significant advantage over the active-control or TAU groups for the whole sample.",
              "The authors suggested that the significance of childhood trauma was in line with previous studies showing that MBCT had more positive effects for vulnerable populations.",
              "9,11,14 Moreover, in 2015 Shallcross et al compared MBCT to a structurally equivalent ACC for patients in remission from MDD with residual depressive symptoms.20 A total of 92 participants were randomly assigned to either condition, and the results showed that MBCT did not differ from the ACC on primary or secondary outcome variables, including rate of depression relapse, symptom reduction, and life satisfaction.",
              "Conversely, one study has shown more positive results comparing MBCT to an ACC.",
              "Meadows et al examined a sample of approximately 200 nondepressed individuals with a history of three or more depressive episodes to determine if MBCT was superior to an ACC in reducing depressive relapse.",
              "19 Results showed that MBCT combined with depression-relapse active monitoring was superior to depression-relapse active monitoring alone in reducing depressive relapse/recurrence over 2 years of follow-up.",
              "With respect to the trend of measuring depressive symptoms as the primary outcome variable, MBCT also has mixed outcomes relative to ACCs.",
              "A recent randomized controlled trial published in 2016 by Eisendrath et al compared MBCT to a health-enhancement program (physical fitness, music therapy, and nutrition education) in addition to TAU in a sample of individuals with treatment-resistant depression.",
              "24 Results showed that relative to the health-enhancement program, MBCT was associated with a significant reduction in depression-symptom severity and a significant increase in treatment-response rates.",
              "In 2015, Chiesa et al compared MBCT to a psychoeducation control group with positive results.",
              "23 A total of 43 patients with MDD who had not achieved remission following the use of antidepressants were randomly assigned to receive either MBCT or a psychoeducation program designed to be structurally equivalent.",
              "Patients in the MBCT group had significantly larger improvements in depressive symptoms, as well as for quality of life and mindfulness.",
              "Conversely, Manicavasgar et al randomly assigned a total of 45 participants who met criteria for current MDD to either an 8-week MBCT or CBT group.",
              "22 Both groups reported significant improvements in depression and anxiety;",
              "however, there were no group differences in outcomes for the two treatment conditions.",
              "Perhaps these discrepant findings were related to the patient population, ie, those who had not responded previously to pharmacological treatments.",
              "Many of the previous trials included individuals who had used antidepressants to assist them in their remission.",
              "This variation in findings highlights the need for additional study.",
              "In line with this need, one additional study protocol has been identified that compares MBCT to a psychoeducational intervention.",
              "25 In summary, additional research comparing MBCT to ACCs must be conducted, in order to evaluate further the efficacy of this treatment.",
              "A current trend in psychotherapy research in general is the identification of mechanisms of change for new and existing interventions.",
              "26,27 Despite the mixed findings when comparing MBCT to ACCs, the preliminary evidence of MBCT\u2019s effectiveness warrants this type of research, and few studies have directly examined how and why MBCT works for recurrent depressive episodes.",
              "The examination of the mechanisms by which this intervention is effective can aid in understanding the processes that lead to therapeutic change, and can aid in further development and refinement of MBCT.",
              "Additionally, this understanding can help in identifying patients for whom this therapy would benefit and perhaps to shed light on the disparate findings mentioned earlier.",
              "Two recent systematic reviews have been conducted to examine mechanisms of change underlying MBCT.",
              "In a 2015 review, van der Velden et al evaluated the state of the research in this area and reviewed 23 clinical trials of MBCT for the treatment of recurrent MDD.",
              "28 Studies were included if they were clinical trials examining meditation or mechanisms in MBCT for MDD, the participants were 18 years or older, and MBCT was conducted in accordance with the manual.",
              "29 The authors examined several theoretical mechanisms of change relevant to depression that were based on the MBCT manual: increased mindfulness, meta-awareness (ie, the mind\u2019s ability to observe itself), self-compassion, decreased rumination, worry, and cognitive reactivity.",
              "Of the 23 studies included, 12 trials showed that MBCT-treatment outcome was associated with or predicted by changes in mindfulness, rumination, worry, self-compassion, decentering, and/or meta-awareness.",
              "Two studies found that increased mindfulness mediated treatment outcome, two studies found decreased rumination mediated outcome, and two studies found decreased worry mediated outcome.",
              "Lastly, one study showed that increased self-compassion mediated relapse risk and reduced the relationship between cognitive reactivity and relapse risk.",
              "There were two trials that failed to find any effect for mindfulness or rumination, and the authors suggested that this may have been due to a lack of therapist competence or fidelity to the MBCT manual.",
              "Few trials reported on therapist adherence;",
              "therefore, it is difficult to know whether a lack of treatment fidelity could be a contributing factor to a lack of effect for mindfulness and/or rumination.",
              "This review culminated in the conclusion that changes in cognitive variables, such as mindfulness, worry, meta-awareness, and self-compassion, are associated with reductions in relapse risk and depressive symptoms, and thus may be mechanisms of action for the positive effects of MBCT.",
              "A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Gu et al in 201530 evaluated mechanisms of action underlying both MBCT and MBSR.",
              "Inclusion criteria were different from van der Velden et al\u2019s review,28 ie, that studies were included if their outcome variables assessed mental health and well-being, rather than specifically for MDD.",
              "In addition, studies were included even if they used adapted versions of MBCT or MBSR.",
              "For inclusion, studies must also have included MBCT or MBSR in a mediation analysis.",
              "These two mindfulness-based approaches were collapsed into one intervention category.",
              "A total of 20 studies were included in this review, and of these only nine included depressive symptoms as an outcome variable.",
              "Other outcomes included anxiety, stress, mood state, quality of life, and anger expression.",
              "The 20 studies were all included in the narrative review examining mechanisms of change, and then were further broken down using two-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling to determine whether particular mechanisms of change mediated the impact of MBCT and/or MBSR on clinical outcomes.",
              "Twelve studies were included in the quantitative analysis of mindfulness, and six studies were included in the quantitative analysis of repetitive negative thinking.",
              "The results of the narrative review showed strong and consistent evidence for cognitive and emotional reactivity, moderate and consistent evidence for mindfulness and repetitive negative thought, and preliminary but insufficient evidence for self-compassion and psychological flexibility as mechanisms of change within mindfulness-based interventions for clinical and nonclinical outcomes.",
              "The results of the two modeling analyses showed that both mindfulness and repetitive negative thought were significant mediators of the effect of MBCT/MBSR on mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depressive symptoms, general psychopathology, stress, and negative affect.",
              "These findings provide evidence that mindfulness is likely an influential factor in the effectiveness of MBCT for psychopathology.",
              "The identification of mechanisms of change and mediators in psychotherapy research is valuable for providing an evidence-based explanation of how treatments work.",
              "Understanding the processes by which MBCT works will assist in potentially refining the intervention.",
              "The existing research examining mechanisms of change in MBCT have been summarized in two recent systematic reviews.",
              "Both of these papers provided strong evidence that increased mindfulness and decreased negative repetitive thought (ie, rumination) are processes that mediate the association among mindfulness-based interventions and treatment outcome.",
              "There is also support for such mechanisms as meta-awareness, self-compassion, and cognitive reactivity;",
              "however, the number of studies examining these variables is more limited.",
              "It is encouraging to see that the mechanisms that emerge as significant mediators are theoretically in line with the development of MBCT;",
              "however, an important line of future research will be to continue to design rigorous studies that include assessments over the course of treatment, in order to obtain consistent high-quality evidence for potential mediators.",

              "9,14 This effect was not found for participants who had had fewer depressive episodes.",
              "Kuyken et al in 2010 evaluated moderating variables, including demographics, severity of depression, and depression recurrence, and found that sex was a significant moderator, such that female participants fared better on a depression inventory at 15-month follow-up compared to males.",
              "32 The authors did note that there was a very small number of males in the study, so this result should be interpreted with caution, especially given that no significant sex effects had been found in earlier evaluations.",
              "9,14 None of the other moderators significantly predicted MBCT outcome.",
              "Finally, as noted earlier, MBCT was found to be more effective than an ACC for those who had experienced childhood trauma, but not the rest of the sample;",
              "21 therefore, the presence of a history of childhood trauma or other variables causing increased vulnerability may moderate outcome, but replication is warranted before drawing firm conclusions.",
              "Taken together, the evidence points to MBCT as an empirically supported intervention that reduces the risk of relapse in individuals with recurrent depression (notwithstanding the recent comparisons with structurally equivalent ACCs).",
              "In order to fully optimize the use of this treatment, there must be a critical mass of trained practitioners to deliver it.",

              "34 These results were not found for informal mindfulness practice, which typically includes present-moment awareness and focus on daily activities, such as eating or walking.",
              "Ongoing daily formal mindfulness-meditation practice (ie, setting aside a particular time to sit and meditate) may be difficult for patients and even some clinicians to develop and maintain, and this prerequisite may make it challenging for practitioners to sign up for training and/or to continue to use MBCT in their own clinical practice.",
              "In order to lead an MBCT program, facilitators must have a formal mindfulness practice and be completely aligned with a mindfulness approach, in order to maintain treatment integrity.",

              "Decades of scientific research on mindfulness meditation has demonstrated a wide range of positive effects on psychological well-being and related aspects of cognitive function in healthy and clinical populations [1, 2].",
              "Neuroimaging studies speak to the correlates of mindfulness meditation in terms of brain functional and structural plasticity;",
              "especially, key brain hubs involved in self-awareness, emotion regulation, and attentional control [1, 3, 4].",
              "Although prior work suggests functional changes in both novices with short-term training and experienced meditators with long-term practice, structural changes in gray matter have been found mainly in experienced meditators [1, 5].",
              "One preliminary finding indicated changes in gray matter after 2 months of mindfulness-based stress reduction, compared to a waitlist control [6].",
              "However, it remains to be established whether such structural effects of mindfulness training are evident when compared to an active control, using a rigorous randomized design [7\u20139].",
              "A meta-analysis has identified several brain structures altered by meditation, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, and hippocampus [5].",
              "However, while both the ACC and insula are important constituents of the salience network implicated in self-awareness and mindfulness meditation [1], the default mode network (DMN) has received less attention in structural studies.",
              "The DMN includes the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and is actively engaged (and affected) in mindfulness as evidenced by functional neuroimaging studies [1, 10, 11].",
              "Prior literature regarding the effect of meditation on the PCC has shown a reduction in its activation during meditation [11], but an increase in its functional connectivity with \u201ctask-positive\u201d regions in the executive control network and salience network (e.",
              "g., ACC and prefrontal cortex), both at rest and during meditation [11\u201313].",
              "Because the PCC is commonly implicated in self-referential processing and mind-wandering [14], decreased activation during meditation could be interpreted as reduced mind-wandering, whereas increased coupling with other control-related networks may suggest better self-regulatory function as a result of meditation experiences [11\u201313].",
              "Therefore, it is plausible that brief or short-term mindfulness could induce not only functional changes in the DMN but also structural plasticity in key nodes or integrative hubs.",
              "Our randomized studies\u2014using a form of mindfulness meditation, the integrative body\u2013mind training (IBMT)\u2014have shown that 5 sessions of IBMT (30 min/session) improved self-control abilities in domains of attention and emotion, as well as increased functional changes in neuronal activity and metabolism in the ACC and PCC [15, 16].",
              "Moreover, 10-20 sessions of IBMT (5-10 h in total) induced white matter plasticity, mainly in white-matter tracts surrounding the ACC and PCC, and the improved mood/affect states were correlated with increased white matter changes surrounding the PCC and other areas [17\u201320].",
              "These convergent findings suggest that the PCC\u2014a key hub of the DMN [21, 22]\u2014may also undergo structural changes in grey matter following mindfulness.",
              "However, evidence regarding the relationship between mindfulness and the PCC volume has so far been inconclusive.",
              "In a study examining trait mindfulness and brain structures, the PCC grey matter volume was found to be negatively related to this tendency to be attentive to and aware of present-moment experiences in everyday life [23].",
              "Conversely, individuals who underwent two months of MBSR showed increased grey matter density in the PCC [6].",
              "Moreover, greater PCC volume in expert meditators was detected compared to controls [24].",
              "Based on the theoretical model regarding the role of PCC [14], as well as preliminary study suggesting mindfulness meditation can induce grey matter improvement [6, 24], we hypothesized that brief IBMT would increase grey matter volume in the ventral PCC, as it is hypothesized to be related to narrow attentional focus both internally and externally, and has also shown greater connectivity with control-related regions in meditation literature [1, 11].",
              "Finally, people differ in their attitudes toward the practice of mindfulness, and that short-term mindfulness practice induces changes in mental state, while long-term practice changes personality or temperamental traits [1, 4, 25].",
              "However, little is known about the role of individual differences (e.",

              "Mental training studies such as working memory training, meditation, and yoga have shown both increased and decreased grey matter volume and/or density in different regions throughout the brain [5, 6, 24, 44\u201346].",
              "In most meditation studies, increases were often detected in areas involving interoceptive awareness and self-regulation, such as the ACC, insular cortex, prefrontal cortex, and sensory cortices [1, 5].",
              "Additionally, hippocampus, a structure critical for memory, has also been shown to increase in volume in long-term meditators [1, 5].",
              "Conversely, reduction in volume was often detected in the amygdala in meditation studies [44, 46], suggesting that this subcortical structure associated with emotion and stress may manifest a different trend of structural plasticity, and may underlie the behavioral reduction of stress reactivity commonly observed in meditators.",
              "In the present study, we focused on a brain hub within the default mode network and detected an increase in ventral PCC/ISC volume in the meditation group, which is consistent with the two studies that, respectively, showed greater grey matter density in PCC for novices who underwent meditation training and greater PCC volume in expert meditators relative to controls [6, 24].",
              "According to a theoretical account of the PCC function, the ventral PCC may play a key role in narrow attentional focus [14], which suggests that the increased volume of the ventral PCC may reflect enhanced attentional control following meditation training.",
              "Interestingly, for the relaxation training group, we detected a reduction of grey matter volume in bilateral ventral PCC/ISC.",
              "It is important to recognize that the relaxation training has a very different emphasis from the mindfulness training;",
              "thus, it is possible that these two forms of training work through different neural mechanisms that led to structural changes in completely different directions.",
              "On the other hand, reduction in grey matter volume and density is not uncommon in training studies [44\u201346], and one possible mechanism of the observed reduction in the relaxation group might be the usage-dependent selective elimination of synapses which helps to sculpt neural circuitry [45].",
              "However, further investigations are needed to fully examine the impact of relaxation training on brain plasticity of the PCC, as well as that of other brain regions.",
              "Overall, our finding concerning the meditation group was in line with prior literature that showed structural improvement in the PCC either following short-term or long-term meditation experiences.",
              "Looking more closely at our target region, ventral PCC (vPCC), it includes the ventral subdivision of PCC and isthmus of cingulate (ISC) as defined by the Destrieux cortical atlas.",
              "The ISC lies within Brodmann areas 29/30, overlapping the same BA 29/30 with adjacent retrosplenial cortex (RSC).",
              "The anatomical location of RSC (BA 29/30) is behind the splenium of the corpus callosum, where RSC directly connects to the vPCC (BA 23) [41, 47\u201349].",
              "Our previous work showed enhanced white matter connectivity in the vPCC and adjacent ISC/RSC following 5-10 h of IBMT, suggesting a putative relationship between the concurrent structural plasticity of white and grey matter in vPCC and adjacent ISC/RSC following brief mindfulness [4].",
              "A closer examination of these brain regions reveals two important functions: emotion- and cognition-related processes [34, 50\u201365].",
              "Emotion-related problems and disorders\u2014such as clinical depression and subthreshold depressive symptoms in adults\u2014are related to structural changes in cingulate cortex [34, 53\u201355].",
              "In a nonclinical sample, one study examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and gray matter volumes in the ACC, PCC, and ISC/RSC and showed that higher scores on the somatic symptoms were related to smaller volume in the PCC and that higher scores on the depressed mood were associated with smaller volume in the ISC/RSC [53].",
              "A further study indicated that unipolar depressed patients had smaller ACC and PCC volumes compared to healthy subjects.",
              "Additionally, when patients were divided into currently depressed and remitted subgroups, currently depressed patients had smaller ACC and PCC volumes than the healthy controls [54].",
              "Similarly, one study suggests that the gray matter volumes of PCC and hippocampus are key regions that disambiguate MDD and BD patients from healthy controls [55].",
              "Together, these findings suggest that the PCC and ISC/RSC actively engage in emotional processing and regulation, which may explain why enhanced mood and reduced negative affect are often reported after mindfulness [1].",
              "Increased volume in vPCC and ISC/RSC may be associated with better psychological well-being, which could be one of the mechanisms that underwrites the commonly observed improvement in mood and psychological health following mindfulness [42].",
              "Our findings also provide support for the notion that increasing structural plasticity of vPCC and ISC/RSC may protect individuals against mood-related symptoms, making them less susceptible to emotion-related disorders.",
              "The vPCC and RSC have dense connections to medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, and parahippocampal cortex, which are important areas for memory [47\u201351].",
              "Growing evidence suggests that decreased PCC activity (e.",
              "g., resting-state or task) and metabolism (e.",
              "g., glucose metabolic rate) are associated with cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) [56\u201362], which often severely impact memory-related functions.",
              "In addition, vPCC also showed associations with MCI/AD, consistent with previous reports concerning the importance of PCC in amyloid deposition with AD\u2014and performance on an episodic memory retrieval task in MCI [63, 64].",
              "Moreover, the locations of amyloid deposition and fMRI activity in both studies were centered on vPCC.",
              "Relatedly, greater cortical thickness in PCC is found in high-performing elderly, indicating that greater gray matter in PCC may be a putative signature of optimal aging [65].",
              "This is consistent with the evidence that the PCC may play a direct role in regulating the focus of attention and thus facilitating cognitive performance [4, 14].",
              "There is also support for the roles of vPCC and RSC in internally directed thoughts and cognition such as the retrieval of episodic and semantic memories, imagining, and planning [14, 52].",
              "Lastly, RSC is associated with perspective taking and switching between different frames of reference, which is a capacity that mindfulness practices seek to promote [4, 48].",
              "Previous work showed that five sessions of IBMT improves PCC activity and metabolism, and cognitive function such as attention, creativity, working memory, problem-solving, learning, and self-control capacities [1, 4, 15\u201318, 28\u201330].",
              "The present structural finding endorses our functional and behavioral findings, implicating the same brain hub\u2014vPCC and suggests that increased functional and structural plasticity in the PCC may play a key role in the preservation of cognitive capacity and performance in aging population [13, 65].",
              "Increased gray matter in the PCC following 10 h of IBMT in healthy adults may suggest some protection against aging-related processes, such as cognitive decline and MCI [4, 66].",
              "It is worth pointing out that only right vPCC/ISC/RSC was significantly affected by brief IBMT, which is consistent with prior work showing the lateralized function of RSC\u2014the right RSC is more associated with MCI/AD and memory-related impairment than left RSC [52].",
              "Network neuroscience on large-scale (intrinsic) brain networks has indicated an architectural core (i.",
              "e., brain hub) in the PCC and parietal cortex, regions with high degree, strength and betweenness centrality, and constitute connector hubs that link major structural modules [22], suggesting that PCC is a key brain hub for efficient information processing\u2014which is implicated in diverse cognitive processes and emotion regulation.",
              "Prior work has shown that mindfulness directly changes these mental processes [3, 4].",
              "One emotion regulation strategy, distancing (e.",
              "g., reformulating aversive stimuli in a neutral and objective way), is one of mindfulness skills that emphasizes the experience of presence without judgment.",
              "Indeed, increased PCC activity and decreased amygdala activity are related to distancing [67], consistent with recent meta-analyses showing that the PCC is one of the main regions implicated in the upregulation and downregulation of emotion [68, 69].",
              "Studies also indicate a role of PCC in conscious awareness, which may explain why enhanced interoceptive awareness is typically observed following mindfulness [1, 3, 70].",
              "Furthermore, PCC has been thought to underpin consciousness, further supporting a role in self-awareness and self-related processing [71\u201373].",
              "Individual differences in mindfulness training-induced brain structural plasticity are rarely explored [1, 4].",
              "We provide preliminary evidence that temperament traits may play a role in underwriting structural volumetric responses to brief mindfulness.",
              "Sadness is one of the negative affects in the ATQ and defined as unpleasant affect/mood, energy related to object/person loss, disappointment, and exposure to suffering.",
              "Studies showed that sadness is associated with depressive symptoms [73].",
              "Given the strong functional relevance of vPCC/ISC/RSC in the pathophysiology of depression, it is not surprising that preexisting individual differences in this particular trait could influence subsequent volumetric change.",
              "We found that individuals with higher level of sadness either showed less improvement (or indeed reduction) in gray matter volume following mindfulness, suggesting that they were not sensitive to such training and that alternative interventions may be more effective.",
              "Crucially, the fact that preexisting temperamental traits were able to predict subsequent gray matter changes suggests that individual differences may play an important role in underlying mechanisms of brain structural plasticity.",
              "Taken together, our results to date suggest it is possible to induce gray matter plasticity in the vPCC and adjacent ISC/RSC following brief mindfulness in novices.",
              "However, we do not yet know how long the plasticity will last;",
              "this warrants further investigation.",

              "Findings on the effects of meditation on the brain are often reported enthusiastically by the media and used by clinicians and educators to inform their work.",

              "Although their insider perspective may be valuable for a deep understanding of meditation, these researchers must ensure that they take a critical view of study outcomes.",
              "In fact, for meditation studies there is a relatively strong bias towards the publication of positive or significant results, as was shown in a meta-analysis17.",
              "The methodological quality of many meditation research studies is still relatively low.",
              "Few are actively controlled longitudinal studies, and sample sizes are small.",
              "As is typical for a young research field, many experiments are not yet based on elaborated theories, and conclusions are often drawn from post-hoc interpretations.",
              "These conclusions therefore remain tentative, and studies must be carefully replicated.",
              "Meditation research also faces several specific methodological challenges.",
              "Cross-sectional versus longitudinal studies.",
              "Early meditation studies were mostly cross-sectional studies: that is, they compared data from a group of meditators with data from a control group at one point in time.",
              "These studies investigated practitioners with hundreds or thousands of hours of meditation experience (such as Buddhist monks) and compared them with control groups of non-meditators matched on various dimensions9,18.",
              "The rationale was that any effects of meditation would be most easily detectable in highly experienced practitioners.",
              "A number of cross-sectional studies revealed differences in brain structure and function associated with meditation (see below).",
              "Although these differences may constitute training-induced effects, a cross-sectional study design precludes causal attribution: it is possible that there are pre-existing differences in the brains of meditators, which might be linked to their interest in meditation, personality or temperament2,19.",
              "Although correlational studies have attempted to discover whether more meditation experience is related to larger changes in brain structure or function, such correlations still cannot prove that meditation practice has caused the changes because it is possible that individuals with these particular brain characteristics may be drawn to longer meditation practice.",
              "More recent research has used longitudinal designs, which compare data from one or more groups at several time points and ideally include a (preferably active) control condition and random assignment to conditions11,12,13,14,20,21,22,23,24,25.",
              "In meditation research, longitudinal studies are still relatively rare.",
              "Among those studies, some have investigated the effects of mindfulness training over just a few days, whereas others have investigated programmes of 1 to 3 months.",
              "Some of these studies have revealed changes in behaviour, brain structure and function11,12,13,14,20,21,22,23,24,25.",
              "A lack of similar changes in the control group suggests that meditation has caused the observed changes, especially when other potentially confounding variables are controlled for properly20,21,22.",
              "Novice meditators versus expert meditators.",
              "Although most cross-sectional studies included long-term meditators9,17, longitudinal studies are often conducted in beginners or naive subjects.",
              "Thus, differences in the results of cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses might be attributed to the different brain regions used during learning of meditation versus those used during the continued practice of an acquired skill.",
              "It would be interesting to follow subjects over a long-term period of practice to determine whether changes induced by meditation training persist in the absence of continued practice.",
              "However, such long-term longitudinal studies would be compromised by feasibility constraints, and it is likely that future longitudinal studies will remain restricted to relatively short training periods2.",
              "Control groups and interventions.",
              "It is important to control for variables that may be confounded with meditation training, such as changes in lifestyle and diet that might accompany the meditation practice or the expectancy and intention that meditation beginners bring to their practice.",
              "Researchers must carefully determine which variables are integral aspects of the meditation training and which can be controlled for.",
              "Some earlier studies only controlled for the length of time that the individual has practised meditation and the effects of repeated testing, but more recent studies have developed and included active interventions in control groups \u2014 such as stress management education26, relaxation training14,23,27 or health enhancement programmes20,21,22 \u2014 that can control for variables such as social interaction with the group and teachers, amount of home exercise, physical exercise and psychoeducation.",
              "These studies are therefore better able to extract and delineate the meditation-specific effects.",
              "For example, one study investigating short-term meditation training used a 'sham meditation' condition in which participants thought they were meditating, but did not receive proper meditation instructions, which allowed the researchers to control for factors such as expectancy, body posture and attention from the teacher28.",
              "Mechanistic studies ideally need to use interventions that are as effective as mindfulness meditation in producing the beneficial effects on target variables but that allow for assessment of the unique mechanism underlying the mindfulness practice23,29.",

              "Although all functional neuroimaging studies must use appropriate comparison conditions, this challenge is particularly important when imaging meditative states (Box 2).",
              "The comparison condition should be one in which a state of mindfulness meditation is not present.",
              "Many studies use resting comparison conditions, but a problem with this is that experienced practitioners are likely to enter into a state of meditation when at rest.",
              "However, other active tasks introduce additional brain activity that renders the comparison difficult to interpret.",
              "Using imaging protocols that do not rely on blood-oxygen-level-dependent contrasts (BOLD contrasts), such as arterial spin labelling, might be a possible solution for this problem30.",

              "For example, sustained attention refers to the sense of vigilance during long continued tasks and may involve both tonic alerting and orienting, whereas selective attention may involve either orienting (when a stimulus is present) or executive function (when stored information is involved).",

              "Because such a negative correlation will occur when prefrontal regions downregulate limbic activation104,105, it was speculated that the positive coupling between the activity of the two regions after mindfulness intervention might indicate that meditation involves monitoring of arousal rather than a downregulation or suppression of emotional responses, and that it might be a unique signature of mindful emotion regulation.",

              "A combination of all of these mechanisms may even occur.",
              "It is also important to realize that the direction of the observed effects of mindfulness meditation has not been consistent across all studies.",
              "Although larger values in meditators compared to controls are predominantly reported, a cross-sectional study also revealed smaller fractional anisotropy and cortical thickness values in meditators in some brain regions, including the medial PFC, postcentral and inferior parietal cortices, PCC and medial occipital cortex138.",
              "Along these lines, mindfulness-induced increases are predominantly observed in longitudinal studies.",
              "However, it was also reported, for example, that as a consequence of meditation, larger decreases in perceived stress were associated with larger decreases in grey-matter density in the amygdala48.",

              "Although neuroimaging has advanced our understanding of the individual brain regions involved in mindfulness meditation, most evidence supports the idea that the brain processes information through the dynamic interactions of distributed areas operating in large-scale networks139,140.",
              "Because the complex mental state of mindfulness is probably supported by alterations in large-scale brain networks, future work should consider the inclusion of complex network analyses, rather than restricting analyses to comparisons of the strength of activations in single brain areas.",

              "By charting new pathways in the brain, mindfulness can change the banter inside our heads from chaotic to calm.",
              "Not too long ago, most of us thought that the brain we\u2019re born with is static\u2014that after a certain age, the neural circuitry cards we\u2019re dealt are the only ones we can play long-term.",
              "Fast-forward a decade or two, and we\u2019re beginning to see the opposite: the brain is designed to adapt constantly.",
              "World-renowned neuroscientist Richie Davidson at the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, along with this colleagues, want us to know three things: 1) you can train your brain to change, 2) that the change is measurable, and 3) new ways of thinking can change it for the better.",
              "It\u2019s hard to comprehend how this is possible.",
              "Practicing mindfulness is nothing like taking a pill, or another fix that acts quickly, entering our blood stream, crossing the Blood Brain Barrier if needed in order to produce an immediate sensation, or to dull one.",
              "But just as we learn to play the piano through practice, the same goes for cultivating well-being and happiness.",
              "Davidson told Mindful that the brain keeps changing over its entire lifespan.",
              "And he thinks that\u2019s very good news: We can intentionally shape the direction of plasticity changes in our brain.",
              "By focusing on wholesome thoughts, for example, and directing our intentions in those ways, we can potentially influence the plasticity of our brains and shape them in ways that can be beneficial.",
              "That leads us to the inevitable conclusion that qualities like warm-heartedness and well-being should best be regarded as skills.",
              "Davidson adds that research on neuroplasticity gives neuroscientists a framework for tracking meditation research.",
              "And CIHM is beginning to see that \u201ceven short amounts of practice,\u201d like 30 minutes of meditation per day, \u201ccan induce measurable changes in the brain\u201d that can be tracked on a brain scanner.",
              "Based on recent research, I\u2019ve chosen to share four ways your brain may change when you practice mindfulness: \u2022 Anterior Cingulate Cortex: Increased grey matter changes were noted in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is a structure located behind the brain\u2019s frontal lobe.",
              "It has been associated with such functions as self-regulatory processes, including the ability to monitor attention conflicts, and allow for more cognitive flexibility.",
              "\u2022 Prefrontal Cortex: Increased grey matter density was also found in areas of the prefrontal lobe, which are primarily responsible for executive functioning such as planning, problem solving, and emotion regulation.",
              "\u2022 Hippocampus: Increased cortical thickness in the hippocampus has also been noted.",
              "The hippocampus is the part of the limbic system that governs learning and memory, and is extraordinarily susceptible to stress and stress-related disorders like depression or PTSD.",
              "Studies have shown that the amygdala, known as our brain\u2019s \u201cfight or flight\u201d center and the seat of our fearful and anxious emotions, decreases in brain cell volume after mindfulness practice.",
              "Not only does the amygdala shrink post mindfulness practice, but the functional connections between the amygdala and the pre-frontal cortex are strengthened.",
              "This allows for less reactivity, and also paves the way for connections between areas associated with higher order brain functions to be strengthened (i.",
              "e. attention, concentration, etc.)",
              ".",
              "Mindfulness practice has been implicated in the decreased activation and the stilling of our Default Mode Network (DMN), which is also sometimes referred to as our wandering \u201cMonkey Minds.",
              "\u201d The DMN is active when our minds are directionless as it goes from thought to thought, a response that is sometimes likened to rumination and not always adaptive with regards to overall happiness.",
              "The impact that mindfulness exerts on our brain is borne from routine: a slow, steady, and consistent reckoning of our realities, and the ability to take a step back, become more aware, more accepting, less judgmental, and less reactive.",
              "Just as playing the piano over and over again over time strengthens and supports brain networks involved with playing music, mindfulness over time can make the brain, and thus, us, more efficient regulators, with a penchant for pausing to respond to our worlds instead of mindlessly reacting.",

          "Increased grey matter density was also found in areas of the prefrontal lobe, which are primarily responsible for executive functioning such as planning, problem solving, and emotion regulation.",
          "Increased cortical thickness in the hippocampus has also been noted.",
          "The hippocampus is the part of the limbic system that governs learning and memory, and is extraordinarily susceptible to stress and stress-related disorders like depression or PTSD.",              
          "Studies have shown that the amygdala, known as our brain\u2019s \u201cfight or flight\u201d center and the seat of our fearful and anxious emotions, decreases in brain cell volume after mindfulness practice.",
          "Not only does the amygdala shrink post mindfulness practice, but the functional connections between the amygdala and the pre-frontal cortex are strengthened."
