    "response": "The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel's company for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution and France's industrial power[^2^]. The inspiration for the design came from the **Latting Observatory** built in New York City in 1853[^1^], which was a wooden tower with an observation deck. The original idea of a 300-meter metal tower was conceived by two engineers, **\u00c9mile Nouguier** and **Maurice Koechlin**, who worked for Eiffel's company[^4^]. They later collaborated with an architect, **Stephen Sauvestre**, who improved the aesthetic appearance of the tower by adding arches, a pavilion, and other decorative elements[^3^]. The tower was constructed from 1887 to 1889 using wrought-iron lattice work and was the tallest human-made structure in the world until 1930[^2^].",

              "Designed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, the Tower was meant to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution and to show off France's modern industrial prowess on a world stage.",
              "And that it did.",
              "The tower's construction, finished after two years, two months, and five days, was considered a marvel of precision and speed.",
              "Gustave Eiffel's civil engineering firm used 7,300 tons of iron and 2.",
              "5 million rivets, and the result stood triumphant over the Champs de Mars, receiving more than two million visitors during the fair.",
              "The Tower\u2019s now-famous silhouette has been emulated around the world in places like Las Vegas, Prague, Tianducheng, China, and, of course, Paris, Texas.",
              "The design wasn\u2019t without its detractors, however \u2014 a \"Protest against the Tower of Monsieur Eiffel,\u201d signed by the likes of Guy de Maupassant, Alexandre Dumas fils, and other well-known artists, was published in the newspaper Le Temps before the project\u2019s completion.",
              "The letter argued that the tower would be \u201ca gigantic black factory chimney, its barbarous mass overwhelming and humiliating all our monuments and belittling our works of architecture, which will just disappear before this stupefying folly.",
              "\u201d In defiance of such protests, the Eiffel Tower did see the light of day and has stood the test of time.",
              "It remains one of the most visited monuments in the world, welcoming almost seven million visitors a year and more than 300 million people since its debut.",
              "It has changed over the years, with the addition of lighting, fresh coats of paint, and numerous installations that have come and gone.",
              "And there\u2019s still more to this landmark than meets the eye.",
              "Despite the incredible number of people who have visited since it opened, La Dame de Fer still has a few secrets to share.",
              "Gustave Eiffel reserved the uppermost level of the tower for himself, where he hosted famous guests like Thomas Edison in a private apartment that he designed.",
              "The space has since been transformed into a recreation of Eiffel's office, complete with wax figures of himself, his daughter, and Edison, and it's open for the public to tour.",
              "While the tower is named for Eiffel, it was actually Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier \u2014 two engineers who worked for his company \u2014 who designed the structure.",
              "They also commissioned French architect Stephen Sauvestre to work on the appearance of the project in order to quell public concerns about the harsh, utilitarian nature of the original design.",
              "They ultimately beat out more than 100 other projects in a contest to choose the main attraction of the World's Fair.",
              "The tower was built with the intent of showing off France's industrial prowess during the World's Fair, but the plan was to tear it down after 20 years.",
              "However, Eiffel cleverly put a radio antenna and wireless telegraph transmitter in the tower.",
              "After proving radio\u2019s usefulness to the government in 1910, Eiffel was granted a 70-year extension to his lease.",
              "By 1980, of course, the tower had become an indelible symbol of both Paris and France, and it was in no danger of demolition.",
              "In August 1944, as the Nazis were losing control of occupied Paris, Adolf Hitler commanded his generals to level the city.",
              "Plans were drawn up to mine the Eiffel Tower with explosives.",
              "Thankfully, Allied troops swooped in before the order could be carried out.",
              "Subsequent air raids over Paris caused significant damage, but the Eiffel Tower survived the war intact.",
              "As sculptor Fre\u0301de\u0301ric-Auguste Bartholdi was designing \u201cLiberty Enlightening the World\u201d, he called upon his mentor, Euge\u0300ne Viollet-le-Duc, to design the statue\u2019s internal framework.",
              "After Viollet-le-Duc died in 1879, Bartholdi turned to Eiffel and Koechlin.",
              "They proved their iron expertise with Lady Liberty before moving on to the Iron Lady.",
              "The tower has been home to several businesses throughout the years, many of which are now gone.",
              "These include the newspaper \u201cLe Figaro\u201d, which had an office on the second floor for six months during the 1889 World's Fair, a post office tucked into the first floor, and a wooden theater on the first floor designed by Sauvestre.",
              "Gim42/Getty Images Eiffel, an avid scientist, housed a meteorology lab on the tower's third floor.",
              "He was known to perform studies in physics and aerodynamics there, even building a wind tunnel at the foot of the structure.",
              "Eiffel opened the doors of the laboratory for other scientists to use for their experiments as well.",
              "The massive iron structure is wind resistant and will sway during a storm.",
              "Wind isn't the only thing that can make the enormous tower move, though \u2014 the heat of the sun causes the iron to expand, making the Tower grow a few centimeters during the summer months.",
              "The tower will also lean an average of six inches away from the sun, as the one side facing the direct light heats up faster than the other three sides.",
              "The names of French scientists and engineers working in the 19th century were not forgotten by history \u2014 not only are they attached to several Parisian streets, but 72 of them are also engraved on the Eiffel Tower.",

              "The Latting Observatory was a wooden tower in New York City built as part of the 1853 Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations, adjoining the New York Crystal Palace.",
              "It was located on the North side of 42nd Street between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue across the street from the site of present-day Bryant Park.",
              "Conceived by Waring Latting and designed by architect William Naugle, the observatory was an octagonally-based, iron-braced wooden tower 315 feet (96 m) high adjoining the Crystal Palace, with landings at three levels on the structure, allowing visitors to see east into Queens, south into Staten Island, and west into New Jersey.",
              "[1] The tower, taller than the spire of Trinity Church at 290 feet (88 m), was the tallest structure in New York City from the time it was constructed in 1853 until it was shortened in 1855.",
              "The tower's base was a 75-foot (23 m) square, tapering to a top of 6 to 8 feet (1.",
              "8 to 2.",
              "4 m).",
              "It could handle up to 1,500 people at a time.",
              "[2] It burned down in 1856.",
              "The Latting Observatory was an inspiration for the Eiffel Tower.",
              "[3] The tallest building in the United States during its brief existence, and described afterwards as \"New York's first skyscraper\", the building's base featured shops and three landings, at 125 feet (38 m), 225 feet (69 m), and 300 feet (91 m), where telescopes allowed tourists to peer over their surroundings.",
              "[4] The original specifications of the observatory called for a steam elevator to be installed to service all three heights, but that would have been unprecedented, since the tallest elevator then in existence was only 75 feet (23 m) high.",
              "None of the accounts of the tower mention steam elevators.",
              "[5] Ascent was possible using winding stairways with several intermediate landings.",
              "[3] In announcing the July 1, 1853 opening of the observatory to invited guests, a writer for The New York Times described that he \"was not prepared for the wonderful panorama\" which was said to reach from 40 to 60 miles (60 to 100 km), providing an incomparable view unavailable in London, Paris or from atop the Great Pyramid of Giza, as the tower rises in \"the midst of a human hive, whose bees are the best in the world's apiary.\"",
              "The ascent to the top of the structure was described as \"fatiguing, but it improves digestion.\"",
              "[6] The building was acquired by the Hydeville Marble Works shortly after the end of the fair in 1854;",
              "the firm removed the top 75 feet of the tower a year later.",
              "The observatory burned down in a fire that started between midnight and 1:00 AM on August 30, 1856 in a cooper's shop located at 49 West 43rd Street.",
              "The fire spread rapidly and attracted spectators from around the city, with flames that were visible for miles around.",
              "Though the fire destroyed more than twelve buildings and several families were left homeless, there were no known injuries or fatalities related to the incident.",
              "The Hydeville Marble Works, which owned the observatory, suffered a loss of $100,000 on merchandise and structures, of which $17,500 was covered by four different insurance companies.",

              "with property valued at a total of $150,000 destroyed, most of which was accounted for by the tower itself.",
              "The Times described the tower as a \"conspicuous landmark, by which the traveler could ascertain his whereabouts\" and that it would be \"greatly missed\" despite the fact that as an investment it was \"a stupendous failure\" that never paid a return on the $150,000 in capital stock raised to erect the structure.",
              "Spectators feared that the tower would topple on and crush the north side of the Crystal Palace, but the observatory burned down on its base into a \"mass of smouldering cinders\".",
              "Fire companies from Williamsburg and elsewhere in Brooklyn were ferried across the East River to assist in extinguishing the blaze.",
              "[2] Engineer Gustave Eiffel acknowledged that the origin of the idea for an observation tower \"came from America\" but that his tower in Paris improved upon the American version in several ways.",
              "[3] The Latting Observatory was built \"without regard for beauty of form and purely for commercial purpose\" in contrast to the Eiffel Tower, built some thirty years later with attention to form.",

              "\ud83d\udd51 Reading time: 1 minute The Eiffel Tower was the first structure to reach the coveted height of 1000 feet and maintained its status as the world\u2019s tallest structure until 1930.",
              "It was constructed as a landmark monument to commemorate the centenary of the 1789 French Revolution.",
              "Later on, the city officials recognized its significance as a radio tower, which proved instrumental during the first and second world wars.",
              "Presently, the Eiffel Tower situated in Paris, France, is one of the world\u2019s most iconic tourist destinations.",
              "Its architectural intricacies welcome more visitors than any other tourist attraction in the world.",
              "In addition to its architectural value, the tower also marks significant improvements in engineering design with its four legs roughly representing an exponential curve, to resist wind loads in the best possible way.",
              "Due to the unique design of its legs, the tower could reach the height never attained before by any other structure.",
              "The Eiffel Tower is a large wrought iron lattice structure comprising 7,300 tons of iron and 2.",
              "5 million rivets.",
              "It has three observation decks connected by multiple stairways and elevators.",
              "These observation decks attract an average of 30,000 visitors each day.",
              "This makes the tower\u2019s observation decks a highly-visited area in the world.",
              "The tower also contains two restaurants that offer panoramic views of the surrounding city.",
              "Eiffel Tower is standing tall even after so many years because of its remarkable engineering design.",
              "To explain this in detail, we\u2019ll discuss the geotechnical, structural, and construction features that make it extraordinary.",
              "The following points describe the geology of the site of the Eiffel Tower: The structural members of the Eiffel Tower consist of the floor system, beams, and legs.",
              "These structural members are discussed below: The floor of all the observation deck is made up of wrought iron.",
              "These decks are supported by the large grid of trusses that span between the legs.",
              "The large grid of trusses that span between the legs acts as a beam for the structure.",
              "These trusses are made up of wrought iron.",
              "Trusses provide the support to the flooring system and also help in load distribution.",
              "The lower and middle platforms are supported by a 16 m x 16 m and 6 m x 6 m square grid trusses with an area of 4200 m2 and 1650 m2, respectively.",
              "Beams in the upper half of the tower provide continuity between the four legs before they join to form a single leg.",
              "The spans of these beams vary from 1.",
              "8 m to 15.",
              "7 m.",
              "The Eiffel Tower consists of four legs.",
              "These legs are of exponential curve shape, such that they meet to form a single point at the peak.",
              "The size of each leg is approximately 15 m x 15 m.",
              "Each leg consists of four columns.",
              "Each column is connected to the iron lattice.",
              "Thus, the columns of each leg behave as a truss member.",
              "The columns of each leg are made up of a hollow square cross-section, formed by a series of angles and flat sections.",
              "The section properties of both the hollow square column sections and the diagonal bracing members vary with height, reflecting the increase in permanent loads of the tower at lower heights.",
              "The following are the important points about the foundation of the Eiffel Tower: Two different approaches were considered for the construction of the Eiffel Tower foundation on two different sides of the tower.",
              "i.",
              "e., park-side and riverside.",
              "The following points describe the details of the park-side foundation of the Eiffel Tower: The following points describe the details of the riverside foundation of the Eiffel Tower: Wind load is a critical factor for designing tall towers.",
              "It affects tall towers in two ways\u2014 statically and dynamically.",
              "The wind load conditions considered for the Eiffel Tower are discussed below: The following points describe the details of the construction process of the Eiffel Tower: Further, the construction process details are discussed in three different segments for the first floor level, second floor level, and third floor level.",
              "In June 1887, the tower rising process started.",
              "Workers started assembling the huge iron pieces.",
              "Each section was designed carefully in a factory so that it could be easily reassembled and fit into another piece at the site.",
              "The workers carried an iron beam on their shoulders.",
              "Lattice iron girders were constructed at the site to climb up and down to reach the desired height.",
              "Cranes were used to provide tools and building materials to the workers.",
              "The weight of the legs of the towers was huge and hence to make the tiniest adjustment, great power was required.",
              "For this purpose, the Eiffel crew developed a jack hammer machine to provide power.",
              "Meanwhile, to keep the legs of the tower in place, sand-filled bags were used as a counterweight.",
              "By the end of March 1888, construction till the first floor was finished.",
              "Since the cranes were only able to reach up to the first level and hence to reach a greater height, Eiffel developed the \u201cCreepers\u201d.",
              "Creepers are steam-powered cranes which can run inside the leg of the tower.",
              "Later on, these Creepers were used as elevators for the public.",
              "Scaffolds were also required to reach a greater height and to support the weight of the legs.",
              "However, after the construction of first-floor level, legs of the tower leaned at 54 degrees inwards.",
              "Huge gigantic bolts, which were installed in the foundation were only holding the legs.",
              "Further construction of the tower without support could have led to the collapse of the tower.",
              "To support the tower further, Eiffel developed the wooden scaffolds around the legs of the tower.",
              "These scaffolds also helped in supporting all the tools and materials required for construction.",
              "Scaffolds were made on the pile foundation so that there was no chance of subsidence.",
              "With the help of cranes and scaffolds, the construction of second floor was finished in June 1988.",
              "After reaching the second-floor level, the slope of the four legs of the tower varied and diminished as it rose.",
              "A pivot platform was made at the top of the tower where all the legs of the tower had resembled a flat platform.",

              "French: Tour Eiffel [tu\u0281 \u025bf\u025bl] i) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.",
              "It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889.",
              "Locally nicknamed \"La dame de fer\" (French for \"Iron Lady\"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair.",
              "Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.",
              "[3] The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022.",
              "[4] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:[5] 6.",
              "91 million people ascended it in 2015.",
              "It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site (\"Paris, Banks of the Seine\") in 1991.",
              "[6] The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[7] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris.",
              "Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side.",
              "During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930.",
              "It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height.",
              "Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.",
              "2 metres (17 ft).",
              "Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.",
              "The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels.",
              "The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground \u2013 the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union.",
              "Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels.",
              "The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent a 600 step climb.",
              "Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.",
              "On this top, third level is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel's private use.",
              "He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as Thomas Edison.",
              "The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and E\u0301mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des E\u0301tablissements Eiffel.",
              "It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution.",
              "Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.",
              "[8] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".",
              "[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design.",
              "Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.",
              "The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name.",
              "On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socie\u0301te\u0301 des Inge\u0301nieurs Civils;",
              "after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise [n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.",
              "[10] Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Gre\u0301vy was re-elected as president of France and E\u0301douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade.",
              "A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.",
              "[10] (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.)",
              "On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.",
              "After some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887.",
              "Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.",
              "5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.",
              "5 million francs.",
              "Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years.",
              "He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.",
              "[11] A French bank, the Cre\u0301dit Industriel et Commercial (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower.",
              "During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower.",
              "These loans were connected to an indemnity controversy which saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, \"effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income\".",
              "According to The New York Times, \"[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.\"",
              "[12] The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds.",
              "Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[13] and many people believed it was impossible.",
              "These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering.",
              "It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet.",
              "A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887: We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection .",

              ".",
              ".",
              "To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream.",
              "And for twenty years .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.",
              "[14] Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man.",
              "Will it not also be grandiose in its way?",
              "And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"",
              "[15] These criticisms were also dealt with by E\u0301douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying,[16] \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.",
              "Indeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection.",
              "Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\"",
              "[17] Some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built;",
              "others remained unconvinced.",
              "[18] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.",
              "[19] By 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.",
              "[20] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.",
              "Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.",
              "[21] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.",
              "6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg.",
              "The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[22] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick.",
              "Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.",
              "Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.",
              "5 m (25 ft) long.",
              "The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began.",
              "The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.",
              "[23] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm (0.",
              "04 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc.",
              "[24] The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed.",
              "No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration.",
              "In all, 18,038 pieces were joined using 2.",
              "5 million rivets.",
              "[21] At first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold.",
              "This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\"",
              "and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press.",
              "[25] At this stage, a small \"creeper\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg.",
              "They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs.",
              "The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.",
              "[21] Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments to precisely align the legs;",
              "hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold.",
              "Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[21] due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens, only one person died.",
              "[26] 18 July 1887:The start of the erection of the metalwork 7 December 1887:Construction of the legs with scaffolding 20 March 1888:Completion of the first level 15 May 1888:Start of construction on the second stage 21 August 1888:Completion of the second level 26 December 1888:Construction of the upper stage 15 March 1889:Construction of the cupola The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower.",
              "[18] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features.",
              "Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, E\u0301mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustre\u0301, completed the ascent.",
              "At 2:35 pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.",
              "[27] There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May;",
              "even then, the lifts had not been completed.",
              "The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.",
              "[28] Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[29] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.",
              "[3] After dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light.",
              "Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition.",
              "The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.",
