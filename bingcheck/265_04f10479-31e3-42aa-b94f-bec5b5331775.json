    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. There is no definitive answer to what is the most innovative and sustainable solution to tackle the issue of plastic waste in the fashion industry, but there are some promising approaches that have been proposed or implemented by researchers, environmental groups and fashion brands.\n\nOne possible solution is to recycle plastic waste into new fabrics that can be used for clothing. For example, scientists have made fabrics from polythene, a common plastic found in bags and packaging, by using a process that breaks down the plastic into fine powder and then melts it into thin fibers[^1^]. These fibers can be woven into textiles that are breathable, durable and water-resistant, and have potential uses in sports wear and even high-end fashion[^1^]. Another example is using recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, the most common type of plastic bottles, to make synthetic fibers such as polyester[^3^]. This can reduce the demand for virgin plastics and save energy and water in production[^3^].\n\nHowever, recycling plastics into fabrics is not a perfect solution. It still requires energy and chemicals to transform the plastic waste into usable materials, and it does not address the problem of microplastic pollution that occurs when synthetic fabrics are washed or discarded[^3^]. Moreover, recycling plastics from different sources can result in lower quality and performance of the fabrics, and there are limits to how many times plastics can be recycled before they degrade[^3^].\n\nAnother possible solution is to shift the fashion industry away from a model of excessive production and consumption, and towards a circular economy that minimizes waste and maximizes resource efficiency. This could involve reducing the use of plastics and other synthetic materials in clothing, and opting for more natural, organic or biodegradable alternatives[^4^]. It could also involve designing clothes that are more durable, versatile and repairable, and encouraging consumers to buy less, reuse more and dispose responsibly[^4^]. Additionally, it could involve improving the collection, sorting and recycling systems for plastic waste, and ensuring that fashion brands are transparent and accountable for their environmental impacts[^2^].\n\nThese are just some of the possible solutions to tackle the issue of plastic waste in the fashion industry. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for this complex challenge, but rather a need for collaboration and innovation across different sectors and stakeholders. Ultimately, it will require a change in mindset and behavior from both producers and consumers of fashion to reduce the negative impact on the environment.",

              "They wove the yarns into silky, lightweight fabrics that absorb and evaporate water more quickly than common textiles such as cotton, nylon, and polyester.",
              "They have also calculated the ecological footprint that polyethylene would have if it were produced and used as a textile.",
              "Counter to most assumptions, they estimate that polyethylene fabrics may have a smaller environmental impact over their life cycle than cotton and nylon textiles.",
              "The researchers hope that fabrics made from polyethylene could provide an incentive to recycle plastic bags and other polyethylene products into wearable textiles, adding to the material\u2019s sustainability.",
              "\u201cOnce someone throws a plastic bag in the ocean, that\u2019s a problem.",
              "But those bags could easily be recycled, and if you can make polyethylene into a sneaker or a hoodie, it would make economic sense to pick up these bags and recycle them,\u201d says Svetlana Boriskina, a research scientist in MIT\u2019s Department of Mechanical Engineering.",
              "Boriskina and her colleagues have published their findings today in Nature Sustainability.",
              "Water wick A molecule of polyethylene has a backbone of carbon atoms, each with a hydrogen atom attached.",
              "The simple structure, repeated many times over, forms a Teflon-like architecture that resists sticking to water and other molecules.",
              "\u201cEveryone we talked to said polyethylene might keep you cool, but it wouldn\u2019t absorb water and sweat because it rejects water, and because of this, it wouldn\u2019t work as a textile,\u201d Boriskina says.",
              "Nevertheless, she and her colleagues tried to make weavable fibers from polyethylene.",
              "They started with polyethylene in its raw powder form and used standard textile manufacturing equipment to melt and extrude polyethylene into thin fibers, similar to turning out strands of spaghetti.",
              "Surprisingly, they found that this extrusion process slightly oxidized the material, changing the fiber\u2019s surface energy so that polyethylene became weakly hydrophilic, and able to attract water molecules to its surface.",
              "The team used a second standard extruder to bunch multiple polyethylene fibers together to make a weavable yarn.",
              "They found that, within a strand of yarn, the spaces between fibers formed capillaries through which water molecules could be passively absorbed once attracted to a fiber\u2019s surface.",
              "To optimize this new wicking ability, the researchers modeled the properties of the fibers and found that fibers of a certain diameter, aligned in specific directions throughout yarn, improved the fibers\u2019 wicking ability.",
              "Based on their modeling, the researchers made polyethylene yarn with more optimized fiber arrangements and dimensions, then used an industrial loom to weave the yarn into fabrics.",
              "They then tested the wicking ability of polyethylene fabric over cotton, nylon, and polyester by dipping strips of the fabrics in water and measuring the time it took for the liquid to wick, or climb up each strip.",
              "They also placed each fabric on a scale over a single water droplet and measured its weight over time as the water was wicked through the fabric and evaporated.",
              "In every test, polyethylene fabrics wicked away and evaporated the water faster than other common textiles.",
              "The researchers did observe that polyethylene lost some of its water-attracting ability with repeated wetting, but by simply applying some friction, or exposing it to ultraviolet light, they induced the material to become hydrophilic again.",
              "\u201cYou can refresh the material by rubbing it against itself, and that way it maintains its wicking ability,\u201d Boriskina says.",

              "The researchers added colored particles into the powdered polyethylene before extruding the material into fiber form.",
              "In this way, particles were encapsulated within the fibers, successfully imparting color to them.",
              "\u201cWe don\u2019t need to go through the traditional process of dyeing textiles by dunking them in solutions of harsh chemicals,\u201d Boriskina says.",
              "\u201cWe can color polyethylene fibers in a completely dry fashion, and at the end of their life cycle, we could melt down, centrifuge, and recover the particles to use again.",
              "\u201d The team\u2019s dry-coloring process contributes to the relatively small ecological footprint that polyethylene would have if it were used to make textiles, the researchers say.",
              "The team calculated this footprint by using a life cycle assessment tool commonly used by the textile industry.",
              "Taking into account polyethylene\u2019s physical properties and the processes required to make and color the fabrics, the researchers found it would require less energy to produce polyethylene textiles, compared to polyester and cotton.",
              "\u201cPolyethylene has a lower melting temperature so you don\u2019t have to heat it up as much as other synthetic polymer materials to make yarn, for example,\u201d Boriskina explains.",
              "\u201cSynthesis of raw polyethylene also releases less greenhouse gas and waste heat than synthesis of more conventional textile materials such as polyester or nylon.",
              "Cotton also takes a lot of land, fertilizer, and water to grow, and is treated with harsh chemicals, which all comes with a huge ecological footprint.",
              "\u201d In its use phase, polyethylene fabric could also have a smaller environmental impact, she says, as it would require less energy to wash and dry the material compared with cotton and other textiles.",

              "The researchers hope that fabrics made from polyethylene could provide an incentive to recycle plastic bags and other polyethylene products into wearable textiles, adding to the material\u2019s sustainability.",

              "But those bags could easily be recycled, and if you can make polyethylene into a sneaker or a hoodie, it would make economic sense to pick up these bags and recycle them,\u201d says Svetlana Boriskina, a research scientist in MIT\u2019s Department of Mechanical Engineering.",

              "\u201cEveryone we talked to said polyethylene might keep you cool, but it wouldn\u2019t absorb water and sweat because it rejects water, and because of this, it wouldn\u2019t work as a textile,\u201d Boriskina says.",
              "Nevertheless, she and her colleagues tried to make weavable fibers from polyethylene.",
              "They started with polyethylene in its raw powder form and used standard textile manufacturing equipment to melt and extrude polyethylene into thin fibers, similar to turning out strands of spaghetti.",
              "Surprisingly, they found that this extrusion process slightly oxidized the material, changing the fiber\u2019s surface energy so that polyethylene became weakly hydrophilic, and able to attract water molecules to its surface.",
              "The team used a second standard extruder to bunch multiple polyethylene fibers together to make a weavable yarn.",
              "They found that, within a strand of yarn, the spaces between fibers formed capillaries through which water molecules could be passively absorbed once attracted to a fiber\u2019s surface.",
              "To optimize this new wicking ability, the researchers modeled the properties of the fibers and found that fibers of a certain diameter, aligned in specific directions throughout yarn, improved the fibers\u2019 wicking ability.",
              "Based on their modeling, the researchers made polyethylene yarn with more optimized fiber arrangements and dimensions, then used an industrial loom to weave the yarn into fabrics.",
              "They then tested the wicking ability of polyethylene fabric over cotton, nylon, and polyester by dipping strips of the fabrics in water and measuring the time it took for the liquid to wick, or climb up each strip.",
              "They also placed each fabric on a scale over a single water droplet and measured its weight over time as the water was wicked through the fabric and evaporated.",
              "In every test, polyethylene fabrics wicked away and evaporated the water faster than other common textiles.",
              "The researchers did observe that polyethylene lost some of its water-attracting ability with repeated wetting, but by simply applying some friction, or exposing it to ultraviolet light, they induced the material to become hydrophilic again.",
              "\u201cYou can refresh the material by rubbing it against itself, and that way it maintains its wicking ability,\u201d Boriskina says.",

              "\u201d Eco cycle The team also found a way to incorporate color into the polyethylene fabrics, which has been a challenge, again due to the material\u2019s resistance to binding with other molecules, including traditional inks and dyes.",
              "The researchers added colored particles into the powdered polyethylene before extruding the material into fiber form.",
              "In this way, particles were encapsulated within the fibers, successfully imparting color to them.",
              "\u201cWe don\u2019t need to go through the traditional process of dyeing textiles by dunking them in solutions of harsh chemicals,\u201d Boriskina says.",
              "\u201cWe can color polyethylene fibers in a completely dry fashion, and at the end of their life cycle, we could melt down, centrifuge, and recover the particles to use again.",
              "\u201d The team\u2019s dry-coloring process contributes to the relatively small ecological footprint that polyethylene would have if it were used to make textiles, the researchers say.",
              "The team calculated this footprint by using a life cycle assessment tool commonly used by the textile industry.",
              "Taking into account polyethylene\u2019s physical properties and the processes required to make and color the fabrics, the researchers found it would require less energy to produce polyethylene textiles, compared to polyester and cotton.",
              "\u201cPolyethylene has a lower melting temperature so you don\u2019t have to heat it up as much as other synthetic polymer materials to make yarn, for example,\u201d Boriskina explains.",
              "\u201cSynthesis of raw polyethylene also releases less greenhouse gas and waste heat than synthesis of more conventional textile materials such as polyester or nylon.",
              "Cotton also takes a lot of land, fertilizer, and water to grow, and is treated with harsh chemicals, which all comes with a huge ecological footprint.",
              "\u201d In its use phase, polyethylene fabric could also have a smaller environmental impact, she says, as it would require less energy to wash and dry the material compared with cotton and other textiles.",

              "Log in Subscribed Fashion Industry By Bharat Khandelwal, Kunal Bhatia, Holger Rubel, Abhishek Dalmia, Shilpa Sharma, Alexander Meyer zum Felde, and Amanat Sidhu The fashion industry is becoming increasingly aware of the environmental impact of its waste problem: 87% of the material used in clothing production is eventually put in landfills or incinerated;",
              "less than 1% is recycled into new garments.",
              "1 1 Ellen MacArthur Foundation, A New Textiles Economy: Redesigning Fashion\u2019s Future (2017).",
              "Notes: 1 Ellen MacArthur Foundation, A New Textiles Economy: Redesigning Fashion\u2019s Future (2017).",
              "This is a consequence of the industry\u2019s traditional linear model, in which clothing is produced, used, and then discarded.",
              "And consumers today are buying more, driving brands to ramp up production, thus compounding the problem.",
              "While efforts to transition to circular and sustainable business models have long been underway, progress has been slow.",
              "Today, circular solutions are far outpaced by the sheer scale of consumption and production.",
              "The urgency of the climate crisis and the enormity of the waste problem call for a greater focus on solutions to reduce fashion\u2019s footprint in the near term.",
              "Promoting the reuse of garments is imperative;",
              "however, all garments eventually reach an end-of-life moment, when they can no longer be reused.",
              "Achieving true circularity in the fashion industry requires advanced recycling solutions to prepare for the end of life of the vast inventory of clothing in circulation that was manufactured using traditional, linear methods and for textiles that are difficult or impossible to recycle using available technologies.",
              "Rather than focusing solely on waste reduction, the fashion industry should adopt a pragmatic approach to circularity and double down on end-of-life recycling solutions, ensuring that textile waste stimulates the production of new garments rather than growth in landfills.",
              "The fashion industry\u2019s overreliance on natural resources for production, coupled with unsustainable waste management and excess production, has had a devastating impact on the environment.",
              "(See Exhibit 1.)",
              "Repercussions of the industry\u2019s practices include deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water scarcity, soil degradation, chemical pollution, and a massive carbon footprint.",
              "Fashion\u2019s traditional linear \u201ctake-make-waste\u201d model contributes to the growing climate crisis by releasing greenhouse gases and using virgin inputs for new production.",
              "Circularity offers a promising solution by establishing a closed-loop system that enables textiles to re-enter the value chain, thereby prolonging the value capture of materials.",
              "The circular value chain holistically addresses waste through five interconnected levers.",
              "(See Exhibit 2.)",
              "Each step, from material choice to circular design, is a critical enabler for the end-of-life stage, which allows products to be recycled and reused over and over again.",
              "For example, technical fibers are often derived from nonrenewable resources and take a long time to decompose in landfills.",
              "Increasing the recycled content in technical fibers reduces the demand for virgin resources, conserves energy, and minimizes waste.",
              "Given the interdependencies across the value chain, achieving a fully circular value chain will require the maturation of each step, which takes considerable time.",
              "As we continue to make progress in advancing long-term levers like materials innovation and circular design, there is a heightened need to focus on end-of-life circularity solutions to mitigate fashion\u2019s waste crisis in the near term.",
              "We must prioritize the development and scaling of advanced recycling systems that can convert multiple sources of textile waste (for example, post-consumer, manufacturing scraps, damaged goods, and excess inventory) into reusable materials, thereby increasing the availability of virgin-equivalent circular inputs for manufacturing.",
              "Before a garment can be recycled, it must go through a series of steps executed by several players working together.",
              "Textile waste is collected from consumer and industrial sources;",
              "sorted by category, condition, and material composition;",
              "and then designated for either reuse or recycling.",
              "(See Exhibit 3.)",
              "The process is far from being perfectly linear and straightforward.",
              "Instead, it is a complex and intricate web of diverse connections and actors characterized by several complications.",
              "Recognizing these complications is the first step toward designing appropriate interventions.",
              "In addition to the complexities that drive inefficiencies in the end-of-life process, there are several gaps where circularity efforts fail and merely postpone landfilling of textile waste.",
              "These gaps, discussed below, must be bridged to promote a perpetual cycle of true circularity.",
              "Collection.",
              "Significant volumes of reusable and recyclable garments are either not being collected or are being discarded due to barriers that limit consumer engagement and brand adoption of reuse and recycling.",
              "Sorting.",
              "Inefficiencies in the sorting market, driven by nascent technologies and inadequate connectivity, inhibit the optimal processing of garments.",
              "Reuse.",
              "Reuse models (resale, repair, or rental) without accompanying measures for products whose lifecycle cannot be further extended are incomplete solutions for achieving circularity.",
              "Recycling.",
              "Open-loop and closed-loop recycling have significant limitations: Closed-loop recycling technologies have not achieved scale.",
              "Closed-loop recycling, which converts textile waste into fiber that can be used in new material production, has yet to achieve the scale required to process the full spectrum of materials produced and volumes of waste generated.",
              "There are two main methods of closed-loop recycling: While several solutions to advance circularity from an end-of-life perspective exist, their adoption by the fashion industry remains limited.",
              "Rather than waiting for the next breakthrough technology or becoming paralyzed in the pursuit of perfection, the industry must seize opportunities to take meaningful action now.",
              "To accelerate progress toward a circular future with positive financial returns, the fashion industry must pursue the strategies discussed below.",
              "The limited inclusion of recycled textiles in clothing lines today is driven by the low availability and high price of recycled fibers compared with alternatives.",
              "Brands rely on recycled plastic waste for their sustainable collections while waiting for recycled textiles to become economically viable.",
              "This is particularly true for recycled polyester, as most brands use recycled plastics (for example, plastic bottles and packaging) from other industries instead of using regenerated polyester from the garments they produce.",
              "This has resulted in a recycling paradox, where textile-recycling technologies are unable to scale without sufficient demand for their output from brands, and brands are hesitant to increase their use of recycled textiles until these technologies become more cost-effective.",
              "To break this cycle, brands must increase their use of recycled textiles available today while also investing in the growth of closed-loop textile-recycling technologies to drive demand and achieve economies of scale.",
              "While investment is needed to support early-stage innovations and to scale promising technologies, the latter is harder to achieve given high-risk, capital-intense requirements to scale.",
              "There are many promising technologies, particularly in closed-loop recycling, that are ready to be scaled today.",
              "However, most players find it challenging to scale their operations beyond a single commercial-scale plant.",
              "Alternative investment models, such as licensing and joint ventures, can reduce upfront capital needs and allow innovators to overcome current funding constraints to scale.",
              "Although the tradeoffs between pursuing these alternative investment models and establishing owned-and-operated factories are not unique to textile recycling, prioritizing the former can deliver speed to scale with favorable economic returns.",
              "Scaling recycling without developing the supporting infrastructure and technology for collection and sorting will create a feedstock gap.",
              "Closed-loop recyclers have high purity standards and can primarily process mono-materials (for example, pure cotton).",
              "Purity constraints, combined with the difficulty in accurately identifying the composition of post-consumer waste, make it a less desirable source of feedstock despite being considerably larger than industrial waste.",
              "As demand for recycled output increases, competition for pure feedstock will also increase, impacting its supply.",
              "To address this issue, it is essential to scale closed-loop recycling technologies that can process a wider variety of blended materials and sorting technologies that can accurately identify material composition, making post-consumer waste a more viable source of feedstock.",
              "Individual, small-scale efforts will not achieve the impact required to tackle fashion\u2019s decentralized waste problem.",
              "Industry actors have launched initiatives and joined coalitions and alliances to create collective action.",
              "Despite the commitment, many players chase communal goals individually, resulting in a sustainability landscape saturated with well-intentioned but fragmented and overlapping initiatives.",
              "Actors must give a higher priority to consolidating efforts at scale than to pursuing individual competitive advantages.",
              "For instance, brands can consolidate take-back programs, pool investment in technologies, and share best practices to amplify and accelerate impact.",
              "Chemical closed-loop recyclers can also work together to ensure that impurities extracted during processing (that is, materials a particular technology cannot recycle) are passed on to recyclers with suitable technology.",
              "For example, a polyester closed-loop recycler can pass on the cotton extracted during processing to a cotton closed-loop recycler.",
              "In searching for opportunities with the highest potential for impact and visibility, brands often overlook short-term prospects that can move the needle.",
              "But brands can gradually build end-of-life business models by starting with initiatives that fit into their current ecosystem.",
              "One such opportunity could be forging partnerships that unify incentives, remove friction, and create revenue streams. For example, brands can sell their excess inventory directly to closed-loop recyclers, thereby making it easier for recyclers to source feedstock with known material composition.",
              "Brands can further integrate circularity into their core business operations through versatile tools that drive business and social value.",
              "For instance, digital IDs enable brands to remain connected to their consumers beyond the point of sale and generate future revenue streams by offering authentication and traceability.",
              "Additionally, digital IDs can be used to engage consumers via marketing and storytelling;",
              "educate them about the product\u2019s origin, materials, and care;",
              "and enable them to eventually resell, repair, or recycle the product.",
              "In addition to reducing waste and emissions, pursuing circularity can yield significant economic value.",
              "Circular business models are expected to grow to approximately 23% of the fashion market by 2030, representing an estimated $700 billion opportunity.",
              "2 2 Ellen MacArthur Foundation and BCG, Circular Business Models: Redefining Growth for a Thriving Fashion Industry (2021) Notes: 2 Ellen MacArthur Foundation and BCG, Circular Business Models: Redefining Growth for a Thriving Fashion Industry (2021) Companies with a clearly defined and well-executed circularity and sustainability agenda stand to win through incremental revenues (via circular business models and recycling), decreased costs, reduced reliance on virgin materials, improved supply-chain control, greater risk resilience, enhanced strategic positioning, and a more favorable brand perception.",
              "Early movers in fashion circularity recognize that implementing circularity at scale requires an industry-wide transformation.",
              "From setting ambitious goals to launching diverse initiatives across the circular value chain, chief executives have demonstrated their commitment to advancing circularity in the fashion industry.",
              "Nevertheless, despite the urgency surrounding circularity, many companies struggle to identify where to begin their journey.",
              "Pressure from stakeholders for immediate action often leads organizations to replicate frameworks applied by other brands and implement circularity initiatives in an ad hoc, piecemeal manner.",
              "However, when it comes to circularity strategies and models, no single approach fits all.",
              "BCG has supported many fashion brands with their circularity agenda, and in our experience, a successful circularity strategy is comprehensive and tailored to the overall business.",
              "For example, we applied our integrated circularity framework, called Circelligence, to build and execute a circularity strategy for an athletic- apparel and footwear brand in three phases: By partnering with the brand from conceptualization to implementation, we accelerated its circularity journey and set it up for success in the long term.",
              "The brand embraced circular design principles and scaled up the use of circular inputs in its new products, among other initiatives.",
              "As long as revenues remain inextricably linked to linear production models, mobilizing for change will be difficult.",
              "Ultimately, though, if industry interest in circularity fails to translate into impact, the status quo will be disrupted through policy and regulation.",
              "Widespread regulation curbing the destruction of textile waste is on the horizon, and those who fail to respond proactively will struggle to survive.",
              "It\u2019s time to pivot away from experimenting in circularity to fundamentally rethinking end-of-life strategies.",

              "It\u2019s plastic, and it\u2019s a big problem.",
              "Today, about 69% of clothes are made up of synthetic fibres, including elastane, nylon and acrylic.",
              "Polyester is the most common, making up 52% of all fiber production.",
              "Plastic\u2019s unique durability and versatility have made it indispensable to the fashion industry.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s in the waistband of your jeans, your shoes, in practically everything you wear, because plastic is this miracle material,\u201d said George Harding-Rolls, campaigns adviser at the Changing Markets Foundation, an organization that investigates corporate practices.",
              "But there\u2019s a climate cost: the raw material for these fibers is fossil fuels.",
              "Textile production consumes 1.",
              "35% of global oil production, more oil than Spain uses in a year, and significantly contributes to the fashion industry\u2019s huge climate footprint.",
              "Synthetics also continue to have an impact long after production, shedding plastic microfibers into the environment when clothes are washed.",
              "In response, a growing number of brands are switching to recycled versions of synthetic fibers like polyester, often advertising these clothes as the \u201cmore sustainable\u201d or \u201cconscious\u201d choice.",
              "This seems like an environmental win.",
              "But as brands weave more of these recycled yarns into their garments, some experts question whether they are just patching over fashion\u2019s environmental harms. \u201cWe\u2019ve been led to believe that recycled and sustainable are synonymous, when they are anything but,\u201d said Maxine Be\u0301dat, executive director of the New Standard Institute, a non-profit pushing for a sustainable fashion industry.",
              "The common recycled substitute for virgin synthetics are polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, the most common type of plastic bottles, which are produced in the billions each year.",
              "A survey of nearly 50 fashion brands by the Changing Markets Foundation revealed that 85% of them aimed to source recycled polyester from plastic bottles.",
              "Estimates show that recycled polyester could reduce emissions by up to 32% compared to virgin polyester.",
              "The demand for recycled synthetics from industries including fashion is expected to accelerate.",
              "Nike uses \u201csome recycled material\u201d in 60% of its products, said Seana Hannah, Nike\u2019s vice-president of sustainable innovation.",
              "Recycled polyester is a primary focus: \u201cNike is the highest industry user of recycled poly and we divert more than 1bn plastic bottles on average a year from landfills,\u201d Hannah said.",
              "Many big brands are setting targets.",
              "H&M, Madewell, J Crew and Gap Inc are among more than 70 brands that have committed to increase the share of recycled polyester to 45% by 2025 as part of a recycled polyester challenge set by the Textile Exchange, a non-profit working to increase uptake of lower-impact fibers across the textile industry.",
              "Synthetics make up the second-largest share of fibers after cotton for Gap Inc, said Alice Hartley, director of product sustainability and circularity at the company.",
              "All four of its brands \u2013 Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta and Gap \u2013 have committed to the 2025 challenge, with Old Navy opting to increase its recycled polyester to 60%.",
              "The company says that recycled synthetics are not a magic bullet.",
              "\u201cWe really try to stay away from the term \u2018sustainable garment\u2019, because that implies that we\u2019ve reached the destination.",
              "We really haven\u2019t, it\u2019s a continuous journey,\u201d Hartley said.",
              "Yet this nuanced message may not be filtering through to consumers, especially as many other brands do describe recycled fabrics as sustainable.",
              "Experts worry that people may believe their purchases are impact-free \u2013 when that\u2019s far from true.",
              "\u201cIf you are recycling synthetics, that doesn\u2019t get rid of the microplastics problem,\u201d said Harding-Rolls.",
              "Fibers continue shedding from recycled plastic yarns just as much as from virgin yarns, he said.",
              "PET bottles are also part of a well-established, closed-loop recycling system, where they can be efficiently recycled at least 10 times.",
              "The apparel industry is \u201ctaking from this closed-loop, and moving it into this linear system\u201d because most of those clothes won\u2019t be recycled, said Be\u0301dat.",
              "Converting plastic from bottles into clothes may actually accelerate its path to the landfill, especially for low-quality, fast-fashion garments which are often discarded after only a few uses.",
              "\u201cOne of the hallmarks of greenwashing is taking one piece of the puzzle and extrapolating broad benefits from that,\u201d said Ashley Gill, senior director of standards and stakeholder engagement Textile Exchange.",
              "\u201cSustainability in the apparel industry is a really complex issue.",
              "\u201d There are moves to use recycled textiles as feedstock for new clothes \u2013 less than 1% of clothes are currently recycled into new fibers \u2013 especially as projections from some markets suggest that cross-industry demand for recycled bottles will soon outstrip supply.",
              "But most clothes are made from a medley of fibers, and commercial-scale technology doesn\u2019t yet exist to disentangle these.",
              "\u201cA whole supply chain needs to be built up to really get to the commercial volumes that we need, to see more recycled fiber-to-fiber textiles,\u201d Hartley said.",
              "Hyping the lower emissions impact of recycled yarns, said Be\u0301dat, distracts from fashion\u2019s larger emissions source: textile mills, which process fibers into yarn to make fabric as well as dyeing and finishing, an energy-guzzling process that accounts for about 76% of a garment\u2019s lifecycle emissions.",
              "\u201cBrands are focusing on what magical material they can create, rather than doing the less sexy work of improving energy efficiency in textile mills,\u201d said Be\u0301dat.",
              "\u201cI don\u2019t want to pooh-pooh progress, but we really do have to start prioritizing where we\u2019re going to be able to move the needle the most.",
              "\u201d Some innovators think the solution lies in finding viable alternatives to fossil fuel-derived synthetics that have the same performance traits.",

              "\u201cThat addresses the microfiber issue, and provides another pathway for textile circularity as well,\u201d said Alissa Baier-Lentz, the company\u2019s co-founder.",
              "The fiber can also be returned to its base components through chemical recycling and used as a feedstock for circular yarn production, Baier-Lentz said.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s just on us to get the [recycling] system in place, and work with industry partners to make it happen,\u201d she said.",

              "the company will launch the first clothes made with Kintra fibers in 2022.",

              "Scientists have made fabrics from polythene in a move they say could reduce plastic pollution and make the fashion industry more sustainable.",
              "Polythene is a ubiquitous plastic, found in everything from plastic bags to food packaging.",
              "The new textiles have potential uses in sports wear, and even high-end fashion, according to US researchers.",
              "The plastic \"cloth\" is more environmentally-friendly than natural fibres, and can be recycled, they say.",
              "Dr Svetlana Boriskina, from the department of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US, said plastic bags that nobody wants can be turned into high-performance fabrics with a low environmental footprint.",
              "\"There's no reason why the simple plastic bag cannot be made into fibre and used as a high-end garment,\" she told BBC News.",
              "\"You can go literally from trash to a high-performance garment that provides comfort and can be recycled multiple times back into a new garment.\"",
              "The fabric is made from fibres of polythene woven on industrial looms into textiles that are designed to be comfortable to wear.",
              "Crucially, the fibres are designed to allow water to escape, rather than repelling water like conventional polythene.",
              "The researchers say the fabric is less damaging to the environment than the likes of wool, cotton, linen, silk, nylon and polyester, and can be washed in cold water, further reducing the environmental footprint.",
              "The plastic can be dyed in different colours before being woven into fabric.",
              "Because it is made up of only one type of plastic - polythene - it can be recycled into new garments time and time again.",
              "The fabric has potential for use in sportswear, such as trainers, vests and leggings, they say.",
              "In the long-term, it could also have applications as a high-performance space suit, engineered to be protect against cosmic radiation.",
              "Commenting on the study, published in Nature Sustainability, Dr Mark Sumner of the University of Leeds said it remained to be seen if such a fabric might catch on.",
              "He said the typical mechanical properties of polythene - such as strength and melting temperature - tend to limit its use in textiles, as does its very low moisture absorption.",
              "\"The fundamental challenge I see with this development, as we have seen with many other 'new fibre' developments, is how well the fibre aligns with comfort, feel and drape requirements of the consumer,\" he said.",
              "\"If the fabric feels waxy, or stiff and lacks comfort then consumers won't buy the product, and therefore, the fibre has limited use for clothing.\"",
              "The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world.",
              "Textile manufacturing consumes huge amounts of water and generates millions of tonnes of waste, as well as 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually.",

              "Scientists have made fabrics from polythene in a move they say could reduce plastic pollution and make the fashion industry more sustainable.",
              "Polythene is a ubiquitous plastic, found in everything from plastic bags to food packaging.",
              "The new textiles have potential uses in sports wear, and even high-end fashion, according to US researchers.",
              "The plastic \"cloth\" is more environmentally-friendly than natural fibres, and can be recycled, they say.",
              "Dr Svetlana Boriskina, from the department of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US, said plastic bags that nobody wants can be turned into high-performance fabrics with a low environmental footprint.",
              "\"There's no reason why the simple plastic bag cannot be made into fibre and used as a high-end garment,\" she told BBC News.",
              "\"You can go literally from trash to a high-performance garment that provides comfort and can be recycled multiple times back into a new garment.\"",
              "The fabric is made from fibres of polythene woven on industrial looms into textiles that are designed to be comfortable to wear.",
              "Crucially, the fibres are designed to allow water to escape, rather than repelling water like conventional polythene.",
              "The researchers say the fabric is less damaging to the environment than the likes of wool, cotton, linen, silk, nylon and polyester, and can be washed in cold water, further reducing the environmental footprint.",
              "The plastic can be dyed in different colours before being woven into fabric.",
              "Because it is made up of only one type of plastic - polythene - it can be recycled into new garments time and time again.",
              "The fabric has potential for use in sportswear, such as trainers, vests and leggings, they say.",
              "In the long-term, it could also have applications as a high-performance space suit, engineered to be protect against cosmic radiation.",
              "Commenting on the study, published in Nature Sustainability, Dr Mark Sumner of the University of Leeds said it remained to be seen if such a fabric might catch on.",
              "He said the typical mechanical properties of polythene - such as strength and melting temperature - tend to limit its use in textiles, as does its very low moisture absorption.",
              "\"The fundamental challenge I see with this development, as we have seen with many other 'new fibre' developments, is how well the fibre aligns with comfort, feel and drape requirements of the consumer,\" he said.",
              "\"If the fabric feels waxy, or stiff and lacks comfort then consumers won't buy the product, and therefore, the fibre has limited use for clothing.\"",
              "The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world.",
              "Textile manufacturing consumes huge amounts of water and generates millions of tonnes of waste, as well as 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually.",
              "Washing and drying clothes often consumes even more energy and water than the production phase.",

              "Scientists have made fabrics from polythene in a move they say could reduce plastic pollution and make the fashion industry more sustainable.",
              "Polythene is a ubiquitous plastic, found in everything from plastic bags to food packaging.",
              "The new textiles have potential uses in sports wear, and even high-end fashion, according to US researchers.",
              "The plastic \"cloth\" is more environmentally-friendly than natural fibres, and can be recycled, they say.",
              "Dr Svetlana Boriskina, from the department of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US, said plastic bags that nobody wants can be turned into high-performance fabrics with a low environmental footprint.",
              "\"There's no reason why the simple plastic bag cannot be made into fibre and used as a high-end garment,\" she told BBC News.",
              "\"You can go literally from trash to a high-performance garment that provides comfort and can be recycled multiple times back into a new garment.\"",
              "The fabric is made from fibres of polythene woven on industrial looms into textiles that are designed to be comfortable to wear.",
              "Crucially, the fibres are designed to allow water to escape, rather than repelling water like conventional polythene.",
              "The researchers say the fabric is less damaging to the environment than the likes of wool, cotton, linen, silk, nylon and polyester, and can be washed in cold water, further reducing the environmental footprint.",
              "The plastic can be dyed in different colours before being woven into fabric.",
              "Because it is made up of only one type of plastic - polythene - it can be recycled into new garments time and time again.",
              "The fabric has potential for use in sportswear, such as trainers, vests and leggings, they say.",
              "In the long-term, it could also have applications as a high-performance space suit, engineered to be protect against cosmic radiation.",
              "Commenting on the study, published in Nature Sustainability, Dr Mark Sumner of the University of Leeds said it remained to be seen if such a fabric might catch on.",
              "He said the typical mechanical properties of polythene - such as strength and melting temperature - tend to limit its use in textiles, as does its very low moisture absorption.",
              "\"The fundamental challenge I see with this development, as we have seen with many other 'new fibre' developments, is how well the fibre aligns with comfort, feel and drape requirements of the consumer,\" he said.",
              "\"If the fabric feels waxy, or stiff and lacks comfort then consumers won't buy the product, and therefore, the fibre has limited use for clothing.\"",
              "The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world.",
              "Textile manufacturing consumes huge amounts of water and generates millions of tonnes of waste, as well as 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually.",

              "The researchers hope that fabrics made from polyethylene could provide an incentive to recycle plastic bags and other polyethylene products into wearable textiles, adding to the material\u2019s sustainability.",
              "\u201cOnce someone throws a plastic bag in the ocean, that\u2019s a problem.",
              "But those bags could easily be recycled, and if you can make polyethylene into a sneaker or a hoodie, it would make economic sense to pick up these bags and recycle them,\u201d says Svetlana Boriskina, a research scientist in MIT\u2019s Department of Mechanical Engineering.",

              "The simple structure, repeated many times over, forms a Teflon-like architecture that resists sticking to water and other molecules.",
              "\u201cEveryone we talked to said polyethylene might keep you cool, but it wouldn\u2019t absorb water and sweat because it rejects water, and because of this, it wouldn\u2019t work as a textile,\u201d Boriskina says.",
              "Nevertheless, she and her colleagues tried to make weavable fibers from polyethylene.",
              "They started with polyethylene in its raw powder form and used standard textile manufacturing equipment to melt and extrude polyethylene into thin fibers, similar to turning out strands of spaghetti.",
              "Surprisingly, they found that this extrusion process slightly oxidized the material, changing the fiber\u2019s surface energy so that polyethylene became weakly hydrophilic, and able to attract water molecules to its surface.",
              "The team used a second standard extruder to bunch multiple polyethylene fibers together to make a weavable yarn.",
              "They found that, within a strand of yarn, the spaces between fibers formed capillaries through which water molecules could be passively absorbed once attracted to a fiber\u2019s surface.",
              "To optimize this new wicking ability, the researchers modeled the properties of the fibers and found that fibers of a certain diameter, aligned in specific directions throughout yarn, improved the fibers\u2019 wicking ability.",
              "Based on their modeling, the researchers made polyethylene yarn with more optimized fiber arrangements and dimensions, then used an industrial loom to weave the yarn into fabrics.",
              "They then tested the wicking ability of polyethylene fabric over cotton, nylon, and polyester by dipping strips of the fabrics in water and measuring the time it took for the liquid to wick, or climb up each strip.",
              "They also placed each fabric on a scale over a single water droplet and measured its weight over time as the water was wicked through the fabric and evaporated.",
              "In every test, polyethylene fabrics wicked away and evaporated the water faster than other common textiles.",
              "The researchers did observe that polyethylene lost some of its water-attracting ability with repeated wetting, but by simply applying some friction, or exposing it to ultraviolet light, they induced the material to become hydrophilic again.",

              "\u201d The team\u2019s dry-coloring process contributes to the relatively small ecological footprint that polyethylene would have if it were used to make textiles, the researchers say.",

              "Taking into account polyethylene\u2019s physical properties and the processes required to make and color the fabrics, the researchers found it would require less energy to produce polyethylene textiles, compared to polyester and cotton.",

              "\u201cSynthesis of raw polyethylene also releases less greenhouse gas and waste heat than synthesis of more conventional textile materials such as polyester or nylon.",
              "Cotton also takes a lot of land, fertilizer, and water to grow, and is treated with harsh chemicals, which all comes with a huge ecological footprint.",
              "\u201d In its use phase, polyethylene fabric could also have a smaller environmental impact, she says, as it would require less energy to wash and dry the material compared with cotton and other textiles.",

              "Already five of the nine planetary boundaries have been transgressed during humanity\u2019s short presence on Earth, driven by a throwaway culture that too often exploits nature.",
              "Our economy has become inherently linear, and it may be difficult to reimagine how we make, use and discard things unless we shift toward a more regenerative and inherently natural system.",
              "The latest edition of the Circularity Gap Report explores the concept of a circular economy and investigates its role in climate mitigation and in cultivating more equitable societies around the world.",
              "Ultimately, the model will require a systems shift: radically rethinking how we use resources to fulfil our needs and wants.",
              "The report presents a range of circular solutions, based on four key principles of the circular economy: using fewer resources, using resources for longer, recycling resources and regenerating resources.",
              "The report applies these strategies to \u201ckey societal needs and wants\u201d \u2013 such as housing, nutrition and transport \u2013 to transform how resources are fed into the economy.",
              "If applied globally, this could result in a 28% reduction of resource use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 39% \u2013 keeping the world on track to reach its goal of limiting global warming to 1.",
              "5 degrees.",
              "Here we outline 21 strategies that can be applied in daily life, to businesses and at local and national government level.",
              "Importantly, these are not only grounded in energy policies \u2013 they go far beyond and span economic policy, industry, business and individual consumer behaviour.",
              "Providing nutrition to the world is an extremely resource and emissions intensive task: accounting for 10 billion tonnes of GHG emissions and 21.",
              "3 billion tonnes of resources a year.",
              "It's also extremely inefficient as more than 30% of all food produced is thought to be wasted.",
              "While a massive proportion of the global population are malnourished, many others are overweight.",
              "Nutrition for all can be delivered with a fraction of the resources currently pumped into the linear food systems. The current model is ripe for change to a circular economy.",
              "It\u2019s extremely impactful to first slash excessive consumption before increasing production to tackle food shortages and scarcity.",
              "The words \u201cno\u201d and \u201crefuse\u201d are important in the circular economy.",
              "Let\u2019s make cutting excess consumption tangible through food sufficiency: bringing the per capita caloric and protein intakes of high-income, high-emitter countries (such as the US or many in the EU, see the Shift profile on the right) down to match healthy levels \u2013 2,000 calories a day for a typical woman.",
              "This can be done by reducing the material and emissions footprint per calorie of foods by prioritising healthier and more satiating foods over foods with low nutritional value.",
              "Think here of sugary beverages and refined, heavily processed items that require resources and energy to be produced, but their \u201cempty calorie\u201d effect on our stomachs means they are a wildly inefficient diet choice.",
              "Animal-based proteins are yet another inefficient way to reach our daily calorie quota: 25kg of grain and about 15,000 litres of water is needed to produce only 1kg of beef \u2013 inputs that could instead be used to nourish humans.",
              "In some parts of the world, where a variety of other high protein, nutritious options are available, ditching animal proteins can be one of the most impactful individual actions for the climate.",

              "Circular shifts will also deliver secondary benefits such as less packaging needed for food \u2013 a massive win in terms of reducing single-use plastic \u2013 reduced obesity and healthier overall communities.",
              "It could also help to reduce food waste, also a strategy in itself needed to make our food systems more circular.",
              "Try doing this at home by not only cutting excess consumption, but planning your meals ahead, looking up innovative recipes to make use of your broccoli stems or fruit peels, shopping your refrigerator before heading to the market and skipping impulse buys if possible.",
              "Food service can employ the use of AI apps, such as Winnow, which has been found to cut kitchen waste by 50% or more.",
              "Choosing food that is sustainably sourced \u2013 meaning it comes from ecosystems that are managed according to environmental standards that enable regeneration \u2013 is a strong circular choice.",
              "A range of sustainable and carbon-neutral certification schemes aim to provide this ethical stamp to consumers.",
              "Nowadays, even cheese can come with a PAS2060 certification, the international mark of carbon neutrality.",
              "Sometimes we need to look to the past to learn lessons for the future.",
              "Practising the habits of our grandparents by going local and regional when picking our ingredients can have substantial environmental plus points.",
              "This often reduces the need for hot-housing vegetables, which equates to a reduction in fuel inputs, plus fewer food miles and lower transportation impacts.",
              "Supporting or practising urban, organic and precision farming models can also eliminate harmful synthetic fertiliser use, a huge source of emissions on its own.",
              "In the UK, interest in allotments soared during the COVID-19 pandemic as home-grown food caught on.",
              "Lastly, backed by carbon-neutral biomass certification, using food waste and losses as animal feed \u2013 instead of the usual soy-based feeds \u2013 is an age-old tradition that will support the growth of secondary markets, take a chunk out of livestock emissions and help to avoid deforestation.",
              "While it's not legal in the EU, it's a successful practice in Japan and South Korea, where about 40% of food waste is used as feed.",
              "Finally, cooking with polluting fuels is a silent killer: nearly 4 million people die a year from illness related to the associated pollution.",
              "Food preparation resources can also be made more circular, and safe, by replacing polluting traditional biomass and black carbon producing stoves with clean cooking apparatuses, including advanced solar-electric stoves.",
              "Increasing access to clean and sustainable energy around the world will be key to making this circular act available to those who most need it.",
              "Providing shelter for the world is the most intensive \u201cneed\u201d in terms of resources and emissions.",
              "Buildings are often developed without regard for the ecosystems of which they are a part.",
              "And in our civilisation's history, we have built a lot: the mass of human-made things, from pavements to apartments to phones, now outweighs all natural biomass, such as trees and animals.",
              "Using circular economy strategies to lessen the load of our housing needs on the environment, and building with (rather than over) nature is imperative.",
              "Fulfilling the global economy\u2019s need for housing is currently responsible for nearly 40 billion tonnes of resources and 13.",
              "5 billion tonnes of GHG emissions a year.",
              "Multi-purpose buildings reduce the overall floor space needed and optimise resource efficiency, and also deliver proportional savings on heating and cooling.",
              "To make our need for housing circular, we must ultimately call for fewer, but better, new houses to be built and make using them for multiple purposes the norm, especially in higher-income countries where we have masses of stock already built up.",
              "To make the most of the buildings we already have, they should be used flexibly and be able to adapt as time and needs evolve.",
              "Imagine a hybrid building that is used as a flex-work office space, a community centre and an evening school.",
              "Such spaces can be payment-per-use, such as the cross-industry collaborative building Dutch Mountains in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.",
              "Multi-purpose buildings reduce the overall floor space needed and optimise resource efficiency, and also deliver proportional savings on heating and cooling.",
              "These savings will be further boosted by cuts in energy consumption that can be practised by anyone: lower room temperatures, smart metering and improved thermal insulation.",
              "To continue making the most of the buildings already gracing the Earth, we must prioritise extending the lifetime of existing stock.",
              "Up until the 1960s there were strong traditions of reusing and sorting building materials, but this began to change as the construction industry in Europe moved from lime mortar to cement mortar, building materials became cheaper, and there were fewer requirements regarding the service life of buildings.",
              "Supporting and urging government interventions that ban building with virgin materials and policies to cap new construction in line with available volumes of secondary materials for building can reduce the need to extract finite materials from the Earth.",
              "Ultimately, waste from demolished buildings can be processed into new building materials, such as concrete mix or building sand.",
              "These options massively boost resource efficiency in production and performance.",
              "Core circular methods must be practised at all levels, from the consumer to the national government.",
              "These include renovation, refurbishment, retrofitting and modular design.",
              "Modular design allows us to easily adapt buildings over time to suit changing needs and carries the potential for deconstruction, relocation and reuse of elements (or even whole buildings).",
              "Underused and disused buildings should also be occupied \u2013 in a time of resource scarcity buildings should not be sitting empty.",
              "Only with these methods can we try to meet the global housing demand within our global stock limits.",
              "Nature-based solutions (NBS) can also lower material and energy demand for housing.",
              "We can be inspired by low-energy approaches such as Passivhaus design (this minimises the requirements for mechanical space heating, cooling and ventilation), while also applying renewable technologies such as solar photovoltaic or thermal, air-source and geothermal heat pumps to shrink the carbon footprint of a property.",
              "The Mahali Hub in South Africa are modular homes built with upcycled and locally available materials and a range of sustainable additions such as rainwater harvesting and passive cooling, resulting in net-zero homes.",
              "We need to see the widespread use of low-carbon construction materials, material lightweighting and local sourcing to help to cut embodied energy in the housing system.",
              "And to add some regenerative power, the use of natural or renewable building materials, such as wood, straw and hemp, can boost biodiversity and regenerate ecosystems, while also generally slashing material footprints due to their lightweight character.",
              "Green roofs and living walls are all examples of NBS interventions with regenerative benefits, at least in terms of thermal performance, water management, biodiversity and air quality.",
              "Fulfilling the societal need for consumables \u2013 a diverse group of items ranging from refrigerators and furniture to clothing and cleaning agents \u2013 is not hugely resource-intensive compared to housing, for example, at 6.",
              "9 billion tonnes of resources and 5.",
              "6 billion tonnes of GHG a year.",
              "However, it's incredibly wasteful, toxic and it is a huge drain on a different set of resources: cotton, synthetic, fossil fuel-based materials such as polyester and all the dye pigments and chemicals that go with it.",
              "Shifting consumption choices and mainstreaming circular design, both usage and acquisition rates can decline.",
              "The production of low-cost, synthetic materials, which form the backbone of cheap, fast fashion, has increased nine-fold in the past 50 years, using around 350 million barrels of oil each year and shedding microplastics in the process.",
              "Meanwhile, the fashion industry is responsible for a fifth of waste water globally.",
              "That's why we must move towards a circular economy.",
              "As we know by now, we need to begin by using less.",
              "Aside from conscious choices and utilising the all-important r-word \u2013 refuse \u2013 we need to start with the efficient design and use of consumer products.",
              "By shifting consumption choices and mainstreaming circular design, both usage and acquisition rates can decline.",
              "Tangible actions include: increasing digitisation to reduce paper use;",
              "not making textiles from animals;",
              "aiming to eradicate single-use plastic;",
              "optimising the usage of electronics to minimise e-waste;",
              "choosing only eco-labelled responsibly-sourced timber furniture, and prioritising local purchasing and sourcing.",
              "We must also learn to make the most of the stuff we have.",
              "Here, encouraging repair, maintenance, sharing, re-manufacturing and take-back programmes for textiles, appliances, furniture and machinery are powerful and should form the base of circular systems. Durable denim meets circular business models in the case of Kuyichi: the company\u2019s resale business model offers a take-back scheme for customers to easily give their denim a new lease of life to their denim, as well as a resale service for preloved goods.",
              "The backwards practice of designing products to break relatively quickly, planned or built-in obsolescence, must be eliminated, or we should choose not to invest in the companies that fail to do so.",
              "A phone with an old battery should not have to be tossed out and replaced, but should instead be repaired, the battery replaced easily with available and value-for-money replacement parts.",
              "Design for disassembly, customisation and replacement parts are all practical and marketable options that should become mainstream.",
              "The EU has no dedicated policy in place to stop the absurd practice of planned obsolescence, yet, Biden in the US has taken a bold and necessary step in formally backing \u201cright to repair\u201d legislation that calls on companies to release the knowledge and tools required to repair many common devices.",
              "To reduce the level of toxins and pollutants in the environment, we should prioritise the use of sustainable materials for chemical-free consumables.",
              "This is imperative in light of recent research that posits that the fifth planetary boundary to be surpassed is chemical pollution \u2013 spurred by plastics and chemicals from farmland fertilisers, for example, leaching into the environment.",
              "We use products and dispose of them, but they don't just go away.",
              "To avoid further environmental degradation, businesses and consumers alike can prioritise bio-based alternatives, chemicals leasing and natural fertilisers, and organic compost in gardens.",
              "We can also look to recycle our consumables when refusing, repairing or refurbishing are not possible avenues.",
              "Closing loops and boosting value in secondary markets will allow a circular market for consumables to thrive.",
              "To get there, governments must promote the recycling of plastics, synthetic fibres, paper, wood and wood by-products;",
              "as well as specifying recycled content obligations, and substituting them where possible for virgin or raw material.",
              "On the plastics front, a range of legislation in this arena has been rolled out: by 2030, all plastic bottles in the EU must contain 30% recycled content, while this stands at 50% in California;",
              "and in Maharashtra in India, industrial packaging produced in the state must include 20% recycled content.",
              "All steps in the right direction, but this has got to move faster, while concurrently turning off the plastics tap by reducing unnecessary plastics production.",

              "We can learn a lot from the behaviours practiced during the COVID-19 lockdowns \u2013 namely a cut in long-distance travel and telecommuting for work.",
              "Current mobility habits leave much to be desired.",
              "Privately owned vehicles in Europe sit unused for 90% of the time, while the phenomenon of \u201cghost flights\u201d recently shocked the world: airlines flying empty planes just to retain flight slots, all the while spewing GHG emissions.",
              "From driving to flying, opportunities for change are plentiful as we look towards a circular economy.",
              "When it comes to cutting the resource and emissions intensity of mobility, the simplest way is to reduce travel.",

              "\u201cBy doing that and having quite a crystalline organization, you can increase the strength and you can also engineer the performance of this fibre,\u201d Stanev says.",
              "He says the fibre is about 20% stronger than standard lyocell, which itself is stronger than cotton.",

              "Every time the molecules are run through the recycling process, they become shorter and thinner.",

              "NMMO tends to be unstable and requires the addition of buffer solutions, but the ionic liquid does not.",
              "Sixta says his ionic liquid is also completely recyclable, making the process environmentally friendly as well as producing fibres with better mechanical properties than cotton.",
              "The Ioncell process can use wood pulp, which Sixta says counts as part of a circular economy because the raw material comes from Finland\u2019s sustainable forests \u2014 these are managed in such a way that growth outpaces the amount removed.",

              "When companies commit to materials that are produced from waste plastic through molecular recycling, we can greatly reduce our dependency on fossil-based feedstocks for new plastic production and create a collection process that assigns value to what was otherwise considered \u2018waste,\u2019 keeping it out of landfills or the environment.",
              "In addition, companies should consider the growing consumer desire to consume less by investing in quality products that last longer.",

              "Companies can commit to reuse by designing products to have replaceable parts or reusable pieces or by packaging in refillable containers.",
              "They\u2019ll need to design convenient and economical systems so that consumers can easily return products and packaging to the value chain at the end of their usefulness, access repair parts or refill containers.",

              "To recycle means to put materials that are at the end of their useful life back into the system to create new products.",
              "Companies can commit to recycling in two ways: using recycled content in products and packaging and designing products to be recyclable.",
              "But we need system reform and consumers on board too.",

              "As the benefits stack up, this transition is becoming a key focus for policymakers around the world.",
              "But there remains much confusion about what a circular economy is, and how it might be achieved.",
              "One common misunderstanding is the notion that it is simply a rebrand of recycling\u2014the recovery and reprocessing of waste materials for use in new products.",
              "This perception is reinforced because recycling is the most common component of almost 80% of circular economy definitions.",
              "But, although recycling is an important element, there are many others.",
              "Before recycling comes into play there are several steps in a product\u2019s life cycle that should be addressed, such as redesigning products and processes so that they use less virgin material, and re-using items rather than discarding them.",

              "These approaches prioritize smart designs that extend a product\u2019s useful life, before reaching the stage of recycling.",
              "These steps are consistent with the central aim of a circular economy: to provide economic productivity by eliminating the concept of waste.",
              "Recycling is often criticized as insufficient compared with earlier interventions such as reuse or reduce.",
              "And it is true that a circular economy requires a great deal more than recycling.",

              "This is a key barrier to realizing a circular economy.",
              "In Australia, there was significant disruption to recycling pathways in 2018 when, similarly to other high-income nations, the country could no longer export waste (including plastic and paper recycling) to China.",
              "This resulted in recycling being directed to landfill for a short period.",
              "For plastics alone, Australia required a 150% increase in domestic plastics-recycling capacity and this highlighted a need to adopt a range of circular economy strategies.",
              "The transition to a circular economy will need further cross-sector collaboration and investment in initiatives that improve recovery rates while minimizing the consumption of raw materials, extending product life and increasing the use of renewable resources.",
              "An example is so-called right to repair legislation, which requires manufacturers to modify product design and make parts available to allow consumers to mend products.",

              "This approach is driving up market demand for recycled content and encourages companies to adopt recycled plastic solutions.",
              "The Australian government has also implemented a waste export ban for key materials\u2014including tyres, plastics, glass, paper and cardboard\u2014and announced an investment of Aus$1 billion (roughly US$620 million) into infrastructure to enhance the country\u2019s ability to recover and remanufacture waste materials.",

              "By Sabine Atieh, Jayant Gotpagar, Peter Meijer, Harry Morrison, and Mark Porter Report This article is part of Bain\u2019s Energy and Natural Resources Report 2022 As attention has focused on the problem of plastic pollution in the environment, governments and the private sector have taken steps to promote recycling and reduce plastic waste.",
              "These measures include phasing out certain single-use plastics and setting specific goals on plastics recycling.",
              "Targets vary by region.",
              "For example, the European Union aims to recycle all plastic packaging by 2030, whereas the US aims to recycle half.",
              "In the private sector, companies that make and use plastics are making new commitments to expand the use of recycled and bio-based plastics, reducing the amount of plastic used, and increasing recycling through better design and new investments in infrastructure.",
              "There are also many new recycling initiatives and partnerships, along with innovation in new plastic types such as low-carbon plastics made from biomaterials.",
              "Our clients tell us they understand that more needs to be done to improve the sustainability and circularity of plastic products, that is, the ability to put materials back into the supply chain, rather than depositing them as waste.",
              "Plastics producers and users know that if concerns aren\u2019t addressed, they risk facing more stringent regulation and more pressure from customers.",
              "But they\u2019ve also said this is one of their many priorities, along with broader environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) commitments, including emissions reductions (see Figure 1).",
              "In many cases, improving plastic circularity will also reduce emissions, making it essential for delivering on the industry\u2019s decarbonization goals and ensuring the license to operate among growing concern about plastic waste.",
              "There\u2019s a lot of activity underway on recycling and circularity, but it\u2019s still not enough to provide the amount of recycled material that industry will need.",
              "Our recycling scenarios, based on current industry efforts and trajectories, suggest that by 2030, between 50 million and 70 million metric tons of plastics will be recycled annually, or 10% to 14% of total plastic consumption (see Figure 2), well below the targets set by companies and governments in, for example, the US and the EU.",
              "This misalignment between what companies want to buy and what will be available could inflate prices for recycled plastics, as competition heats up for the limited supply.",
              "Also, as the feedstock required for producing recycled plastics becomes bottlenecked, plastics producers will need to secure supplies to remain competitive as the market scales.",
              "These dynamics add to the uncertainty of the prospects for recycled plastics growth and will hinder investment.",
              "A shortage of recycled and renewable plastics could also permanently reduce demand for these products if users shift to alternatives to meet their recycling targets.",
              "This will be in addition to customer efforts to reduce the amount of plastics used, and the risk of cost increases for virgin plastics due to new taxes like the UK\u2019s plastics tax or other extended producer responsibility measures.",
              "So it\u2019s important for plastics producers to scale up their recycling efforts and develop solutions to meet their customers\u2019 needs for sustainable and low-carbon solutions at scale.",
              "Faster industrialization of the recycling industry, better waste-sorting solutions, and more technical expertise, especially in chemical recycling, will all be needed.",
              "As we talk with our clients, we\u2019re seeing three types of actions aimed at accelerating the momentum behind plastics recycling.",
              "Innovation and new technology.",
              "One reason that recycling rates are so low is that the technologies involved aren\u2019t well-developed.",
              "Recycling rates are higher in categories where technology, infrastructure, and public and consumer engagement are more mature\u2014for example, mechanical recycling for PET bottles in Europe, which is around 50%.",
              "Scaling up recycling also comes with challenges, though, as it gets increasingly difficult and costly to increase collection rates while also capturing smaller and less-efficient volumes of used plastic.",
              "Most plastic recycling today is mechanical\u2014processing the material, but keeping the molecule intact.",
              "Chemical processing\u2014changing the chemical structure of polymeric waste\u2014can recycle more plastic.",
              "But chemical recycling remains mostly at R&D levels (1 kiloton or less) or pilot-program scale (10 to 30 kilotons), focused mostly on polyolefins.",
              "Pilots help overcome technical challenges, demonstrate scalability and commercial viability, and provide experience that improves process stability and yield.",
              "We expect some of these efforts to scale to commercial levels over the next five years.",
              "Advances in chemical recycling technologies targeting other plastics, such as polystyrene and PVC, are also gaining traction.",
              "Improving circularity for those plastics will be an important building block to boost overall plastics ESG performance and circularity across such end markets as electronics and automotive, where more companies are thinking about circularity.",
              "Recycling advances aren\u2019t limited to technology, but also extend to collection, sorting, and processing to improve the quality of waste streams\u2014a necessary step to boost recycling rates.",
              "Some companies are building up these capabilities.",
              "For example, before divesting the asset to PreZero Recycling, waste management company Suez (now Veolia) opened Europe\u2019s most advanced facility for sorting used packaging in Germany.",
              "That plant can process 100 kilotons annually, using an innovative optical system to improve waste recovery.",
              "Another advancement under discussion is secondary material recovery facilities (MRFs), which aggregate residual waste streams from primary MRFs to pull out lower-value plastics and paper cartons more effectively.",
              "Several material innovations have also been pushed by resin producers to improve circularity, which are now being adopted by plastic converters.",
              "These innovations include better-performing monomaterials, which improve the recyclability of the application, and lightweight polymers to help reduce packaging volume.",
              "Finally, low-carbon solutions are also developing quickly, with greater emphasis on producing chemicals from renewable sources.",
              "For example, Origin Materials focuses on improving production of plant-based building blocks for PET as a negative-carbon solution to replace fossil-based PET.",
              "Partnerships and new business models.",
              "Scale, sustainable solutions will require partnerships that ensure a steady supply of renewable materials and a market for recycled material.",
              "Supply chain partnerships can help ensure a consistent flow of renewable inputs, which is essential to develop a market.",
              "These partnerships need to extend beyond the local initiatives that have emerged in some regions.",
              "Plastics users are also forming partnerships.",
              "Mondelez International is working with waste management start-up Plastic Energy to use its polypropylene feedstock made from postconsumer plastics for Philadelphia Cream Cheese containers.",
              "Offtake agreements are critical to ensure demand for recycled materials as production scales up.",
              "These agreements, which ensure delivery of the recycled materials produced, give producers a runway to gain experience, become more efficient, and reduce costs.",
              "We typically find that early offtake agreements are with customers willing to pay a premium for better ESG performance, whether because of individual commitments or local regulation.",
              "Companies like The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle\u0301, and PepsiCo have made commitments to increasing recycled content in plastic bottles.",
              "Our customer research has found that brands are typically willing to pay initial premiums of up to 25% above virgin pricing for these applications.",
              "Depending on the application, the relative change in product price will be much lower as the plastic forms only a small part of the total cost.",
              "In plastic resins for bottles, for example, a premium of around 20% for recycled plastics raises the price of the end product by about 2%.",
              "A Bain survey across the UK, France, and the Netherlands found that 75% of consumers said they\u2019d pay more for sustainable products.",
              "Legislation and standards.",
              "Plastic producers, recyclers, and consumers will need to work together to build support for change.",
              "They\u2019ll need to develop better policies for collecting and managing plastic waste, supported by better consumer education and behavior on waste sorting.",
              "They\u2019ll need to encourage investments and funding for new technologies, for example, through the OECD\u2019s Extended Producer Responsibility project.",
              "They\u2019ll need to agree on taxonomy as well as standards, for example, around using a mass balance approach or segregated supply chains for virgin and recycled plastics.",
              "Governments can also take specific actions to support growth in recycling.",
              "For example, they could restrict the use of, or tax, virgin plastics, thus promoting the use of recycled content.",
              "They could also consider minimum requirements of recycled content in plastics by extending renewable blending requirements to chemicals, similar to renewable fuel standards, which will help promote the use of renewable hydrocarbons in petrochemicals.",
              "Support is also developing around the world.",
              "In March 2022, the UN agreed to develop a treaty designed to end plastic pollution.",
              "Details are still to be ironed out, but the specific resolution is likely to address the full life cycle of plastic, including production, design, and disposal.",
              "The outcome, with internationally binding commitments, could be an important step in creating a global environment with investments channeled toward building up recycling infrastructure.",
              "Companies and associations, such as the International Council of Chemical Associations, have endorsed the treaty as an important step to address plastic pollution.",
              "Although current efforts aren\u2019t yet at the scale required, plastics recycling, the use of recycled content, and the use of low-carbon plastics are sure to increase.",
              "Companies that prepare now to scale up, connect to high-quality waste streams, and ensure a long-term supply of feedstock can put themselves in a stronger position in sustainable plastics.",

              "less than 1% is recycled into new garments.",
              "1 1 Ellen MacArthur Foundation, A New Textiles Economy: Redesigning Fashion\u2019s Future (2017).",
              "Notes: 1 Ellen MacArthur Foundation, A New Textiles Economy: Redesigning Fashion\u2019s Future (2017).",
              "This is a consequence of the industry\u2019s traditional linear model, in which clothing is produced, used, and then discarded.",
              "And consumers today are buying more, driving brands to ramp up production, thus compounding the problem.",
              "While efforts to transition to circular and sustainable business models have long been underway, progress has been slow.",
              "Today, circular solutions are far outpaced by the sheer scale of consumption and production.",
              "The urgency of the climate crisis and the enormity of the waste problem call for a greater focus on solutions to reduce fashion\u2019s footprint in the near term.",
              "Promoting the reuse of garments is imperative;",
              "however, all garments eventually reach an end-of-life moment, when they can no longer be reused.",
              "Achieving true circularity in the fashion industry requires advanced recycling solutions to prepare for the end of life of the vast inventory of clothing in circulation that was manufactured using traditional, linear methods and for textiles that are difficult or impossible to recycle using available technologies.",
              "Rather than focusing solely on waste reduction, the fashion industry should adopt a pragmatic approach to circularity and double down on end-of-life recycling solutions, ensuring that textile waste stimulates the production of new garments rather than growth in landfills.",
              "The fashion industry\u2019s overreliance on natural resources for production, coupled with unsustainable waste management and excess production, has had a devastating impact on the environment.",
              "(See Exhibit 1.)",
              "Repercussions of the industry\u2019s practices include deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water scarcity, soil degradation, chemical pollution, and a massive carbon footprint.",
              "Fashion\u2019s traditional linear \u201ctake-make-waste\u201d model contributes to the growing climate crisis by releasing greenhouse gases and using virgin inputs for new production.",
              "Circularity offers a promising solution by establishing a closed-loop system that enables textiles to re-enter the value chain, thereby prolonging the value capture of materials.",
              "The circular value chain holistically addresses waste through five interconnected levers.",
              "(See Exhibit 2.)",
              "Each step, from material choice to circular design, is a critical enabler for the end-of-life stage, which allows products to be recycled and reused over and over again.",
              "For example, technical fibers are often derived from nonrenewable resources and take a long time to decompose in landfills.",
              "Increasing the recycled content in technical fibers reduces the demand for virgin resources, conserves energy, and minimizes waste.",
              "Given the interdependencies across the value chain, achieving a fully circular value chain will require the maturation of each step, which takes considerable time.",
              "As we continue to make progress in advancing long-term levers like materials innovation and circular design, there is a heightened need to focus on end-of-life circularity solutions to mitigate fashion\u2019s waste crisis in the near term.",
              "We must prioritize the development and scaling of advanced recycling systems that can convert multiple sources of textile waste (for example, post-consumer, manufacturing scraps, damaged goods, and excess inventory) into reusable materials, thereby increasing the availability of virgin-equivalent circular inputs for manufacturing.",
              "Before a garment can be recycled, it must go through a series of steps executed by several players working together.",
              "Textile waste is collected from consumer and industrial sources;",
              "sorted by category, condition, and material composition;",
              "and then designated for either reuse or recycling.",
              "(See Exhibit 3.)",
              "The process is far from being perfectly linear and straightforward.",
              "Instead, it is a complex and intricate web of diverse connections and actors characterized by several complications.",
              "Recognizing these complications is the first step toward designing appropriate interventions.",
              "In addition to the complexities that drive inefficiencies in the end-of-life process, there are several gaps where circularity efforts fail and merely postpone landfilling of textile waste.",
              "These gaps, discussed below, must be bridged to promote a perpetual cycle of true circularity.",
              "Collection.",
              "Significant volumes of reusable and recyclable garments are either not being collected or are being discarded due to barriers that limit consumer engagement and brand adoption of reuse and recycling.",
              "Sorting.",
              "Inefficiencies in the sorting market, driven by nascent technologies and inadequate connectivity, inhibit the optimal processing of garments.",
              "Reuse.",
              "Reuse models (resale, repair, or rental) without accompanying measures for products whose lifecycle cannot be further extended are incomplete solutions for achieving circularity.",
              "Recycling.",
              "Open-loop and closed-loop recycling have significant limitations: Closed-loop recycling technologies have not achieved scale.",
              "Closed-loop recycling, which converts textile waste into fiber that can be used in new material production, has yet to achieve the scale required to process the full spectrum of materials produced and volumes of waste generated.",
              "There are two main methods of closed-loop recycling: While several solutions to advance circularity from an end-of-life perspective exist, their adoption by the fashion industry remains limited.",
              "Rather than waiting for the next breakthrough technology or becoming paralyzed in the pursuit of perfection, the industry must seize opportunities to take meaningful action now.",
              "To accelerate progress toward a circular future with positive financial returns, the fashion industry must pursue the strategies discussed below.",
              "The limited inclusion of recycled textiles in clothing lines today is driven by the low availability and high price of recycled fibers compared with alternatives.",
              "Brands rely on recycled plastic waste for their sustainable collections while waiting for recycled textiles to become economically viable.",
              "This is particularly true for recycled polyester, as most brands use recycled plastics (for example, plastic bottles and packaging) from other industries instead of using regenerated polyester from the garments they produce.",
              "This has resulted in a recycling paradox, where textile-recycling technologies are unable to scale without sufficient demand for their output from brands, and brands are hesitant to increase their use of recycled textiles until these technologies become more cost-effective.",
              "To break this cycle, brands must increase their use of recycled textiles available today while also investing in the growth of closed-loop textile-recycling technologies to drive demand and achieve economies of scale.",
              "While investment is needed to support early-stage innovations and to scale promising technologies, the latter is harder to achieve given high-risk, capital-intense requirements to scale.",
              "There are many promising technologies, particularly in closed-loop recycling, that are ready to be scaled today.",
              "However, most players find it challenging to scale their operations beyond a single commercial-scale plant.",
              "Alternative investment models, such as licensing and joint ventures, can reduce upfront capital needs and allow innovators to overcome current funding constraints to scale.",
              "Although the tradeoffs between pursuing these alternative investment models and establishing owned-and-operated factories are not unique to textile recycling, prioritizing the former can deliver speed to scale with favorable economic returns.",
              "Scaling recycling without developing the supporting infrastructure and technology for collection and sorting will create a feedstock gap.",
              "Closed-loop recyclers have high purity standards and can primarily process mono-materials (for example, pure cotton).",
              "Purity constraints, combined with the difficulty in accurately identifying the composition of post-consumer waste, make it a less desirable source of feedstock despite being considerably larger than industrial waste.",
              "As demand for recycled output increases, competition for pure feedstock will also increase, impacting its supply.",
              "To address this issue, it is essential to scale closed-loop recycling technologies that can process a wider variety of blended materials and sorting technologies that can accurately identify material composition, making post-consumer waste a more viable source of feedstock.",
              "Individual, small-scale efforts will not achieve the impact required to tackle fashion\u2019s decentralized waste problem.",
              "Industry actors have launched initiatives and joined coalitions and alliances to create collective action.",
              "Despite the commitment, many players chase communal goals individually, resulting in a sustainability landscape saturated with well-intentioned but fragmented and overlapping initiatives.",
              "Actors must give a higher priority to consolidating efforts at scale than to pursuing individual competitive advantages.",
              "For instance, brands can consolidate take-back programs, pool investment in technologies, and share best practices to amplify and accelerate impact.",
              "Chemical closed-loop recyclers can also work together to ensure that impurities extracted during processing (that is, materials a particular technology cannot recycle) are passed on to recyclers with suitable technology.",
              "For example, a polyester closed-loop recycler can pass on the cotton extracted during processing to a cotton closed-loop recycler.",
              "In searching for opportunities with the highest potential for impact and visibility, brands often overlook short-term prospects that can move the needle.",
              "But brands can gradually build end-of-life business models by starting with initiatives that fit into their current ecosystem.",
              "One such opportunity could be forging partnerships that unify incentives, remove friction, and create revenue streams. For example, brands can sell their excess inventory directly to closed-loop recyclers, thereby making it easier for recyclers to source feedstock with known material composition.",
              "Brands can further integrate circularity into their core business operations through versatile tools that drive business and social value.",
              "For instance, digital IDs enable brands to remain connected to their consumers beyond the point of sale and generate future revenue streams by offering authentication and traceability.",
              "Additionally, digital IDs can be used to engage consumers via marketing and storytelling;",
              "educate them about the product\u2019s origin, materials, and care;",
              "and enable them to eventually resell, repair, or recycle the product.",
              "In addition to reducing waste and emissions, pursuing circularity can yield significant economic value.",
              "Circular business models are expected to grow to approximately 23% of the fashion market by 2030, representing an estimated $700 billion opportunity.",
              "2 2 Ellen MacArthur Foundation and BCG, Circular Business Models: Redefining Growth for a Thriving Fashion Industry (2021) Notes: 2 Ellen MacArthur Foundation and BCG, Circular Business Models: Redefining Growth for a Thriving Fashion Industry (2021) Companies with a clearly defined and well-executed circularity and sustainability agenda stand to win through incremental revenues (via circular business models and recycling), decreased costs, reduced reliance on virgin materials, improved supply-chain control, greater risk resilience, enhanced strategic positioning, and a more favorable brand perception.",
              "Early movers in fashion circularity recognize that implementing circularity at scale requires an industry-wide transformation.",

          "Findings from this research will ultimately enable sorters to take action through the support of a digital platform that matches their textile waste with recyclers.",
          "The aim of the 18 month project is to create a greater link between textile sorters and textile recyclers;",
          "What is more, Fashion for Good and Circle Economy will map the current and future capabilities of textile recyclers in the region \u2013 illuminating crucial gaps between the sorting and recycling industry, and the innovation, investment and policy changes required to accelerate circularity.",
          "Rather than focusing solely on waste reduction, the fashion industry should adopt a pragmatic approach to circularity and double down on end-of-life recycling solutions, ensuring that textile waste stimulates the production of new garments rather than growth in landfills.",
          "To achieve a circular system, a new end-market for non-reusable textile is required, with an infrastructure and digital matching system that can support activities of sorters and recyclers\u201d \u2013 Katrin Ley, Managing Director \u2013 Fashion for Good 3.",
          "Achieving true circularity in the fashion industry requires advanced recycling solutions to prepare for the end of life of the vast inventory of clothing in circulation that was manufactured using traditional, linear methods and for textiles that are difficult or impossible to recycle using available technologies.",
          "Circularity offers a promising solution by establishing a closed-loop system that enables textiles to re-enter the value chain, thereby prolonging the value capture of materials."
