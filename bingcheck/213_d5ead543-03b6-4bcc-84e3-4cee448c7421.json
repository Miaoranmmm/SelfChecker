    "response": "That's a very interesting question. There are many fascinating and little-known facts about Mozart's life and career, but one that I find particularly intriguing is that he had a passion for billiards. According to some sources[^1^] [^2^], Mozart owned a billiard table and spent many hours playing the game with his friends and family. He even composed some of his music while playing billiards, such as his famous opera Don Giovanni[^1^]. Some scholars believe that Mozart's love for billiards influenced his musical style, as he used the principles of geometry, physics, and probability to create complex and elegant melodies and harmonies[^2^]. Mozart's billiard table is now preserved at the Mozarthaus museum in Vienna[^2^].\n\nThis fact shows that Mozart was not only a musical genius, but also a curious and playful person who enjoyed exploring different aspects of life and art. It also reveals how he was able to combine his mathematical and creative skills to produce some of the most remarkable works of classical music. Mozart's billiard hobby is an example of how he transcended the boundaries of genres and disciplines, and how he enriched his musical expression with diverse influences and inspirations.",
