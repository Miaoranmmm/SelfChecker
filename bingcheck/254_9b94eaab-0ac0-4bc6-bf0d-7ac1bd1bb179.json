    "query": "What is the social and economic impact of the fashion industry, and how can we promote sustainable and ethical fashion practices to reduce its negative effects on the environment and workers in the industry?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. The fashion industry has a significant social and economic impact on the world, as well as a huge environmental footprint. According to various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^], the fashion industry is responsible for:\n\n- 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 20% of global wastewater\n- 93 billion cubic meters of water consumption per year, enough to meet the needs of five million people\n- The use of toxic chemicals, pesticides, and insecticides that pollute the soil and waterways\n- The deforestation of endangered forests for wood pulp to make fabrics like rayon and viscose\n- The exploitation of millions of workers, especially women and children, who face low wages, long hours, unsafe conditions, and human rights violations\n- The generation of 92 million tons of textile waste per year, most of which ends up in landfills or incinerators\n\nTo reduce these negative effects, we can promote sustainable and ethical fashion practices that aim to minimize the harm to people and the planet along the entire value chain. Some examples of these practices are[^5^] [^6^] [^7^] [^8^]:\n\n- Using organic, recycled, or biodegradable materials that require less water, energy, and chemicals\n- Adopting circular fashion principles that extend the lifespan of garments and reduce waste through reuse, repair, rental, or recycling\n- Implementing fair trade and social responsibility standards that ensure workers are paid a living wage and have decent working conditions\n- Supporting local and artisanal production that preserves cultural heritage and empowers communities\n- Educating consumers about the true cost and impact of their clothing choices and encouraging them to buy less, buy better, and wear longer\n\nSustainable and ethical fashion is not only a moral duty but also a business opportunity. According to a report by Global Fashion Agenda[^2^], addressing the environmental and social problems created by the fashion industry would provide a $192 billion overall benefit to the global economy by 2030. Moreover, consumers are increasingly demanding more transparency and accountability from fashion brands, and are willing to pay more for products that align with their values.\n\nI hope this answer helps you understand what is sustainable and ethical fashion and why it matters. If you want to learn more about this topic or find some examples of sustainable fashion brands, please let me know.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "Elisa Tonda, Head of the Consumption and Production Unit at the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), one of the 10 UN bodies involved in the Alliance, explained the urgency behind its formation: \u201cThe global production of clothing and footwear generates 8% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and, with manufacturing concentrated in Asia, the industry is mainly reliant on hard coal and natural gas to generate electricity and heat.",

              "Despite the moves being made by some retailers to make the industry less harmful to the environment, it can be argued that, ultimately, the only way to really make fashion sustainable is to end the throwaway culture.",
              "Not only is the average person buying 60 per cent more items of clothing than they did 15 years ago but, according to the McKinsey 2019 State of Fashion report, they are only keeping them as half as long as they used to.",
              "UNEP says that promoting a change in consumption modes, through actions such as taking better care of clothes, recycling and \u201ctake-back\u201d programs, can make a major impact, and that simply doubling the time that we use each item of clothing could halve the fashion industry\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.",

              "Although there are many studies on the fashion industry\u2019s impact on climate change, much less research discusses the impact the industry has on biodiversity.",
              "The globe is currently going through the Holocene Extinction, Earth\u2019s 6th mass extinction, with one million species of plants and animals at risk of extinction.",

              "Researchers in the study note, \u201cWe expect biodiversity to become an even greater concern for consumers and investors in the coming years.",
              "Covid-19, instead of slowing the trend, has accelerated it\u2014perhaps because people now understand more deeply that human and animal ecosystems are interdependent.",
              "It\u2019s time for the apparel industry, which to date has contributed heavily to biodiversity loss, to now make bold moves in the opposite direction.",
              "\u201d People now, more than ever, are changing their sentiment toward sustainability, with two-thirds of consumers stating the importance of limiting climate change impacts, and 88 percent maintaining that more attention should be given to pollution reduction.",
              "Although apparel companies are cognizant of climate change, initiating numerous projects for carbon neutrality, the relationship between climate change and biodiversity\u2014a \u201cdistinct but related issue\u201d\u2014 is less apparent in the apparel industry.",
              "Climate change and biodiversity loss are interdependent, and an adverse impact on one can bolster an adverse effect on the other.",
              "Biodiversity is intricate and affects all environmental ecosystems\u2014from oceans and freshwater to forests and soils;",
              "it encompasses all life forms on earth.",
              "Furthermore, without biodiversity, global reliance on food, energy production, clean water, fertile soil, sustained air quality, and climate regulations will suffer.",
              "Researchers remark, \u201cThrough our analysis of quantitative impact indicators as well as industry-expert interviews, we have developed a good understanding of how each part of the apparel value chain affects biodiversity.",
              "\u201d To determine how the apparel industry contributes to biodiversity loss, researchers examined each stage of the apparel supply chain, including raw material production, material preparation and processing, production manufacturing, transportation and distribution, retailing, product-use life, and end-use.",
              "Researchers assess the negative impacts that each stage of the apparel supply chain has on biodiversity, analyzing land and water use patterns, chemical pollution, waste production, and energy consumption.",
              "Additionally, researchers developed a \u201cbiodiversity impact area\u201d map using data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to determine the severity (high, medium, low) of impact on biodiversity from each apparel chain sector on land and water use, pollution, climate change, and overexploitation.",
              "The results of the report identify the apparel sector\u2019s five largest contributors to biodiversity loss in order of overall value added to the apparel industry: cotton agriculture, wood-based natural fibers/synthetic manmade cellulose fibers (MMCFs), textile dyeing and treatment, microplastics, and waste.",
              "All five contributors come from three stages in the apparel sector: raw-material production, material preparation and processing, and end-use.",
              "Raw material and production have the highest levels of land, water, and energy use, with chemical pollution following close behind.",
              "Material preparation and processing have the highest levels of chemical pollution and energy consumption, preceding water use levels.",
              "The end-use sector has the most elevated waste levels of all apparel sectors.",

              "e., chemical, physical, geological, biological) that impacts species biodiversity.",
              "Many people, including regulators and corporations themselves, are aware of the adverse environmental impacts associated with the apparel industry, including the production of 10% of all global CO2 emissions, approximately 20% of all industrial water pollution, nearly 35% of oceanic microplastic pollution, and massive amounts of textile waste.",
              "Despite the environmental impacts, the fashion industry continues to grow and pollute due to the upsurge in \u201cfast fashion,\u201d which relies on cheap product manufacturing, frequent consumption of goods and services, and brief clothing use to meet consumer demands.",
              "Nowadays, the amount of material-use in fast fashion is increasing as clothing brands are generating nearly double the amount of clothing than in the early 2000s.",
              "Just as regular apparel production and consumption, fast-apparel production and consumption increase CO2 emissions, uses an enormous amount of water (trillions of liters per year), and produces an immense quantity of textile waste, most of which companies burn or send to landfills/developing countries.",
              "Furthermore, the entire apparel manufacturing process uses countless chemicals that are hazardous to consumers, factory workers, and the environment, including chemicals that lead to ailments, like brain cancer.",
              "A few examples of chemical hazards also include pesticide use on crops that produce raw material, chemical contamination in soils from pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, and chemical run-off into waterways from textile dyes and microfibers.",
              "Additionally, some fabrics treatments involve the infusion of harmful antimicrobial agents, like titanium dioxide or silver nanoparticles (nanosilver), which can seep into a person\u2019s sweat and absorb through the skin.",
              "The apparel industry\u2019s dependence on natural resources for the production of goods from raw materials demonstrates a need for sustainable practices to mitigate the risks associated with natural resource deficiency, including biodiversity loss.",

              "Global Canopy\u2019s Forest 500 ranking identifies the 500 companies and financial institutions with the greatest influence on tropical deforestation, based on their exposure through their supply chains based on market share, tonnes of each forest-risk commodity used, and other information.",

              "Fast-fashion brands and the high end market are both exposed to deforestation in their supply chains.",
              "Deforestation is a problem across the industry.",
              "The companies identified by Forest 500 as exposed to deforestation through the forest-risk commodities in their supply chains are assessed annually on the strength of their deforestation commitments and on their approach to implementation.",
              "Our most recent data shows that clothing companies \u2013 particularly those producing leather shoes, bags and accessories \u2013 are failing to take action to ensure their products are deforestation-free.",
              "Three quarters of the 38 clothing companies assessed had not made a public commitment related to forests for their leather supply chain.",
              "These companies, including Prada, Inditex (Zara\u2019s owner) and Capri Holdings (which owns Michael Kors) had not published information about what they were doing to ensure that the leather they source is deforestation-free.",
              "Failing to take these steps leaves these companies at risk of sourcing leather linked to the destruction of tropical forests.",
              "But not all forest-related commitments are equal.",
              "Of the nine companies with a commitment, five had committed only to protect priority forests in the Amazon.",
              "Three (Marks and Spencer\u2019s, Nike and VF Corporation) had made a commitment to zero-deforestation throughout their leather supply chains.",
              "And one company, Kering, had committed to ensure that no natural landscapes, including forests, are converted to produce leather.",
              "So why is so little action being taken on leather?",
              "Leather often faces significantly less scrutiny than other commodities because companies and consumers consider it a \u2018by-product\u2019 of beef.",
              "And certainly for some, not using leather would be a waste of the raw material.",
              "But, selling leather is actually a profitable co-product for most companies and therefore demand for leather does have an impact on the cattle industry.",
              "There are some industry sustainability initiatives focused on leather, such as the Leather Working Group (LWG), but none of these initiatives focus on deforestation.",
              "Although the LWG audits include an assessment of traceability to the slaughterhouse, this is not sufficient for the company to know or act on their impact on deforestation.",
              "So while 17 of the 38 leather companies identified by Forest 500 are members of the Leather Working Group, including Adidas, Asics and Deichmann, this means they are focusing on improving the sustainability of the tanning process, not their impact on deforestation.",
              "Cattle supply chains are opaque, with cows often moving from farm to farm before being taken to slaughter.",
              "As large processing companies frequently purchase live cows from small-scale farmers, there is often little record of where the cattle came from.",
              "However, the biggest issue of transparency in cattle supply chains is the gap between the slaughterhouse and the tannery where the hides are made into leather.",
              "Some tanneries source directly from the slaughterhouse, but others procure hides through traders making it harder to track back.",
              "As a result, some processors \u2013 and by extension the traders, manufacturers or retailers \u2013 don\u2019t know who they are sourcing the raw materials from.",
              "As a result, companies do not necessarily know if their suppliers have deforestation commitments, and whether or not the products contributed to deforestation.",
              "Man-made cellulosic fibres are now the second largest cellulosic fibre product following cotton, and are thought of by many consumers as sustainable alternatives to plastic-based fibres, such as polyester and nylon.",
              "Plastic fibres are a problem - approximately eight million tonnes of plastic, including up to 236,000 tonnes of microplastics, enter the oceans every year just as a result of washing plastic-fibre clothes.",
              "But simply replacing these fibres with wood-based alternatives does not guarantee that the clothing has less impact on the planet.",
              "Replacing natural forests with single-species tree plantations to harvest cellulose fibres reduces the natural biodiversity of the area and destroys critical natural habitats.",
              "If global biodiversity continues to decline, the ecosystems we depend on will collapse \u2013 impacting everything from food and water security to economic livelihoods.",
              "The sustainability of these natural fibres depends on how they are sourced and how forests are managed.",
              "Cellulose should be sourced without the destruction or degradation of ancient, endangered, or tropical forests \u2013 and companies can make sure that their suppliers are also operating in line with these standards to ensure the protection of these critical habitats.",
              "In comparison to leather, a greater proportion of companies in cellulose supply chains are addressing the problem of deforestation.",
              "Of the 22 companies we assessed, 15 had made a forest-related commitment.",
              "Some well-known brands, including Adidas, Amazon and Associated British Foods (the owners of Primark) did not have a forest-related commitment for procuring wood-based fibres.",
              "But some high street brands, including H&M, Cofra, and Zara-owner Inditex had committed to procuring cellulose which doesn\u2019t impact tropical forests.",
              "At the time of the most recent Forest 500 assessment, seven of the companies with forest-related commitments were members of the Canopy Style initiative, but this has now risen to all but three.",
              "Set up to drive change within the wood-based fibre industry, Canopy Style works with companies to develop and implement commitments to protect endangered forests from deforestation and degradation in their sourcing of viscose.",
              "With over 320 members, Canopy Style is helping to drive positive action.",
              "Once commitments have been made, they must be implemented well to drive change in the way companies source materials in their supply chains.",
              "But one of the biggest impediments to this change is a lack of transparency on who is supplying who with what.",
              "Supply chains are complex, often involving a number of different companies at each stage.",
              "To ensure a product is deforestation-free, companies have to be able to trace the product back through their suppliers to the point where they can check the product was produced in line with their commitment.",
              "In some high-risk areas, or for commodities like leather where applicable certification schemes are not available, this may mean tracing all the way back to where the raw materials were produced.",
              "Without this, any commitments companies make to consumers cannot be guaranteed.",
              "Yet just four of the 15 companies with a commitment for their cellulose supply chains had committed to traceability (Cofra, Inditex, Bestseller A/S and Fast Retailing).",
              "And only Fast Retailing had made a commitment to track through to the point of production.",
              "The leather supply chain is even more complex, with the steps from cow to fully-processed leather taking up to two years, and cattle being moved between farms before slaughter.",
              "Half of the companies with a commitment to ensure their leather is not linked to deforestation had committed to trace their leather supplies through their supply chain, and only one company \u2013 Kering \u2013 had committed to tracking the leather through to the point of production.",
              "The remaining companies that didn\u2019t have traceability commitments, which include New Balance, Clarks and VF Corporation, cannot provide any guarantee that their shoes, bags, and accessories are deforestation-free.",
              "Traceability is particularly critical for leather as there is no credible certification scheme for deforestation-free leather, unlike for some other commodities.",
              "Without this third-party scheme, it is even more pivotal that companies are able to track their own leather and monitor compliance throughout their supply chains.",
              "Companies do not always disclose their progress towards the commitments they have made, making it hard to know whether their products are deforestation-free.",
              "This could be because they are reluctant to reveal slow progress, or because they aren\u2019t taking action.",
              "The fashion industry has long avoided scrutiny by failing to be open about its practices, but as consumers demand greater transparency the time for this to change has come.",
              "Only one company with a forest-related commitment for leather, Tapestry, reported on their progress towards this goal in the latest Forest 500 assessment, while not one of the companies with a deforestation-free commitment did.",
              "As with making forest-related commitments, more companies were actively reporting on their progress for cellulose.",
              "But still, only six of the 15 companies with a forest-related commitment reported on their progress towards their goal.",
              "Without this progress reporting, consumers and external organisations cannot know if the company is actively working towards the target \u2013 or if the commitment is anything more than greenwash.",
              "But by opening up their supply chains to the public, companies can empower their customers to hold them accountable, and as a result increase the trust between consumers and the company.",
              "By being open and clear about what the company is doing, how they are doing it, and how much progress they are making, companies can let everyone know that they are working towards a more sustainable future.",
              "And they can raise the bar for other companies in the sector to follow suit.",
              "It is important to note that transparency and sustainability are not synonymous.",
              "However, transparency is a critical step in the right direction.",
              "It can create a race to the top for sustainability in all elements of a fashion supply chain, and as the Amazon continues to burn, the need for transparency in cellulose and leather supply chains is urgent.",
              "For companies, deforestation is just one of the corporate responsibility issues to address, according to Dr James MacPherson, from global sustainability consultancy, Anthesis Group.",
              "It intersects with climate change, biodiversity loss, water & catchment management, and human rights, and these issues are all being taken more seriously.",
              "The first step for a company, he explained, is to understand the risks in their supply chain.",
              "Could suppliers be linked to deforestation?",
              "Finding this out can be difficult, but there are a growing number of specialist tools that can be used to help.",
              "For example, jeans brand Wrangler has gone through this process.",
              "Tools such as Trase provide deforestation risk data by mapping links between consumer countries via trading companies to sources of production, helping companies to chart where and when deforestation risk is material.",
              "Once the source of any risk has been identified, companies can address that risk, and often will set a goal or commitment aiming for zero deforestation by a set date.",
              "Forest 500 found that 60% of the most influential companies in forest-risk supply chains had made a commitment to zero deforestation.",
              "Commitments of course need to be implemented.",
              "MacPherson said that achieving deforestation-free supply chains is likely to involve engaging and collaborating with a range of stakeholders in the supply chain, perhaps working with suppliers to achieve certification or helping them identify where the risks lie.",
              "This might include working towards certification, but it is increasingly recognised that deeper interventions are required.",
              "Such interventions might involve working with community and conservation organisations to balance the needs of local communities, businesses and biodiversity within landscapes and jurisdictions that lie within their supply chains.",
              "Companies should also be transparent about the actions they have taken, providing reassurance for consumers that their products are not driving biodiversity loss and climate change.",
              "As consumers, we all can help influence the decisions of the brands we buy.",
              "And the responses of H&M and VF Corp to the Amazon fires in 2019 show that companies do listen to the growing demands of consumers for sustainability \u2013 either due to consumer pressure or to avoid risking their reputation.",
              "\u201cConsumers are more informed than ever about the impact of their choices, and they are demanding more eco-friendly offerings.",

              "The UK government and European Union are both currently considering new laws designed to address the problem of deforestation in supply chains.",
              "Through both the EU and UK public consultations that have been set up around these new proposed laws, consumers can send a message that they want strong action to remove deforestation from their wardrobes.",
              "Although we are a long way from deforestation-free options being the norm, as awareness around the impact of our shoes, bags and shirts on tropical forests grows, so too does pressure on companies to make changes within their supply chains.",
              "Consumers want to know that their purchases are deforestation-free, and companies have an opportunity to lead the way in manufacturing deforestation-free fashion.",
              "As some companies take the first step towards a green recovery, they can use the opportunity to build sustainable supply chains.",

              "Worldwide 80 billion pieces of clothing are consumed every year, a 400% increase from only twenty years ago.",
              "However, approximately 85% of these textiles end up in a landfill every year.",
              "This is an indicator of the mass demand from consumers and rapid turnover in trends that is occuring.",
              "In 2014 the average person bought 60% more clothing than in the year 2000, however, they kept each item of clothing only half as long.",
              "This can largely be attributed to the rise of fast fashion, micro-trends, and the cheap and exploitative labor that makes it possible.",
              "The Rise of Fast Fashion \u201cFast fashion\u201d refers to the rapid production of clothing, generally in a way that sacrifices quality for quantity.",
              "Prior to the mid 1900\u2019s there were generally 4 seasons of fashion, one for every season of the year.",
              "Now fast fashion companies such as H&M create 52 \u201cmicro-seasons\u201d a year, one for every week.",
              "This new pattern created a massive demand for apparel and the creation of approximately 53 million tons of clothing annually.",
              "In order to sustain this level of production at a cost that allows the consumer to purchase clothing in large quantities, many fast fashion companies sought a way to cut costs in the supply chain.",
              "In order to achieve this, companies began taking their production to developing countries to take advantage of cheaper labor costs and less regulations.",
              "The rapid trend cycle, known as micro-trending, encourages the majority of fast fashion companies to engage in unethical labor practices in order to create a high volume of clothing at a low cost.",
              "Labor Practices in Fast Fashion What We Don\u2019t Know Can\u2019t Hurt Us?",
              "One of the main reasons fashion companies are so eager to take their subsidiaries to countries such as Vietnam, India, and Bangladesh is the lack of oversight that occurs during the actual textile production.",
              "Many brands choose to have minimal control over each step of the supply chain in order to avoid opening themselves up to enormous legal liability.",
              "Brands allow their subsidiaries to remain largely unregulated because it absolves them of responsibility for the unethical practices being used to produce their clothing at such low costs.",
              "However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for brands to turn a blind eye to the exploitation of their labor forces as it is being brought more and more into the public purview, as exemplified in 2019 when thousands of garment workers in Bangladesh went on strike over their low wages garnering international attention.",
              "What We Do Know The fast fashion industry employs approximately 75 million factory workers worldwide.",
              "Of those workers it is estimated that less than 2% of them make a living wage.",
              "This leads to workers living below the poverty line and the European Parliament has even described the conditions of factory workers in Asia as \u201cslave labor\u201d.",
              "Many garment workers are working up to 16 hours a day, 7 days a week.",
              "The textile industry also uses child labor particularly because it is often low skilled, so children can be exploited at a younger age.",
              "Additionally, the health of laborers is adversely affected by working conditions.",
              "The production of fast fashion clothing employs the use of 8,000 synthetic chemicals.",
              "Some of these chemicals have been shown to cause cancer and factory workers are regularly exposed to and breathing in these chemicals.",
              "There are also structural dangers that come with avoiding codes.",
              "This was demonstrated by the deadliest garment industry accident in modern history in Bangladesh when the Rana Plaza Factory collapsed in 2013 and 1,100 people were killed and 2,500 more were injured.",
              "Safeguards on the building had expired and engineers had even recommended the building should be condemned.",
              "However, workers were ordered to come in anyway, and they came for fear of not being paid.",
              "After this incident, building inspections were done on 1,106 factories used by fast fashion companies and 80,000 safety related issues were found.",
              "Looking Forward The idea that all companies take responsibility for their supply chains and ensure factory workers have a living wage and conditions are safe is a bit of a pipe dream considering the very exploitation of that labor is what allows those companies to increase their profit margins.",
              "Therefore, rather than ask for individual accountability, it is clear a more structural change is necessary.",
              "The most successful regulation in this sector is the Bangladesh Fire & Safety Accord, which came after the Rana Plaza factory collapse.",
              "The Accord is the first legally-binding agreement in the modern era between workers, factory managers, and apparel companies and affects the safety of over one million workers in Bangladesh factories.",
              "This model should be emulated in other countries that rely on fast fashion manufacturing and a similar model could be used to ensure fair wages.",
              "In addition, countries that headquarter the fast fashion companies can implement regulations that de-incentivize outsourcing offshore, or require that if a company is going to outsource offshore they be in greater control of their supply chain.",
              "This would force greater regulation of wages and hopefully prevent companies from abusing foreign labor because it is less expensive.",
              "Conclusion The fashion industry is growing rapidly, with an estimated 20% growth between 2020 and 2021, and it isn\u2019t slowing down.",
              "Consumer demand for a larger quantity of clothing at a cheaper price point has pushed development of the fast fashion industry.",
              "This has led to the dangerous exploitation of the labor force who makes the fashion industry possible.",
              "In order to prevent further damage to garment workers it is necessary that legislation emulating the Bangladesh Fire & Safety Accord be put into place in every country.",
              "There need to be larger pushes for legislation around fair wages and corporate responsibility for supply chain management.",

              "We take a look at the world\u2019s leading fair trade standard, alternative fair trade labels, and a selection of fashion brands selling fair trade clothing.",
              "Describing an item of clothing as fair trade is often shorthand for saying that a product was ethically produced - in particular, that the workers who helped produce it had safer working conditions, fairer pay, and other workers' rights.",
              "Our Ethical Markets report showed that demand for fair trade products continues to grow - sales of fair trade products increased by nearly 14% between October 2019 and October 2020.",
              "However, since any company can describe a product as fair trade or fairly traded, it can be hard to know how meaningful the term is and whether buying clothing labelled as fair trade actually benefits workers.",
              "Fair trade is not a protected term (unlike for example organic - to be labelled \u2018organic\u2019 a product must be produced using at least 95% organically farmed ingredients, and the definition of organically farmed is defined by the government).",
              "As such, while the general idea of fair trade is fairer conditions for workers, in the fashion industry the term can be used loosely to mean a range of things.",
              "This creates ample opportunity for greenwashing - companies marketing clothing as ethical and fairly traded, when in fact they might not know (or care) about the conditions of workers who help make their clothes.",
              "Our Supply Chain Management rating helps consumers to know which companies are supporting the livelihoods of people making their clothes.",
              "Many companies with a best rating ensure the materials they use are fairly traded (even if they might not market their products as \u2018fair trade\u2019).",
              "Certification is the best way of ensuring that clothing is truly fair trade, making brands more accountable and assuring consumers that the extra cost associated with fair trade clothing is being used to ensure fair working conditions.",
              "If an item of clothing is certified by Fairtrade International (FI) it will often be referred to as Fairtrade (capital F) or in all caps (FAIRTRADE).",
              "While it does provide an indication, the spelling alone isn\u2019t enough to guarantee a product is FI certified so look for a clear statement saying who certifies it, or the Fairtrade logo, to make sure.",
              "FI has a global network of nearly two million farmers and workers and works in almost 80 countries.",
              "Around the globe countries have licensed the use of the Fairtrade Mark from Fairtrade International.",
              "The Fairtrade Foundation is the UK member of Fairtrade International.",
              "Fairtrade International certifies small farmers organised into cooperatives (these can be very large organisations, involving thousands of farmers.",
              "Kuapa Kokoo cocoa cooperative in Ghana, for example, has 100,000 members), and estates.",
              "It requires specific social, economic and environmental criteria to be met, and it sends inspectors occasionally to check that producers are compliant.",
              "Companies then source from these certified producers, paying a premium to the coop or estate for the assurance that someone's checking that what they buy is produced in more ethical conditions, and also paying the Fairtrade Minimum Price should the market price drop below it, which is there to protect producers from market fluctuations.",
              "Fairtrade International was formerly called the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation (FLO).",
              "FLOCERT is the leading certifier for Fairtrade products, so if a product has been certified by FLOCERT this means it is Fairtrade certified.",
              "Fairtrade International\u2019s \u2018Fairtrade Mark\u2019 - the blue, green and black icon of a person raising an arm (see above) - is the world\u2019s most recognisable fairtrade certification logo.",
              "If a garment features this original Fairtrade Mark (without any extra arrows, words, or different colours) then this means that all of its contents are certified by Fairtrade International.",
              "All of the ingredients or materials in the product are fully traceable - kept separate from non-certified products from field to shelf.",
              "There are however variations on this Fairtrade logo, which indicates that not everything in the product is certified - just some elements of it are.",
              "If you see the Fairtrade Mark with an arrow next to it, it means that all of the materials that can be sourced under Fairtrade conditions were done so (though it may contain some materials that Fairtrade International does not certify).",
              "To feature the Fairtrade Mark with an arrow the garment must have at least 20% certified Fairtrade content.",
              "If a product is certified under the Fairtrade Textile Standard then the whole piece of clothing must meet Fairtrade standards, including the cotton.",
              "This mark features the same Fairtrade logo but it is blue, green and white instead of blue, green and black.",
              "Next to the logo it says which components in a garment are sourced Fairtrade - for example, cotton.",
              "The component must be directly traceable through all stages of production and separated from non-Fairtrade cotton.",
              "So for example, 100% of the cotton used in the garment must be Fairtrade certified to feature this mark.",
              "Fairtrade International only provides certification for a limited number of products, materials and ingredients, and as such it is not always possible to get certification - some products just can\u2019t be certified.",
              "In these cases a company may choose to find its own way to source ethically.",
              "Positive alternatives to Fairtrade International certification may be listed on the World Fair Trade Organisation (WFTO) website or the British Association of Fair Trade Shops and Suppliers (BAFTS) website.",
              "According to the WTFO website, \u201cThrough peer-reviews and independent audits, WFTO verifies members are mission-led enterprises fully practicing the 10 Principles of Fair Trade across their business and supply chains.",
              "Once verified, all members have free use of the WFTO Guaranteed Fair Trade product label.",
              "\u201d BAFTS is a network of independent shops and suppliers that claim to be \u201cdedicated to promoting Fair Trade retail in the UK\u201d.",
              "Its members state that they adhere to the 10 Principles of Fair Trade laid out by the World Fair Trade Organisation (WFTO).",
              "Sometimes companies are not connected to any of these bodies.",
              "In these instances it is worth visiting their website.",
              "They should publish detailed information on their website about what steps they have taken to ensure their produce is fairly traded.",
              "Some companies create their own fair trade standards instead of Fairtrade International\u2019s certification.",
              "For example, Sainsbury\u2019s used to be the world\u2019s largest retailer of Fairtrade certified products but then in 2017 it decided to withdraw many of its products from certification and instead launched its own \u2018Fairly Traded\u2019 scheme.",
              "Fairtrade International highlighted the key issue of companies setting up their own fair trade schemes: \u201cFairtrade is a fully independent and transparent system supported by the third party organisation\u201d while \u201cSainsbury\u2019s Sustainability Standards are established by Sainsbury\u2019s, which means that Sainsbury\u2019s will in future carry responsibility for their implementation, review and performance\u201d.",
              "The obvious downside of companies creating their own fair trade standards is that they can decide what does and does not count as fair trade criteria (which may on occasion align more closely with corporate interests than workers\u2019 rights), and it will likely have a less independent third-party enforcement mechanism than established certifying bodies.",
              "There is a small overlap between organic and Fairtrade requirements.",
              "For example, organic farming can benefit farmers and workers who may otherwise suffer health impacts due to harmful chemicals in pesticides and herbicides.",
              "Organic certifications might also include some workers\u2019 rights requirements, such as The Soil Association, whose certification includes brief clauses on involuntary and child labour.",
              "Some major brands (such as Nobody\u2019s Child) say their cotton must be organic, Fairtrade, recycled, or Better Cotton Initiative certified, but don\u2019t specify what percentage is Fairtrade.",
              "Organic cotton is less risky in terms of workers\u2019 rights because it requires a physically certifiable supply chain, and recycled produce is less likely to be directly funding unethical practises too.",
              "However when it comes to workers\u2019 rights Fairtrade certification is the most robust.",
              "Fairtrade certification and explicit supply chain policies on the company website are much more likely to guarantee that workers\u2019 rights are respected than organic or other types of certification.",
              "If you want to buy fairly traded clothing, where should you look?",
              "In our guides to high street clothing and ethical clothing we highlight which brands specialise in or sell fair trade clothes.",
              "We've included more information about some of the companies below.",
              "People Tree sells a full range of clothes.",

              "This scheme looks right along the supply chain, from the growth of the initial crop to the manufacture of the final textile.",
              "It restricts the chemicals which can be used, puts requirements in place for waste-management, and ensures safe conditions for workers.",

              "Viscose is another big user of water, accounting for 21% of water usage by the textile industry.",
              "This is mainly down to its manufacturing process, which requires a lot of water to spin woody plant fibres into soft fabrics.",

              "Linen and hemp, for example, are plant-based fabrics which require less water than conventional cotton.",
              "Manmade fabrics like polyester and acrylic also use less water, although there are other issues with these textiles that we will discuss later on.",
              "You can also opt for organic cotton over conventional cotton.",
              "Not only does this avoid the use of harmful pesticides, but the labelling standards usually require growers to manage their water usage more carefully.",

              "Synthetic fibres, like polyester, have a larger carbon footprint than natural fibres like linen and hemp.",
              "Choosing organic clothing is one way to reduce the impact of your wardrobe, as organic labelling schemes like GOTS include requirements for managing energy usage to help manufacturers minimise their impact.",
              "The use of synthetic fertilisers can significantly contribute to carbon emissions too, so choosing organic avoids this issue.",
              "You can also opt for natural fibres over synthetic ones to reduce the carbon footprint of your clothing.",
              "Fabrics like polyester and acrylic are derived from petroleum and are more energy intensive to produce than natural fabrics.",
              "Even if this energy could be obtained from renewable sources, petroleum itself is a fossil fuel meaning it\u2019s always locked into these fabrics in some way.",

              "And retailers are also culpable, with unsold stock sent to incinerators without ever getting as far as our wardrobes.",
              "Very simply, choosing to buy fewer clothes is a good first step in reducing textile waste.",
              "By choosing better brands that focus on making quality clothing in styles that will suit your lifestyle for years to come, you can reduce the amount of clothing you end up discarding.",
              "When you do come to let your clothes go, making use of the thriving second-hand market might mean they can find a new home.",
              "If your clothes have reached the end of their lives, finding a way to repurpose the fabric (as cleaning cloths, for example, or maybe an alternative to wrapping paper) can keep them useful for a while longer.",
              "When it is time to discard them for good, send them to textile recycling instead of landfill.",
              "Some brands are also taking steps to address waste by partnering with recycling schemes to create a circular fashion system.",
              "Customers are encouraged to return their clothing to the brands to be recycled into new products.",
              "Making use of these take-back programmes can keep your clothes out of landfill and encourage other brands to get on board.",
              "Finally, close the loop by looking out for clothing made from recycled textile waste so that those discarded clothes can find a second life as fabulous new garments.",
              "Many countries now have a ban on plastic bags, but plastic packaging is still used by plenty of clothing retailers for online orders.",
              "Plastic packaging is also used by many distributors to protect clothes while en-route to our shops.",
              "Plus, plastic embellishments, zippers, and buttons are common and often end up in landfill.",

              "Microplastics are also a serious concern.",
              "Clothes made from synthetic fibres such as acrylic, polyester, and nylon can shed microfibres when they are washed.",
              "These end up polluting our waterways and washing into our oceans, where they can cause significant issues for marine life.",
              "Avoiding plastics altogether can be tricky but a good step when shopping online is to choose eco-friendly clothing brands that don\u2019t use plastic packaging for their deliveries.",
              "You can also try to minimise the plastic on the clothes themselves by choosing styles without lots of plastic embellishments.",
              "When it comes to microfibres, choosing natural fabrics is the best way to avoid these tiny pieces of plastic.",
              "Even polyester made from recycled plastic bottles will shed microfibres, so avoiding these petroleum-based materials altogether is best.",
              "For those that you already own, put clothes into a special washing bag when you do the laundry to reduce the number of fibres that escape into the water.",
              "The impact of the fashion industry on the environment can be severe.",
              "But the demand for cheap clothes also has implications for workers all along the supply chain.",
              "The need to produce high volumes of clothing at a low cost has unsurprisingly led to a number of human rights issues associated with the fashion industry.",
              "Low wages Many of our clothes are manufactured in poorer countries, where wages are low and the legal minimum wage falls a long way short of the actual living wage.",
              "Despite commitments by many fashion brands to ensure the workers who make their clothes are paid a fair wage, a 2020 report from the Clean Clothes Campaign and Fashion Checker surveyed 490 workers in 19 different factories and found that none were being paid a living wage.",
              "When they spoke with the brands who source their clothes from these factories, 100 out of 108 scored a rating of E on the living wage scale, meaning that none of the workers in their supply chains were paid enough to live on.",
              "None of the brands scored higher than a C, which indicates that 50% of workers are paid a living wage.",
              "Long working hours Low wages are often associated with long working hours since workers must do more hours in order to take home enough money to live.",
              "According to Common Objective, a networking organisation for the fashion industry, an average day for a garment worker might be 14.",
              "6 hours in China or 17.",

              "Unsafe working conditions In 2013, a factory collapse in Bangladesh brought global attention to the unsafe working conditions in many garment factories.",
              "Over a thousand people died and another 2000 were injured.",
              "Fires the year before in two factories in Pakistan and Bangladesh also highlighted the unsafe buildings that many clothes are made in.",
              "But the lack of safety doesn\u2019t stop with the buildings themselves.",
              "The Clean Clothes Campaign highlight the overcrowded conditions, lack of proper light and ventilation, and exposure to harmful chemicals experienced by many garment workers.",
              "Issues can start earlier in the supply chain too.",
              "Cotton pickers, for example, are regularly exposed to unsafe levels of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.",
              "Child labour The demand for cheap labour doesn\u2019t only affect the wellbeing of adult workers.",
              "Lack of regulation and transparency in supply chains has led to illegal child labour being used in all the steps of clothing production, from the harvesting of raw materials to the finishing of garments.",
              "Children working in the garment industry are often exposed to harmful chemicals, made to work long hours for low pay, and miss out on an education due to being at work instead of at school.",
              "Gender discrimination The workers involved in making our clothes are disproportionately female \u2013 approximately 80% of those employed by clothing factories are women.",
              "The Clean Clothes Campaign say this is a deliberate policy on the behalf of factory owners, who take advantage of cultural norms in countries where women are still seen as being subordinate to men.",
              "As well as working long hours for low pay, female garment workers are often denied maternity leave and can be subjected to gender-based harassment and violence.",
              "They are also more likely than men to shoulder the burden of childcare and other unpaid domestic labour on top of their long working hours.",
              "The complicated supply chains and lack of transparency involved in the fashion industry makes it difficult to be certain that the people who make our clothing have been fairly treated.",
              "Even brands struggle to know exactly where their clothes are made.",
              "Labelling schemes that include independent audits are the best way to know whether your clothes were made in working conditions that comply with the standards laid out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).",
              "Look out for clothes carrying the following labels: The fashion industry is a complex beast.",
              "The long supply chains make it a truly global enterprise and it can sometimes feel like there isn\u2019t much we, as consumers, can do to encourage the sustainable and responsible manufacture of our clothes.",

              "At a specific temperature, A will start to melt, but B will remain behind as a solid.",
