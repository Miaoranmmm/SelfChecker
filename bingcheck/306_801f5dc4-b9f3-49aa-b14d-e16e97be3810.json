    "response": "Hurling is a very ancient and traditional Irish sport that has been played for at least **3000 years**[^1^] [^3^] and has a strong connection to Irish mythology and culture. It is a field game played by two teams of **fifteen players** each, who use wooden sticks called **hurleys** to hit a small ball called a **sliotar** between the opponent's goalposts[^2^]. Hurling is considered as an **intrinsic part of Irish culture** and plays a central role in promoting health and wellbeing, inclusiveness and team spirit[^2^]. Hurling has also been inscribed on the **Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity** by UNESCO in 2018[^2^].\n\nHurling has a long and rich history that dates back to the **Bronze Age**[^3^] and features prominently in Irish legends, such as the story of **C\u00fa Chulainn**, a hero who killed a fierce guard dog by driving a hurling ball down its throat[^1^] [^2^]. Hurling was also seen as a form of martial training and a way of displaying bravery and skill in battle[^1^]. Hurling was outlawed by the Normans in the 12th century, but it survived and even flourished in some areas, especially in Munster[^1^]. Hurling was also played by the upper classes in the 19th century, but it bore little relation to the traditional game[^1^].\n\nHurling has evolved over time to become a more regulated and standardized sport, with the establishment of the **Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA)** in 1884 and the adoption of codified rules[^1^].

The most prestigious hurling tournament is the **All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship**, which attracts thousands of spectators and fans every year. Hurling is also played by women, who call it **camogie**, and by Irish diaspora communities around the world[^2^]. Hurling is a fast-paced, skillful and exciting game that showcases the best of Irish culture and heritage.",

              "Picture credit: Ray McManus / SPORTSFILE Hurling is one of the oldest field games in the world and is popular for at least 3000 years in Ireland with the first literary reference dating back to 1272 BC.",
              "Hurling is often referenced in Irish myths and legends, the most famous of which has to be the early account found in the Ta\u0301in Bo Cuailgne, a legendary tale from early Irish literature, which describes the exploits of the Ulster hero Cu\u0301 Chullainn, (literally Hound of Cullen) who was so named after killing a fierce guard dog by driving a hurling ball down its throat.",
              "Such stories often portray Hurling as a form of martial training and proficiency on the Hurling field was equated with skill in battle.",
              "Throughout the countryside, Hurling thrived as a wild and often violent practice with few set rules.",
              "One 17th century account describes the game as being played on a plain about 200-300 yards long, with victory going to the first team to drive the ball through the goal of the opponent.",
              "The Celtic legal system, the Brehon Laws, provided for compensation for hurling accidents and provisions were also made for cases of deliberate injury, or even death, as a result of Hurling.",
              "The game was outlawed in the 12th century after the occupation by the Normans, but it survived and even flourished up to the early 19th century mainly due to patronization by the landlords.",
              "By the time of the Great Famine of 1846 \u2013 49, Hurling had declined dramatically and was in danger of dying out completely but for a number of strongholds.",
              "However, Dublin Castle itself admitted that by the late 1850s, Hurling was being played all over Munster and records of the game survive in Donegal and Down and Kilkenny and Longford.",
              "There was much variation in the forms of the stick and ball games played in Ireland.",

              "There was also the Ioma\u0301n form of the Hurling that was regulated by the Killimor Daly rules of south Galway and the more obscure local rules drafted by James Maher of Tipperary before the famine.",
              "The 19th century saw a new version of Hurling, or hurley as it was referred to, become popular within the upper classes.",
              "A defining ten year period for Hurling was before the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1884.",
              "By 1879, there were at least six hurley clubs among the gentry in Dublin, and the Irish Hurley Union was founded in Trinity College.",
              "It was exclusively an upper-class preserve and bore little relation to traditional concepts of the game.",
              "During this period, the various forms of the game all metamorphosed into the first nationally codified sport of Hurling, which was in essence, the summer game of Leinster and the South.",
              "Cama\u0301n, the ground Hurling winter game which according to mid-nineteenth century accounts had been more widespread and popular within Ireland than its younger Hurling sibling, was to fade away, even in Ulster where it had been played for generations.",
              "A clareman named Michael Cusack had realised the need for common regulations and this inspired much of his thinking with regard to the formation of the GAA.",
              "In order to preserve the game of Hurling, Cusack had begun writing about its revival in 1882 in a newspaper *The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News *and in 1884 the GAA was founded to restore the Gaelic pastimes of old.",
              "Since the foundation of the GAA in 1884 and the introduction of a formal set of rules, the game of Hurling has evolved to the game we see today.",
              "The original core concept of man-on man (or woman-on-woman) contests for the ball within the defined framework of a positional game has been added to and eroded to varying degrees over time.",
              "The physical conditioning of the modern player has allowed him to move quickly into space to gain possession of the ball, in many cases uncontested, while a focus on maintaining possession has resulted in the movement of the ball in a more designed manner, giving clear advantage to a team mate.",
              "This latter trend has also resulted in the reduction in frequency of use of many of the less controllable skills of both games, for example, the overhead strike in Hurling, as the use of these may often lead to a more equal contest or the loss of possession altogether.",
              "The focus on maintaining possession once you have it has antagonistically resulted in the adoption of defensive tactics designed to concentrate players in front of the scoring area or around the ball when not in possession.",
              "While there is much debate about the value of such tactics to both games, modern coaches seek to position their players against opponents they perceive to have advantages over - whether in the contest or once in possession - maintaining the dramatic combat or duel concept of the games.",
              "All the while tactical innovation is sought from far and wide to overcome those of their opponents, and improve their team\u2019s chances of winning.",
              "Hurling has also been exposed to the influence of external sources, particularly through the international games played between Hurlers of Ireland and their Scottish Shinty counterparts.",
              "The game is played under \u2018compromise\u2019 rules agreed between the governing associations and provide an opportunity for players to represent their country in a series of international tests from time to time."

              "One of Ireland's native Gaelic games, it shares a number of features with Gaelic football, such as the field and goals, the number of players and much terminology.",
              "The same game played by women is called camogie (camo\u0301gai\u0301ocht), which shares a common Gaelic root.",
              "The objective of the game is for players to use an ash wood stick called a hurley (in Irish a cama\u0301n, pronounced /\u02c8k\u00e6m\u0259n/ or /k\u0259\u02c8m\u0254\u02d0n/) to hit a small ball called a sliotar /\u02c8\u0283l\u026at\u0259r/ between the opponent's goalposts either over the crossbar for one point or under the crossbar into a net guarded by a goalkeeper for three points.",
              "The sliotar can be caught in the hand and carried for not more than four steps, struck in the air or struck on the ground with the hurley.",
              "It can be kicked, or slapped with an open hand (the hand pass), for short-range passing.",
              "A player who wants to carry the ball for more than four steps has to bounce or balance the sliotar on the end of the stick (solo), and the ball can only be handled twice while in the player's possession.",
              "Provided that a player has at least one foot on the ground, he may make a shoulder-to-shoulder charge on an opponent who is in possession of the ball or is playing the ball, or when both players are moving in the direction of the ball.",
              "No protective padding is worn by players.",
              "A plastic protective helmet with a faceguard is mandatory for all age groups as of 2010.",

              "[citation needed] The following are considered technical fouls (\"fouling the ball\"): Can be deliberate or accidental, oftentimes accompanied by a card.",
              "They are as follows: Scoring is achieved by sending the sliotar between the opposition's goal posts.",
              "The posts, which are at each end of the field, are H posts as in rugby football but with a net under the crossbar as in football.",

              "A linesman or umpire is not permitted to inform the referee of technical fouls such as a \"third time in the hand\", where a player catches the ball for a third time in succession after soloing or an illegal pick up of the ball.",

              "The 19th century saw a new version of Hurling, or hurley as it was referred to, become popular within the upper classes.",
              "A defining ten year period for Hurling was before the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1884.",
              "By 1879, there were at least six hurley clubs among the gentry in Dublin, and the Irish Hurley Union was founded in Trinity College.",
              "It was exclusively an upper-class preserve and bore little relation to traditional concepts of the game.",
              "During this period, the various forms of the game all metamorphosed into the first nationally codified sport of Hurling, which was in essence, the summer game of Leinster and the South.",
              "Cama\u0301n, the ground Hurling winter game which according to mid-nineteenth century accounts had been more widespread and popular within Ireland than its younger Hurling sibling, was to fade away, even in Ulster where it had been played for generations.",
              "A clareman named Michael Cusack had realised the need for common regulations and this inspired much of his thinking with regard to the formation of the GAA.",
              "In order to preserve the game of Hurling, Cusack had begun writing about its revival in 1882 in a newspaper *The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News *and in 1884 the GAA was founded to restore the Gaelic pastimes of old.",
              "Since the foundation of the GAA in 1884 and the introduction of a formal set of rules, the game of Hurling has evolved to the game we see today.",
              "The original core concept of man-on man (or woman-on-woman) contests for the ball within the defined framework of a positional game has been added to and eroded to varying degrees over time.",
              "The physical conditioning of the modern player has allowed him to move quickly into space to gain possession of the ball, in many cases uncontested, while a focus on maintaining possession has resulted in the movement of the ball in a more designed manner, giving clear advantage to a team mate.",
              "This latter trend has also resulted in the reduction in frequency of use of many of the less controllable skills of both games, for example, the overhead strike in Hurling, as the use of these may often lead to a more equal contest or the loss of possession altogether.",
              "The focus on maintaining possession once you have it has antagonistically resulted in the adoption of defensive tactics designed to concentrate players in front of the scoring area or around the ball when not in possession.",
              "While there is much debate about the value of such tactics to both games, modern coaches seek to position their players against opponents they perceive to have advantages over - whether in the contest or once in possession - maintaining the dramatic combat or duel concept of the games.",
              "All the while tactical innovation is sought from far and wide to overcome those of their opponents, and improve their team\u2019s chances of winning.",
              "Hurling has also been exposed to the influence of external sources, particularly through the international games played between Hurlers of Ireland and their Scottish Shinty counterparts.",
              "The game is played under \u2018compromise\u2019 rules agreed between the governing associations and provide an opportunity for players to represent their country in a series of international tests from time to time."

              "If I have any criticism of this well-researched book, it would be a desire for more information on the early history of hurling.",
              "In recent times there has been no dearth of information on the history of hurling and hurlers of the present century;",
              "one thinks of the work done by people like Raymund Smith and Brendan Fullam.",
              "But only Brother O'Caithnia has delved into the early origins of hurling, and his monumental work has not been available outside the Irish language (Sceal na hlomana).",

              "It is fascinating to think that some form of hurling was already practiced here long before the Celts arrived on the shores of Ireland.",
              "The famous Statute of Kilkenny in 1366 banning \"the games which men call hurlings\" was passed in order to wean the Norman settlers away from the customary pastimes of the Irish Gael, in this case from a game from which (according to the Statute) \"great evils and injuries have arisen.\"",
              "They are exhorted to apply themselves to archery and the throwing of spears and other such gentle games!",
              "The author quotes from many sources to show that hurling was alive and flourishing in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.",
              "The landlords played an important role organising and supporting teams of their tenants to play against a team of a rival landlord.",
              "The games were well attended and there was heavy wagering, which often led to tensions and violence, As the political relationship between landlord and tenant soured in the 19th century, the landlord patronage of hurling ceased, leading to a decline in the game.",
              "Even though the basic ingredients of hurling were always the same, a caman, a sliotar, and the desire to get the ball into the opposite goal, yet hurling as we know it today is a very different game from what is was in the 18th century or early 19th century.",
              "The number of players was often far bigger than today (sometimes as many as fifty) and the ball was much bigger and heavier.",
              "In the early days no points were recognised.",
              "Even when points were introduced, a goal had no equivalent in points.",
              "In early times the goal was much narrower, no wider than the narrow goal used in ice-hockey today, but without any bar.",
              "The ball could not be struck through the goal, but had to be carried through it.",
              "Goalkeepers Were unnecessary, and points were unknown.",

              "There was a time in the evolution of the game when handling the ball was strictly forbidden.",
              "There was a great deal o' ground hurling, yet the weight and size of the ball would have made it a much slower game than the game we have known in this century.",
              "There was a great deal more physical contact.",
              "jostling and wrestling an opponent were not excluded.",
              "The early rules, in so far as they existed, permitted the assailant to wrestle the opponent in possession, and this may have been common up to 1886.",
              "No wonder that the author remarks on the many similarities to be found between this form of hurling and the rules of modern rugby!",
              "There may have been an even greater likeness to American Football, since there is evidence in some of the contemporary accounts of a kind of scrum or phalanx formed by the heavier men on the team, with the ball then being passed back quarter-back style, and then delivered out to the swifter lighter athletes on the wing.",
              "The playing field was much wider and longer in those days.",
              "I mentioned ice-hockey.",
              "Unlike field hockey, it is a game dstinguished by a great deal of body-charging and hip-to-hip contact.",
              "There is a belief among some (not mentioned by the author) that ice-hockey as played in Canada and the United States today may well have its remote origins in the kind of hurling once played on the plains of Ireland.",
              "I mentioned that the early games did not allow the handling of the ball.",
              "During the 19th century many Irish people migrated to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.",
              "They may have brought their game of hurling with them.",
              "In the' absence of suitable terrain, they played their game on the ice, and this was one of the major influences on the eventual evolution of ice-hockey as it is played today.",
              "The second section of the book begins with the story of the founding of the Gaelic Athletic Association, and the key roles played by Michael Cusack of Clare (resident in Dublin), Maurice Davin of Carrick-on-Suir, and Archbishop Croke of Thurles.",
              "He goes on the tell the story of early All-Irelands, which were all club or parish based, and only grew into full county selections over a few decades.",

              "Seamus King's book goes on to range over a century of hurling, concentrating on the senior hurling championship and the counties and outstanding players who graced this major competition.",
              "For any keen follower of the GAA over the years it makes compelling reading.",
              "The author is at his best when dealing with Tipperary's triumphs;",
              "it is easy to see that he has an inside track and speaks with great affection and esteem of the great teams and heroes of his native county.",
              "But he is generous too in his appraisal of the great teams and great hurlers of other counties.",
              "Of Christy Ring he says that he is accepted as the greatest hurler ever, and that his likes will not be seen again.",
              "Not all Limerick people would agree!",
              "With some justification they might propose Mick Mackey as the more complete hurler and sportsman with a dash and elan uniquely his own.",
              "Of course Christy Ring had the advantage of a much longer playing career spanning twenty four years from 1939 to 1963.",
              "But he wasn't approaching his 51st birthday in the Munster final of 1961 as the book states in one of its rare misprints (page 144).",
              "If true,it might help to explain Tipp's easy victory in Limerick on a day which saw the biggest attendance ever at a hurling match outside Croke Park (62,000).",
              "Of course Christy Ring's name and fame would have been further enhanced by the voice of Micheal O'Hehir who began broadcasting in the very year that Christy Ring embarked on his long inter-county career with Cork.",
              "Micheal is mentioned a few times in passing in the book, but his recent death and the tributes paid to him remind us of the pride of place this great man should occupy in any history of the GAA and particularly of hurling which was his first love.",
              "The popularity of hurling today must owe so much to Micheal and the excitement he generated in the heart of many a youngster listening to the Radio and Tele\u00advision over half a century.",
              "Seamus King finished his book with interesting chapters on the \"geography of hurling\" and hurling styles, and a final chapter on the \"future of hurling\" in an age that has seen the creeping profession-alism of all sport.",
              "All three chapters make compelling reading.",
              "The book is generously illustrated with 64 pages of photographs ranging over a century of the game, further enhancing a book that is attractively produced.",
              "I trust there will be a paper-back edition in due course to help make the book more widely known.",
              "Further editions might note that the victorious Limerick captain of the Munster final of 1980 is Sean Foley and not Joe McKenna as stated in the caption to the photograph.",
              "A Kerry neighbour in BalIyfermot, tells me that Ned Barrett of BalIyduff (who appears in the early series of photographs) did accomplish the unique feat of winning an All Ireland hurling medal and an Olympic gold medal.",
              "He was an all round sportsman, competing in the Olympics in many events;",
              "wrestling, shot-put, discus and javelin.",
              "But it was not in these that he won the gold medal, but with the United Kingdom tug-of-war team!",
              "The author is to be complimented for the extraordinary amount of research he has put into this book.",
              "It is a fascinating account of the story of hurling.",
              "Despite the inevitable detail of many names and scores, the writing is never dull.",
              "For me it evoked many memories especially of the fifties when I had the honour of playing against the great teams of that era, Wexford and the Rackard brothers (Billly has now added a book to the burgeoning library of hurling memories), a great Cork team won 3 All-lrelands in a row, and one of there greatest of Tipperary teams in the making.",
              "Elsewhere in the book the author discusses the different styles of close-in free taking of the experts on those teams: Nicky Rackard, Christy Ring and Paddy Kenny.",
              "It was pretty scary facing any of them when they lined up and you sensed they were going for a goal.",

              "Hurling is often referenced in Irish myths and legends, the most famous of which has to be the early account found in the Ta\u0301in Bo Cuailgne, a legendary tale from early Irish literature, which describes the exploits of the Ulster hero Cu\u0301 Chullainn, (literally Hound of Cullen) who was so named after killing a fierce guard dog by driving a hurling ball down its throat.",
              "Such stories often portray Hurling as a form of martial training and proficiency on the Hurling field was equated with skill in battle.",
              "Throughout the countryside, Hurling thrived as a wild and often violent practice with few set rules.",
              "One 17th century account describes the game as being played on a plain about 200-300 yards long, with victory going to the first team to drive the ball through the goal of the opponent.",
              "The Celtic legal system, the Brehon Laws, provided for compensation for hurling accidents and provisions were also made for cases of deliberate injury, or even death, as a result of Hurling.",
              "The game was outlawed in the 12th century after the occupation by the Normans, but it survived and even flourished up to the early 19th century mainly due to patronization by the landlords.",
              "By the time of the Great Famine of 1846 \u2013 49, Hurling had declined dramatically and was in danger of dying out completely but for a number of strongholds.",
              "However, Dublin Castle itself admitted that by the late 1850s, Hurling was being played all over Munster and records of the game survive in Donegal and Down and Kilkenny and Longford.",
              "There was much variation in the forms of the stick and ball games played in Ireland.",
              "There was the cross country scuaib in Clare and South Galway.",
              "The Cama\u0301n (anglicized to commons) game was played due north of the Dublin Galway railway line and epicentred in Ulster\u2019s communal heartlands.",
              "There was also the Ioma\u0301n form of the Hurling that was regulated by the Killimor Daly rules of south Galway and the more obscure local rules drafted by James Maher of Tipperary before the famine.",
              "The 19th century saw a new version of Hurling, or hurley as it was referred to, become popular within the upper classes.",
              "A defining ten year period for Hurling was before the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1884.",
              "By 1879, there were at least six hurley clubs among the gentry in Dublin, and the Irish Hurley Union was founded in Trinity College.",
              "It was exclusively an upper-class preserve and bore little relation to traditional concepts of the game.",
              "During this period, the various forms of the game all metamorphosed into the first nationally codified sport of Hurling, which was in essence, the summer game of Leinster and the South.",
              "Cama\u0301n, the ground Hurling winter game which according to mid-nineteenth century accounts had been more widespread and popular within Ireland than its younger Hurling sibling, was to fade away, even in Ulster where it had been played for generations.",
              "A clareman named Michael Cusack had realised the need for common regulations and this inspired much of his thinking with regard to the formation of the GAA.",
              "In order to preserve the game of Hurling, Cusack had begun writing about its revival in 1882 in a newspaper *The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News *and in 1884 the GAA was founded to restore the Gaelic pastimes of old.",
              "Since the foundation of the GAA in 1884 and the introduction of a formal set of rules, the game of Hurling has evolved to the game we see today.",
              "The original core concept of man-on man (or woman-on-woman) contests for the ball within the defined framework of a positional game has been added to and eroded to varying degrees over time.",
              "The physical conditioning of the modern player has allowed him to move quickly into space to gain possession of the ball, in many cases uncontested, while a focus on maintaining possession has resulted in the movement of the ball in a more designed manner, giving clear advantage to a team mate.",
              "This latter trend has also resulted in the reduction in frequency of use of many of the less controllable skills of both games, for example, the overhead strike in Hurling, as the use of these may often lead to a more equal contest or the loss of possession altogether.",
              "The focus on maintaining possession once you have it has antagonistically resulted in the adoption of defensive tactics designed to concentrate players in front of the scoring area or around the ball when not in possession.",
              "While there is much debate about the value of such tactics to both games, modern coaches seek to position their players against opponents they perceive to have advantages over - whether in the contest or once in possession - maintaining the dramatic combat or duel concept of the games.",
              "All the while tactical innovation is sought from far and wide to overcome those of their opponents, and improve their team\u2019s chances of winning.",
              "Hurling has also been exposed to the influence of external sources, particularly through the international games played between Hurlers of Ireland and their Scottish Shinty counterparts.",
              "The game is played under \u2018compromise\u2019 rules agreed between the governing associations and provide an opportunity for players to represent their country in a series of international tests from time to time."

              "On Saturday, the annual Hurling Classic brings the Irish sport to US audiences once more, but this time in New York City.",
              "So what is this ancient sport that's finding new popularity in America, asks Patrick Redmond?",
              "Long ago, they say a young Irish boy found himself cornered by a ferocious guard dog.",
              "Armed with only a ball and a bronze stick - a hurley - the boy fought back, throwing the ball down the beast's throat before killing it with his stick.",
              "When the dog's master, Culann, hears what has happened, the dutiful child swears to replace the guard dog himself.",
              "And thus, with a hurley in hand, Culann's hound, Cu\u0301 Chulainn, the warrior-hero of Irish folklore was born.",
              "Today, hurling - the field game played by Cu\u0301 Chulainn - is one of Ireland's two major national sports.",
              "Its history stretches even beyond folklore to the Tailteann Games, the \"Irish Olympics,\" initiated in 1600BC almost 1,000 years before the Greek version began.",
              "It is for many the original sporting art.",
              "And sometimes, to paraphrase Ernest Hemingway, an art where the artist is in danger of death.",
              "Hurling still epitomises the Irish warrior of old.",
              "When the legend of Cu\u0301 Chulainn was rewritten in 1894, Ireland was in the midst of a \"Gaelic revival\" which would lead ultimately to a violent push for independence.",
              "The strength and fitness of Ireland's young men was important, and the formation 10 years previously of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884, which standardised the rules to the modern hurling game, would play a crucial role in Irish muscular nationalism.",
              "The poet Brian na Banban encapsulated this in his poem The Irish Hurling men, which was even used in an advert for sportswear in 1916: When comes the day, as come it must That England's rule of greed and lust Shall lie, all broken, in the dust We'll still have the Irish Hurling Men.",
              "This Saturday, the Hurling Classic - Fenway Sports Management (FSM) annual tournament to bring the sport to new audiences in the US - moves from Boston's iconic Fenway Park to Citi Field, home of MLB's New York Mets.",
              "The top four counties from this year's All-Ireland Senior Hurling competition will be participating in the Classic.",
              "In the Big Apple, FSM will be showcasing the sport to many first-time viewers, having already hosted three successful tournaments in Boston that attracted over 30,000 spectators.",
              "\"We're aiming to replicate that success in New York and hope to introduce hurling to new audiences and generate more interest in the sport,\" FSM spokesman Mark Lev told the BBC.",
              "Reigning champions Limerick will take on Wexford, while Kilkenny and Tipperary re-enact this year's All-Ireland final.",
              "Winners of both games will meet for the title.",
              "How to get into hurling For the American hurler, the game provides a level almost equal to that in Ireland.",
              "There are five senior teams in New York, and 27-year-old hurler Tommy Kavanagh says the competition \"is pretty good\".",
              "\"The majority of the American-born players' parents were born in Ireland, and their skill set would be at 17 or 18 as good as any 17 or 18-year-old in Ireland,\" says Kavanagh, who hails from Borrisoleigh, near Thurles, County Tipperary.",
              "Kavanagh came to New York three years ago and currently works in recruitment.",
              "He plays for the Tipperary club, founded in the early 1890s as the Kickhams, before changing its name in 1904 when the Irish Counties Athletics Union (ICAU), the forerunner of the NYGAA, organised New York's GAA clubs along country lines.",
              "\"Anyone that emigrates, either to the US or the UK, that has played hurling, once they arrive in a new location, their first port of call is to join a local club, and to try and meet similar people to yourself,\" Kavanagh explains.",
              "More importantly, hurling is a key part of Kavanagh's Irish identity and with keeping connected with Ireland: \"Just because you move to a new country doesn't mean you stop playing the game.\"",
              "Being a hurler in New York can provoke curiosity.",
              "\"Hurling is the national game of Ireland.",
              "If you carry a hurley down the street, people are very inquisitive to know what's the game, and what is that bat.",
              "I have that sense of spreading the game.\"",
              "If the Hurling Classic is new to New York City, the game certainly is not.",
              "Hurling was recorded as far back as 1772, brought by Irish soldiers in the British Army.",
              "There was even an early form of \"Ice Hurling\" played on Collect Pond, where Chinatown is now located.",
              "As the Irish poured into America in the wake of the famine, the sport became an important part of Irish-American life.",
              "New York's Irish Hurling and Football Club was established in 1857, and clubs were soon set up from Boston to San Francisco.",
              "With the opening of the Irish-American Athletic Club's (I-AAC) Celtic Park in 1898, Gaelic sports had its first permanent home in the city.",
              "At times hurling held a great fascination for the American sporting press.",
              "The Baltimore Sun of 12 December, 1912 described it as a sport \"adapted to the impetuous temperament of the Gaels\", with players \"who rush in entirely oblivious of danger\".",
              "But by the early 1920s, following the demise of the I-AAC, Celtic Park declined into a bootlegger's paradise.",
              "In response the New York GAA opened its current home, Innisfail Park (now called Gaelic Park) in the Bronx in 1928, though they would often entertain Irish visitors at bigger venues such as at Yankee Stadium where 40,000 fans watched Limerick beat New York at hurling in 1936.",
              "By the late 1960s, New York hurlers were competing with the best Ireland could provide, beating the 1969 All-Ireland champions Kilkenny in a Hurling \"World Cup\" final over two games.",
              "In the past, the GAA has been criticised for putting as much effort into preventing people playing hurling - through bans on British military and police in Northern Ireland - as it does into encouraging participation.",
              "That ban had been in place for almost 100 years but was lifted in 2002 and police officers in Northern Ireland and a British Army regiment subsequently formed GAA teams. Recent success stories of the growth of Gaelic Football outside the Irish diaspora, like at St Paul's Academy in South-East London, or the phenomenal growth in Galicia, Spain, have been the result of individual efforts rather than from the GAA itself.",
              "So, who is the Hurling Classic targeted at - the Irish in America, or everyone?",
              "Kavanagh is quick to agree that while the Irish and their descendants are key fellow participants in the US, it's only half the story.",
              "\"On the outside of that, there's a huge pick-up over the last couple of years collegially, with colleges all over America taking up hurling.",
              "A lot of their players would have no connection to Ireland.\"",
              "Since 2011, the US National Collegiate Gaelic Athletic Association has held a hurling championship.",
              "None of the winners - including the University of Montana with four titles - are the Catholic universities Irish-Americans have traditionally attended.",
              "\"There are a lot of things to appeal to Americans,\" Kavanagh enthuses.",
              "\"It's similar to lacrosse, it is in the skill category of ice hockey, it's high scoring like a lot of their sports.\"",
              "He understands that hurling is not an easy sport to take up, and that the small-parish feel of GAA clubs is sadly lacking in the US.",
              "But building a sense of community is why Kavanagh still thinks Americans should take an interest in hurling.",
              "\"Once you leave college here there seems so little for 27 or 28-year-olds of that small local sporting club ethos you get with hurling in Ireland.",
              "This could appeal to many of them.\"",

              "The final, formerly held in September, then August and now controversially moved to July, is the culmination of a series of games played during July and August, with the winning team receiving the Liam MacCarthy Cup.",

              "The All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship final was listed in second place by CNN in its \"10 sporting events you have to see live\", after the Olympic Games.",
              "[1] Following the foundation of the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1884, new rules for Gaelic football and hurling were drawn up and published in the United Irishman newspaper.",
              "In 1886, county committees began to be established, with several counties affiliating over the next few years.",
              "The GAA ran its inaugural All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship in 1887.",
              "The decision to establish that first championship was influenced by several factors.",
              "Firstly, inter-club contests in 1885 and 1886 were wildly popular and began to draw huge crowds.",
              "Clubs started to travel across the country to play against each other and these matches generated intense interest as the newspapers began to speculate which teams might be considered the best in the country.",
              "Secondly, although the number of clubs was growing, many were slow to affiliate to the Association, leaving it short of money.",
              "Establishing a central championship held the prospect of enticing GAA clubs to process their affiliations, just as the establishment of the FA Cup had done much in the 1870s to promote the development of the Football Association in England.",
              "The championships were open to all affiliated clubs who would first compete in county-based competitions, to be run by local county committees.",
              "The winners of each county championship would then proceed to represent that county in the All-Ireland series.",
              "[2] The inaugural All-Ireland Championship used, for the only time in its history, an open draw format without the provincial series of games.",
              "All of the existing county boards were eligible to enter a team, however, only six chose to do so.",
              "Disputes in Cork and Limerick over which club should represent the county resulted in neither county fielding a team.",
              "Dublin later withdrew from the championship.",
              "In all five teams participated: Clare (Garraunboy Smith O'Briens), Galway (Meelick), Kilkenny (Tullaroan) Tipperary (Thurles) and Wexford (Castlebridge).",

              "Postponements, disqualifications, objections, withdrawals and walkovers were regular occurrences during the initial years of the championship.",
              "The inaugural All-Ireland final took place on 1 April 1888 in Birr, County Offaly, with Tipperary defeating Galway to take the title.",
              "[3][4][5] The provincial championships were introduced in 1888 in Munster, Leinster, Connacht and Ulster on a knock-out basis.",
              "The winners of the provincial finals participated in the All-Ireland semi-finals.",
              "Over time the Leinster and Munster teams grew to become the superpowers of the game, as Gaelic football was the more dominant sport in Ulster and Connacht.",
              "After some time Galway became the only credible team in Connacht and was essentially given an automatic pass to the All-Ireland semi-final every year.",
              "This knock-out system persisted for over 100 years and was considered to be the fairest system as the All-Ireland champions would always be the only undefeated team of the year.",
              "Unlike in other European countries, such as neighbouring England, where annual sports events were cancelled during the twentieth century due to the First and Second World Wars, the All-Ireland Championship has been running continuously since 1887, with the final running since 1889 (the 1888 competition was played but no final was held due to the Invasion).",
              "The competition continued even in spite of the effects on the country of the Civil War and the Second World War (the National Hurling League was not held during the latter).",
              "In 1941, the All-Ireland Championship was disrupted by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.",
              "[6] The duration of certain championship matches increased from 60 to 80 minutes during the 1970s.",
              "They were settled at 70 minutes after five seasons of this in 1975.",
              "[7] This applied only to the provincial finals, All-Ireland semi-finals and finals.",
              "[8] In the mid-1990s the Gaelic Athletic Association looked at developing a new system whereby a defeat in the championship for certain teams would not mean an immediate exit from the Championship.",
              "In the 1997 championship the first major change in format arrived when the 'back-door system' was introduced.",
              "This new structure allowed the defeated Munster and Leinster finalists another chance to regain a place in the All-Ireland semi-finals.",
              "Tipperary and Kilkenny were the first two teams to benefit from the new system when they defeated Down and Galway respectively in the quarter-finals.",
              "The All-Ireland final in the first year of this new experiment was a replay of the Munster final with Clare defeating Tipperary.",
              "The first team to win the All-Ireland through the 'back-door' was Offaly in 1998, winning a replay of the Leinster final by beating Kilkenny 2\u201316 to 1\u201313.",
              "The new \"back-door system\" proved successful and was expanded over the following years.",
              "The 2005 Championship saw even bigger changes in the \"back-door\" or qualifier system.",
              "The Munster and Leinster champions and defeated finalists automatically qualified for the new quarter-final stages, while two groups of four other teams played in a league format to fill the vacant four places in the quarter-finals.",
              "Many criticised the structure for not being a real championship at all, for degrading the Munster and Leinster championships and for penalising the strongest teams. 2008 brought a change to the competition format, whereby the team that won the Leinster and Munster championships advanced to the All-Ireland semi-finals, and the losers of the provincial finals advanced to two quarter-finals.",
              "A series of knockout qualifiers for the remaining teams decided which other two teams would reach the quarter-finals.",
              "The updated qualifier structure provided more games and gave renewed hope to the \"weaker\" teams, as a defeat in the first round no longer meant the end of a county's All-Ireland ambitions.",
