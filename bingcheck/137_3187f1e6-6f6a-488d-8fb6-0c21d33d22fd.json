    "query": "What is the history and cultural significance behind the traditional dance form, Bharatanatyam, and how has it evolved over time to become one of the most popular classical dance styles in India and beyond?",
    "response": "Bharatanatyam is a classical dance form that originated in the Hindu temples of Tamil Nadu and neighbouring areas[^1^]. It is one of the oldest and most popular forms of Indian classical dance, and is regarded as the mother of many other dance forms[^1^]. It is a dance that expresses Hindu religious themes and spiritual ideas through gestures, footwork and facial expressions[^1^].\n\nThe history of Bharatanatyam can be traced back to the ancient Sanskrit text 'Natya Shastra', written by the sage Bharata Muni, which is considered the foundation of all Indian classical dances[^1^]. According to legend, Lord Brahma revealed Bharatanatyam to Bharata Muni, who then encoded it in the 'Natya Shastra'[^1^]. The name Bharatanatyam is derived from the combination of 'Bharata' and 'Natyam', where 'Bharata' is a mnemonic for 'bhava' (emotion), 'raga' (melody) and 'tala' (rhythm), and 'Natyam' means dance[^1^].\n\nBharatanatyam was traditionally performed by female temple dancers called 'devadasis', who dedicated their lives to worshiping the gods through dance[^2^]. However, with the decline of temple patronage and the rise of colonialism, Bharatanatyam faced social stigma and suppression in the 19th and early 20th centuries[^2^] [^4^]. It was revived and popularized by visionary artists like Rukmini Devi Arundale, Balasaraswati, E. Krishna Iyer and others, who reformed the dance form and brought it to the stage and the wider audience[^2^] [^4^].\n\nBharatanatyam has evolved over time to incorporate elements from other dance forms, such as Kathakali, Odissi and folk dances[^3^]. It has also adapted to changing social contexts and artistic preferences, while retaining its core principles and aesthetics[^3^]. Today, Bharatanatyam is performed by both male and female dancers, from different regions, religions and backgrounds. It is also taught and practiced all over the world, as a form of cultural expression and heritage[^2^] [^3^].\n\nBharatanatyam is a rich and complex dance form that reflects the history and culture of India. It is a dance that celebrates the beauty, grace and spirituality of human movement. I hope this answer has given you some insight into this fascinating art form.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "A\u0302 History & Evolution According to the Hindu tradition the name of the dance form was derived by joining two words, a\u0302\u0080\u0098Bharataa\u0302\u0080\u0099 and Natyama\u0302\u0080\u0099 where a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natyam in Sanskrit means dance and a\u0302\u0080\u0098Bharataa\u0302\u0080\u0099 is a mnemonic comprising a\u0302\u0080\u0098bhaa\u0302\u0080\u0099, a\u0302\u0080\u0098raa\u0302\u0080\u0099 and a\u0302\u0080\u0098taa\u0302\u0080\u0099 which respectively means a\u0302\u0080\u0098bhavaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 that is emotion and feelings;",

              "and a\u0302\u0080\u0098talaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 that is rhythm.",
              "Thus, traditionally the word refers to a dance form where bhava, raga and tala are expressed.",
              "The theoretical base of this dance form, which is also referred as Sadir, trace back to ancient Indian theatrologist and musicologist, Bharata Munia\u0302\u0080\u0099s Sanskrit Hindu text on the performing arts called a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natya Shastraa\u0302\u0080\u0099.",
              "The texta\u0302\u0080\u0099s first complete version was presumably completed between 200 BCE to 200 CE, however such timeframe also varies between 500 BCE and 500 CE.",
              "According to legends Lord Brahma revealed Bharatanatyam to the sage Bharata who then encoded this holy dance form in Natya Shastra.",
              "The text that consists of thousands of verses structured in different chapters divides dance in two specific forms, namely a\u0302\u0080\u0098nritaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 that is pure dance comprising of finesse of hand movements and gestures, and a\u0302\u0080\u0098nrityaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 that is solo expressive dance that comprises of expressions.",
              "According to Russian scholar Natalia Lidova, a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natya Shastraa\u0302\u0080\u0099 elucidates several theories of Indian classical dances including that of Tandava dance, standing postures, basic steps, bhava, rasa, methods of acting and gestures.",
              "One of the five great epics of Tamil Literature, a\u0302\u0080\u0098Silappatikarama\u0302\u0080\u0099 (~2nd century CE) has a direct reference to this dance form.",
              "The Shiva temple of Kanchipuram that is decorated with carvings dating back to a period between 6th to 9th centuries CE manifests the development of this dance form by around the mid first millennium CE.",
              "Many ancient Hindu temples are embellished with sculptures of Lord Shiva in Bharatanatyam dance poses.",
              "The eastern gopuram of the 12th century Thillai Natarajar Temple, Chidambaram, of Tamil Nadu dedicated to Lord Shiva bears sculptures depicting 108 poses of Bharatanatyam, referred as karanas in a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natya Shastraa\u0302\u0080\u0099, that are intricately carved in small rectangular panels.",
              "Another notable sculpture can be seen in the Cave 1 of Karnatakaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s Badami cave temples dating back to the 7th century where a 5 feet tall sculpture of Lord Shiva is depicted as Nataraja doing Tandava dance.",
              "The 18 arms of the Shiva sculpture expresses mudras or hand gestures that are part of Bharatanatyam.",
              "Association with Devadasi Culture Originating in Hindu temples of Tamil Nadu and nearby regions, Bharatanatyam soon prospered in other South Indian temples.",
              "According to some sources the Devadasi culture dating back to 300 BCE to 300 CE evolved under the auspices of the royals that saw the temple dancers called Devadasis, who were dedicated to serve the Lord as dasis or servants, performing the dance form.",
              "Eventually the Devadasi culture became an integral part of rituals in South Indian temples.",
              "Although ancient texts and sculptures indicate existence of such culture and presence of dancing girls as also exclusive quarters for women in temple compound, there is no concrete evidence either archaeological or text-based that can manifest A\u0302 the Devadasis as prostitutes or courtesans as accused by some colonial Indologists.",
              "After analysing evidences, Davesh Soneji, a historian on performance arts and an expert on Bharatanatyam, concluded that courtesan dancing phenomenon commenced during the Nayaka period of Tamil Nadu sometime around late 16th or 17th century.",
              "Opposition & Ban During Colonial Rule The 18th century saw emergence of rule of the East India Company followed by setting up of British colonial rule in the 19th century.",
              "Such developments saw decline of various classical dance forms which were subjected to contemptuous fun and discouragement including Bharatanatyam that through the 19th century remained exclusive to Hindu temples.",
              "Eventually social and economic conditions associated with Devadasi culture added with contempt and despicable attitude from the Christian missionaries and British officials, who held the Devadasis of South India and nautch girls of North India as harlots, disgraced such systems. Furthermore the Christian missionaries launched anti-dance movement in 1892 to stop such practice.",
              "The Madras Presidency under the British colonial government banned the custom of dancing in Hindu temples in 1910 and with this the age-old tradition of performing Bharatanatyam in Hindu temples also came to an end.",
              "RevivalA\u0302 The Indian community disapproved such ban.",
              "The Tamilians were worried that such a rich and ancient custom of Hindu temple dancing was getting persecuted on the pretext of social reform.",
              "Many classical art revivalists like Indian lawyer, freedom-fighter, activist and classical artist E.",
              "Krishna Iyer questioned such discrimination.",
              "Iyer who became involved with the Bharatanatyam revival movement was incarcerated on charges of nationalism and imprisoned.",
              "During his prison term he convinced the political prisoners to advocate for this age-old classical dance form.",
              "A\u0302 Iyer founded the a\u0302\u0080\u0098Madras Music Academya\u0302\u0080\u0099 and along with Indian theosophist, dancer and Bharatanatyam choreographer Rukmini Devi Arundale, he strived to save Bharatanatyam from dying out.",
              "Despite the fact that Hindu temple dances were being suppressed due to laws enforced by the colonial British government, many artists like American dancer Esther Sherman came from the West to learn Indian classical dance forms. She came to India in 1930 and not only learnt classical dances but also adopted the name Ragini Devi and became a part of the ancient dance arts revival movement.",
              "As the Indian freedom movement progressed steadily during the early 20th century, an effort to revive Indian culture and tradition seethed with excitement among Indians.",
              "Eminent Bharatanatyam dancers like Arundale and Balasaraswati expanded the dance form out of Hindu temples and established it as a mainstream dance form.",
              "Later the Tamil Hindu migrants revived this Hindu temple dancing custom in British Tamil temples during the late 20th century.",
              "Today this ancient classical dance form also includes technical performances as also non-religious and fusion based themes.",
              "Repertoire The repertoire of this performance art are categorized into three brackets namely a\u0302\u0080\u0098Nrittaa\u0302\u0080\u0099, a\u0302\u0080\u0098Nrityaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 and a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natyaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 mentioned in a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natya Shastraa\u0302\u0080\u0099 and followed by all major Indian classical dance forms. a\u0302\u0080\u0098Nrittaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 is a technical performance where the dancer presents pure Bharata Natyam movements emphasising on speed, form, pattern, range and rhythmic aspects without any form of enactment or interpretive aspect.",
              "In a\u0302\u0080\u0098Nrityaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 the dancer communicates a story, spiritual themes, message or feelings through expressive gestures and slower body movements harmonised with musical notes.",
              "a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natyama\u0302\u0080\u0099 is usually performed by a group or in some cases by a solo dancer who maintains certain body movements for certain characters of the play which is communicated through dance-acting.",
              "The dance form typically comprises of certain sections performed in sequence namely Alarippu, Jatiswaram, Shabdam, Varnam, Padam and Thillana.",
              "Costumes The style of dressing of a Bharatanatyam dancer is more or less similar to that of a Tamil Hindu bride.",
              "She wears a gorgeous tailor-made sari that consists of a cloth specially stitched in pleats that falls in the front from the waist and when the dancer performs spectacular footwork that include stretching or bending her knees, the cloth widens up like a hand fan.",
              "The sari worn in a special manner is well complimented with traditional jewellery that include the ones that adorn her head, nose, ear and neck and vivid face make-up specially highlighting her eyes so that audience can view her expressions properly.",
              "Her hair neatly plaited in conventional way is often beautified with flowers.",
              "A jewellery belt adorns her waist while musical anklets called ghunghru made of leather straps with small metallic bells attached to it are wrapped in her ankles.",
              "Her feet and fingers are often brightened with henna colour so as to highlight gestures of her hands.",
              "Instruments & MusicA\u0302 The Bharatnatyam dancer is accompanied by a nattuvanar (or taladhari) that is a vocalist who generally conducts the whole performance, a part often executed by the guru.",

              "The verses recited during performance are in Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu.",

              "The texta\u0302\u0080\u0099s first complete version was presumably completed between 200 BCE to 200 CE, however such timeframe also varies between 500 BCE and 500 CE.",
              "According to legends Lord Brahma revealed Bharatanatyam to the sage Bharata who then encoded this holy dance form in Natya Shastra.",
              "The text that consists of thousands of verses structured in different chapters divides dance in two specific forms, namely a\u0302\u0080\u0098nritaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 that is pure dance comprising of finesse of hand movements and gestures, and a\u0302\u0080\u0098nrityaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 that is solo expressive dance that comprises of expressions.",
              "According to Russian scholar Natalia Lidova, a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natya Shastraa\u0302\u0080\u0099 elucidates several theories of Indian classical dances including that of Tandava dance, standing postures, basic steps, bhava, rasa, methods of acting and gestures.",
              "One of the five great epics of Tamil Literature, a\u0302\u0080\u0098Silappatikarama\u0302\u0080\u0099 (~2nd century CE) has a direct reference to this dance form.",
              "The Shiva temple of Kanchipuram that is decorated with carvings dating back to a period between 6th to 9th centuries CE manifests the development of this dance form by around the mid first millennium CE.",
              "Many ancient Hindu temples are embellished with sculptures of Lord Shiva in Bharatanatyam dance poses.",
              "The eastern gopuram of the 12th century Thillai Natarajar Temple, Chidambaram, of Tamil Nadu dedicated to Lord Shiva bears sculptures depicting 108 poses of Bharatanatyam, referred as karanas in a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natya Shastraa\u0302\u0080\u0099, that are intricately carved in small rectangular panels.",
              "Another notable sculpture can be seen in the Cave 1 of Karnatakaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s Badami cave temples dating back to the 7th century where a 5 feet tall sculpture of Lord Shiva is depicted as Nataraja doing Tandava dance.",
              "The 18 arms of the Shiva sculpture expresses mudras or hand gestures that are part of Bharatanatyam.",
              "Association with Devadasi Culture Originating in Hindu temples of Tamil Nadu and nearby regions, Bharatanatyam soon prospered in other South Indian temples.",
              "According to some sources the Devadasi culture dating back to 300 BCE to 300 CE evolved under the auspices of the royals that saw the temple dancers called Devadasis, who were dedicated to serve the Lord as dasis or servants, performing the dance form.",
              "Eventually the Devadasi culture became an integral part of rituals in South Indian temples.",
              "Although ancient texts and sculptures indicate existence of such culture and presence of dancing girls as also exclusive quarters for women in temple compound, there is no concrete evidence either archaeological or text-based that can manifest A\u0302 the Devadasis as prostitutes or courtesans as accused by some colonial Indologists.",
              "After analysing evidences, Davesh Soneji, a historian on performance arts and an expert on Bharatanatyam, concluded that courtesan dancing phenomenon commenced during the Nayaka period of Tamil Nadu sometime around late 16th or 17th century.",
              "Opposition & Ban During Colonial Rule The 18th century saw emergence of rule of the East India Company followed by setting up of British colonial rule in the 19th century.",
              "Such developments saw decline of various classical dance forms which were subjected to contemptuous fun and discouragement including Bharatanatyam that through the 19th century remained exclusive to Hindu temples.",
              "Eventually social and economic conditions associated with Devadasi culture added with contempt and despicable attitude from the Christian missionaries and British officials, who held the Devadasis of South India and nautch girls of North India as harlots, disgraced such systems. Furthermore the Christian missionaries launched anti-dance movement in 1892 to stop such practice.",
              "The Madras Presidency under the British colonial government banned the custom of dancing in Hindu temples in 1910 and with this the age-old tradition of performing Bharatanatyam in Hindu temples also came to an end.",
              "RevivalA\u0302 The Indian community disapproved such ban.",
              "The Tamilians were worried that such a rich and ancient custom of Hindu temple dancing was getting persecuted on the pretext of social reform.",
              "Many classical art revivalists like Indian lawyer, freedom-fighter, activist and classical artist E.",
              "Krishna Iyer questioned such discrimination.",
              "Iyer who became involved with the Bharatanatyam revival movement was incarcerated on charges of nationalism and imprisoned.",
              "During his prison term he convinced the political prisoners to advocate for this age-old classical dance form.",
              "A\u0302 Iyer founded the a\u0302\u0080\u0098Madras Music Academya\u0302\u0080\u0099 and along with Indian theosophist, dancer and Bharatanatyam choreographer Rukmini Devi Arundale, he strived to save Bharatanatyam from dying out.",
              "Despite the fact that Hindu temple dances were being suppressed due to laws enforced by the colonial British government, many artists like American dancer Esther Sherman came from the West to learn Indian classical dance forms. She came to India in 1930 and not only learnt classical dances but also adopted the name Ragini Devi and became a part of the ancient dance arts revival movement.",
              "As the Indian freedom movement progressed steadily during the early 20th century, an effort to revive Indian culture and tradition seethed with excitement among Indians.",
              "Eminent Bharatanatyam dancers like Arundale and Balasaraswati expanded the dance form out of Hindu temples and established it as a mainstream dance form.",
              "Later the Tamil Hindu migrants revived this Hindu temple dancing custom in British Tamil temples during the late 20th century.",
              "Today this ancient classical dance form also includes technical performances as also non-religious and fusion based themes.",
              "Repertoire The repertoire of this performance art are categorized into three brackets namely a\u0302\u0080\u0098Nrittaa\u0302\u0080\u0099, a\u0302\u0080\u0098Nrityaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 and a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natyaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 mentioned in a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natya Shastraa\u0302\u0080\u0099 and followed by all major Indian classical dance forms. a\u0302\u0080\u0098Nrittaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 is a technical performance where the dancer presents pure Bharata Natyam movements emphasising on speed, form, pattern, range and rhythmic aspects without any form of enactment or interpretive aspect.",
              "In a\u0302\u0080\u0098Nrityaa\u0302\u0080\u0099 the dancer communicates a story, spiritual themes, message or feelings through expressive gestures and slower body movements harmonised with musical notes.",
              "a\u0302\u0080\u0098Natyama\u0302\u0080\u0099 is usually performed by a group or in some cases by a solo dancer who maintains certain body movements for certain characters of the play which is communicated through dance-acting.",
              "The dance form typically comprises of certain sections performed in sequence namely Alarippu, Jatiswaram, Shabdam, Varnam, Padam and Thillana.",
              "Costumes The style of dressing of a Bharatanatyam dancer is more or less similar to that of a Tamil Hindu bride.",
              "She wears a gorgeous tailor-made sari that consists of a cloth specially stitched in pleats that falls in the front from the waist and when the dancer performs spectacular footwork that include stretching or bending her knees, the cloth widens up like a hand fan.",
              "The sari worn in a special manner is well complimented with traditional jewellery that include the ones that adorn her head, nose, ear and neck and vivid face make-up specially highlighting her eyes so that audience can view her expressions properly.",
              "Her hair neatly plaited in conventional way is often beautified with flowers.",
              "A jewellery belt adorns her waist while musical anklets called ghunghru made of leather straps with small metallic bells attached to it are wrapped in her ankles.",
              "Her feet and fingers are often brightened with henna colour so as to highlight gestures of her hands.",
              "Instruments & MusicA\u0302 The Bharatnatyam dancer is accompanied by a nattuvanar (or taladhari) that is a vocalist who generally conducts the whole performance, a part often executed by the guru.",
              "The person can also play the cymbals or any other instrument.",
              "The music associated with Bharatanatyam is in South Indiaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s Carnatic style and instruments played comprise of cymbals, the flute, a long pipe horn called nagaswaram, a drum called mridangam and veena.",
              "The verses recited during performance are in Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu.",
              "Famous Exponents The four Nattuvanars namely Ponaiyah, Vadivelu, Sivanandam and Chinnaiya who are renowned as Tanjaore Bandhu and who thrived in the Durbar of Maratha ruler, Sarfoji-II from 1798 to 1832 shaped up the modern day Bharatanatyam.",
              "Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, a dance guru from the village of Pandanallur was a noted exponent of Bharatanatyam who is predominantly known for his style referred as the Pandanallur school of Bharatanatyam.",
              "One of his students Rukmini Devi championed and performed the Pandanallur (Kalakshetra) style and also remained one of the leading proponents of the classical dance revival movement.",
              "Balasarswati who was regarded as child prodigy by Vidhwans and Pandits also joined hands in reviving the dance form.",
              "She was a virtuoso of the Thanjavur style of Bharatanatyam.",

              "In addition to taking care of the temple and performing rituals, these women also learn and practice classical Indian dances such as Bharatanatyam, Mohiniyattam, Kuchipudi, and Odissi.",
              "Their status as dancers, musicians and consorts were an essential part of temple worship.",
              "Between the sixth and thirteenth centuries, Devadasis had a high rank and dignity in society and were exceptionally affluent as they were seen as the protectors of the arts.",
              "During this period royal patrons provided them with gifts of land, property, and jewellery.",

              "Devadasis were expected to live a life of celibacy, however, there have been several instances of exceptions.",
              "[5] During the period of British rule in the Indian subcontinent, kings who were the patrons of temples lost their power, thus the temple artist communities also lost their significance.",
              "[5] As a result, Devadasis were left without their traditional means of support and patronage and were now commonly associated with prostitution.",
              "[6][7][8] The practice of Devadasi was banned during British rule, starting with the Bombay Devadasi Protection Act in 1934.",
              "The colonial view of Devadasi practices remains debated as the British colonial government were unable to distinguish the Devadasis from non-religious street dancers.",
              "[9][10][11][12][13][14] The Devadasi system though is still in existence in rudimentary form but with social activism state governments of different states at different times outlawed this ritual such as Andhra Pradesh Devdasis (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1988, or the Madras Devdasis Act 1947.",
              "[15] The practice became significant when one of the great queens of the Somavamshi dynasty decided that in order to honour the gods, certain women who were trained in classical dancing, should be married to the deities.",

              "Bharatanatyam is a classical dance form originating from Tamil Nadu, Southern India, and is known for its elegance, beauty, and ability to express ideas and stories.",
              "This enchanting dance form suffered throughout history due to the stigmatizing nature of the Indian caste system in regards to the values and perceptions that the dance form held.",
              "Bharatanatyam\u2019s origins are unable to be precisely identified.",
              "However, its beginning is understood to date back more than 2000 years, into ancient India.",
              "Even though many kings and rulers contributed to the flourishment of Bharatanatyam, there is a consensus among scholars that it rose to prominence during the Rajaraja Chola period.",
              "The golden age of Bharatanatyam, during the Chola period, began to diminish after the Cholas, but still survived as an art form for hundreds of years, until the British colonized India during the 17th century.",
              "The 17th century brought not only Bharatanatyam but also the entirety of India into a state of calamity in which the perception of Bharatanatyam as a dance form experienced a drastic shift.",
              "Bharatanatyam was seen as an art form that only the poor members of Indian society engaged in, until the early 20th century, when certain upperclassmen activists realized the beauty of Bharatanatyam and revolutionized its entire perception as a dance form to be engaged in by everyone in society.",
              "The effect of the revolution still can be seen today, as children all over the world from different social backgrounds eagerly seek to learn this ancient dance form.",
              "Bharatanatyam is an ancient classical dance form from Tamil Nadu that has been in existence for over 2000 years.",
              "The word Bharatanatyam can be broken down to \u201cbhavam\u201d which means expression, \u201cragam\u201d which means music, \u201ctalam\u201d, which means rhythm, and \u201cnatyam\u201d, which means dance.",
              "The dance that society now calls Bharatanatyam was actually referred to as Sadir Natyam during ancient times (Shankar, 1994).",
              "Sadir refers to dancing in the royal courts, which was the original purpose of Bharatanatyam during ancient times.",
              "During the early ages of India, Bharatanatyam was used as a form of entertainment for rulers in India in which people, known as Devadasis, or temple dancers, would dance for the kings.",
              "The temple dancers were, to an extent, servants to the king and devoted their lifetime to both learn and dance on a daily basis for the royals of the kingdom.",
              "Bharatanatyam is an expressive dance form that utilizes many body parts, such as the eyes, hands, and feet to accentuate various human emotions.",
              "Modern Bharatanatyam contains over 30 individual hand gestures with each gesture representing a different meaning.",
              "The myriad of patterns that arise from a combination of eye and hand gestures allows for both men and women dancers to create a story through this visually aesthetic dance.",
              "For example, the hand gesture \u201cpataaka\u201d is done with all the fingers held straight like a stop sign, without any gap between the fingers.",
              "Pataaka is used in Bharatanatyam to express denial, blessings, months, years, etc.",
              "The caste system is a unique social stratification structure of Indian society that, though dating back more than 3000 years, has firmly persevered into modern Indian society.",
              "The caste system is hereditarily selective with little to no opportunity to move between castes.",
              "Thus, the caste system is a key element in the identity of an Indian individual and significantly affects their social life and environment (Belkin, 2008).",
              "Figure 1.",
              "Indian Caste System (Belkin, 2008) The caste system is composed of five main classes in hierarchical descending order: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras, and Untouchables.",
              "Each class within the caste system dictates the occupations and power that members within the caste were born into.",
              "The Brahmins belong at the top of the caste system and served as priests in temples.",
              "Their role was to serve as the gatekeepers and the direct connection between the Hindu gods and members of Indian society.",
              "The next caste is the Kshatriyas, who were the warriors and rulers of society.",
              "The Kshatriyas were responsible for serving the public in all forms through administration, law making, and protection of the citizens of society.",
              "The Vaishyas, who were merchants and landowners, were the next caste in the system.",
              "The Vaishyas were responsible for all commercial activity in India.",
              "The second to last class contains the Shudras, who were relatively unskilled laborers.",
              "In Indian society, the Shudras engaged in jobs as peasants and farmers working the lands of the Vaishyas.",
              "The final caste contains the Untouchables, who held little to no power in society at all.",
              "Even though the Untouchables were part of the caste system, they were outcasts amongst the other four classes in the caste system and could only engage in jobs such as sweepers or cleaners (Torri, 2009).",
              "From historical accounts, it is evident that dance and music were prominent during the Sangam period and the Chola dynasty.",
              "The Sangam period, which arose during the second century, contains the first written records of Devadasis, thereby proving the existence of Bharatanatyam.",
              "In the popular Tamil epic, Silapathikaram, written during Sangam era, the central character, Kovalan, is the son of wealthy merchant.",
              "Kovalan\u2019s mistress, Madhavi, was a Devadasi woman who was given the same importance and respect as Kovalan\u2019s wife, Kannagi.",
              "Even though breaking monogamy was considered a sinful act, Madhavi was still treated in an honorable manner (Shankar, 1994).",
              "Figure 2.",
              "A geographical illustration of the Chola's territory and influence (Chakraborty, 2004) Bharatanatyam entered its age of prominence during the Chola dynasty in Southern India.",
              "The Chola dynasty began during the 9th century and lasted until the late 13th century.",
              "The Chola dynasty was known for its wartime abilities, through which, at its peak, Chola was able to expand all the way to the northeastern border of India.",
              "What set the Chola dynasty apart from other dynasties during this time was that the Chola dynasty became well known for its literature, art, music, and architectural abilities through structures, such as the Brihadeeswarar Temple, which still stands today (Orr, 2000).",
              "Figure 3.",
              "A Karana that can be found in the Brihadeeswarar Temple (Prasad, 1991) Bharatanatyam flourished, because the dance form fit perfectly into the Chola Empire\u2019s value system.",
              "The Chola Empire promoted the Devadasi system, and Devadasis were then also known as Devar Adigalar.",
              "Devar, in Tamil means \u201cGod\u201d and Adigalar means \u201cservant\u201d, which thus makes Devadasis \u201cGod\u2019s Servants\u201d (Orr, 2000).",
              "Devadasis during the Chola dynasty were well respected and given a haven in the Chola Empire.",
              "Bharatanatyam is based on the 108 positions of Lord Nataraja\u2019s \u201cDance of Triumph\u201d, which are described in the Natya Shasta, a text focused on the art of performance.",
              "Karanas, which are depictions of the 108 positions, still exist on temples in Tamil Nadu.",
              "Five temples that were built during this era contain Karanas that clearly evoke the beauty of the positions: the Brihadeeswarar Temple, the Nataraja Temple, the Sarangapani Temple, the Arunachaleshvara Temple, and the Vriddhagirishvara Temple.",
              "The oldest of these is the Brihadeeswarar Temple, which was built by Rajaraja Chola, but its Karana sculpture remains incomplete.",
              "The ancient inscriptions have shown that over 400 Devadasis were able to dance in the name of Hindu gods and serve the Chola Empire in the Brihadeeswarar Temple.",
              "As the Chola Empire grew all over India, the Cholas built temples in the areas they conquered, which allowed for an increase in the number of Devadasis that resided in the Chola Empire.",
              "The Devadasis were such a large part of Chola life, that even the Chola princess, Kundavai, learned Bharatanatyam from a Devadasi (Orr, 2000).",
              "Scholars have been investigating as to why the Chola Empire was so receptive and welcoming of Devadasis.",
              "From their research, multiple theories have been formulated.",
              "One common theory that was created during this time in India stated that devoting girls to temples would help improve the welfare of the empire, itself (Prasad, 1991).",
              "This idea\u2019s purpose is somewhat similar to a sacrifice that many cultures engage in to please a supernatural being.",
              "By devoting girls to temples, the Cholas believed that they would be giving the ultimate offering to the Hindu gods and goddesses, in the form of the purity and kindness that a girl represents in Hindu culture.",
              "Furthermore, scholars have postulated that girls could have devoted their lives to the Hindu temples in order to increase the fertility of the land (Shankar, 1994).",
              "Ancient India was an agrarian based society and by devoting a small proportion of the population to the art of Bharatanatyam for religious purposes, the Cholas may have been optimistic for an expanding population and livestock.",
              "Another prevailing theory about the dominance of Devadasis during the Chola era revolves around the relationship between Bharatanatyam and the Hindu religion.",
              "During the Chola dynasty, Bharatanatyam was seen as a sacred dance to please the Hindu gods and goddesses (Srinivasan, 1985).",
              "Only upper caste individuals were allowed to dance in the temples, while lower caste members were permitted to dance in non-religious functions, such as marriages and puberty ceremonies (Srinivasan, 1985).",
              "The combination of both the upper caste individual\u2019s involvement in Bharatanatyam and the direct link between Bharatanatyam and Hinduism bolstered the image and value that Bharatanatyam had in Chola society.",
              "In Ancient Indian societies, politics and religion were heavily related, because rulers relied heavily on religion to bolster their wealth and kingdom (Orr, 2000).",
              "Due to the link between politics and religion, Devadasis were in close proximity to the Chola rulers which helped raise their status in society.",
              "The Chola rulers also supported the Devadasis financially, allowing the Devadasis to help raise the prestige and wealth of the temples (Vanamamalai, 1974).",
              "Overall, the Devadasis\u2019 association with religion allowed them to become central to the Chola social system.",
              "Once the British and other European powers began colonizing India, during the 17th century, the role of Bharatanatyam and how it was seen changed dramatically.",
              "The British colonial rule had no foreseeable use for the aristocratic system of India.",
              "Although the British did not destroy the aristocratic system of India, former kings were left powerless and subservient to the British (Dirks, 1992).",
              "Essentially, these once powerful were now managers for the British.",
              "Having lost their power, they could no longer provide money or support for the Devadasis (Torri, 2009).",
              "Furthermore, even if a Devadasis could somehow make a living through Bharatanatyam, their livelihood was momentary.",
              "Indian society became more judgmental and critical about the physical features of a Devadasi.",
              "Once a Devadasi\u2019s physical beauty began to fade, she could be shunned from ever dancing again.",
              "This left many Devadasis struggling with no other opportunities or options for a livelihood (Soneji, 2010).",
              "The Devadasis therefore entered a state of poverty in which they could not support themselves or the temples they danced within.",
              "Bharatanatyam began to lose its bond and identity with religion as a form of offering.",
              "Figure 4.",
              "A Devadasi can be seen dancing in front of men during the Colonial British Indian era (Hancock, 2000) Although this art form began to lose its connection to religion, Bharatanatym survived through the offering of girls to temples by their family in the hope of bringing good fortune to their home (Soneji, 2011).",
              "Other reasons why families may offer girls to the temple during this time include being unable to find a husband for the girl or that the girl was a child of premarital intercourse.",
              "In the Chola period, families offered their girls as a devotion for religious reasons and to bring prosperity into their families.",
              "In contrast, during the Colonial India period, families offered their girls as a last resort in hopes of escaping poverty or because their girls may have no future due to lack of a male presence in their lives.",
              "Beyond the economic conditions and the circumstances which caused girls to become temple dancers, Devadasis also suffered in their social appearance in society.",
              "During the Chola period, mainly upper caste girls would become Devadasis, because of the association between Bharatanatyam and Hinduism.",
              "However, during the Colonial British India era, many lower caste and even untouchables became Devadasis, which was unheard of for the time.",
              "Even the music that the Devadasis danced to displayed the inferior attitudes that were projected upon them.",
              "A sample song that displays these antagonistic views is shown below: It\u2019s true, I have my period But don\u2019t let that stop you.",
              "No Rules Apply To another man\u2019s wife I beg you to come close But you always have second thoughts All these codes where written By men who don\u2019t know how to love When I come at you, wanting you, why do you back off?",
              "You don\u2019t have to touch my whole body Just bend over and kiss.",
              "(Narayana Rao, 2002) This song illustrates a view in which Devadasi women are more open about their body and sexuality in contrast to normal Indian women in society.",
              "One might argue that this shows women\u2019s liberation and progressive attitudes that should be accepted and praised, however, it is important to know that a Devadasi did not write the song.",
              "A group of men wrote this song and decided that it would be appropriate for a girl to dance to it, as if these were her views.",
              "In Indian society, to this day, girls who are more private about their body and in a sense, more pure, are more appreciated and valued.",
              "Using Indian cultural standards as a parameter for judgment, it is evident that Devadasis were constantly linked to negative attitudes, such as being more promiscuous and having no honor.",
              "Colonial India society did not respect the Devadasis the same way that the Chola society did.",
              "There is no absolute year as to when India entered its modern era, but most scholars agree that the early 20th century is an acceptable starting point, since that is when the British began losing control of India (Dirks, 1992).",
              "As India entered its current era, a clear shift towards more progressive and liberal ideas can be seen.",
              "Bharatanatyam and the Devadasi system were antiquated in comparison to the progressive ideas that stemmed from this time period.",
              "Certain leaders of India saw that Bharatanatyam needed change and led a revolution to fight for a brighter future for Bharatanatyam.",
              "Modern day Indians were unhappy with how the Devadasi system worked.",
              "These Indians felt that Bharatanatyam and having a personal life did not necessarily have to be mutually exclusive occupations.",
              "They believed that a girl could dance liberally without having to devote her entire life to the temple.",
              "Dr.",
              "Muthulakshmi Reddy, a physician, freedom fighter, and woman\u2019s activist, was unsatisfied with the Devadasi system and fought for its eradication.",
              "Even though Dr.",
              "Reddy was not a dancer herself, she felt that women did not have to be subjugated to the Devadasi conditions in order to learn this beautiful art.",
              "Dr.",
              "Reddy fought relentlessly and was able to present a bill to the Madras Legislative Council that eventually became the Devadasi Abolition Act.",
              "This act contained hundreds of conditions about the Devadasi system, but the most notable changes was that it became illegal for girls to become Devadasis.",
              "Anyone who promoted or pressured girls into becoming Devadasis could be given imprisonment for up to five years.",
              "The act had multiple retroactive clauses that allowed prior Devadasis to give up the role and be granted the same rights as other women in India, including the right to marry.",
              "Dr.",
              "Reddy\u2019s struggle is the main reason why there are no more Devadasis in existence today.",
              "She completely changed the purpose of Bharatanatyam from an art form performed solely for the pleasure of the Hindu gods and goddesses, to a more tolerant art form that girls from around the world can enjoy.",
              "Until the early 20th century, Bharatanatyam was primarily a dance form that was performed by lower caste members.",
              "Krishna Iyer was a lawyer from the Brahmin caste who foresaw Bharatanatyam as a dance that should have no association with caste.",
              "Unfortunately, Mr.",
              "Iyer was a male with no Bharatanatyam dancing background, so it was difficult to have his statements and views valued by society.",

              "Arundale brought back the honor of the dancers, by eliminating the erotic elements of Bharatanatyam that could be seen in the Colonial British India song, and filling it with spiritual values (Medhuri, 2005).",
              "She used her aesthetic knowledge to enhance the beauty of dance presentation, by replacing the unprofessional costumes with intricate dance wear and jewelry.",
              "Rather than advocating that Bharatanatyam be learned just by the upper castes, Ms.",
              "Arundale encouraged everyone to learn it.",
