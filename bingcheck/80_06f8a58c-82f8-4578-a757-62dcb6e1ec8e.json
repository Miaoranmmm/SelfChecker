    "query": "Can you tell me about the history and evolution of cryptography, and how it has been used in different historical contexts throughout human history?",
    "response": "Cryptography is the use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets, and it has a long and fascinating history. According to [^2^], the earliest known use of cryptography was over 5600 years ago in Sumeria and Egypt, where cuneiform and hieroglyphs were used to record transactions. These were not necessarily meant to be secret, but rather to be understood only by those who knew the language system.\n\nLater, in ancient Greece and Rome, cryptography was used for military and diplomatic purposes. For example, the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions, was used by Julius Caesar to communicate with his generals [^3^]. Another example is the scytale, a device that wraps a strip of parchment around a rod of a certain diameter and writes a message along it. When unwrapped, the message becomes scrambled and can only be read by someone who knows the rod's diameter [^3^].\n\nIn the Middle Ages and Renaissance, cryptography became increasingly important for political and religious reasons. Various forms of substitution and transposition ciphers were developed and used by different states and factions. For instance, the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, which uses a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on a keyword, was invented in the 16th century and was considered unbreakable for a long time [^1^]. Another example is the Babington Plot, a failed attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1586. The conspirators used a nomenclator cipher, which combines symbols for common words and letters, but their messages were intercepted and deciphered by Sir Francis Walsingham, leading to their execution [^3^].\n\nIn more recent centuries, cryptography advanced significantly with the invention of mechanical and electromechanical devices that could encrypt and decrypt faster and more complexly than humans. Some examples are the Enigma machine used by Nazi Germany during World War II, which had rotors that changed the substitution alphabet for each letter typed [^3^]; the Lorenz cipher machine used by Hitler to communicate with his high command, which added a pseudorandom stream of bits to the plaintext [^3^]; and the SIGABA machine used by the US military, which had multiple rotors and scramblers that made it more secure than Enigma [^3^]. These machines were also subject to cryptanalysis by various parties, such as the Polish Cipher Bureau, the British Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, and the US Army Signals Intelligence Service.\n\nThe advent of electronics and computers in the 20th century ushered in a new era of cryptography that is still ongoing today. Some of the developments in this era include:\n\n- The creation of public-key cryptography, which allows two parties to communicate securely without sharing a secret key beforehand. This was first proposed by James Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm Williamson at GCHQ in the 1970s, but their work remained classified until 1997. Independently, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published their paper on public-key cryptography in 1976, introducing the concept of digital signatures and proposing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol [^3^].\n- The invention of various symmetric-key algorithms (such as DES, AES, Blowfish, etc.) and asymmetric-key algorithms (such as RSA, ECC, ElGamal, etc.) that are widely used for encryption, decryption, authentication, and digital signatures today.\n- The emergence of various cryptographic protocols (such as SSL/TLS, PGP, SSH, etc.) that enable secure communication over networks such as the Internet.\n- The development of various cryptographic techniques (such as hash functions, message authentication codes, zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, etc.) that enhance the security and functionality of cryptographic systems.\n- The rise of various cryptographic applications (such as cryptocurrencies, blockchain, digital certificates, electronic voting, etc.) that have significant social and economic impacts.\n\nCryptography has been used in different historical contexts throughout human history for various purposes: to protect secrets from enemies or rivals; to ensure authenticity and integrity of messages; to conceal or reveal identities; to create or break codes; to influence or resist power; to enable or challenge innovation; etc. Cryptography is not only a science but also an art that reflects human creativity and ingenuity.",

              "It is important to note that hashing is not the same as encrypting.",
              "Hashing is a one-way operation that is used to transform data into the compressed message digest.",
              "Additionally, the integrity of the message can be measured with hashing.",
              "Conversely, encryption is a two-way operation that is used to transform plaintext into cipher-text and then vice versa.",
              "In encryption, the confidentiality of a message is guaranteed.",
              "[34] Hash functions can be used to verify digital signatures, so that when signing documents via the Internet, the signature is applied to one particular individual.",
              "Much like a hand-written signature, these signatures are verified by assigning their exact hash code to a person.",
              "Furthermore, hashing is applied to passwords for computer systems. Hashing for passwords began with the UNIX operating system.",
              "A user on the system would first create a password.",
              "That password would be hashed, using an algorithm or key, and then stored in a password file.",
              "This is still prominent today, as web applications that require passwords will often hash user's passwords and store them in a database.",
              "[35] The public developments of the 1970s broke the near monopoly on high quality cryptography held by government organizations (see S Levy's Crypto for a journalistic account of some of the policy controversy of the time in the US).",
              "For the first time ever, those outside government organizations had access to cryptography not readily breakable by anyone (including governments).",
              "Considerable controversy, and conflict, both public and private, began more or less immediately, sometimes called the crypto wars.",
              "They have not yet subsided.",
              "In many countries, for example, export of cryptography is subject to restrictions.",
              "Until 1996 export from the U.",
              "S.",
              "of cryptography using keys longer than 40 bits (too small to be very secure against a knowledgeable attacker) was sharply limited.",
              "As recently as 2004, former FBI Director Louis Freeh, testifying before the 9/11 Commission, called for new laws against public use of encryption.",
              "One of the most significant people favoring strong encryption for public use was Phil Zimmermann.",
              "He wrote and then in 1991 released PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a very high quality crypto system.",
              "He distributed a freeware version of PGP when he felt threatened by legislation then under consideration by the US Government that would require backdoors to be included in all cryptographic products developed within the US.",
              "His system was released worldwide shortly after he released it in the US, and that began a long criminal investigation of him by the US Government Justice Department for the alleged violation of export restrictions.",
              "The Justice Department eventually dropped its case against Zimmermann, and the freeware distribution of PGP has continued around the world.",
              "PGP even eventually became an open Internet standard (RFC 2440 or OpenPGP).",
              "While modern ciphers like AES and the higher quality asymmetric ciphers are widely considered unbreakable, poor designs and implementations are still sometimes adopted and there have been important cryptanalytic breaks of deployed crypto systems in recent years.",
              "Notable examples of broken crypto designs include the first Wi-Fi encryption scheme WEP, the Content Scrambling System used for encrypting and controlling DVD use, the A5/1 and A5/2 ciphers used in GSM cell phones, and the CRYPTO1 cipher used in the widely deployed MIFARE Classic smart cards from NXP Semiconductors, a spun off division of Philips Electronics.",
              "All of these are symmetric ciphers.",
              "Thus far, not one of the mathematical ideas underlying public key cryptography has been proven to be 'unbreakable', and so some future mathematical analysis advance might render systems relying on them insecure.",
              "While few informed observers foresee such a breakthrough, the key size recommended for security as best practice keeps increasing as increased computing power required for breaking codes becomes cheaper and more available.",
              "Quantum computers, if ever constructed with enough capacity, could break existing public key algorithms and efforts are underway to develop and standardize post-quantum cryptography.",
              "Even without breaking encryption in the traditional sense, side-channel attacks can be mounted that exploit information gained from the way a computer system is implemented, such as cache memory usage, timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks or even sounds emitted.",
              "Newer cryptographic algorithms are being developed that make such attacks more difficult."

              "The article also stimulated the almost immediate public development of a new class of enciphering algorithms, the asymmetric key algorithms. Prior to that time, all useful modern encryption algorithms had been symmetric key algorithms, in which the same cryptographic key is used with the underlying algorithm by both the sender and the recipient, who must both keep it secret.",
              "All of the electromechanical machines used in World War II were of this logical class, as were the Caesar and Atbash ciphers and essentially all cipher systems throughout history.",

              "The first to perform a successful attack on a modification of the Vigenere cipher back in 1854 was no one other than Charles Babbage, a pioneer of computing, but the analysis was published by another researcher, Friedrich Kasiski nine months later.",

              "It led to Mary's execution, a result of a letter sent by Mary (who had been imprisoned for 19 years since 1568 in England at the behest of Elizabeth) in which she consented to the assassination of Elizabeth.",
              "[1] The long-term goal of the plot was the invasion of England by the Spanish forces of King Philip II and the Catholic League in France, leading to the restoration of the old religion.",
              "The plot was discovered by Elizabeth's spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham and used to entrap Mary for the purpose of removing her as a claimant to the English throne.",
              "The chief conspirators were Anthony Babington and John Ballard.",
              "Babington, a young recusant, was recruited by Ballard, a Jesuit priest who hoped to rescue the Scottish Queen.",
              "Working for Walsingham were double agents Robert Poley and Gilbert Gifford, as well as Thomas Phelippes, a spy agent and cryptanalyst, and the puritan spy Maliverey Catilyn.",
              "The turbulent Catholic deacon Gifford had been in Walsingham's service since the end of 1585 or the beginning of 1586.",
              "Gifford obtained a letter of introduction to Queen Mary from a confidant and spy for her, Thomas Morgan.",
              "Walsingham then placed double agent Gifford and spy decipherer Phelippes inside Chartley Castle, where Queen Mary was imprisoned.",
              "Gifford organised the Walsingham plan to place Babington's and Queen Mary's encrypted communications into a beer barrel cork which were then intercepted by Phelippes, decoded and sent to Walsingham.",
              "[2] On 7 July 1586, the only Babington letter that was sent to Mary was decoded by Phelippes.",
              "Mary responded in code on 17 July 1586 ordering the would-be rescuers to assassinate Queen Elizabeth.",
              "The response letter also included deciphered phrases indicating her desire to be rescued: \"The affairs being thus prepared\" and \"I may suddenly be transported out of this place\".",
              "At the Fotheringay trial in October 1586, Elizabeth's Lord High Treasurer William Cecil \u2014 Lord Burghley \u2014 and Walsingham used the letter against Mary who refused to admit that she was guilty.",
              "However, Mary was betrayed by her secretaries Nau and Curle, who confessed under pressure that the letter was mainly truthful.",
              "[3] Mary, Queen of Scots, a Roman Catholic, was regarded by Roman Catholics as the legitimate heir to the throne of England.",
              "In 1568 she escaped imprisonment by Scottish rebels and sought the aid of her first cousin once removed, Queen Elizabeth I, a year after her forced abdication from the throne of Scotland.",
              "The issuance of the papal bull Regnans in Excelsis by Pope Pius V on 25 February 1570, granted English Catholics authority to overthrow the English queen.",
              "Queen Mary became the focal point of numerous plots and intrigues to restore England to its former religion, Catholicism, and to depose Elizabeth and even to take her life.",
              "Rather than the expected aid, Elizabeth imprisoned Mary for nineteen years in the charge of a succession of jailers, principally the Earl of Shrewsbury.",
              "In 1584 Elizabeth's Privy Council signed a \"Bond of Association\" designed by Cecil and Walsingham which stated that anyone within the line of succession to the throne on whose behalf anyone plotted against the Queen, would be excluded from the line and executed.",
              "This was agreed upon by hundreds of Englishmen, who likewise signed the Bond.",
              "Mary also agreed to sign the Bond.",
              "The following year, Parliament passed the Act of Association, which provided for the execution of anyone who would benefit from the death of the Queen if a plot against her was discovered.",
              "Because of the bond, Mary could be executed if a plot was initiated by others that could lead to her accession to England's throne.",
              "Queen Elizabeth ordered Queen Mary transferred back to the ruined Tutbury Castle in the wintry weather of Christmas Eve 1569.",
              "[4] Mary became ill because of the bad conditions of her captivity, imprisoned in a very damp cold room with closed windows and with no access to the sun.",
              "In 1585, Elizabeth ordered Mary to be transferred in a coach and under heavy guard and placed under the strictest confinement at Chartley Hall in Staffordshire, under the control of Sir Amias Paulet.",
              "She was prohibited any correspondence with the outside world.",
              "Puritan Paulet was chosen by Queen Elizabeth in part because he abhorred Queen Mary's Catholic faith.",
              "Reacting to the growing threat posed by Catholics, urged on by the pope and other Catholic monarchs in Europe, Francis Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth's Secretary of State and spymaster, together with William Cecil, Elizabeth's chief advisor, realised that if Mary could be implicated in a plot to assassinate Elizabeth, she could be executed and the papist threat diminished.",
              "As he wrote to the Earl of Leicester: \"So long as that devilish woman lives, neither Her Majesty must make account to continue in quiet possession of her crown, nor her faithful servants assure themselves of safety of their lives.\"",
              "[5] Walsingham used Babington to ensnare Queen Mary by sending his double agent, Gilbert Gifford to Paris to obtain the confidence of Morgan, then locked in the Bastille.",
              "Morgan previously worked for George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, an earlier jailor of Queen Mary.",
              "Through Shrewsbury, Queen Mary became acquainted with Morgan.",

              "Walsingham had Gifford function as a courier in the entrapment plot against Queen Mary.",
              "The Babington plot was related to several separate plans: At the behest of Mary's French supporters, John Ballard, a Jesuit priest and agent of the Roman Church, went to England on various occasions in 1585 to secure promises of aid from the northern Catholic gentry on behalf of Mary.",
              "In March 1586, he met with John Savage, an ex-soldier who was involved in a separate plot against Elizabeth and who had sworn an oath to assassinate the queen.",

              "[6] Later that same year, Gifford reported to Charles Paget and Don Bernardino de Mendoza, and told them that English Catholics were prepared to mount an insurrection against Elizabeth, provided that they would be assured of foreign support.",
              "While it was uncertain whether Ballard's report of the extent of Catholic opposition was accurate, what was certain is that he was able to secure assurances that support would be forthcoming.",
              "He then returned to England, where he persuaded a member of the Catholic gentry, Anthony Babington, to lead and organise the English Catholics against Elizabeth.",
              "Ballard informed Babington about the plans that had been so far proposed.",
              "Babington's later confession made it clear that Ballard was sure of the support of the Catholic League: He told me he was retorned from Fraunce uppon this occasion.",

              "[7] Despite this assurance of this foreign support, Babington was hesitant, as he thought that no foreign invasion would succeed for as long as Elizabeth remained, to which Ballard answered that the plans of John Savage would take care of that.",
              "After a lengthy discussion with friends and soon-to-be fellow conspirators, Babington consented to join and to lead the conspiracy.",
              "[8] Unfortunately for the conspirators, Walsingham was certainly aware of some of the aspects of the plot, based on reports by his spies, most notably Gilbert Gifford, who kept tabs on all the major participants.",
              "While he could have shut down some part of the plot and arrested some of those involved within reach, he still lacked any piece of evidence that would prove Queen Mary's active participation in the plot and he feared to commit any mistake which might cost Elizabeth her life.",
              "After the Throckmorton Plot, Queen Elizabeth had issued a decree in July 1584, which prevented all communication to and from Mary.",
              "However, Walsingham and Cecil realised that that decree also impaired their ability to entrap Mary.",
              "They needed evidence for which she could be executed based on their Bond of Association tenets.",
              "Thus Walsingham established a new line of communication, one which he could carefully control without incurring any suspicion from Mary.",
              "Gifford approached the French ambassador to England, Guillaume de l'Aubespine, Baron de Cha\u0302teauneuf-sur-Cher, and described the new correspondence arrangement that had been designed by Walsingham.",
              "Gifford and jailer Paulet had arranged for a local brewer to facilitate the movement of messages between Queen Mary and her supporters by placing them in a watertight casing inside the stopper of a beer barrel.",
              "Thomas Phelippes, a cipher and language expert in Walsingham's employ, was then quartered at Chartley Hall to receive the messages, decode them and send them to Walsingham.",

              "All subsequent messages to Mary would be sent via diplomatic packets to Chateauneuf, who then passed them on to Gifford.",

              "The brewer would then smuggle the letter to Mary.",

              "[10] This letter was received by Mary on 14 July 1586, who was in a dark mood knowing that her son had betrayed her in favour of Elizabeth, and three days later she replied to Babington in a long letter in which she outlined the components of a successful rescue and the need to assassinate Elizabeth.",
              "She also stressed the necessity of foreign aid if the rescue attempt was to succeed: For I have long ago shown unto the foreign Catholic princes, what they have done against the King of Spain, and in the time the Catholics here remaining, exposed to all persecutions and cruelty, do daily diminish in number, forces, means and power.",

              "Mary was clear in her support for the murder of Elizabeth if that would have led to her liberty and Catholic domination of England.",
              "In addition, Queen Mary supported in that letter, and in another one to Ambassador Mendoza, a Spanish invasion of England.",

              "This in turn formed the basis for Maria Stuarda, an opera by Donizetti, in 1835.",
              "Although the Babington Plot occurs before the events of the opera, and is only referenced twice during the opera, the second such occasion being Mary admitting her own part in it in private to her confessor (a role taken by Lord Talbot in the opera, although not in real life).",
              "The story of the Babington Plot is dramatised in the novel Conies in the Hay by Jane Lane (ISBN 0-7551-0835-3), and features prominently in Anthony Burgess's A Dead Man in Deptford.",

              "[8] Unfortunately for the conspirators, Walsingham was certainly aware of some of the aspects of the plot, based on reports by his spies, most notably Gilbert Gifford, who kept tabs on all the major participants.",
              "While he could have shut down some part of the plot and arrested some of those involved within reach, he still lacked any piece of evidence that would prove Queen Mary's active participation in the plot and he feared to commit any mistake which might cost Elizabeth her life.",

              "He served mainly under Sir Francis Walsingham, in the time of Elizabeth I, and most notably deciphered the coded letters of Babington Plot conspirators.",
              "Little is known about Phelippes family background except that he was the son of a cloth merchant.",
              "Despite his humble origins, it is believed that he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1569 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1574.",
              "Phelippes was a linguist who could speak French, Italian, Spanish, Latin and German.",
              "His education helped him to master cipher skills and be an excellent cryptographer of high reputation.",
              "Therefore, he was employed by Sir Francis Walsingham, the principal secretary to Queen Elizabeth I.",
              "The physical and intellectual stature of Phelippes was described as \"a small, lean, yellow-haired, short-sighted man, with pock-marked face, an excellent linguist, and, above all, a person with a positive genius for deciphering letters.\"",
              "[1] He is most remembered for his postscript to the \"bloody letter\" sent by Mary, Queen of Scots, to Anthony Babington regarding the Babington plot.",

              "The Enigma machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication.",
              "It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military.",
              "The Enigma machine was considered so secure that it was used to encipher the most top-secret messages.",
              "[1] The Enigma has an electromechanical rotor mechanism that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet.",
              "In typical use, one person enters text on the Enigma's keyboard and another person writes down which of the 26 lights above the keyboard illuminated at each key press.",
              "If plain text is entered, the illuminated letters are the ciphertext.",
              "Entering ciphertext transforms it back into readable plaintext.",
              "The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress.",
              "The security of the system depends on machine settings that were generally changed daily, based on secret key lists distributed in advance, and on other settings that were changed for each message.",
              "The receiving station would have to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message.",
              "While Nazi Germany introduced a series of improvements to the Enigma over the years, and these hampered decryption efforts, they did not prevent Poland from cracking the machine as early as December 1932 and reading messages prior to and into the war.",
              "Poland's sharing of their achievements enabled the Allies to exploit Enigma-enciphered messages as a major source of intelligence.",
              "[2] Many commentators say the flow of Ultra communications intelligence from the decrypting of Enigma, Lorenz, and other ciphers shortened the war substantially and may even have altered its outcome.",
              "[3] The Enigma machine was invented by German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I.",
              "[4] The German firm Scherbius & Ritter, co-founded by Scherbius, patented ideas for a cipher machine in 1918 and began marketing the finished product under the brand name Enigma in 1923, initially targeted at commercial markets.",
              "[5] Early models were used commercially from the early 1920s, and adopted by military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany before and during World War II.",
              "[6] Several different Enigma models were produced, but the German military models, having a plugboard, were the most complex.",
              "Japanese and Italian models were also in use.",
              "[7] With its adoption (in slightly modified form) by the German Navy in 1926 and the German Army and Air Force soon after, the name Enigma became widely known in military circles.",
              "Pre-war German military planning emphasized fast, mobile forces and tactics, later known as blitzkrieg, which depend on radio communication for command and coordination.",
              "Since adversaries would likely intercept radio signals, messages had to be protected with secure encipherment.",
              "Compact and easily portable, the Enigma machine filled that need.",
              "Around December 1932 Marian Rejewski, a Polish mathematician and cryptologist at the Polish Cipher Bureau, used the theory of permutations,[8] and flaws in the German military-message encipherment procedures, to break message keys of the plugboard Enigma machine.",
              "[9] France's spy Hans-Thilo Schmidt obtained access to German cipher materials that included the daily keys used in September and October 1932.",
              "Those keys included the plugboard settings.",
              "The French passed the material to the Poles, and Rejewski used some of that material and the message traffic in September and October to solve for the unknown rotor wiring.",
              "Consequently the Polish mathematicians were able to build their own Enigma machines, dubbed \"Enigma doubles\".",
              "Rejewski was aided by fellow mathematician-cryptologists Jerzy Ro\u0301z\u0307ycki and Henryk Zygalski, both of whom had been recruited with Rejewski from Poznan\u0301 University, which had been selected for its students' knowledge of the German language, since that area was held by Germany prior to World War I.",
              "The Polish Cipher Bureau developed techniques to defeat the plugboard and find all components of the daily key, which enabled the Cipher Bureau to read German Enigma messages starting from January 1933.",
              "Over time, the German cryptographic procedures improved, and the Cipher Bureau developed techniques and designed mechanical devices to continue reading Enigma traffic.",
              "As part of that effort, the Poles exploited quirks of the rotors, compiled catalogues, built a cyclometer (invented by Rejewski) to help make a catalogue with 100,000 entries, invented and produced Zygalski sheets, and built the electromechanical cryptologic bomba (invented by Rejewski) to search for rotor settings.",
              "In 1938 the Poles had six bomby (plural of bomba), but when that year the Germans added two more rotors, ten times as many bomby would have been needed to read the traffic.",
              "[10] On 26 and 27 July 1939,[11] in Pyry, just south of Warsaw, the Poles initiated French and British military intelligence representatives into the Polish Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment, including Zygalski sheets and the cryptologic bomb, and promised each delegation a Polish-reconstructed Enigma (the devices were soon delivered).",
              "[12] In September 1939, British Military Mission 4, which included Colin Gubbins and Vera Atkins, went to Poland, intending to evacuate cipher-breakers Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Ro\u0301z\u0307ycki, and Henryk Zygalski from the country.",
              "The cryptologists, however, had been evacuated by their own superiors into Romania, at the time a Polish-allied country.",
              "On the way, for security reasons, the Polish Cipher Bureau personnel had deliberately destroyed their records and equipment.",
              "From Romania they traveled on to France, where they resumed their cryptological work, collaborating by teletype with the British, who began work on decrypting German Enigma messages, using the Polish equipment and techniques.",
              "[13] Gordon Welchman, who became head of Hut 6 at Bletchley Park, has written: \"Hut 6 Ultra would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.\"",
              "[14] The Polish transfer of theory and technology at Pyry formed the crucial basis for the subsequent World War II British Enigma-decryption effort at Bletchley Park, where Welchman worked.",
              "During the war, British cryptologists decrypted a vast number of messages enciphered on Enigma.",
              "The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed \"Ultra\" by the British, was a substantial aid to the Allied war effort.",
              "[a] Though Enigma had some cryptographic weaknesses, in practice it was German procedural flaws, operator mistakes, failure to systematically introduce changes in encipherment procedures, and Allied capture of key tables and hardware that, during the war, enabled Allied cryptologists to succeed.",
              "[15][16] From October 1944, the German Abwehr used the Schlu\u0308sselgera\u0308t 41.",
              "[citation needed] Like other rotor machines, the Enigma machine is a combination of mechanical and electrical subsystems. The mechanical subsystem consists of a keyboard;",
              "a set of rotating disks called rotors arranged adjacently along a spindle;",
              "one of various stepping components to turn at least one rotor with each key press, and a series of lamps, one for each letter.",
              "These design features are the reason that the Enigma machine was originally referred to as the rotor-based cipher machine during its intellectual inception in 1915.",
              "[17] An electrical pathway is a route for current to travel.",
              "By manipulating this phenomenon the Enigma machine was able to scramble messages.",
              "[17] The mechanical parts act by forming a varying electrical circuit.",
              "When a key is pressed, one or more rotors rotate on the spindle.",
              "On the sides of the rotors are a series of electrical contacts that, after rotation, line up with contacts on the other rotors or fixed wiring on either end of the spindle.",
              "When the rotors are properly aligned, each key on the keyboard is connected to a unique electrical pathway through the series of contacts and internal wiring.",
              "Current, typically from a battery, flows through the pressed key, into the newly configured set of circuits and back out again, ultimately lighting one display lamp, which shows the output letter.",

              ".",
              ".",
              ", the operator would first press the A key, and the Z lamp might light, so Z would be the first letter of the ciphertext.",
              "The operator would next press N, and then X in the same fashion, and so on.",
              "Current flows from the battery (1) through a depressed bi-directional keyboard switch (2) to the plugboard (3).",
              "Next, it passes through the (unused in this instance, so shown closed) plug \"A\" (3) via the entry wheel (4), through the wiring of the three (Wehrmacht Enigma) or four (Kriegsmarine M4 and Abwehr variants) installed rotors (5), and enters the reflector (6).",
              "The reflector returns the current, via an entirely different path, back through the rotors (5) and entry wheel (4), proceeding through plug \"S\" (7) connected with a cable (8) to plug \"D\", and another bi-directional switch (9) to light the appropriate lamp.",
              "[18] The repeated changes of electrical path through an Enigma scrambler implement a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that provides Enigma's security.",
              "The diagram on the right shows how the electrical pathway changes with each key depression, which causes rotation of at least the right-hand rotor.",
              "Current passes into the set of rotors, into and back out of the reflector, and out through the rotors again.",
              "The greyed-out lines are other possible paths within each rotor;",
              "these are hard-wired from one side of each rotor to the other.",
              "The letter A encrypts differently with consecutive key presses, first to G, and then to C.",
              "This is because the right-hand rotor steps (rotates one position) on each key press, sending the signal on a completely different route.",
              "Eventually other rotors step with a key press.",
              "The rotors (alternatively wheels or drums, Walzen in German) form the heart of an Enigma machine.",
              "Each rotor is a disc approximately 10 cm (3.",
              "9 in) in diameter made from Ebonite or Bakelite with 26 brass, spring-loaded, electrical contact pins arranged in a circle on one face, with the other face housing 26 corresponding electrical contacts in the form of circular plates.",
              "The pins and contacts represent the alphabet \u2014 typically the 26 letters A\u2013Z, as will be assumed for the rest of this description.",
              "When the rotors are mounted side by side on the spindle, the pins of one rotor rest against the plate contacts of the neighbouring rotor, forming an electrical connection.",
              "Inside the body of the rotor, 26 wires connect each pin on one side to a contact on the other in a complex pattern.",
              "Most of the rotors are identified by Roman numerals, and each issued copy of rotor I, for instance, is wired identically to all others.",
              "The same is true for the special thin beta and gamma rotors used in the M4 naval variant.",
              "By itself, a rotor performs only a very simple type of encryption, a simple substitution cipher.",
              "For example, the pin corresponding to the letter E might be wired to the contact for letter T on the opposite face, and so on.",
              "Enigma's security comes from using several rotors in series (usually three or four) and the regular stepping movement of the rotors, thus implementing a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.",
              "Each rotor can be set to one of 26 possible starting positions when placed in an Enigma machine.",
              "After insertion, a rotor can be turned to the correct position by hand, using the grooved finger-wheel which protrudes from the internal Enigma cover when closed.",
              "In order for the operator to know the rotor's position, each has an alphabet tyre (or letter ring) attached to the outside of the rotor disc, with 26 characters (typically letters);",
              "one of these is visible through the window for that slot in the cover, thus indicating the rotational position of the rotor.",
              "In early models, the alphabet ring was fixed to the rotor disc.",
              "A later improvement was the ability to adjust the alphabet ring relative to the rotor disc.",
              "The position of the ring was known as the Ringstellung (\"ring setting\"), and that setting was a part of the initial setup needed prior to an operating session.",
              "In modern terms it was a part of the initialization vector.",
              "Each rotor contains one or more notches that control rotor stepping.",
              "In the military variants, the notches are located on the alphabet ring.",
              "The Army and Air Force Enigmas were used with several rotors, initially three.",
              "On 15 December 1938, this changed to five, from which three were chosen for a given session.",
              "Rotors were marked with Roman numerals to distinguish them: I, II, III, IV and V, all with single notches located at different points on the alphabet ring.",
              "This variation was probably intended as a security measure, but ultimately allowed the Polish Clock Method and British Banburismus attacks.",
              "The Naval version of the Wehrmacht Enigma had always been issued with more rotors than the other services: At first six, then seven, and finally eight.",
              "The additional rotors were marked VI, VII and VIII, all with different wiring, and had two notches, resulting in more frequent turnover.",
              "The four-rotor Naval Enigma (M4) machine accommodated an extra rotor in the same space as the three-rotor version.",
              "This was accomplished by replacing the original reflector with a thinner one and by adding a thin fourth rotor.",
              "That fourth rotor was one of two types, Beta or Gamma, and never stepped, but could be manually set to any of 26 positions.",
              "One of the 26 made the machine perform identically to the three-rotor machine.",
              "To avoid merely implementing a simple (solvable) substitution cipher, every key press caused one or more rotors to step by one twenty-sixth of a full rotation, before the electrical connections were made.",
              "This changed the substitution alphabet used for encryption, ensuring that the cryptographic substitution was different at each new rotor position, producing a more formidable polyalphabetic substitution cipher.",
              "The stepping mechanism varied slightly from model to model.",
              "The right-hand rotor stepped once with each keystroke, and other rotors stepped less frequently.",
              "The advancement of a rotor other than the left-hand one was called a turnover by the British.",
              "This was achieved by a ratchet and pawl mechanism.",
              "Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a ratchet.",
              "The alphabet ring of the rotor to the right normally prevented this.",
              "As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left.",
              "The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression.",
              "[19] For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor.",
              "Similarly for rotors two and three.",
              "For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.",
              "The first five rotors to be introduced (I\u2013V) contained one notch each, while the additional naval rotors VI, VII and VIII each had two notches.",
              "The position of the notch on each rotor was determined by the letter ring which could be adjusted in relation to the core containing the interconnections.",
              "The points on the rings at which they caused the next wheel to move were as follows.",
              "[20] The design also included a feature known as double-stepping.",
              "This occurred when each pawl aligned with both the ratchet of its rotor and the rotating notched ring of the neighbouring rotor.",
              "If a pawl engaged with a ratchet through alignment with a notch, as it moved forward it pushed against both the ratchet and the notch, advancing both rotors.",
              "In a three-rotor machine, double-stepping affected rotor two only.",
              "If, in moving forward, the ratchet of rotor three was engaged, rotor two would move again on the subsequent keystroke, resulting in two consecutive steps.",
              "Rotor two also pushes rotor one forward after 26 steps, but since rotor one moves forward with every keystroke anyway, there is no double-stepping.",
              "[19] This double-stepping caused the rotors to deviate from odometer-style regular motion.",
              "With three wheels and only single notches in the first and second wheels, the machine had a period of 26\u00d725\u00d726 = 16,900 (not 26\u00d726\u00d726, because of double-stepping).",
              "[19] Historically, messages were limited to a few hundred letters, and so there was no chance of repeating any combined rotor position during a single session, denying cryptanalysts valuable clues.",
              "To make room for the Naval fourth rotors, the reflector was made much thinner.",
              "The fourth rotor fitted into the space made available.",
              "No other changes were made, which eased the changeover.",
              "Since there were only three pawls, the fourth rotor never stepped, but could be manually set into one of 26 possible positions.",
              "A device that was designed, but not implemented before the war's end, was the Lu\u0308ckenfu\u0308llerwalze (gap-fill wheel) that implemented irregular stepping.",
              "It allowed field configuration of notches in all 26 positions.",
              "If the number of notches was a relative prime of 26 and the number of notches were different for each wheel, the stepping would be more unpredictable.",
              "Like the Umkehrwalze-D it also allowed the internal wiring to be reconfigured.",
              "[21] The current entry wheel (Eintrittswalze in German), or entry stator, connects the plugboard to the rotor assembly.",
              "If the plugboard is not present, the entry wheel instead connects the keyboard and lampboard to the rotor assembly.",
              "While the exact wiring used is of comparatively little importance to security, it proved an obstacle to Rejewski's progress during his study of the rotor wirings.",
              "The commercial Enigma connects the keys in the order of their sequence on a QWERTZ keyboard: Q\u2192A, W\u2192B, E\u2192C and so on.",

              "It did this by exchanging letters reciprocally, so that if A was plugged to G then pressing key A would lead to current entering the scrambler at the G position, and if G was pressed the current would enter at A.",

              "[41] Marian Rejewski quickly spotted the Germans' major procedural weaknesses of specifying a single indicator setting (Grundstellung) for all messages on a network for a day, and repeating the operator's chosen message key in the enciphered 6-letter indicator.",

              "Scores of messages would be enciphered by several cipher clerks, but some of those messages would have the same encrypted indicator.",
              "That meant that both clerks happened to choose the same three letter starting position.",
              "Such a collision should be rare with randomly selected starting positions, but lazy cipher clerks often chose starting positions such as \"AAA\", \"BBB\", or \"CCC\".",

              "After some thought, he realized one of his assumptions must be wrong.",

              "He made an inspired correct guess that it was in alphabetical order.",
              "[50] Britain's Dilly Knox was astonished when he learned, in July 1939, that the arrangement was so simple.",
              "[51][52] With the new assumption, Rejewski succeeded in solving the wiring of the rightmost rotor.",
              "The next month's cipher traffic used a different rotor in the rightmost position, so Rejewski used the same equations to solve for its wiring.",
              "With those rotors known, the remaining third rotor and the reflector wiring were determined.",
              "Without capturing a single rotor to reverse engineer, Rejewski had determined the logical structure of the machine.",

              "the replicas were called \"Enigma doubles\".",
              "The Poles now had the machine's wiring secrets, but they still needed to determine the daily keys for the cipher traffic.",
              "The Poles would examine the Enigma traffic and use the method of characteristics to determine the six permutations used for the indicator.",
              "The Poles would then use the grill method to determine the rightmost rotor and its position.",

              "The grill method also determined the plugboard wiring.",
              "The grill method could also be used to determine the middle and left rotors and their setting (and those tasks were simpler because there was no plugboard), but the Poles eventually compiled a catalog of the 3\u00d72\u00d726\u00d726=4056 possible Q permutations (reflector and 2 leftmost rotor permutations), so they could just look up the answer.",
              "The only remaining secret of the daily key would be the ring settings, and the Poles would attack that problem with brute force.",
              "Most messages would start with the three letters \"ANX\" (an is German for \"to\" and the \"X\" character was used as a space).",
              "It may take almost 26\u00d726\u00d726=17576 trials, but that was doable.",

              "The Germans made it easy for the Poles in the beginning.",
              "The rotor order only changed every quarter, so the Poles would not have to search for the rotor order.",
              "Later the Germans changed it every month, but that would not cause much trouble, either.",
              "Eventually, the Germans would change the rotor order every day, and late in the war (after Poland had been overrun) the rotor order might be changed during the day.",
              "The Poles kept improving their techniques as the Germans kept improving their security measures.",
              "Rejewski realised that, although the letters in the cycle groups were changed by the plugboard, the number and lengths of the cycles were unaffected\u2014in the example above, six cycle groups with lengths of 9, 9, 3, 3, 1 and 1.",
              "He described this invariant structure as the characteristic of the indicator setting.",
              "[dubious \u2013 discuss] There were only 105,456 possible rotor settings.",
              "[53][54] The Poles therefore set about creating a card catalog of these cycle patterns.",
              "[55] The cycle-length method would avoid using the grill.",

              "There are roughly 1 million possible cycle-length combinations and only 105,456 starting positions.",
              "Having found a starting position, the Poles would use an Enigma double to determine the cycles at that starting position without a plugboard.",
              "The Poles would then compare those cycles to the cycles with the (unknown) plugboard and solve for the plugboard permutation (a simple substitution cipher).",
              "Then the Poles could find the remaining secret of the ring settings with the ANX method.",
              "The problem was compiling the large card catalog.",

              "[56] Preparation of this catalog, using the cyclometer, was, said Rejewski, \"laborious and took over a year, but when it was ready, obtaining daily keys was a question of [some fifteen] minutes\".",
              "[57] However, on 1 November 1937, the Germans changed the Enigma reflector, necessitating the production of a new catalog\u2014\"a task which [says Rejewski] consumed, on account of our greater experience, probably somewhat less than a year's time\".",
              "[57] This characteristics method stopped working for German naval Enigma messages on 1 May 1937, when the indicator procedure was changed to one involving special codebooks (see German Navy 3-rotor Enigma below).",
              "[58] Worse still, on 15 September 1938 it stopped working for German army and air force messages because operators were then required to choose their own Grundstellung (initial rotor setting) for each message.",
              "Although German army message keys would still be double-enciphered, the day's keys would not be double-enciphered at the same initial setting, so the characteristic could no longer be found or exploited.",
              "Although the characteristics method no longer worked, the inclusion of the enciphered message key twice gave rise to a phenomenon that the cryptanalyst Henryk Zygalski was able to exploit.",
              "Sometimes (about one message in eight) one of the repeated letters in the message key enciphered to the same letter on both occasions.",
              "These occurrences were called samiczki[59] (in English, females\u2014a term later used at Bletchley Park).",

              "[62] About ten females from a day's messages were required for success.",
              "There was a set of 26 of these sheets for each of the six possible sequences wheel orders.",
              "Each sheet was for the left (slowest-moving) rotor.",

              "Rejewski wrote about how the device was operated: When the sheets were superposed and moved in the proper sequence and the proper manner with respect to each other, in accordance with a strictly defined program, the number of visible apertures gradually decreased.",
              "And, if a sufficient quantity of data was available, there finally remained a single aperture, probably corresponding to the right case, that is, to the solution.",
              "From the position of the aperture one could calculate the order of the rotors, the setting of their rings, and, by comparing the letters of the cipher keys with the letters in the machine, likewise permutation S;",
              "in other words, the entire cipher key.",
              "[64] The holes in the sheets were painstakingly cut with razor blades and in the three months before the next major setback, the sets of sheets for only two of the possible six wheel orders had been produced.",
              "[65] After Rejewski's characteristics method became useless, he invented an electro-mechanical device that was dubbed the bomba kryptologiczna, 'cryptologic bomb'.",

              "It took the place of about one hundred workers and shortened the time for obtaining a key to about two hours.",
              "[68] The cipher message transmitted the Grundstellung in the clear, so when a bomba found a match, it revealed the rotor order, the rotor positions, and the ring settings.",
              "The only remaining secret was the plugboard permutation.",
              "On 15 December 1938, the German Army increased the complexity of Enigma enciphering by introducing two additional rotors (IV and V).",

              "[117] With a combination of probable plaintext fragment and the fact that no letter could be enciphered as itself, a corresponding ciphertext fragment could often be tested by trying every possible alignment of the crib against the ciphertext, a procedure known as crib-dragging.",

              "This was useful in working out plugboard settings when a possible solution was being examined.",
              "For example, if the crib was the word WETTER (German for \"weather\") and a possible decrypt before the plugboard settings had been discovered, was TEWWER, it is easy to see that T with W are stecker partners.",
              "[119] These examples, although illustrative of the principles, greatly over-simplify the cryptanalysts' tasks.",
              "A fruitful source of cribs was re-encipherments of messages that had previously been decrypted either from a lower-level manual cipher or from another Enigma network.",
              "[120] This was called a kiss and happened particularly with German naval messages being sent in the dockyard cipher and repeated verbatim in an Enigma cipher.",
              "One German agent in Britain, Nathalie Sergueiew, code named Treasure, who had been turned to work for the Allies, was very verbose in her messages back to Germany, which were then re-transmitted on the Abwehr Enigma network.",

              "[121] Occasionally, when there was a particularly urgent need to solve German naval Enigma keys, such as when an Arctic convoy was about to depart, mines would be laid by the RAF in a defined position, whose grid reference in the German naval system did not contain any of the words (such as sechs or sieben) for which abbreviations or alternatives were sometimes used.",
              "[122] The warning message about the mines and then the \"all clear\" message, would be transmitted both using the dockyard cipher and the U-boat Enigma network.",

              "[124] When captured German Enigma operators revealed that they had been instructed to encipher numbers by spelling them out rather than using the top row of the keyboard, Alan Turing reviewed decrypted messages and determined that the word eins (\"one\") appeared in 90% of messages.",

              "[125] The British bombe was an electromechanical device designed by Alan Turing soon after he arrived at Bletchley Park in September 1939.",
              "Harold \"Doc\" Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) in Letchworth (35 kilometres (22 mi) from Bletchley) was the engineer who turned Turing's ideas into a working machine\u2014under the codename CANTAB.",

              "The bombe helped to identify the wheel order, the initial positions of the rotor cores, and the stecker partner of a specified letter.",
              "This was achieved by examining all 17,576 possible scrambler positions for a set of wheel orders on a comparison between a crib and the ciphertext, so as to eliminate possibilities that contradicted the Enigma's known characteristics.",
              "In the words of Gordon Welchman \"the task of the bombe was simply to reduce the assumptions of wheel order and scrambler positions that required 'further analysis' to a manageable number.\"",
              "[110] The demountable drums on the front of the bombe were wired identically to the connections made by Enigma's different rotors.",
              "Unlike them, however, the input and output contacts for the left-hand and the right-hand sides were separate, making 104 contacts between each drum and the rest of the machine.",
              "[127] This allowed a set of scramblers to be connected in series by means of 26-way cables.",
              "Electrical connections between the rotating drums' wiring and the rear plugboard were by means of metal brushes.",
              "When the bombe detected a scrambler position with no contradictions, it stopped and the operator would note the position before restarting it.",
              "Although Welchman had been given the task of studying Enigma traffic callsigns and discriminants, he knew from Turing about the bombe design and early in 1940, before the first pre-production bombe was delivered, he showed him an idea to increase its effectiveness.",
              "[128] It exploited the reciprocity in plugboard connections, to reduce considerably the number of scrambler settings that needed to be considered further.",

              "[21][129] A cryptanalyst would prepare a crib for comparison with the ciphertext.",
              "This was a complicated and sophisticated task, which later took the Americans some time to master.",
              "As well as the crib, a decision as to which of the many possible wheel orders could be omitted had to be made.",
              "Turing's Banburismus was used in making this major economy.",
              "The cryptanalyst would then compile a menu which specified the connections of the cables of the patch panels on the back of the machine, and a particular letter whose stecker partner was sought.",
              "The menu reflected the relationships between the letters of the crib and those of the ciphertext.",
              "Some of these formed loops (or closures as Turing called them) in a similar way to the cycles that the Poles had exploited.",
              "The reciprocal nature of the plugboard meant that no letter could be connected to more than one other letter.",
              "When there was a contradiction of two different letters apparently being stecker partners with the letter in the menu, the bombe would detect this, and move on.",
              "If, however, this happened with a letter that was not part of the menu, a false stop could occur.",
              "In refining down the set of stops for further examination, the cryptanalyst would eliminate stops that contained such a contradiction.",
              "The other plugboard connections and the settings of the alphabet rings would then be worked out before the scrambler positions at the possible true stops were tried out on Typex machines that had been adapted to mimic Enigmas.",
              "All the remaining stops would correctly decrypt the crib, but only the true stop would produce the correct plaintext of the whole message.",
              "[130] To avoid wasting scarce bombe time on menus that were likely to yield an excessive number of false stops, Turing performed a lengthy probability analysis (without any electronic aids) of the estimated number of stops per rotor order.",
              "It was adopted as standard practice only to use menus that were estimated to produce no more than four stops per wheel order.",
              "This allowed an 8-letter crib for a 3-closure menu, an 11-letter crib for a 2-closure menu and a 14-letter crib for a menu with only one closure.",
              "If there was no closure, at least 16 letters were required in the crib.",
              "[130] The longer the crib, however, the more likely it was that turn-over of the middle rotor would have occurred.",
              "The production model 3-rotor bombes contained 36 scramblers arranged in three banks of twelve.",

              "[50] Given that the Tunny indicators used 25 letters (excluding J) for 11 of the positions, but only 23 letters for the twelfth, he tried Kasiski's technique on the first impulse of the key characters using a repetition of 25 \u00d7 23 = 575.",
              "This did not produce a large number of repetitions in the columns, but Tutte did observe the phenomenon on a diagonal.",

              "Recognising that the prime factors of this number are 2, 7 and 41, he tried again with a period of 41 and \"got a rectangle of dots and crosses that was replete with repetitions\".",
              "[51] It was clear, however, that the sequence of first impulses was more complicated than that produced by a single wheel of 41 positions.",
              "Tutte called this component of the key \u03c71 (chi).",
              "He figured that there was another component, which was XOR-ed with this, that did not always change with each new character, and that this was the product of a wheel that he called \u03c81 (psi).",
              "The same applied for each of the five impulses\u2014indicated here by subscripts.",
              "So for a single character, the key K consisted of two components: The actual sequence of characters added by the psi wheels, including those when they do not advance, was referred to as the extended psi,[43] and symbolised by \u03c8\u2032 Tutte's derivation of the \u03c8 component was made possible by the fact that dots were more likely than not to be followed by dots, and crosses more likely than not to be followed by crosses.",

              "Once Tutte had made this breakthrough, the rest of the Research Section joined in to study the other impulses, and it was established that the five \u03c8 wheels all moved together under the control of two \u03bc (mu or \"motor\") wheels.",
              "Diagnosing the functioning of the Tunny machine in this way was a truly remarkable cryptanalytical achievement, and was described when Tutte was inducted as Officer of the Order of Canada in October 2001, as \"one of the greatest intellectual feats of World War II\".",
              "[52] In July 1942 Alan Turing spent a few weeks in the Research Section.",
              "[53] He had become interested in the problem of breaking Tunny from the keys that had been obtained from depths.",
              "[54] In July, he developed a method of deriving the cam settings (\"wheel breaking\") from a length of key.",
              "It became known as \"Turingery\"[55] (playfully dubbed \"Turingismus\" by Peter Ericsson, Peter Hilton and Donald Michie[54]) and introduced the important method of \"differencing\" on which much of the rest of solving Tunny keys in the absence of depths, was based.",
              "[55] The search was on for a process that would manipulate the ciphertext or key to produce a frequency distribution of characters that departed from the uniformity that the enciphering process aimed to achieve.",
              "Turing worked out that the XOR combination of the values of successive (adjacent) characters in a stream of ciphertext or key, emphasised any departures from a uniform distribution.",
              "[55][56] The resultant stream was called the difference (symbolised by the Greek letter \"delta\" \u0394)[57] because XOR is the same as modulo 2 subtraction.",
              "So, for a stream of characters S, the difference \u0394S was obtained as follows, where underline indicates the succeeding character: The stream S may be ciphertext Z, plaintext P, key K or either of its two components \u03c7 and \u03c8.",
              "The relationship amongst these elements still applies when they are differenced.",
              "For example, as well as: It is the case that: Similarly for the ciphertext, plaintext and key components: So: The reason that differencing provided a way into Tunny, was that although the frequency distribution of characters in the ciphertext could not be distinguished from a random stream, the same was not true for a version of the ciphertext from which the chi element of the key had been removed.",
              "This is because, where the plaintext contained a repeated character and the psi wheels did not move on, the differenced psi character (\u0394\u03c8) would be the null character ('/' at Bletchley Park).",
              "When XOR-ed with any character, this character has no effect, so in these circumstances, \u0394K = \u0394\u03c7.",

              "[59] So the delta de-chi \u0394D was: Repeated characters in the plaintext were more frequent both because of the characteristics of German (EE, TT, LL and SS are relatively common),[60] and because telegraphists frequently repeated the figures-shift and letters-shift characters[61] as their loss in an ordinary telegraph transmission could lead to gibberish.",
              "[62] To quote the General Report on Tunny: Turingery introduced the principle that the key differenced at one, now called \u0394\u039a, could yield information unobtainable from ordinary key.",
              "This \u0394 principle was to be the fundamental basis of nearly all statistical methods of wheel-breaking and setting.",

              "The periodicity of the chi and psi wheels for each impulse (41 and 43 respectively for the first impulse) is also reflected in the pattern of \u0394K.",
              "However, given that the psi wheels did not advance for every input character, as did the chi wheels, it was not simply a repetition of the pattern every 41 \u00d7 43 = 1763 characters for \u0394K1, but a more complex sequence.",
              "Turing's method of deriving the cam settings of the wheels from a length of key obtained from a depth, involved an iterative process.",
              "Given that the delta psi character was the null character '/' half of the time on average, an assumption that \u0394K = \u0394\u03c7 had a 50% chance of being correct.",
              "The process started by treating a particular \u0394K character as being the \u0394\u03c7 for that position.",
              "The resulting putative bit pattern of x and \u2022 for each chi wheel, was recorded on a sheet of paper that contained as many columns as there were characters in the key, and five rows representing the five impulses of the \u0394\u03c7.",
              "Given the knowledge from Tutte's work, of the periodicity of each of the wheels, this allowed the propagation of these values at the appropriate positions in the rest of the key.",
              "A set of five sheets, one for each of the chi wheels, was also prepared.",
              "These contained a set of columns corresponding in number to the cams for the appropriate chi wheel, and were referred to as a 'cage'.",
              "So the \u03c73 cage had 29 such columns.",
              "[64] Successive 'guesses' of \u0394\u03c7 values then produced further putative cam state values.",
              "These might either agree or disagree with previous assumptions, and a count of agreements and disagreements was made on these sheets.",
              "Where disagreements substantially outweighed agreements, the assumption was made that the \u0394\u03c8 character was not the null character '/', so the relevant assumption was discounted.",

              "However, by utilising the parallelism of the Mark 2 Colossus, the number of times the message had to be read could be reduced by a factor of five, from 1271 to 255.",
              "[106] Having identified possible \u03c71, \u03c72 start positions, the next step was to try to find the start positions for the other chi wheels.",

              "[108] These were used by the Wrens without recourse to the cryptanalysts if certain criteria were met.",
              "[109] In the above one of Small's examples, the next run was with the first two chi wheels set to the start positions found and three separate parallel explorations of the remaining three chi wheels.",
              "Such a run was called a \"short run\" and took about two minutes.",
              "[106] So the probable start positions for the chi wheels are: \u03c71 = 36, \u03c72 = 21, \u03c73 = 01, \u03c74 = 19, \u03c75 = 04.",
              "These had to be verified before the de-chi (D) message was passed to the Testery.",
              "This involved Colossus performing a count of the frequency of the 32 characters in \u0394D.",
              "Small describes the check of the frequency count of the \u0394D characters as being the \"acid test\",[111] and that practically every cryptanalyst and Wren in the Newmanry and Testery knew the contents of the following table by heart.",
              "If the derived start points of the chi wheels passed this test, the de-chi-ed message was passed to the Testery where manual methods were used to derive the psi and motor settings.",

              "The vulnerability of such codes to knowledge of the key was therefore their \u2018Achilles heel\u2019 and secure distribution of keys was a major operational problem.",

              "Therefore secure communications using a public key was considered impossible, and so not deserving of investigation.",
              "It was within this framework that James Ellis, a physics graduate of Imperial College, University of London, who moved to GCHQ from Dollis Hill in April 1965, was asked in 1969 to investigate methods of key distribution, which was seen as a most expensive and serious limitation to the increased use of secure communications in military contexts.",
