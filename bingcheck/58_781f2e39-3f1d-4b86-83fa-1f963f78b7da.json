    "query": "What is the origin of the word \"quarantine\" and how has its meaning evolved throughout history?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. The word \"quarantine\" originates from the Italian words **quaranta giorni** which mean **40 days**[^1^] [^4^]. This is because during the 14th century, when the bubonic plague was spreading in Europe, ships arriving in Venice from infected ports were required to sit at anchor for 40 days before landing[^1^] [^3^]. This was a measure to prevent the disease from reaching the shore and the city. The practice of quarantine was later adopted by other cities and countries, and the isolation period was sometimes extended or shortened depending on the situation[^2^]. The meaning of quarantine has evolved over time to refer to any restriction of movement or communication of people or goods that is designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests[^2^].",

              "The Word &quot;Quarantine&quot; Comes from the Italian Word &quot;Forty Days&quot;",
              "The term derives from \u201cquaranta giorni,\u201d meaning 40 days, and traces back to the 14th century when the city of Dubrovnik, now in Croatia, was under Venetian rule.",
              "The Great Pestilence, or the Great Plague, as it was known at the time, was devastating Europe.",
              "As a form of protection, Dubrovnik declared that all ships and people had to be isolated for 40 days before entering the city.",
              "Later, the disease would be referred to as the Black Death \u2014 probably because of the gloom it brought, although some theorize that the \u201cblack\u201d referred to the terrible dark bruising of the skin due to internal bleeding, a hallmark of the disease.",
              "Between 1345 and 1360, the plague wiped out roughly half of Europe\u2019s population.",
              "The cause was unknown, but it was clear that the disease was contagious.",
              "Once it took hold, it spread like wildfire.",
              "In Milan, doctors advised that victims should be walled up in their homes along with healthy family members \u2014 a measure that apparently worked, since Milan had the lowest death rate from the plague in all of Italy.",
              "It would not be until 1894 that Alexandre Yersin of France\u2019s Pasteur Institute would identify a bacterium as the causative agent while investigating an outbreak of the plague in Hong Kong.",
              "The bacterium, eventually named Yersinia pestis in his honour, is thought to have originated in Asia, where it found a hospitable environment in fleas, which would readily transmit it through their bites.",
              "Since fleas infested rats and mice, rodents that were regular passengers on ships, the disease spread throughout the Mediterranean and Europe.",
              "Infection with the bacterium can take several forms, with \u201cbubonic plague\u201d being the most notorious.",
              "This term originates from the Greek for \u201cgroin,\u201d due to the characteristic swellings of the lymph glands particularly in the groin, an area close to the legs, where flea bites are most likely to occur.",
              "In \u201csepticemic\u201d and \u201cpneumonic plague,\u201d bacteria enter the bloodstream and can be transmitted from person to person, especially though the coughing associated with pneumonic plague.",
              "When science fails to find an explanation for a phenomenon, superstition and quackery rush in to fill the void.",
              "And there certainly was no scientific explanation for the plague in the 14th century.",
              "The Church decreed that the Black Death was punishment for human sin.",
              "Lepers, because of their outward signs that resembled the plague, were blamed, as were astrological alignments and volcanic eruptions.",
              "\u201cFlagellants\u201d believed God\u2019s punishment could be avoided by stripping to the waist and whipping themselves as they marched from town to town.",
              "Jews were also targeted, accused of poisoning wells.",
              "Many Jewish communities in Europe were exterminated in hopes of bringing an end to the plague.",
              "In Cologne, thousands of Jews were burned alive after being accused of starting the plague.",
              "Black cats also became victims. They were thought to be witches in an animal form, casting their spell on the population.",
              "Since cats were a natural enemy of the disease-carrying rats, hunting them actually increased the spread of the plague.",
              "As far as treatments went, there were none.",
              "Since the plague was often accompanied by a terrible smell, people walked around with flowers under their noses hoping to ward off the stench and the disease.",
              "This, of course, did nothing.",
              "Neither did the burning of aromatic woods to purify the atmosphere.",
              "Other attempts to remedy the \u201cbad air\u201d included the ringing of bells and the firing of guns.",
              "Birds were released indoors so that the flapping of their wings would break up the pestilence.",
              "Bathing was thought to be dangerous, as was the consumption of olive oil.",
              "And one of the most bizarre pieces of advice given to men was that if they valued their lives, they must preserve their chastity.",
              "Apparently no such advice was given to women.",
              "The belief that pleasant smells were of some help persisted through the 17th century, when the Great Plague once again terrified Londoners.",
              "The classic children\u2019s rhyme about a \u201cpocketful of posies\u201d dates back to that time.",
              "Posies were flowers, but as the lyrics indicate, they did not do much good against the \u201cring of rosies,\u201d the rose-coloured rash in the form of a ring around flea bites.",

              "\u201cThey knew that you had to be very careful with goods that are being traded, because the disease could be spread on objects and surfaces, and that you tried your best to limit person-to-person contact,\u201d says Jane Stevens Crawshaw, a senior lecturer in early modern European history at Oxford Brookes University.",
              "The Adriatic port city of Ragusa (modern-day Dubrovnik) was the first to pass legislation requiring the mandatory quarantine of all incoming ships and trade caravans in order to screen for infection.",
              "The order, which miraculously survived in the Dubrovnik archives, reads that on July 27, 1377, the city\u2019s Major Council passed a law \u201cwhich stipulates that those who come from plague-infested areas shall not enter [Ragusa] or its district unless they spend a month on the islet of Mrkan or in the town of Cavtat, for the purpose of disinfection.",
              "\u201d Mrkan was an uninhabited rocky island south of the city and Cavtat was situated at the end of the caravan road used by overland traders en route to Ragusa, writes Zlata Blazina Tomic in Expelling the Plague: The Health Office and the Implementation of Quarantine in Dubrovnik, 1377-1533.",
              "Tomic says that some medical historians consider Ragusa\u2019s quarantine edict one of the highest achievements of medieval medicine.",

              "READ MORE: Pandemics that Changed History The 30-day period stipulated in the 1377 quarantine order was known in Italian as a trentino, but Stevens Crawshaw says that doctors and officials also had the authority to impose shorter or longer stays.",

              "After childbirth, for example, a new mother was expected to rest for 40 days.",
              "Even with the new quarantine law, Ragusa continued to be hit hard by aftershock outbreaks of the plague in 1391 and 1397.",
              "As a maritime city that survived on trade, it would have been impossible to completely wall off Ragusa to disease without gutting the economy.",

              "Data on NPIs were collected from official government websites as well as from media sources.",
              "Results: Measures such as travel restrictions have been implemented in multiple countries and appears to have slowed the geographic spread of COVID-19 and reduced initial case numbers.",
              "We find that, due to the relatively sparse information on the differences with and without interventions, it is difficult to quantitatively assess the efficacy of many interventions.",

              "As of the 21 March 2020, over 271,364 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been confirmed globally across 174 countries and regions 1.",
              "Sustained human-to-human transmission has now been observed in multiple countries outside of mainland China including Italy, Japan, and South Korea with 47,021, 1,007, and 8,799 cases reported respectively 1.",

              "g. quarantine, contact tracing, wide-scale proactive school closures) SD measures 20.",
              "It is important to note that most countries and regions have implemented isolation of cases, contact tracing and quarantine in response to the first imported cases from Hubei, China (Japan, Thailand, South Korea, USA, Singapore since mid- to late-January) 9, 21.",
              "Other countries have introduced interventions in response to a large number of newly reported cases (Italy and Iran) more recently 22, 23.",
              "Many SD interventions have focused on public messaging to encourage positive behaviour change.",
              "For example, encouraging individuals to work remotely, avoid crowded areas, and restrict non-essential travel.",
              "As such interventions are not enforced, its effectiveness will be dependent on public compliance.",
              "A recent YouGov survey found that risk perception differed by country 24.",
              "A higher proportion of respondents in Asian countries reported being concerned about their risk of being infected compared to European or North American countries.",

              "g. 83% in Hong Kong).",
              "Advocating for remote working have led to the greatest positive behavior in mainland China and Hong Kong, with 67% and 45% reportedly avoiding going to the office, respectively.",
              "These high figures compared to other countries in Asia may be due to implementation of remote working for government offices.",
              "Outside of Hubei province, China where the long-term implementation of substantial SD layered with the strict movement restrictions in Wuhan City and Hubei have reduced the reproduction number R 0, estimated to be greater than 2 during the early stages of the outbreak, it is likely too early to be able to evaluate or quantify the true effectiveness of specific SD interventions on the epidemic in affected countries or regions 25\u2013 28.",
              "Indeed as most countries have implemented a range of non-pharmaceutical measures such as travel restrictions, health screenings, and advice such as hand and cough hygiene intended to prompt behaviour change, it is difficult to quantify the effectiveness of SD in the absence of other control measures.",
              "However early studies have found that the relative effectiveness of case isolation and contact tracing was greater than travel restrictions or contact reduction 18.",
              "They additionally found that the rapid implementation of these combined NPIs, conducted one, two, or three weeks earlier could have reduced case numbers by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively up to three months from their introduction.",
              "However, the impact that these NPIs beyond May 2020 remains unknown.",
              "Studies from pandemic influenza have also shown that the timing and duration of SD interventions will impact its effectiveness.",
              "For example, for influenza there are restricted benefits to time-limited interventions, with the potential reduction in mortality by up to 30% being eroded if the control was applied too late or lifted too early 29.",
              "When considering targeted layered containment strategies, Ferguson et al.",
              "found that the effectiveness of social distancing, rapid case ascertainment, and targeted prophylaxis were similar, with school closures playing an important role in each scenario, especially if values of R0 were \u22642 8.",
              "A systematic review of the effectiveness of SD measures for pandemic influenza identified varying levels of evidence for avoiding crowding, workplace measures, and case isolation in the community 18.",
              "These particular SD measures are more resource intensive and are socially and economically disruptive.",
              "For COVID-19 most isolation has thus far been in a hospital setting.",
              "As more cases are reported in the community, protocols around case isolation may change towards voluntary home isolation or household quarantine.",
              "Household quarantine for influenza was found to have an overall effect, but within an affected household could increase risk of infection amongst quarantined individuals.",
              "Other resource intensive measures such as contact tracing were found to be effective in reducing influenza transmission when used in combination with other interventions such as quarantine and isolation.",
              "However this is not feasible in all settings or sustainable beyond the early phase of an epidemic when there are fewer cases.",
              "For influenza where children are known to be important for transmission as they are more susceptible to infection, are more infectious, and contribute to higher person-to-person contact rates, there was evidence that school closures could have a substantial effect on reducing transmission.",
              "However, the role of children in transmission of COVID-19 is still unknown.",
              "If children have the same or similar role in transmission as for influenza, then we could expect the same level of impact as has been estimated for influenza.",
              "However, across all SD measures the most important consideration is the feasibility of its long-term implementation.",
              "The most effective measures in terms of stopping transmission, for example the lockdown of entire cities as implemented in Hubei province, are also the most socially and economically disruptive 5.",
              "As many measures start to be lifted across cities in China, as transmission has effectively been paused, we may observe a bounce-back effect.",
              "Countries and regions are therefore faced with the difficult task of balancing economically and socially sustainable and acceptable control measures which are likely to have the largest overall impact with the need to control growing case numbers.",

              "Cite This Article In the new millennium, the centuries-old strategy of quarantine is becoming a powerful component of the public health response to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases.",
              "During the 2003 pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the use of quarantine, border controls, contact tracing, and surveillance proved effective in containing the global threat in just over 3 months.",
              "For centuries, these practices have been the cornerstone of organized responses to infectious disease outbreaks.",
              "However, the use of quarantine and other measures for controlling epidemic diseases has always been controversial because such strategies raise political, ethical, and socioeconomic issues and require a careful balance between public interest and individual rights.",
              "In a globalized world that is becoming ever more vulnerable to communicable diseases, a historical perspective can help clarify the use and implications of a still-valid public health strategy.",
              "The risk for deadly infectious diseases with pandemic potential (e.",
              "g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) is increasing worldwide, as is the risk for resurgence of long-standing infectious diseases (e.",
              "g., tuberculosis) and for acts of biological terrorism.",
              "To lessen the risk from these new and resurging threats to public health, authorities are again using quarantine as a strategy for limiting the spread of communicable diseases (1).",
              "The history of quarantine\u2014not in its narrower sense, but in the larger sense of restraining the movement of persons or goods on land or sea because of a contagious disease\u2014has not been given much attention by historians of public health.",
              "Yet, a historical perspective of quarantine can contribute to a better understanding of its applications and can help trace the long roots of stigma and prejudice from the time of the Black Death and early outbreaks of cholera to the 1918 influenza pandemic (2) and to the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century, the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak (3).",
              "Quarantine (from the Italian \u201cquaranta,\u201d meaning 40) was adopted as an obligatory means of separating persons, animals, and goods that may have been exposed to a contagious disease.",
              "Since the fourteenth century, quarantine has been the cornerstone of a coordinated disease-control strategy, including isolation, sanitary cordons, bills of health issued to ships, fumigation, disinfection, and regulation of groups of persons who were believed to be responsible for spreading the infection (4,5).",
              "Organized institutional responses to disease control began during the plague epidemic of 1347\u20131352 (6).",
              "The plague was initially spread by sailors, rats, and cargo arriving in Sicily from the eastern Mediterranean (6,7);",
              "it quickly spread throughout Italy, decimating the populations of powerful city-states like Florence, Venice, and Genoa (8).",
              "The pestilence then moved from ports in Italy to ports in France and Spain (9).",
              "From northeastern Italy, the plague crossed the Alps and affected populations in Austria and central Europe.",
              "Toward the end of the fourteenth century, the epidemic had abated but not disappeared;",
              "outbreaks of pneumonic and septicemic plague occurred in different cities during the next 350 years (8).",
              "Medicine was impotent against plague (8);",
              "the only way to escape infection was to avoid contact with infected persons and contaminated objects.",
              "Thus, some city-states prevented strangers from entering their cities, particularly, merchants (10) and minority groups, such as Jews and persons with leprosy.",
              "A sanitary cordon\u2014not to be broken on pain of death\u2014was imposed by armed guards along transit routes and at access points to cities.",
              "Implementation of these measures required rapid, firm action by authorities, including prompt mobilization of repressive police forces.",
              "A rigid separation between healthy and infected persons was initially accomplished through the use of makeshift camps (10).",
              "Quarantine was first introduced in 1377 in Dubrovnik on Croatia\u2019s Dalmatian Coast (11), and the first permanent plague hospital (lazaretto) was opened by the Republic of Venice in 1423 on the small island of Santa Maria di Nazareth.",
              "The lazaretto was commonly referred to as Nazarethum or Lazarethum because of the resemblance of the word lazaretto to the biblical name Lazarus (12).",
              "In 1467, Genoa adopted the Venetian system, and in 1476 in Marseille, France, a hospital for persons with leprosy was converted into a lazaretto.",
              "Lazarettos were located far enough away from centers of habitation to restrict the spread of disease but close enough to transport the sick.",
              "Where possible, lazarettos were located so that a natural barrier, such as the sea or a river, separated them from the city;",
              "when natural barriers were not available, separation was achieved by encircling the lazaretto with a moat or ditch.",
              "In ports, lazarettos consisted of buildings used to isolate ship passengers and crew who had or were suspected of having plague.",
              "Merchandise from ships was unloaded to designated buildings.",
              "Procedures for so-called \u201cpurgation\u201d of the various products were prescribed minutely;",
              "wool, yarn, cloth, leather, wigs, and blankets were considered the products most likely to transmit disease.",
              "Treatment of the goods consisted of continuous ventilation;",
              "wax and sponge were immersed in running water for 48 hours.",
              "It is not known why 40 days was chosen as the length of isolation time needed to avoid contamination, but it may have derived from Hippocrates theories regarding acute illnesses.",
              "Another theory is that the number of days was connected to the Pythagorean theory of numbers.",
              "The number 4 had particular significance.",
              "Forty days was the period of the biblical travail of Jesus in the desert.",
              "Forty days were believed to represent the time necessary for dissipating the pestilential miasma from bodies and goods through the system of isolation, fumigation, and disinfection.",
              "In the centuries that followed, the system of isolation was improved (13\u201315).",
              "In connection with the Levantine trade, the next step taken to reduce the spread of disease was to establish bills of health that detailed the sanitary status of a ship\u2019s port of origin (14).",
              "After notification of a fresh outbreak of plague along the eastern Mediterranean Sea, port cities to the west were closed to ships arriving from plague-infected areas (15).",
              "The first city to perfect a system of maritime cordons was Venice, which because of its particular geographic configuration and its prominence as a commercial center, was dangerously exposed (12,15,16).",
              "The arrival of boats suspected of carrying plague was signaled with a flag that would be seen by lookouts on the church tower of San Marco.",
              "The captain was taken in a lifeboat to the health magistrate\u2019s office and was kept in an enclosure where he spoke through a window;",
              "thus, conversation took place at a safe distance.",
              "This precaution was based on a mistaken hypothesis (i.",
              "e., that \u201cpestilential air\u201d transmitted all communicable diseases), but the precaution did prevent direct person-to-person transmission through inhalation of contaminated aerosolized droplets.",
              "The captain had to show proof of the health of the sailors and passengers and provide information on the origin of merchandise on board.",
              "If there was suspicion of disease on the ship, the captain was ordered to proceed to the quarantine station, where passengers and crew were isolated and the vessel was thoroughly fumigated and retained for 40 days (13,17).",
              "This system, which was used by Italian cities, was later adopted by other European countries.",
              "The first English quarantine regulations, drawn up in 1663, provided for the confinement (in the Thames estuary) of ships with suspected plague-infected passengers or crew.",
              "In 1683 in Marseille, new laws required that all persons suspected of having plague be quarantined and disinfected.",
              "In ports in North America, quarantine was introduced during the same decade that attempts were being made to control yellow fever, which first appeared in New York and Boston in 1688 and 1691, respectively (18).",
              "In some colonies, the fear of smallpox outbreaks, which coincided with the arrival of ships, induced health authorities to order mandatory home isolation of persons with smallpox (19), even though another controversial strategy, inoculation, was being used to protect against the disease.",
              "In the United States, quarantine legislation, which until 1796 was the responsibility of states, was implemented in port cities threatened by yellow fever from the West Indies (18).",
              "In 1720, quarantine measures were prescribed during an epidemic of plague that broke out in Marseille and ravaged the Mediterranean seaboard of France and caused great apprehension in England.",
              "In England, the Quarantine Act of 1710 was renewed in 1721 and 1733 and again in 1743 during the disastrous epidemic at Messina, Sicily (19).",
              "A system of active surveillance was established in the major Levantine cities.",
              "The network, formed by consuls of various countries, connected the great Mediterranean ports of western Europe (15).",
              "By the eighteenth century, the appearance of yellow fever in Mediterranean ports of France, Spain, and Italy forced governments to introduce rules involving the use of quarantine (18).",
              "But in the nineteenth century, another, even more frightening scourge, cholera, was approaching (20).",
              "Cholera emerged during a period of increasing globalization caused by technological changes in transportation, a drastic decrease in travel time by steamships and railways, and a rise in trade.",
              "Cholera, the \u201cAsiatic disease,\u201d reached Europe in 1830 and the United States in 1832, terrifying the populations (21\u201324).",
              "Despite progress regarding the cause and transmission of cholera, there was no effective medical response (25).",
              "During the first wave of cholera outbreaks, the strategies adopted by health officials were essentially those that had been used against plague.",
              "New lazarettos were planned at western ports, and an extensive structure was established near Bordeaux, France (26).",
              "At European ports, ships were barred entry if they had \u201cunclean licenses\u201d (i.",
              "e., ships arriving from regions where cholera was present) (27).",
              "In cities, authorities adopted social interventions and the traditional health tools.",
              "For example, travelers who had contact with infected persons or who came from a place where cholera was present were quarantined, and sick persons were forced into lazarettos.",
              "In general, local authorities tried to keep marginalized members of the population away from the cities (27).",
              "In 1836 in Naples, health officials hindered the free movement of prostitutes and beggars, who were considered carriers of contagion and, thus, a danger to the healthy urban population (27,28).",
              "This response involved powers of intervention unknown during normal times, and the actions generated widespread fear and resentment.",
              "In some countries, the suspension of personal liberty provided the opportunity\u2014using special laws\u2014to stop political opposition.",
              "However, the cultural and social context differed from that in previous centuries.",
              "For example, the increasing use of quarantine and isolation conflicted with the affirmation of citizens\u2019 rights and growing sentiments of personal freedom fostered by the French Revolution of 1789.",
              "In England, liberal reformers contested both quarantine and compulsory vaccination against smallpox.",
              "Social and political tensions created an explosive mixture, culminating in popular rebellions and uprisings, a phenomenon that affected numerous European countries (29).",
              "In the Italian states, in which revolutionary groups had taken the cause of unification and republicanism (27), cholera epidemics provided a justification (i.",
              "e., the enforcement of sanitary measures) for increasing police power.",
              "By the middle of the nineteenth century, an increasing number of scientists and health administrators began to allege the impotence of sanitary cordons and maritime quarantine against cholera.",
              "These old measures depended on the idea that contagion was spread through the interpersonal transmission of germs or by contaminated clothing and objects (30).",
              "This theory justified the severity of measures used against cholera;",
              "after all, it had worked well against the plague.",
              "The length of quarantine (40 days) exceeded the incubation period for the plague bacillus, providing sufficient time for the death of the infected fleas needed to transmit the disease and of the biological agent, Yersinia pestis.",
              "However, quarantine was almost irrelevant as a primary method for preventing yellow fever or cholera.",
              "A rigid maritime cordon could only be effective in protecting small islands.",
              "During the terrifying cholera epidemic of 1835\u20131836, the island of Sardinia was the only Italian region to escape cholera, thanks to surveillance by armed men who had orders to prevent, by force, any ship that attempted to disembark persons or cargo on the coast (27).",

              "In addition, quarantine inspired a false sense of security, which was dangerous to public health because it diverted persons from taking the correct precautions.",
              "International cooperation and coordination was stymied by the lack of agreement regarding the use of quarantine.",
              "The discussion among scientists, health administrators, diplomatic bureaucracies, and governments dragged on for decades, as demonstrated in the debates in the International Sanitary Conferences (31), particularly after the opening, in 1869, of the Suez Canal, which was perceived as a gate for the diseases of the Orient (32).",
              "Despite pervasive doubts regarding the effectiveness of quarantine, local authorities were reluctant to abandon the protection of the traditional strategies that provided an antidote to population panic, which, during a serious epidemic, could produce chaos and disrupt public order (33).",
              "A turning point in the history of quarantine came after the pathogenic agents of the most feared epidemic diseases were identified between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.",
              "International prophylaxis against cholera, plague, and yellow fever began to be considered separately.",
              "In light of the newer knowledge, a restructuring of the international regulations was approved in 1903 by the 11th Sanitary Conference, at which the famed convention of 184 articles was signed (31).",

              "During the second influenza pandemic of the twentieth century, the \u201cAsian flu\u201d pandemic of 1957\u20131958, some countries implemented measures to control spread of the disease.",
              "The illness was generally milder than that caused by the 1918 influenza, and the global situation differed.",
              "Understanding of influenza had advanced greatly: the pathogenic agent had been identified in 1933, vaccines for seasonal epidemics were available, and antimicrobial drugs were available to treat complications.",
              "In addition, the World Health Organization had implemented a global influenza surveillance network that provided early warning when novel influenza (H2N2) virus, began spreading in China in February 1957 and worldwide later that year.",

              "SARS, which originated in Guangdong Province, China, in 2003, spread along air-travel routes and quickly became a global threat because of its rapid transmission and high mortality rate and because protective immunity in the general population, effective antiviral drugs, and vaccines were lacking.",
              "However, compared with influenza, SARS had lower infectivity and a longer incubation period, providing time for instituting a series of containment measures that worked well (39).",

              "In Canada, public health authorities asked persons who might have been exposed to SARS to voluntarily quarantine themselves.",
              "In China, police cordoned off buildings, organized checkpoints on roads, and even installed Web cameras in private homes.",
              "There was stronger control of persons in the lower social strata (village-level governments were empowered to isolate workers from SARS-affected areas).",
              "Public health officials in some areas resorted to repressive police measures, using laws with extremely severe punishments (including the death penalty), against those who violated quarantine.",
              "As had occurred in the past, the strategies adopted in some countries during this public health emergency contributed to the discrimination and stigmatization of persons and communities and raised protests and complaints against limitations and travel restrictions.",
              "More than half a millennium since quarantine became the core of a multicomponent strategy for controlling communicable disease outbreaks, traditional public health tools are being adapted to the nature of individual diseases and to the degree of risk for transmission and are being effectively used to contain outbreaks, such as the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic.",
              "The history of quarantine\u2014how it began, how it was used in the past, and how it is used in the modern era\u2014is a fascinating topic in history of sanitation.",
              "Over the centuries, from the time of the Black Death to the first pandemics of the twenty-first century, public health control measures have been an essential way to reduce contact between persons sick with a disease and persons susceptible to the disease.",
              "In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, such measures helped contain infection, delay the spread of disease, avert terror and death, and maintain the infrastructure of society.",
              "Quarantine and other public health practices are effective and valuable ways to control communicable disease outbreaks and public anxiety, but these strategies have always been much debated, perceived as intrusive, and accompanied in every age and under all political regimes by an undercurrent of suspicion, distrust, and riots.",
              "These strategic measures have raised (and continue to raise) a variety of political, economic, social, and ethical issues (39,40).",
              "In the face of a dramatic health crisis, individual rights have often been trampled in the name of public good.",
              "The use of segregation or isolation to separate persons suspected of being infected has frequently violated the liberty of outwardly healthy persons, most often from lower classes, and ethnic and marginalized minority groups have been stigmatized and have faced discrimination.",
              "This feature, almost inherent in quarantine, traces a line of continuity from the time of plague to the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic.",
              "The historical perspective helps with understanding the extent to which panic, connected with social stigma and prejudice, frustrated public health efforts to control the spread of disease.",
              "During outbreaks of plague and cholera, the fear of discrimination and mandatory quarantine and isolation led the weakest social groups and minorities to escape affected areas and, thus, contribute to spreading the disease farther and faster, as occurred regularly in towns affected by deadly disease outbreaks.",
              "But in the globalized world, fear, alarm, and panic, augmented by global media, can spread farther and faster and, thus, play a larger role than in the past.",
              "Furthermore, in this setting, entire populations or segments of populations, not just persons or minority groups, are at risk of being stigmatized.",
              "In the face of new challenges posed in the twenty-first century by the increasing risk for the emergence and rapid spread of infectious diseases, quarantine and other public health tools remain central to public health preparedness.",

              "General dissatisfaction with quarantine practice led to the convening of the first international sanitary conference in Paris in 1851.",

              "Commercially, the conflict was between countries with considerable vested interests in quarantine and major maritime nations, which favoured its abolition.",
              "Medically, the opposition was between the \u201ccontagionists,\u201d who believed that diseases such as cholera and plague were transmitted from person to person, and the \u201cmiasmatists,\u201d who thought that certain diseases were caused by infected atmosphere and that the remedy was sanitation, not quarantine.",
              "Despite these differences, agreement was reached on some important general principles for the standardization of quarantine procedures.",
              "The convention and regulations were not generally ratified, however.",
              "In the next 50 years a succession of sanitary conferences, with better understanding of the epidemiology of infectious disease, reached some agreement on the maximum permissible measures of control and on the removal of the most irksome restrictions of quarantine practice.",

              "In plague, isolation is important to prevent person-to-person spread, but it does not have an effect on the main route of infection\u2014by bites of the rat flea.",
              "It is inappropriate to isolate human cases of a disease that is usually acquired by contact with infected farm animals or their products, as in the case of brucellosis.",
              "Even for diseases in which it may protect individuals, isolation will often have little effect on the general epidemic;",
