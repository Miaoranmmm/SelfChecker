    "response": "The gut microbiome is a collection of trillions of microorganisms that live in your intestines and affect your health in many ways. It helps you digest food, produce vitamins, support your immune system, and prevent harmful bacteria from colonizing your gut[^1^].\n\nThe most effective way to promote and maintain a healthy gut microbiome is to eat a balanced diet that is rich in fiber, prebiotics, and probiotics. Fiber and prebiotics are substances that feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut, while probiotics are live bacteria that you can consume from fermented foods or supplements[^1^] [^2^].\n\nSome examples of foods that contain fiber and prebiotics are fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds. Some examples of foods that contain probiotics are yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, tempeh, and kombucha[^1^] [^2^].\n\nSome dietary and lifestyle habits that have been shown to have a positive impact on gut health are:\n\n- Eating a variety of plant-based foods to increase the diversity of your gut bacteria[^1^].\n- Avoiding or limiting processed foods, fast foods, sugar, and alcohol that can disrupt your gut balance[^2^].\n- Drinking enough water to keep your gut hydrated and prevent constipation[^2^].\n- Exercising regularly to stimulate your gut motility and reduce stress[^2^].\n- Getting enough sleep to allow your gut to rest and repair[^2^].\n- Managing stress levels to avoid harming your gut barrier and immune system[^2^].\n\nBy following these tips, you can improve your gut microbiome and enjoy the benefits of a healthy digestive system.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "When operating optimally and under normal circumstances, the alliance between the immune system and gut microbiota interweaves the innate and adaptive arms of immunity in a dialog that selects, adjusts, and terminates responses in the most appropriate manner [2].",
              "Gut microbial metabolites play key roles in inflammatory signaling, interacting both directly and indirectly with host immune cells [1].",
              "Some bacteria, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis, and Anaerostipes butyraticus [3] digest complex carbohydrates via fermentation, creating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) [4,5,6] that modulate host immune cells and serve as a carbon source for colonocytes [7,8].",
              "SCFAs are fatty acids with fewer than six carbon atoms, mainly consisting of acetate, propionate, and butyrate [1,9].",
              "Collectively, SCFAs are considered the most abundant microbiota-derived metabolites in the gut lumen and are enriched by their vigorous capacity to reduce intestinal inflammation, protect against pathogen invasion, and maintain barrier integrity largely by activating G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or inducing their suppressive effects on histone deacetylases (HDACs), influencing gene expression.",

              "SCFAs can have anti-inflammatory effects on host immune cells, regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) through activation of macrophages and DCs [13].",
              "Several studies have demonstrated that butyrate induces the differentiation of T-regulatory (Treg) cells in vitro and in vivo, and ameliorates the development of colitis induced by the adoptive transfer of CD4+CD45RBhi T-cells in Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice [14].",
              "Butyrate also modulates the differentiation of anti-inflammatory forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3), which has an essential role in the suppression of inflammatory responses [14,15].",
              "Moreover, butyrate controls the cytokine production profile of T-helper (Th) cells and promotes intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, which can help limit exposure of the mucosal immune system to luminal microbes and prevent aberrant inflammatory responses [16].",
              "By binding GPR109a on DCs and macrophages, the presence of butyrate leads to increased expression of IL-10 and decreased production of IL-6, resulting in increased Treg cell development while inhibiting the expansion of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells.",
              "Therefore, GPR109a potentiates anti-inflammatory pathways, induces apoptosis, and protects against inflammation-induced colon cancer [11].",

              "Conversely, another study suggests butyrate interaction on L-cells might be mediated by GPR41, since increases in the secretion of GLP-1 induced by butyrate were associated with increased GPR41 expression.",

              "The regulation of blood glucose concentrations exerted by SCFAs can occur through multiple mechanisms, including reduced insulin resistance from decreased inflammation, the contemporarily increased GLP-1 secretion that stimulates insulin release, and improved beta-cell function that contributes to the amelioration of glucose homeostasis.",
              "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including both Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory conditions of the GI tract, resulting from altered interactions between gut microbiota and the intestinal immune system.",

              "Although studies to date have failed to reveal a single etiological pathogenic species responsible for IBD, the current view is that while individual species may play significant roles in immunomodulation, collateral damage to the gut microbiota due to their loss or overabundance plays a key role in the persistence of inflammatory responses in chronic disease [97,110,111].",
              "Evidence for the role of gut microbiota in IBD pathogenesis is provided through studies demonstrating that antibiotic use can reduce or prevent inflammation in both IBD patients and murine models of disease.",
              "Initial studies performed by Rutgeerts (1991) [112] and D\u2019Haens (1998) [113] demonstrated the involvement of gut microbiota in IBD using clinical experiments that showed that diversion of the fecal stream improved symptoms of CD, and that postoperative exposure of the terminal ileum to luminal contents increased inflammation.",

              "In healthy individuals, the gut barrier consists of an intact layer of epithelial cells that are tightly connected by a surrounding system of tight junction strands from the claudin protein family.",
              "Gut barrier dysfunctions observed in patients with mild to moderately active CD result mostly from the up-regulation of claudin 2, and the down-regulation and redistribution of claudins 5 and 8, leading to discontinuous tight junctions [114,115].",
              "In IBD patients, gut dysbiosis occurs due to increasing colonization of an enteric pathogen, host-mediated inflammatory responses, or a combination of the two.",

              "In mice, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis non-inflammatory infection with Citrobacter jejuni has decreased the total number of colonic bacteria, but DSS-induced inflammation promoted overgrowth of Enterobacteriaceae.",
              "Both conditions were necessary to reach maximal gut dysbiosis [118,119].",
              "Commensal gut bacteria can also alter pools of available metabolites, thereby modifying host-generated signaling molecules.",
              "Harnessing the ability of the microbiota to affect host immunity is considered an important therapeutic strategy for patients with IBD.",
              "Notably, numerous studies have documented alterations in microbiota associated with CD, particularly reduced abundances of the phylum Firmicutes and a concomitant increase in Proteobacteria [114,120].",
              "Specifically, Clostridium clusters IV and XIV have exhibited relatively lower abundance in IBD patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting their loss may deplete the microbiota of key anti-inflammatory metabolites or other cell-associated immunomodulatory ligands.",
              "Both CD and UC gut microbiota exhibit general decreases in taxonomic diversity relative to healthy controls, along with phylum-level decreases in Firmicutes and increases in Proteobacteria.",
              "The abundance of bacteria from the Clostridia family have also been altered, with decreases in Roseburia and Faecalibacterium and increases in Ruminococcus and the Enterobacteriaceae family in IBD patients [120,121].",
              "Together, these findings suggest that IBD is ultimately linked to inflammation that may be largely associated with microbially derived or modified metabolites.",
              "Mutations of the NOD2 gene increase susceptibility to CD.",
              "PRRs, including NOD-like receptors (NLRs), TLRs, and others, play a crucial role in the innate immune response by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from a diverse collection of microbial pathogens.",
              "Evidence from IBD genetic studies have demonstrated that several innate immune genes have functionally relevant polymorphisms. Of those studied, NOD2 genetic variants conferred the greatest risk.",
              "NOD2 functions as an intracellular sensor for microbial pathogens and plays an important role in epithelial defense.",
              "NOD2, a member of the NLR family, functions as an important intracellular sensor for bacteria, detecting peptidoglycans through the recognition of muramyl dipeptide [121].",

              "After binding with intracellular muramyl dipeptide (MDP), NOD2 recruits the adaptor protein RIP2 to activate NF-\u03baB and initiate a pro-inflammatory response.",
              "NOD2 was the first identified gene strongly associated with susceptibility to CD patients, and NOD2 loss of function mutations occur in IBD patients.",
              "In one study, the number of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were reduced significantly in NOD2\u2212/\u2212 mice, and the residual IELs displayed reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis.",
              "NOD2 signaling maintained IEL abundances via recognition of gut microbiota and IL-15 production.",
              "Recognition of gut microbiota by NOD2 is important to maintain the homeostasis of IELs, providing a clue linking NOD2 variation to impaired innate immunity and higher susceptibility to CD [121].",
              "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs and is characterized by autoantibody production, reflecting dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Loss of tolerance to various self-antigens is a critical feature of SLE.",
              "While the pathogenesis is not fully understood, a combination of environmental factors, host genetic background, and gut microbiota can contribute to SLE [122].",
              "The associated loss of immune tolerance can be caused by altered gut microbial composition, with both experimental and clinical models providing evidence of the strong relationship between gut microbiota and SLE [123,124,125].",
              "Gut microbiota can stimulate an immune response against the host if the mechanisms of tolerance fail for any of several reasons.",
              "In normal cell apoptotic conditions, the host immune system does not involve the release of nuclear antigens.",
              "In SLE, however, external stimuli such as bacterial infection, toxins, or ultraviolet (UV) light induce DNA damage and keratinocyte apoptosis.",

              "Type I IFNs and other cytokines promote B-cell maturation and survival, inducing the B-cell hyperactivity characteristic of SLE.",
              "B-cells produce high-affinity autoantibodies against self-antigens that cause inflammation and tissue damage.",
              "Autoantibodies and immune complexes (ICs) mediate inflammation and tissue damage by activating complement cascades and binding to Fc receptors on inflammatory cells.",
              "Fc receptors are a heterogeneous group of hematopoeitic cell surface glycoproteins that facilitate the efficiency of antibody\u2013antigen interactions with effector cells of the immune system.",
              "These receptors are involved in a variety of humoral and cellular immune responses including phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, cytokine and chemokine expression, B-cell activation, and IC clearance.",
              "Many studies have shown that the level of expression and function of the Fc region in IgG (Fc\u03b3R) are altered in SLE.",
              "Consistent with its role in the pathogenesis of SLE, Fc\u03b3R stimulates the production of autoantibodies, resulting in inflammation and IC handling.",
              "Altered or delayed clearance of autoantibody containing ICs results in their deposition in various tissues, eliciting inflammation and damage by engaging Fc\u03b3Rs and complement cascades [129,130].",
              "An increase in follicular Th cells and defects in Treg cells have also been implicated in SLE pathogenesis.",
              "Scalapino and colleagues (2006) [131] demonstrated in adoptive transfer experiments that Treg cells delay disease progression and reduce the mortality of lupus-prone mice.",
              "Treg cells are a subset of CD4+ T cells that maintain self-tolerance by suppressing autoreactive lymphocytes, leading to the hypothesis that defects in Treg cells contribute to SLE pathogenesis.",
              "Activated T cells release proinflammatory cytokines and induce B-cell secretion of autoantibodies.",
              "Thus, activation of both B cells and T cells induce innate and adaptive immune responses toward autoimmunity [36,132].",
              "In germ-free murine models, T-cell subsets in the gut are abnormal, displaying reduced responses of Th17 in the lamina propria of the small intestine and Treg in the colonic lamina propria [133,134].",
              "Gut microbiota has been associated with an imbalance in the proportions of Th17 and Treg cells in SLE patients [125].",
              "In patients with SLE, gut microbial composition significantly enriches several genera, including Klebsiella, Rhodococcus, Eggerthella, Eubacterium, Prevotella, and Flavonifractor.",
              "In contrast, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and abundance of Dialister and Pseudobutyrivibrio have been decreased in SLE patients [123].",
              "It remains unclear whether the observed changes in commensal bacteria are a consequence of the disease process or if gut dysbiosis contributes to SLE onset.",
              "However, manipulation of gut microbiota in murine models with antibiotic treatment provides further evidence of gut microbiota influences on systemic immune homeostasis [135,136].",
              "Furthermore, studies show a significant reduction of Lactobacillaceae and an increase of Lachnospiraceae in female lupus-prone mice [137].",
              "Lactobacillus, a genus in the Lactobacillaceae family, is a common resident microbiota in human GI tracts.",

              "The relative lack of Lactobacillus spp.",
              "is most prominent before, but not after, disease onset.",
              "Lactobacillus treatment contributes to an anti-inflammatory environment by decreasing IL-6 and increasing IL-10 production in the gut.",
              "In circulation, Lactobacillus treatment increased IL-10 and decreased IgG2a, a major immune deposit in MRL/lpr mice.",
              "Thus, Lactobacillus may play a preventive role in lupus pathogenesis [138].",
              "However, Lactobacillus has played an opposite role in alternative lupus murine models, where the relative abundance of Lactobacillus species tended to correlate positively with decreased renal function and higher-level systemic autoimmunity in NZB/W F1 mice [124,139].",
              "Thus, exploration of the gut microbiota in murine and human lupus has afforded new insights into the role played by the bacteria in SLE.",
              "Divergent associations were observed for pro- and anti-inflammatory free fatty acids (FFAs) with endothelial activation biomarkers in lupus patients, supporting the link between the gut microbiota and the host metabolism in the pathological framework of SLE [140].",
              "The altered production of SCFAs related to the intestinal dysbiosis highlights the role for the gut microbiota in the maintenance of serum FFA levels, further pointing to SCFAs as potential orchestrators of the cross talk between gut microbiota and the host metabolism [140].",
              "Additionally, five perturbed metabolic pathways were identified in feces of SLE patients, including aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, thiamine metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and cyanoamino acid metabolism [141].",
              "The aforementioned metabolites could also be used as non-invasive biomarkers for SLE, as long as the effects of potential cofounders, such as medications, co-morbidities, smoking, and diet are considered [142].",
              "Given the role of metabolites in autoimmune diseases, one proposed therapeutic strategy is to promote generation of SCFAs in the gut in order to impel the differentiation of nai\u0308ve CD4+ T-cells into Treg cells, avoiding differentiation into Th1 and Th17 cells.",
              "One may support the growth and proliferation of SCFA-producing gut microbes by using appropriate types of dietary fiber [143], prebiotics such as fructo-oligosaccharides [144,145], or probiotics [146].",
              "Oral delivery of SCFAs may be problematic as they are metabolized extensively in the upper portions of the intestinal tract [147].",
              "Data from both human patients and mouse models suggest direct links, largely through immunological mechanisms, between gut microbiota and a number of common human illnesses.",
              "Many of these links are statistical associations without an understanding of causality, susceptibilities to genetic allelic components, and/or environmental factors that may act in tandem.",
              "Dependence upon murine models has both advanced and hindered the field, as many variables affecting mice are not adequately controlled.",
              "Further, mice are genetically inbred (lacking the complex genetic variability of humans), have an average life span of two years, and display different receptor sensitivities in comparison with humans.",
              "While human and mouse immune systems have many similarities, there are areas that are widely disparate.",
              "The murine and human gut microbiota share two major phyla, but 85% of their bacterial genera are not found in humans, and their microbiota is largely driven by a coprophagic diet different from common human diets.",
              "Differences in the immune system must also be considered, and the development of humanized immune systems in mouse models will advance our understandings.",
              "Therapeutics for altering the gut microbiota in animals is in its infancy, and more basic research is required.",
              "In total, these findings indicate that modifications on gut microbiota and their metabolism may be a viable therapeutic and diagnostic target of autoimmune diseases.",
              "Despite our nascent understanding of the role gut microbiota play in the onset and progression of human disease, several mechanisms have been elucidated by which gut microbiota and their metabolic products interact with and regulate both innate and adaptive immune systems. Central to these interactions, and a common theme among seemingly disparate disease states, is subversion of the mucosal layer produced by intestinal epithelial cells and leakage of bacteria and metabolic products through the intestinal barrier.",
              "Translocation from the leakage activates a variety of signaling pathways in a manner dependent upon the location sink within the host and the invading species or metabolites.",
              "These pathways then stimulate inflammatory immune responses through the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and alterations to B- and T- cell populations.",
              "At each interaction, host genetics likely play a role through receptor activation rates and signaling intensity.",
              "The microbial production of SCFAs in the gut, particularly butyrate, reduces intestinal inflammation and increases the integrity of the intestinal barrier, minimizing leakage and bacterial translocation.",

              "When probiotic strains are selected, attributes important for efficacy and technological function must be assessed.",
              "Because the range of targets for in vivo function is broad, spanning oral, stomach, respiratory, intestinal, vaginal, and immune functions, it would be a daunting task to develop a list of characteristics required for all probiotic functions.",

              "In vitro assays are frequently conducted that have not been proved to be predictive of in vivo function [14].",
              "Technological robustness must also be determined, such as the strain's ability to be grown to high numbers, concentrated, stabilized, and incorporated into a final product with good sensory properties, if applicable, and to be stable, both physiologically and genetically, through the end of the shelf life of the product and at the active site in the host.",
              "Assessment of stability can also be a challenge, since factors such as chain length and injury may challenge the typical assessment of colony-forming units, as well as in vivo function.",
              "Strains of the same probiotic species can be different, which has been demonstrated both in vitro and in animals, although similar data in humans are rare.",
              "Thus, clinical results from one study are applicable only to the strain or strains being evaluated in that study.",

              "Currently, however, research specific to the strain or strain combinations should be used to substantiate claims of physiological benefits.",
              "Furthermore, the genus, species, and strain designations should be specified for all probiotic strains in a product.",
              "Dose levels of probiotics should be based on levels found to be efficacious in human studies.",
              "One dose level cannot be assumed to be effective for all strains.",
              "For example, the efficacy of Bifidobacterium infantis 35264 has been documented at 10 8 cfu/day [16], whereas the recommended dose of VSL#3 (VSL Pharmaceuticals) is (1.",

              "In addition, the microbiota participates in metabolic functions by processing nondigestible dietary residues that produce SCFAs (such as n-butyrate, acetate, and propionate), which subsequently contribute to the host energy balance by increasing the availability of nutrients [66].",
              "SCFAs are secreted into the intestinal lumen, pass the epithelial barrier, are released into the bloodstream, and reach peripheral organs and tissues, where they will be used as substrates for energy metabolism.",

              "Even in the presence of a high-fat diet, physical exercise is related to lower inflammatory infiltrates and better protection of the morphology and integrity of the intestine.",

              "On the other hand, it has been observed that resistance exercise results in a transient decrease in splanchnic blood flow (up to 80% of baseline levels) with potential subsequent changes in the morphology and physiology of the intestinal tissues [67].",
              "This reduction depends on the increased arterial resistance in the splanchnic vascular bed, secondary to enhanced activation of the sympathetic nervous system.",
              "Thus, when physical exercise is excessively prolonged, the increased intestinal permeability might favor bacterial translocation from the colon with a subsequent associated risk of gastrointestinal issues [67, 71].",
              "In experimental studies on animals, voluntary running is associated with microbiota variation and concomitant increases in both the n-butyrate concentration and cecum diameter.",
              "Although this last condition might lead to exposure to gastrointestinal disturbances, n-butyrate-mediated control of NF-kB signaling pathways with subsequent protection against carcinogenesis might compensate for the overall risk of exercise-associated colonic diseases [72].",
              "In this regard, it is important to recall that butyrate may inhibit the activity of histone deacetylases and therefore influence gene regulation, immune modulation, reduction of oxidative stress, suppression of carcinogenesis and cell differentiation, and, in terms of physiological activities, regulation of the intestinal barrier, visceral sensitivity, and modulation of intestinal motility [73].",
              "Similarly, regular exercise prevents obesity development and produces changes in the percentage of major bacterial phyla in high-fat-fed obese mice.",

              "Increased production of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and a reduced number of B and T-CD4 cells were observed in the intestines of mice performing moderate long-term exercise compared to mice that did not undergo any physical training.",
              "These findings suggest that exercise in mice may enhance the strength of the commensal microbiota to counteract exogenous colonization and therefore help protect against infections by intestinal pathogens [72\u201374].",
              "To add complexity, some other studies have observed a decrease in the genus Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which is potentially responsible for pathologies in the fatty intestine, in exercising mice [74].",
              "In this regard, it has been hypothesized that the association between an inadequate dietary restriction to the body's needs combined with exercise might be responsible for a decrease in \u201cgood\u201d bacteria and an increase in harmful bacteria with possible alterations in the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa [67, 75].",
              "These findings call attention to the relationship between nutritional status and exercise, especially during the juvenile period when the composition of the gut microbiota is modified with a relative increase in Bacteroidota and a concomitant decrease in the Bacillota phylum [72].",
              "This shift is associated with appetite-related signaling, as serum leptin levels correlate positively with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus populations and negatively with the levels of Bacteroides spp.",
              "and Prevotella spp.",
              "[67, 69], whereas ghrelin serum levels exert opposite effects on these bacterial populations.",
              "Thus, early-life exercise may profoundly influence the composition of the gut microbiota by stimulating the development of bacteria capable of causing adaptive changes in host metabolism and contribute to optimizing the development of brain function [67, 76].",
              "Regarding the influence of specific training activities, an inverse relationship has been noted between the quality and nature of physical activity and the amount of fecal bile acids, and this correspondence becomes stronger as physical activity intensifies.",
              "This is a specific example of how exercise frequency, mode, or intensity may affect the gut microbiota [12].",

              "The microbiota may subsequently influence metabolic function through the synthesis of the so-called secondary bile acids that regulate the deposition of fat in the liver and muscles by activating hormone receptors, such as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR).",
              "Moreover, bile acids seem to be involved in increased energy expenditures in the muscles.",
              "Overall, these observations further reinforce the idea that gut bacteria actively participate in metabolic homeostasis and may therefore contribute to protection from obesity [77\u201380].",
              "Similarly, changes produced by exercise in the profile of SCFAs add support to the relationship that ties physical activity to the muscle/microbiota axis.",
              "SCFAs produced by the microbiota can activate AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of energy metabolism, in muscle cells [81, 82].",
              "The activation of this kinase by SCFAs can occur directly by increasing the AMP/ATP ratio and/or indirectly through the leptin FFar2 pathway, thus controlling the activity of various factors involved in lipid metabolism, cholesterol, and glucose levels in the muscle.",
              "In addition, SCFAs produced in the colon compartment stimulate the FFar2/3 receptors and increase the plasma concentrations of peptide YY (PYY), a satiety hormone that strengthens the insulin-mediated disposal of glucose in muscles and adipose tissue [82\u201384].",
              "Muscles concomitantly express TLR4 and TLR5 receptors, which could be activated by circulating LPS, the levels of which may vary according to the composition of the gut microbiota.",
              "Activation of TLRs by LPS from the membrane of some bacterial types leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines in muscles through activation of NF-kB [79\u201381], and muscle atrophy in mice injected with LPS is related to activation of TLR4 receptors.",
              "Interestingly, in rats fed a high-fat diet, both acute and chronic exercise may induce a significant decrease in the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue accompanied by the concomitant reduction in serum LPS levels and improved insulin signaling and sensitivity in metabolic target tissues [82, 83].",
              "During regular physical activity, myokines (cytokines and other peptides) released from muscle fibers exert paracrine and endocrine effects.",
              "Exercise stimulates muscle cells to produce IL-6, thereby increasing the total circulating levels of this cytokine and contributing to its metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects [84].",
              "IL-6 enhances fat oxidation and glucose uptake through AMPK phosphorylation and activates the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, IL-1ra, and TNF-R, protecting against chronic diseases associated with low-grade inflammation.",

              "As briefly mentioned above, weight loss could cause changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and exercise may induce weight loss.",
              "This aspect is of particular interest given that the composition of the microbiota differs in obese and nonobese individuals.",
              "Although the nature of these changes and how they are produced remains unknown, it is worth emphasizing that commensal bacteria are able to activate hormones and neurotransmitters (epinephrine, acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, gamma aminobutyric acid) acting on the brain, and their receptors are sensitive to the same mediators released by the host brain [4, 87, 88].",

              "As previously mentioned, Veillonella plays a key role in the lactic acid cycle, and the genus Haemophilus hosts various pathogenic species.",
              "Although no gastrointestinal infection or inflammation symptoms were reported in this case, either during or after the race conclusion, it is plausible that the proliferation of intestinal pathogens may contribute to the incidence of infections in athletes undergoing prolonged and intense physical exercise [113].",
              "Indeed, the decreased activity of the immune system during the postexercise phase is well known and defined as the \"open window\" [114].",
              "This condition is opposite to the activation of lymphocytes observed under physical exercise characterized by both moderate intensity/duration or an intense but short duration: only prolonged (greater than 1 h) and/or high-intensity (greater than 70% VO2 max) efforts can substantially decrease lymphocyte number and activities, thereby eliciting transient immunosuppression in the post-exercise phase [114].",
              "Thus, in an otherwise unexplained performance deterioration in a professional athlete, the evaluation of his/her microbiota (eubiosis or dysbiosis) along with intestinal functions might provide some interesting hints to interpret the general conditions [112\u2013114].",
              "In this regard, the use of probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus reuteri, and others) and prebiotics to maintain the eubiosis of the intestinal microbiota may represent an additional support for exercise performance capacity, training adaptations, and recovery from exercise [115, 116].",
              "Increasing research findings confirm the notion that regular physical activity and sport in general may influence both qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbial composition with overall benefits for the host in terms of immune protection and metabolic advantages.",
              "Indeed, the diversity, stability, and enrichment of the microbial members of the microbiota is one of the fundamental aspects of intestinal tract homeostasis and physiology, but is also a key player in adequate signaling not only along the brain-gut axis but also in other gut crosstalk axes (such as the lung and liver).",
              "Exercise complements and reinforces the diversity of gut microflora by stimulating the proliferation of \u201cfriendly\u201d bacteria that can modulate mucosal immunity and improve barrier functions, produce substances that protect against gastrointestinal disorders and colon cancer (such as SCFAs), and improve the Bacteroidota/Bacillota phyla ratio, which aid in controlling weight gain (fighting obesity).",

              "IL-6 is a putative somnogenic factor in humans [59] and high daytime serum concentrations of IL-6 is associated with poor sleep quality [60, 61].",
              "In addition, increased IL-6 levels are associated with fragmented sleep in mice [37].",
              "IL-6 is also an important factor in sleep regulation as sleep onset often coincides with increased circulating IL-6 and IL-6 remains high during the night [62, 63].",
              "While our study found clear associations between IL-6, gut microbiome diversity, and both bacterial phyla and taxa (Fig 2 and Fig 3), the mechanisms and/or metabolites that link these systems remains unknown.",
              "Interestingly, we failed to find a significant correlation between the general stress biomarker, cortisol, sleep measures, and microbiome diversity.",
              "As such, it appears the link between gut microbiome diversity and IL-6 is not mediated or influenced by stress despite the well-developed link between high IL-6 concentrations and stress [64].",
              "Finally, we found that increased gut microbiome diversity correlates with abstract matching correct responses.",
              "The abstract matching test measures abstraction and flexibility components of executive function and reflects prefrontal cortex activity [43].",
              "We note that a previous study that examined cognitive flexibility, sleep, and gut microbiome composition failed to find any significant influence between cognitive flexibility and gut microbiome composition [40].",
              "Our results demonstrated that richness within the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were positively correlated with sleep efficiency, while only the Bacteroidetes was negatively correlated with sleep fragmentation (WASO).",
              "These two phyla have been previously associated with sleep quality in humans, and there is growing evidence that members of these phyla may modulate circadian rhythm [65] and food intake [66], both of which impact sleep quality.",
              "Specifically, Benedict and colleagues found that partial sleep deprivation alters the ratio between these two phyla [38].",
              "Similar findings were reported in mice [37].",
              "However, Zhang and colleagues failed to find any changes in the ratio of these two phyla following sleep restriction [39].",
              "Our study also found that the richness within the Actinobacteria phylum was negatively correlated with the number of awakenings.",
              "That is, increased richness within the Actinobacteria contributes to high sleep quality.",
              "Similar findings were reported in mice where sleep disruption reduced the percentage of Actinobacteria in the gut microbiome [37].",
              "This contrasts to Benedict and colleagues who found that some members of this phyla increased following sleep restriction in humans [38].",
              "Finally, in contrast to a previous study [40], we found no significant relationships between sleep measures and the richness or diversity within the Verrucomicrobia and Lentisphaera.",
              "This may be owing to differences in sampling methodology (self-report vs. actigraphy).",
              "In the previous study [40], the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to determine sleep quality whereas herein we used actigraphy.",

              "Given that sleep quality is significantly lower in older adults relative to younger adults [67] it is possible that changes in gut microbiome phyla, along with other physiological changes, contribute to poor sleep quality with age.",
              "This warrants future investigation.",
              "Our redundancy analysis revealed several taxa (genera and families) associated with measures of sleep (Fig 3).",
              "Previous work [68] examining the relationship between gut microbiome composition and severity of sleep apnea\u2013hypopnea syndrome found that a decrease in the relative abundance of Sutterella and Brevibacterium generally coincided with an increase in severity of the disease state.",
              "In congruence with these previous findings, our study found that there was a negative correlation between these genera, and the number of awakenings.",
              "In addition, the same previous study [68] found an increase in the relative abundance in the Lachnospiraceae (family) as the severity of sleep apnea\u2013hypopnea syndrome increased.",
              "This also generally agrees with our findings as the Lachnospiraceae were, on average, negatively correlated with sleep efficiency and total sleep time.",
              "This may indicate that similar genera/families have wide ranging effects on sleep, both in disease and non-disease states.",
              "There is growing interest in identifying the metabolites produced by bacteria that interface through the BGMA.",
              "Several human gut associated species in the Bacteroidetes [69], Actinobacteria and Firmicutes [70] phyla produce \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep [71].",

              "This might allude to an important role of the Corynebacterium in promoting sleep as serotonin modulates sleep [72], and gut bacteria produce serotonin that appears to interface through the BGMA [73].",
              "Interestingly, serotonin has been previously reported to increase synthesis of IL-6 in some human cell types [74], and that increased IL-6 has been associated with poor cognitive and emotional performance [75].",
              "Moreover, the ability of Corynebacterium and Brevibacterium to produce the somnogenic factor glutamate has been noted previously [76].",
              "We note that both taxa are negatively correlated with number of awakenings (Fig 3).",
              "Finally, our analysis revealed that several taxa from the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing Lachnospiraceae family [77], including Blautia, Coprococcus and Oribacterium, are negatively correlated with healthy sleep.",
              "While our literature review failed to identify species within this family that produce metabolites that promote wakefulness or reduced sleep quality, a recent study has shown that SCFA produced in the murine gut microbiome peak in concentration at the beginning of the dark period and can otherwise influence circadian rhythm [78].",
              "It remains unclear as to if SCFA produced from the Lachnospiraceae family influences sleep quality, either positively or negatively, in humans.",
              "It is important to note that a major caveat of our current research is that we cannot pinpoint directionality of interactions through correlation such as this.",
              "Nevertheless, while the aforementioned link is plausible, additional studies are required to elucidate the role that the gut microbiome has in producing and regulating serotonin, and other sleep modulating metabolites, and their direct influence on the immune system and neurobehavioral performance.",
              "It is also important to note that our study was limited to males and, therefore, we cannot be certain of the extent to which our findings apply to women.",
              "Previous work from our group showed that sleep loss also increases inflammation in young women [79].",
              "In general, we would expect similar, or even more pronounced, findings in women since the consequences of sleep loss accumulate more quickly in women compared to men [80, 81] and women are at a higher risk than men for sleep loss-related mortality [82].",
              "However, it appears that gender can affect microbiome composition (e.",
              "g., [83]), which may result in different associations between taxa and measures of sleep.",
              "Nevertheless, we expect that the results are repeatable in men given that the major findings were sufficiently robust as to yield statistical significance at the conventional levels with good effect sizes.",
              "In summary, our results show a novel association between sleep health and gut microbiome diversity.",
              "Moreover, we found that IL-6 is as an important player in the sleep-gut microbiome relationship.",
