              "The sender does not have to know the particular quantum state being transferred.",
              "Moreover, the location of the recipient can be unknown, but to complete the quantum teleportation, classical information needs to be sent from sender to receiver.",

              "[6] In matters relating to quantum information theory, it is convenient to work with the simplest possible unit of information: the two-state system of the qubit.",
              "The qubit functions as the quantum analog of the classic computational part, the bit, as it can have a measurement value of both a 0 and a 1, whereas the classical bit can only be measured as a 0 or a 1.",
              "The quantum two-state system seeks to transfer quantum information from one location to another location without losing the information and preserving the quality of this information.",
              "This process involves moving the information between carriers and not movement of the actual carriers, similar to the traditional process of communications, as two parties remain stationary while the information (digital media, voice, text, etc.)",
              "is being transferred, contrary to the implications of the word \"teleport\".",
              "The main components needed for teleportation include a sender, the information (a qubit), a traditional channel, a quantum channel, and a receiver.",
              "The sender does not need to know the exact contents of the information that is being sent.",
              "The measurement postulate of quantum mechanics \u2013 when a measurement is made upon a quantum state, any subsequent measurements will \"collapse\" or that the observed state will be lost \u2013 creates an imposition within teleportation: if a sender makes a measurement on their information, the state could collapse when the receiver obtains the information since the state has changed from when the sender made the initial measurement.",
              "For actual teleportation, it is required that an entangled quantum state be created for the qubit to be transferred.",
              "Entanglement imposes statistical correlations between otherwise distinct physical systems by creating or placing two or more separate particles into a single, shared quantum state.",
              "This intermediate state contains two particles whose quantum states are related to each other: measuring one particle's state provides information about the measurement of the other particle's state.",
              "These correlations hold even when measurements are chosen and performed independently, out of causal contact from one another, as verified in Bell test experiments.",
              "Thus, an observation resulting from a measurement choice made at one point in spacetime seems to instantaneously affect outcomes in another region, even though light hasn't yet had time to travel the distance, a conclusion seemingly at odds with special relativity.",
              "This is known as the EPR paradox.",
              "However, such correlations can never be used to transmit any information faster than the speed of light, a statement encapsulated in the no-communication theorem.",
              "Thus, teleportation as a whole can never be superluminal, as a qubit cannot be reconstructed until the accompanying classical information arrives.",
              "The sender will then combine the particle, of which the information is teleported, with one of the entangled particles, causing a change of the overall entangled quantum state.",
              "Of this changed state, the particles in Alice's possession are then sent to an analyzer that will measure the change of the entangled state.",
              "The \"change\" measurement will allow the receiver to recreate the original information that the sender had, resulting in the information being teleported or carried between two people that have different locations.",
              "Since the initial quantum information is \"destroyed\" as it becomes part of the entanglement state, the no-cloning theorem is maintained as the information is recreated from the entangled state and not copied during teleportation.",
              "The quantum channel is the communication mechanism that is used for all quantum information transmission and is the channel used for teleportation (relationship of quantum channel to traditional communication channel is akin to the qubit being the quantum analog of the classical bit).",
              "However, in addition to the quantum channel, a traditional channel must also be used to accompany a qubit to \"preserve\" the quantum information.",
              "When the change measurement between the original qubit and the entangled particle is made, the measurement result must be carried by a traditional channel so that the quantum information can be reconstructed and the receiver can get the original information.",
              "Because of this need for the traditional channel, the speed of teleportation can be no faster than the speed of light (hence the no-communication theorem is not violated).",
              "The main advantage with this is that Bell states can be shared using photons from lasers, making teleportation achievable through open space, as there is no need to send information through physical cables or optical fibers.",
              "Quantum states can be encoded in various degrees of freedom of atoms. For example, qubits can be encoded in the degrees of freedom of electrons surrounding the atomic nucleus or in the degrees of freedom of the nucleus itself.",
              "Thus, performing this kind of teleportation requires a stock of atoms at the receiving site, available for having qubits imprinted on them.",
              "[7] As of 2015,[update] the quantum states of single photons, photon modes, single atoms, atomic ensembles, defect centers in solids, single electrons, and superconducting circuits have been employed as information bearers.",
              "[8] Understanding quantum teleportation requires a good grounding in finite-dimensional linear algebra, Hilbert spaces and projection matrixes.",
              "A qubit is described using a two-dimensional complex number-valued vector space (a Hilbert space), which are the primary basis for the formal manipulations given below.",
              "A working knowledge of quantum mechanics is not absolutely required to understand the mathematics of quantum teleportation, although without such acquaintance, the deeper meaning of the equations may remain quite mysterious.",
              "The resources required for quantum teleportation are a communication channel capable of transmitting two classical bits, a means of generating an entangled Bell state of qubits and distributing to two different locations, performing a Bell measurement on one of the Bell state qubits, and manipulating the quantum state of the other qubit from the pair.",
              "Of course, there must also be some input qubit (in the quantum state | \u03c6 \u27e9 {\\displaystyle |\\phi \\rangle } ) to be teleported.",
              "The protocol is then as follows: It is worth noticing that the above protocol assumes that the qubits are individually addressable, meaning that the qubits are distinguishable and physically labeled.",
              "However, there can be situations where two identical qubits are indistinguishable due to the spatial overlap of their wave functions.",
              "Under this condition, the qubits cannot be individually controlled or measured.",
              "Nevertheless, a teleportation protocol analogous to that described above can still be (conditionally) implemented by exploiting two independently prepared qubits, with no need of an initial Bell state.",
              "This can be made by addressing the internal degrees of freedom of the qubits (e.",
              "g., spins or polarisations) by spatially localized measurements performed in separated regions A and B where the two spatially overlapping, indistinguishable qubits can be found.",
              "[9] This theoretical prediction has been then verified experimentally via polarized photons in a quantum optical setup.",
              "[10] Work in 1998 verified the initial predictions,[2] and the distance of teleportation was increased in August 2004 to 600 meters, using optical fiber.",
              "[11] Subsequently, the record distance for quantum teleportation has been gradually increased to 16 kilometres (9.",

              "In quantum information theory, superdense coding (also referred to as dense coding) is a quantum communication protocol to communicate a number of classical bits of information by only transmitting a smaller number of qubits, under the assumption of sender and receiver pre-sharing an entangled resource.",
              "In its simplest form, the protocol involves two parties, often referred to as Alice and Bob in this context, which share a pair of maximally entangled qubits, and allows Alice to transmit two bits (i.",
              "e., one of 00, 01, 10 or 11) to Bob by sending only one qubit.",
              "[1][2] This protocol was first proposed by Charles H.",
              "Bennett and Stephen Wiesner in 1970[3] (though not published by them until 1992) and experimentally actualized in 1996 by Klaus Mattle, Harald Weinfurter, Paul G.",
              "Kwiat and Anton Zeilinger using entangled photon pairs.",
              "[2] Superdense coding can be thought of as the opposite of quantum teleportation, in which one transfers one qubit from Alice to Bob by communicating two classical bits, as long as Alice and Bob have a pre-shared Bell pair.",
              "[2] The transmission of two bits via a single qubit is made possible by the fact that Alice can choose among four quantum gate operations to perform on her share of the entangled state.",
              "Alice determines which operation to perform accordingly to the pair of bits she wants to transmit.",
              "She then sends Bob the qubit state evolved through the chosen gate.",
              "Said qubit thus encodes information about the two bits Alice used to select the operation, and this information can be retrieved by Bob thanks to pre-shared entanglement between them.",
              "After receiving Alice's qubit, operating on the pair and measuring both, Bob obtains two classical bits of information.",
              "It is worth stressing that if Alice and Bob do not pre-share entanglement, then the superdense protocol is impossible, as this would violate Holevo's theorem.",
              "Superdense coding is the underlying principle of secure quantum secret coding.",
              "The necessity of having both qubits to decode the information being sent eliminates the risk of eavesdroppers intercepting messages.",
              "[4] Suppose Alice wants to send two classical bits of information (00, 01, 10, or 11) to Bob using qubits (instead of classical bits).",
              "To do this, an entangled state (e.",
              "g. a Bell state) is prepared using a Bell circuit or gate by Charlie, a third person.",
              "Charlie then sends one of these qubits (in the Bell state) to Alice and the other to Bob.",
              "Once Alice obtains her qubit in the entangled state, she applies a certain quantum gate to her qubit depending on which two-bit message (00, 01, 10 or 11) she wants to send to Bob.",
              "Her entangled qubit is then sent to Bob who, after applying the appropriate quantum gate and making a measurement, can retrieve the classical two-bit message.",
