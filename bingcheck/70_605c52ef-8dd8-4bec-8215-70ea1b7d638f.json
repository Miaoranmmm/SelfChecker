    "query": "What was the inspiration behind the famous Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci and why is it considered a masterpiece of the Renaissance era?",
    "response": "The Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci is a masterpiece of the Renaissance era because it showcases his skillful use of various painterly techniques, such as sfumato (fine shading), aerial perspective (depth illusion), and three-quarter view (natural pose). It also reflects his vision of the cosmic link between humanity and nature, as seen in the harmony between the sitter and the landscape[^1^] [^4^].\n\nThe inspiration behind the painting is not certain, but many scholars and historians have suggested that it is a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant who commissioned Leonardo to paint her[^1^]. However, some have also proposed other possible identities, such as Leonardo's mother, his assistant, or even himself[^2^]. The painting's mysterious smile and unproven identity have made it a source of ongoing investigation and fascination[^1^].\n\nThe Mona Lisa has also influenced many other artists, who have reinterpreted it in various ways, such as adding moustaches, changing the background, or transforming the style[^3^]. It has also inspired songs, poems, films, and novels that celebrate its beauty and mystery[^5^].",

              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",

              "Any speculative price (some say over a billion dollars!)",
              "would probably be so high that not one person would be able or willing to purchase and maintain the painting.",
              "Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it.",
              "The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for the Mona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment.",
              "Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.",
              "Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece\u2019s celebrity, including its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and its tour to the U.",

              "in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.",
              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal.",
              "Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world\u2019s most famous painting.",
              "It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century.",
              "The sitter\u2019s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.",
              "The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape.",
              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter\u2019s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.",
              "The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting\u2014especially apparent in the sitter\u2019s faint smile\u2014reflects Leonardo\u2019s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo\u2019s vision.",
              "In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits.",
              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",
              "The sitter\u2019s identity has not been definitively proven.",
              "Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo\u2019s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.",

              "For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "Following a period hanging in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",
              "During World War II the Mona Lisa, singled out as the most-endangered artwork in the Louvre, was evacuated to various locations in France\u2019s countryside, returning to the museum in 1945 after peace had been declared.",
              "It later traveled to the United States in 1963, drawing about 40,000 people per day during its six-week stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              "It also toured to Tokyo and Moscow in 1974.",
              "Scholars have noted that the Mona Lisa is in fairly good condition for its age.",
              "The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its original frame and to braces added by early restorers.",
              "To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting.",
              "Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail.",
              "The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject\u2019s left elbow.",
              "The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work\u2019s visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it."

              "[10] It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506;",

              "It has been on permanent display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.",
              "[11] The painting's global fame and popularity stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism\u2014a belief it should belong to Italy.",
              "The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Arse\u0300ne Lupin) and the song Mona Lisa recorded by Nat King Cole\u2014one of the most successful songs of the 1950s.",

              "[14] The title of the painting, which is known in English as Mona Lisa, is based on the presumption that it depicts Lisa del Giocondo, although her likeness is uncertain.",
              "Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote that \"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\"",
              "[17][18][19][20] Monna in Italian is a polite form of address originating as ma donna\u2014similar to Ma'am, Madam, or my lady in English.",
              "This became madonna, and its contraction monna.",
              "The title of the painting, though traditionally spelled Mona in English, is spelled in Italian as Monna Lisa (mona being a vulgarity in Italian), but this is rare in English.",

              "[23] The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea.",
              "[24] The Italian name for the painting, La Gioconda, means 'jocund' ('happy' or 'jovial') or, literally, 'the jocund one', a pun on the feminine form of Lisa's married name, Giocondo.",
              "[23][25] In French, the title La Joconde has the same meaning.",
              "Vasari's account of the Mona Lisa comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist's death.",
              "It has long been the best-known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter.",
              "Leonardo's assistant Salai\u0300, at his death in 1524, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named la Gioconda, a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.",
              "[citation needed] That Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume by ancient Roman philosopher Cicero.",
              "Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci.",
              "This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.",
              "[26] In response to the announcement of the discovery of this document, Vincent Delieuvin, the Louvre representative, stated \"Leonardo da Vinci was painting, in 1503, the portrait of a Florentine lady by the name of Lisa del Giocondo.",
              "About this we are now certain.",
              "Unfortunately, we cannot be absolutely certain that this portrait of Lisa del Giocondo is the painting of the Louvre.\"",
              "[27] The catalogue raisonne\u0301 Leonardo da Vinci (2019) confirms that the painting probably depicts Lisa del Giocondo, with Isabella d'Este being the only plausible alternative.",
              "[28] Scholars have developed several alternative views, arguing that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, and identifying at least four other paintings referred to by Vasari as the Mona Lisa.",
              "[29] Several other people have been proposed as the subject of the painting,[30] including Isabella of Aragon,[31] Cecilia Gallerani,[32] Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla,[30] Pacifica Brandano/Brandino, Isabela Gualanda, Caterina Sforza, Bianca Giovanna Sforza, Salai\u0300, and even Leonardo himself.",
              "[33][34][35] Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud theorized that Leonardo imparted an approving smile from his mother, Caterina, onto the Mona Lisa and other works.",
              "[36][37] The Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at that time seen as an ideal for womanhood.",
              "[38] The woman sits markedly upright in a \"pozzetto\" armchair with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture.",
              "Her gaze is fixed on the observer.",
              "The woman appears alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines (sfumato).",
              "The soft blending creates an ambiguous mood \"mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes\".",
              "[39] The depiction of the sitter in three-quarter profile is similar to late 15th-century works by Lorenzo di Credi and Agnolo di Domenico del Mazziere.",
              "[38] Zo\u0308llner notes that the sitter's general position can be traced back to Flemish models and that \"in particular the vertical slices of columns at both sides of the panel had precedents in Flemish portraiture.\"",
              "[40] Woods-Marsden cites Hans Memling's portrait of Benedetto Portinari (1487) or Italian imitations such as Sebastiano Mainardi's pendant portraits for the use of a loggia, which has the effect of mediating between the sitter and the distant landscape, a feature missing from Leonardo's earlier portrait of Ginevra de' Benci.",
              "[41] The painting was one of the first Italian portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape,[43] and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective.",

              "[140] Once part of King Francis I of France's collection, the Mona Lisa was among the first artworks to be exhibited in the Louvre, which became a national museum after the French Revolution.",
              "Leonardo began to be revered as a genius, and the painting's popularity grew in the mid-19th century when French intelligentsia praised it as mysterious and a representation of the femme fatale.",
              "[141] The Baedeker guide in 1878 called it \"the most celebrated work of Leonardo in the Louvre\",[142] but the painting was known more by the intelligentsia than the general public.",
              "[143] The 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa and its subsequent return was reported worldwide, leading to a massive increase in public recognition of the painting.",
              "During the 20th century it was an object for mass reproduction, merchandising, lampooning and speculation, and was claimed to have been reproduced in \"300 paintings and 2,000 advertisements\".",
              "[142] The Mona Lisa was regarded as \"just another Leonardo until early last century, when the scandal of the painting's theft from the Louvre and subsequent return kept a spotlight on it over several years.\"",

              "[151] Before the 1962\u20131963 tour, the painting was assessed for insurance at $100 million (equivalent to $700 million in 2021), making it, in practice, the most highly-valued painting in the world.",
              "The insurance was not purchased;",
              "instead, more was spent on security.",
              "[152] In 2014, a France 24 article suggested that the painting could be sold to help ease the national debt, although it was observed that the Mona Lisa and other such art works were prohibited from being sold by French heritage law, which states that \"Collections held in museums that belong to public bodies are considered public property and cannot be otherwise.\"",
              "[153] Cultural depictions of the Mona Lisa include: A version of Mona Lisa known as Mujer de mano de Leonardo Abince (\"Woman by Leonardo da Vinci's hand\", Museo del Prado, Madrid) was for centuries considered to be a work by Leonardo.",
              "However, since its restoration in 2012, it is now thought to have been executed by one of Leonardo's pupils in his studio at the same time as Mona Lisa was being painted.",
              "[154] The Prado's conclusion that the painting is probably by Salai\u0300 (1480\u20131524) or by Melzi (1493\u20131572) has been called into question by others.",
              "[155] The restored painting is from a slightly different perspective than the original Mona Lisa, leading to the speculation that it is part of the world's first stereoscopic pair.",
              "[156][157] However, a more recent report has demonstrated that this stereoscopic pair in fact gives no reliable stereoscopic depth.",
              "[158] A version of the Mona Lisa known as the Isleworth Mona Lisa was first bought by an English nobleman in 1778 and was rediscovered in 1913 by Hugh Blaker, an art connoisseur.",
              "The painting was presented to the media in 2012 by the Mona Lisa Foundation.",

              "Today it is in the Louvre in Paris, but it was produced in Florence when Leonardo moved there to live from about 1500-1508.",
              "It is sometimes called La Jaconde in French (or in Italian, La Giaconda) because it is believed to be the portrait of the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, whose name was Lisa (Mona = short for \u201cMadonna\u201d (lady)).",
              "This identification was provided by Vasari in the sixteenth century, but this was later disputed.",
              "It is likely that the uncertainty over the sitter\u2019s identification has added to the mystery and lure surrounding this painting over the years.",
              "According to Vasari, the painting was not finished over the course of four years, which may have resulted in the difference in the craquelure (level of cracking on the surface) in the face and in the hands.",
              "The portrait shows what appears to be a typical portrait of a woman in which her wealth is not primary thing on display.",
              "She is veiled, her hands are crossed, and she has a faint smile \u2013 or some expression masquerading as a smile \u2013 which seems to capture the viewer\u2019s gaze.",
              "The way Leonardo painted this portrait deviated from the traditional way women were painted like this in Italy.",
              "Mona Lisa looks directly out at us, the viewers, which was something unconventional for a woman in a portrait to do at this time.",
              "She also appears rather content and assured in her demeanor, which reflected more the expectations of the aristocracy among men rather than among women.",
              "Further, until this point in time, portraits of both men and women were typically cut off in the middle of torso and hands were raised so that we the head and face and shoulders occupies more of the panel upon which the paint was applied.",
              "Here, however, the portrait shows not only the woman\u2019s head and upper torso, but much of her body down to just below her waist.",
              "We see all of her arms, which are not raised up but resting comfortably on the armrests of her chair.",
              "The implication of this kind of view is that we are seeing the entire person, rather than just a sliver of her.",
              "Leonardo\u2019s approach was innovative and would start a trend in portrait painting which would influence European painting into 1800s.",
              "The way Leonardo has rendered the body of the woman is nothing less than extraordinary, and it truly reveals the jump forward in the level of naturalism that Italian painters made between 1400 and 1500.",
              "Leonardo makes use of his sfumato technique to show how the light bounces off her skin in certain places while leaving other parts in darker shadows.",
              "Her skin appears to be soft and smooth, and she looks quite like a real, though perhaps somewhat idealized, woman would look like right in front of us.",
              "Leonardo\u2019s skill in this painting particularly impressed the sixteenth-century painter and historian Vasari, who had the following to say about it: In this head, whoever wished to see how closely art could imitate nature, was able to comprehend it with ease;",
              "for in it were counterfeited all the minutenesses that with subtlety are able to be painted, seeing that the eyes had that lustre and watery sheen which are always seen in life, and around them were all those rosy and pearly tints, as well as the lashes, which cannot be represented without the greatest subtlety.",
              "The eyebrows, through his having shown the manner in which the hairs spring from the flesh, here more close and here more scanty, and curve according to the pores of the skin, could not be more natural.",
              "The nose, with its beautiful nostrils, rosy and tender, appeared to be alive.",
              "The mouth, with its opening, and with its ends united by the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the face, seemed, in truth, to be not colours but flesh.",
              "In the pit of the throat, if one gazed upon it intently, could be seen the beating of the pulse.",
              "And, indeed, it may be said that it was painted in such a manner as to make every valiant craftsman, be he who he may, tremble and lose heart.",
              "Apart from the naturalism in the figure, the painting includes a background which provides us with a stark contrast.",
              "Leonardo has placed Lisa against a vast landscape.",
              "The original loggia she was under was cropped out, but you can still see the base of the vertical supports to either side of her (at the right and left edges of the painting).",
              "If we look over her shoulder to the left side, we see a road that leads to distance, and mountains painted in a way which seems similar \u2013 at least on some level \u2013 to Chinese landscape painting of the preceding centuries.",
              "On the right side, we can see a bridge, and a road which leads to sea in the distance.",
              "It is in this vast landscape that we find a compelling juxtaposition in this painting.",
              "We have directly in front of us a touchable woman who is in the world of the here-and-now.",
              "She seems real to us \u2013 a very lifelike figure.",
              "Behind her we have a vast landscape which goes off into unknowable distances, and seems to continue on into a type of misty haze.",
              "The contrast between the woman and the background landscape is therefore quite remarkable, and it lends to the power of the painting.",
              "Overall, the Mona Lisa is a masterpiece in portrait painting which has stood the test of time and continues to inspire and amaze visitors to the Louvre from around the world.",
              "Yet, if we consider it apart from its current role as a leading icon of pop culture in the modern world, we can very much see how this innovative work would have created an impression on Leonardo\u2019s contemporaries in the sixteenth century.",

              "Yet how many of us have ever consciously noted the object in the painting that is closer to us than any other \u2013 the chair on which the mysterious woman sits?",
              "Never mind that the piece of furniture is the only thing that Leonardo's sitter grips in her hand (she's literally pointing at it with every finger she has), the chair must surely be the single most neglected aspect of the otherwise over-stared-at icon.",
              "Hiding in plain sight, it may also be the arrow that points the way to the work's deepest meanings.",
              "More like this: - The fresco with multiple identities - The secret toilet humour in a Titian painting - The tragedy of art's greatest supermodel For centuries, our attention has largely been focused elsewhere in the small (77 x 53cm/30 x 21in) oil-on-poplar panel, which Da Vinci never fully finished and is thought to have continued to tinker with obsessively until his death in 1519 \u2013 as if the painting's endless emergence were the work itself.",
              "A preoccupation principally with Mona Lisa's inscrutable smile is almost as old as the painting, and dates back at least to the reaction of the legendary Renaissance writer and historian Giorgio Vasari, who was born a few years after Da Vinci began work on the likeness.",
              "\"The mouth with its opening and with its ends united by the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the face,\" Vasari observed in his celebrated Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, \"seemed, in truth, to be not colours but flesh.",
              "In the pit of the throat, if one gazed upon it intently, could be seen the beating of the pulse.\"",
              "He concluded: \"In this work of Leonardo, there was a smile so pleasing, that it was a thing more divine than human to behold, and it was held to be something marvellous, in that it was not other than alive.\"",
              "Many scholars have been fascinated by the mystery of Mona Lisa's smile (Credit: Alamy) The mesmerising mystery of Mona Lisa's smile and how Leonardo magically leveraged it into creating \"a thing more divine than human\" and yet \"not other than alive\" would prove too intense for many to bear.",
              "The 19th-Century French art critic Alfred Dumesnil confessed to finding the painting's paradox utterly paralysing.",
              "In 1854 he asserted that the subject's \"smile is full of attraction, but it is the treacherous attraction of a sick soul that renders sickness.",
              "This so soft a look, but avid like the sea, devours\".",
              "If legend is to be believed, the \"treacherous attraction\" of Mona Lisa's irresolvable smirk consumed too the soul of an aspiring French artist by the name of Luc Maspero.",
              "According to popular myth, Maspero, who allegedly ended his days by leaping from the window of his Paris hotel room, was driven to destructive distraction by the mute whispers of Mona Lisa's engrossingly gladsome lips.",
              "\"For years I have grappled desperately with her smile,\" he is said to have written in the note he left behind.",
              "\"I prefer to die.\"",
              "Not everyone, however, has been content to locate the centre of Mona Lisa's magnetising mystique in her enigmatic grin.",
              "The Victorian writer Walter Pater believed it was the \"delicacy\" with which her hands and eyelids are rendered that transfix and hypnotise us into believing that the work possesses preternatural power.",
              "\"We all know the face and hands of the figure,\" he observed in an article on Da Vinci in 1869, \"in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea\".",
              "Pater proceeds to meditate on the Mona Lisa in such a singularly intense way that in 1936 the Irish poet William Butler Yeats found himself compelled to seize a sentence from Pater's description, break it up into free-verse lines, and install them as the opening poem in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, which Yeats was then compiling.",
              "The passage that Yeats couldn't help co-opting begins: \"She is older than the rocks among which she sits;",
              "like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave;",
              "and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her;",
              "and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants, and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary;",
              "and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes.\"",
              "The portrait \"lives\", Pater concludes, \"only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands\".",
              "Some viewers are as transfixed by Mona Lisa's hands as by her face (Credit: Alamy) Pater's description still astounds.",
              "Unlike Dumesnil and the doomed Maspero before him, Pater sees past the seductive snare of the portrait's smile to a larger vitality that percolates as if from deep below the surface.",
              "Contending that the painting depicts a figure suspended in ceaseless shuttle between the here-and-now and some otherworldly realm that lies beyond, Pater pinpoints the mystical essence of the panel's perennial appeal: its surreal sense of eternal flux.",
              "Like Vasari, Pater bears witness to a breathing and pulsing presence \u2013 \"changing lineaments\" \u2013 that transcends the inert materiality of the portrait's making.",
              "Key to the force of Pater's language is an insistence on aquatic imagery that reinforces the fluidity of the sitter's elusive self (\"faint light under the sea\", \"a diver in deep seas\", and \"trafficked.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "with Eastern merchants\"), as if Mona Lisa were an ever-flowing fountain of living water \u2013 an interminable ripple in the endless eddies of time.",
              "Perhaps she is.",
              "There is reason to think that such a reading, which sees the sitter as a shape-shifting spring of eternal resurgence, is precisely what Leonardo intended.",
              "Flanked on either side by bodies of flowing water that the artist has ingeniously positioned in such a way as to suggest that they are aspects of his sitter's very being, Da Vinci's subject has a strangely submarine quality to her that is accentuated by the algae green dress she wears \u2013 an amphibious second skin that has only grown murkier and darker with time.",
              "Pivoting her stare slightly to her left to meet ours, Mona Lisa is poised upon not just any old bench or stool, but a deep-seated perch known popularly as a pozzetto chair.",
              "Meaning \"little well\", the pozzetto introduces a subtle symbolism into the narrative that is as revealing as it is unexpected.",
              "By placing Mona Lisa on a 'little well', surrounded by water, Da Vinci could be drawing on earlier spiritual connections with springs (Credit: Alamy) Suddenly, the waters we see meandering with a mazy motion behind Mona Lisa (whether belonging to an actual landscape, such as the valley of the Italian River Arno, as some historians believe, or entirely imaginary, as others contend) are no longer distant and disconnected from the sitter, but are an essential resource that sustain her existence.",
              "They literally flow into her.",
              "By situating Mona Lisa inside a \"little well\", Da Vinci transforms her into an ever-fluctuating dimension of the physical universe she occupies.",
              "Art historian and leading Da Vinci expert Martin Kemp has likewise detected a fundamental connection between Mona Lisa's depiction and the geology of the world she inhabits.",
              "\"The artist was not literally portraying the prehistoric or future Arno,\" Kemp asserts in his study Leonardo: 100 Milestones (2019), \"but was shaping Lisa's landscape on the basis of what he had learned about change in the 'body of the Earth', to stand alongside the implicit transformations in the body of the woman as a 'lesser world' or microcosm.\"",
              "Mona Lisa isn't sitting before a landscape.",
              "She is the landscape.",
              "Drawing from a well As with all visual symbols employed by Leonardo, the pozzetto chair is multivalent and serves more than merely to link Mona Lisa with the artist's well-known fascination with the hydrological forces that shape the Earth.",
              "The subtle insinuation of a \"little well\" in the painting as the very channel through which Mona Lisa emerges into consciousness repositions the painting entirely in cultural discourse.",
              "No longer is this a straightforwardly secular portrait but something spiritually more complex.",
              "Portrayals of women \"at the well\" are a staple throughout Western art history.",
              "Old Testament stories of Eliezar meeting Rebekah at a well and of Jacob meeting Rachel at the well went on to become especially popular in the 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries, as everyone from Bartolome\u0301 Esteban Murillo to Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo to William Holman Hunt tried their hand at one or other of the narratives.",
              "There are many depictions in art of people at wells, such as Christ and the Samaritan Woman (1310-11) by Duccio di Buoninsegna (Credit: Alamy) Moreover apocryphal depictions of the New Testament Annunciation (the moment when the Archangel Gabriel informs the Virgin Mary that she will give birth to Christ) as occurring at the site of a spring were a mainstay among Medieval manuscript illustrators, and may even have inspired the oldest surviving visual portrayal of Mary.",
              "An endlessly elastic emblem, as Walter Pater intimated, Mona Lisa is doubtless capable of absorbing all such reflected resonances and many more besides.",
              "There is no one she isn't.",
              "But perhaps the most pertinent parallel between Da Vinci's Mona Lisa and pictorial precursors is one that can be drawn with the many representations of a biblical episode in which Jesus finds himself at a well, engaged in cryptic conversation with a woman from Samaria.",
              "In the Gospel of John, Jesus makes a distinction between the water that can be drawn from the natural spring \u2013 water which will inevitably leave one \"thirsty\" \u2013 and the \"living water\" that he can provide.",
              "Where water from a well can only sustain a perishable body, 'living water' is capable of quenching the eternal spirit.",
              "Notable depictions of the scene by the Medieval Italian painter Duccio di Buoninsegna and by the German Renaissance master Lucas Cranach the Elder tend to seat Jesus directly on the wall of the well, suggesting his dominion over the fleeting elements of this world.",
              "By placing his female sitter notionally inside the well, however, Da Vinci confounds the tradition, and suggests instead a merging of material and spiritual realms \u2013 a blurring of the here and hereafter \u2013 into a shared plane of eternal emergence.",
              "In Da Vinci's enthralling narrative, Mona Lisa is herself a miraculous surge of \"living water\", serenely content in the knowledge of her own raging infinitude.",

              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",

              "Any speculative price (some say over a billion dollars!)",
              "would probably be so high that not one person would be able or willing to purchase and maintain the painting.",
              "Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it.",

              "Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.",

              "The sitter\u2019s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.",
              "The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape.",
              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter\u2019s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.",
              "The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting\u2014especially apparent in the sitter\u2019s faint smile\u2014reflects Leonardo\u2019s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo\u2019s vision.",
              "In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits.",

              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",

              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",

              "It later traveled to the United States in 1963, drawing about 40,000 people per day during its six-week stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",

              "Scholars have noted that the Mona Lisa is in fairly good condition for its age.",
              "The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its original frame and to braces added by early restorers.",
              "To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting.",
              "Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail.",
              "The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject\u2019s left elbow.",
              "The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work\u2019s visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it."

              "1503-1505, oil on wood Leonardo\u2019s Mona Lisa is one of the most famous paintings in the world.",
              "Today it is in the Louvre in Paris, but it was produced in Florence when Leonardo moved there to live from about 1500-1508.",
              "It is sometimes called La Jaconde in French (or in Italian, La Giaconda) because it is believed to be the portrait of the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, whose name was Lisa (Mona = short for \u201cMadonna\u201d (lady)).",
              "This identification was provided by Vasari in the sixteenth century, but this was later disputed.",
              "It is likely that the uncertainty over the sitter\u2019s identification has added to the mystery and lure surrounding this painting over the years.",
              "According to Vasari, the painting was not finished over the course of four years, which may have resulted in the difference in the craquelure (level of cracking on the surface) in the face and in the hands.",
              "The portrait shows what appears to be a typical portrait of a woman in which her wealth is not primary thing on display.",
              "She is veiled, her hands are crossed, and she has a faint smile \u2013 or some expression masquerading as a smile \u2013 which seems to capture the viewer\u2019s gaze.",
              "The way Leonardo painted this portrait deviated from the traditional way women were painted like this in Italy.",
              "Mona Lisa looks directly out at us, the viewers, which was something unconventional for a woman in a portrait to do at this time.",
              "She also appears rather content and assured in her demeanor, which reflected more the expectations of the aristocracy among men rather than among women.",
              "Further, until this point in time, portraits of both men and women were typically cut off in the middle of torso and hands were raised so that we the head and face and shoulders occupies more of the panel upon which the paint was applied.",
              "Here, however, the portrait shows not only the woman\u2019s head and upper torso, but much of her body down to just below her waist.",
              "We see all of her arms, which are not raised up but resting comfortably on the armrests of her chair.",
              "The implication of this kind of view is that we are seeing the entire person, rather than just a sliver of her.",
              "Leonardo\u2019s approach was innovative and would start a trend in portrait painting which would influence European painting into 1800s.",
              "The way Leonardo has rendered the body of the woman is nothing less than extraordinary, and it truly reveals the jump forward in the level of naturalism that Italian painters made between 1400 and 1500.",
              "Leonardo makes use of his sfumato technique to show how the light bounces off her skin in certain places while leaving other parts in darker shadows.",
              "Her skin appears to be soft and smooth, and she looks quite like a real, though perhaps somewhat idealized, woman would look like right in front of us.",
              "Leonardo\u2019s skill in this painting particularly impressed the sixteenth-century painter and historian Vasari, who had the following to say about it: In this head, whoever wished to see how closely art could imitate nature, was able to comprehend it with ease;",
              "for in it were counterfeited all the minutenesses that with subtlety are able to be painted, seeing that the eyes had that lustre and watery sheen which are always seen in life, and around them were all those rosy and pearly tints, as well as the lashes, which cannot be represented without the greatest subtlety.",
              "The eyebrows, through his having shown the manner in which the hairs spring from the flesh, here more close and here more scanty, and curve according to the pores of the skin, could not be more natural.",
              "The nose, with its beautiful nostrils, rosy and tender, appeared to be alive.",
              "The mouth, with its opening, and with its ends united by the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the face, seemed, in truth, to be not colours but flesh.",
              "In the pit of the throat, if one gazed upon it intently, could be seen the beating of the pulse.",
              "And, indeed, it may be said that it was painted in such a manner as to make every valiant craftsman, be he who he may, tremble and lose heart.",
              "Apart from the naturalism in the figure, the painting includes a background which provides us with a stark contrast.",
              "Leonardo has placed Lisa against a vast landscape.",
              "The original loggia she was under was cropped out, but you can still see the base of the vertical supports to either side of her (at the right and left edges of the painting).",
              "If we look over her shoulder to the left side, we see a road that leads to distance, and mountains painted in a way which seems similar \u2013 at least on some level \u2013 to Chinese landscape painting of the preceding centuries.",
              "On the right side, we can see a bridge, and a road which leads to sea in the distance.",
              "It is in this vast landscape that we find a compelling juxtaposition in this painting.",
              "We have directly in front of us a touchable woman who is in the world of the here-and-now.",
              "She seems real to us \u2013 a very lifelike figure.",
              "Behind her we have a vast landscape which goes off into unknowable distances, and seems to continue on into a type of misty haze.",
              "The contrast between the woman and the background landscape is therefore quite remarkable, and it lends to the power of the painting.",
              "Overall, the Mona Lisa is a masterpiece in portrait painting which has stood the test of time and continues to inspire and amaze visitors to the Louvre from around the world.",
              "Yet, if we consider it apart from its current role as a leading icon of pop culture in the modern world, we can very much see how this innovative work would have created an impression on Leonardo\u2019s contemporaries in the sixteenth century.",

              "While some may debate its rightful name, few would question that Da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece is today the most famous painting in the world, although quite why or how it has acquired its iconic status is far less clear.",
              "Perhaps it is because so few genuine da Vinci paintings (perhaps 15) survive today.",
              "Perhaps it is because the Mona Lisa displays a technical mastery and daring composition that few, if any, have ever surpassed.",
              "Or maybe the answer lies in the fact that almost everything about the painting is shrouded in obscurity.",
              "Take her name.",
              "As described above, today she has at least three, although up until the mid-19th Century, she had none, being mainly referred to by various descriptive phrases, such as \u201ca certain Florentine lady\u201d and \u201ca courtesan in a gauze veil\u201d.",
              "The name Mona Lisa can be traced back to the famous Renaissance biographer Georgio Vasari, who claimed that the sitter was Lisa Gherardini, wife of the rich Florentine Merchant Francesco del Giocondo, who had commissioned the portrait from Da Vinci in 1502.",
              "Thus Mona Lisa was derived from the common Italian contraction of Madonna, meaning my lady, or Mrs Lisa.",
              "La Gioconda meanwhile (and the French translation La Joconde) is simply the feminine form of Giocondo, although this could perhaps be a coincidence \u2013 giocondo also means \u2018jocund\u2019, so this traditional name for the painting could in fact have originated as another purely descriptive title \u2013 the witty or playful one, the joker-lady, perhaps even the tease.",
              "The debate over the name stems from continuing uncertainty over the identity of the sitter.",
              "Alternative suggestions have ranged from Isabelle d\u2019Este;",
              "Constanza d\u2019Avalos, duchess of Francavilla (coincidentally also nicknamed \u2018La Gioconda\u2019);",
              "Isabella of Aragon, the Duchess of Milan;",
              "to da Vinci himself, his mother Caterina or even one of his gay lovers.",
              "This sexual ambiguity is not helped by the Mona Lisa\u2019s lack of facial hair which gives her a slightly androgynous look.",
              "It is unclear if this was deliberate (as facial hair on genteel women was considered unsightly at the time), or if Leonardo simply did not finish the painting, as is the case with almost all of his works.",
              "The confusion is worsened by the fact that the panel is unsigned and undated (Vasari claims that da Vinci painted it between 1503 and 1507, although some believe it was started as early as 1489 or as late at 1513).",
              "And although most portraits of the time included something to indicate the sitter\u2019s family name or social status, no such emblem can be found in the Mona Lisa.",
              "Nor is there any record of a commission for the portrait among Leonardo\u2019s papers.",
              "In a final twist, some have even speculated that da Vinci created more than one version of the painting, with some early copies (e.",
              "g. at the Dulwich Picture Gallery) showing columns to either side of the seated figure, while only the edges of the bases can be seen in the original.",
              "In other versions the sitter appears nude, leading some to speculate that they were copied from a lost Leonardo original depicting Lisa naked.",
              "If its genesis is uncertain, the Mona Lisa\u2019s subsequent movements are well documented and surprising in how little the painting has moved around compared to most other Renaissance works.",
              "Da Vinci took the painting to France with him in 1516 when Franc\u0327ois I offered him his patronage, eventually selling it to the king when on his death bed for 4,000 e\u0301cus.",
              "Franc\u0327ois installed it in the Apartement des Bains at the royal palace of Fontainebleau, where it remained until moved by Louis XIV to Versailles.",
              "His son, Louis XV, hated it however, and ordered it removed from the palace.",
              "For a time it was in the hands of a palace bureaucrat and after having been hidden in a warehouse during the chaos of the French Revolution, it was installed in the Louvre where it has remained ever since apart from a brief period when Napoleon insisted on hanging the painting in his bedroom in the adjacent Tuileries palace.",
              "Since then, the painting has been moved only five times: Twice when it was stored for safe-keeping during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u20131871 and the Second World War.",
              "Twice when it went on tour to the United States in 1962/63 and to Tokyo and Moscow in 1974.",
              "And once, of course, when it was stolen in 1911.",
              "Da Vinci used a pyramid design to place the woman simply and calmly in the space of the painting, modifying the simple formula of the seated Madonna which was in common use at the time.",
              "The enigmatic woman is portrayed seated in what appears to be an open loggia with dark pillar bases on either side.",
              "The armrest of the chair functions as a dividing element between Mona Lisa and us and she sits very upright with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture.",
              "At the same time, however, the framing of the Mona Lisa\u2019s face by much darker elements (her hair, veil and shadows), attracts the eye to her.",
              "This creates an ambiguous effect on the observer as we are both drawn to her and held at a distance The sensuous curves of the woman\u2019s hair and clothing, created through da Vinci\u2019s mastery of sfumato, are echoed in the undulating imaginary valleys and rivers behind her \u2013 Da Vinci was one of the first painters to place their subject in an imaginary landscape, a vast landscape receding to icy mountains behind her and winding paths and a distant bridge giving only the slightest indications of human presence.",
              "The blurred outlines, graceful figure, dramatic contrasts of light and dark, and overall feeling of calm are characteristic of Leonardo\u2019s style and his belief in a cosmic link connecting humanity and nature.",
              "Mona Lisa\u2019s smile has been the subject of many \u2013 greatly varying \u2013 interpretations.",
              "Unsurprisingly, Freud interpreted the \u2018smile\u2019 as signifying Leonardo\u2019s erotic attraction to his mother, while others have described it as both innocent and inviting.",
              "Many researchers have tried to explain why her smile is seen so differently by people.",
              "Dina Goldin, Adjunct Professor at Brown University, for example, has argued that the secret is in the dynamic position of Mona Lisa\u2019s facial muscles, where our mind\u2019s eye unconsciously extends her smile;",
              "the result is an unusual dynamicity to the face that invokes subtle yet strong emotions in the viewer of the painting.",
              "In late 2005, Dutch researchers from the University of Amsterdam ran the painting\u2019s image through an \u201cemotion recognition\u201d computer software which found the smile to be 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than 1% neutral, and 0% surprised.",
              "In 2004 experts from the National Research Council of Canada conducted a three-dimensional infrared scan which suggested that the transparent gauze veil worn by the sitter is a guarnello, typically used by women while pregnant or just after giving birth, and therefore concluded that the Mona Lisa\u2019s enigmatic smile is that of a glowing, pregnant woman.",
              "Vasari notes that even in da Vinci\u2019s day, artists came from far and wide to study the Mona Lisa in amazement.",
              "The young Raphael was reportedly so fascinated by Leonardo\u2019s composition that he created a series of Florentine portraits, several of which display a striking resemblance to the Mona Lisa.",
              "However, the painting only really came to mass-prominence in the mid-19th century, when artists of the emerging Symbolist movement began to appreciate it, and associated it with their ideas about feminine mystique.",
              "Catapulted to international notoriety by its theft in 1911 [click here for more] the Mona Lisa has come to occupy a unique position in popular culture, from Dadaist pin-up girl, to Andy Warhol screen print, to featuring in the Monty Python opening credits and \u201cstarring\u201d in the Muppet Show.",
              "Today, according to Louvre Curator Jean-Pierre Cuzin, the painting\u2019s importance is due more to the seminal role it has played in the history of painting: \u201cThe entire history of portraiture afterwards depends on the Mona Lisa.",
              "If you look at all the other portraits \u2013 not only of the Italian Renaissance, but also of the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries \u2013 if you look at Picasso, at everyone you want to name, all of them were inspired by this painting.",
              "Thus it is sort of the root, almost, of occidental portrait painting.",
              "\u201d Because of this, there is no reliable estimate of the value of the Mona Lisa.",
              "Prior to the 1962-63 tour to America, it was assessed for insurance purposes at $100 million.",
              "According to the Guinness Book of Records, this makes it the most valuable painting ever insured and only recently been surpassed (in terms of actual dollar price) by three other paintings: This comparison does not, however, account for the change in prices due to inflation \u2013 $100 million in 1962 is approximately $670 million in 2006 when adjusted for inflation.",
              "However, fame has come at a cost.",
              "In 1956, the lower part of the painting was severely damaged when someone doused it with acid.",
              "On December 30 of that same year, Ugo Ungaza Villegas, a young Bolivian, damaged the painting by throwing a rock at it.",
              "This resulted in the loss of a speck of pigment near the left elbow, which was later painted over.",
              "Today, to protect her from further attacks, the painting is displayed in a purpose-built, climate-controlled enclosure behind bullet proof glass in the newly refurbished Salle des E\u0301tats, just off the Grande Gallerie.",
              "But the true cost of her fame is perhaps felt most by those who go to see her.",
              "As Cuzin says \u201cThe problem is she has become so famous that we don\u2019t really see her anymore.",
              "What would be extraordinary would be to see the Mona Lisa for the very first time, as if you had never seen her before.",

              "It is the most famous painting in the world, and yet, when viewers manage to see the artwork up close, they are likely to be baffled by the small subdued portrait of an ordinary woman.",
              "She\u2019s dressed modestly in a translucent veil, dark robes, and no jewelry.",
              "Much has been said about her smile and gaze, but viewers still might wonder what all the fuss is about.",
              "Along with the mysteries of the sitter\u2019s identity and her enigmatic look, the reason for the work\u2019s popularity is one of its many conundrums. Although many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece\u2019s celebrity, the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.",
              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal.",
              "There is no doubt that the Mona Lisa is a very good painting.",
              "It was highly regarded even as Leonardo worked on it, and his contemporaries copied the then novel three-quarter pose.",
              "The writer Giorgio Vasari later extolled Leonardo\u2019s ability to closely imitate nature.",
              "Indeed, the Mona Lisa is a very realistic portrait.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato, an artistic technique that uses subtle gradations of light and shadow to model form, and shows his understanding of the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric reveal Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "And, although the sitter\u2019s steady gaze and restrained smile were not regarded as mysterious until the 19th century, viewers today can appreciate her equivocal expression.",
              "Leonardo painted a complex figure that is very much like a complicated human.",
              "Many scholars, however, point out that the excellent quality of the Mona Lisa was not enough by itself to make the painting a celebrity.",
              "There are, after all, many good paintings.",
              "External events also contributed to the artwork\u2019s fame.",
              "That the painting\u2019s home is the Louvre, one of the world\u2019s most-visited museums, is a fortuitous circumstance that has added to the work\u2019s stature.",
              "It arrived at the Louvre via a circuitous path beginning with Francis I, king of France, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life.",
              "The painting became part of the royal collection, and, for centuries after, the portrait was secluded in French palaces until the Revolution claimed the royal collection as the property of the people.",
              "Following a stint in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "As patronage of the Louvre grew, so too did recognition of the painting.",
              "The identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter soon became more intriguing.",
              "Although many scholars believe that the painting depicts Lisa Gherardini, wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo, no records of such a commission from Francesco exist, and the sitter has never been conclusively identified.",
              "The unknown identity has thus lent the figure to whatever characterization people wanted to make of her.",
              "During the Romantic era of the 19th century, the simple Florentine housewife who may have been portrayed was transformed into a mysterious seductress.",
              "The French writer The\u0301ophile Gautier described her as a \u201cstrange being.",

              "The English author Walter Pater went so far as to call her a vampire who \u201chas been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave.",
              "\u201d The air of mystery that came to surround the Mona Lisa in the 19th century continues to define the painting and draw speculation.",
              "Meanwhile, the 19th century also mythologized Leonardo as a genius.",
              "Throughout the centuries after his death, he was well regarded\u2014but no more so than his esteemed contemporaries Michelangelo and Raphael.",
              "Some scholars have noted, however, that, as interest in the Renaissance grew in the 19th century, Leonardo became more popularly seen not only as a very good painter but also as a great scientist and inventor whose designs prefigured contemporary inventions.",
              "Many of his so-called inventions were later debunked, and his contributions to science and architecture came to be seen as small, but the myth of Leonardo as a genius has continued well into the 21st century, contributing to the Mona Lisa\u2019s popularity.",
              "The writers of the 19th century aroused interest in the Mona Lisa, but the theft of the painting in 1911 and the ensuing media frenzy brought it worldwide attention.",
              "When news of the crime broke on August 22 of that year, it caused an immediate sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to gape at the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, accusations of a hoax splashed across newspapers, and Pablo Picasso was even arrested as a suspect!",
              "Two years later the painting was found in Italy after an art dealer in Florence alerted the local authorities that a man had contacted him about selling it.",
              "The man was Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant to France, who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and two other workers took the portrait from the wall, hid with it in a closet overnight, and ran off with it in the morning.",
              "Unable to sell the painting because of the media attention, Peruggia hid it in the false bottom of a trunk until his capture.",
              "He was tried, convicted, and imprisoned for the theft while the painting toured Italy before it made its triumphant return to the Louvre.",
              "By then, many French people had come to regard the work as a national treasure that they had lost and recovered.",
              "The Mona Lisa was certainly more famous after the heist, but World War I soon consumed much of the world's attention.",
              "Some scholars argue that Marcel Duchamp\u2019s playful defacement of a postcard reproduction in 1919 brought attention back to the Mona Lisa and started a trend that would make the painting one of the most-recognized in the world.",

              "For decades after, other artists, notably Andy Warhol, followed suit.",
              "As artists distorted, disfigured, and played with reproductions of the Mona Lisa, cartoonists and admen exaggerated her further still.",
              "Over the decades, as technology improved, the painting was endlessly reproduced, sometimes manipulated and sometimes not, so that the sitter\u2019s face became one of the most well known in the world, even to those who had little interest in art.",
              "A tour of the painting to the United States in 1963 and to Japan in 1974 elevated it to celebrity status.",
              "The Mona Lisa traveled to the United States in no less than a first-class cabin on an ocean liner and drew about 40,000 people a day to the Metropolitan Museum in New York City and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",

              "Although the Mona Lisa is undoubtedly good art, there is no single reason for its celebrity.",
              "Rather, it is hundreds of circumstances\u2014from its fortuitous arrival at the Louvre to the mythmaking of the 19th century to the endless reproductions of the 20th and 21st centuries\u2014that have all worked together with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal to make the Mona Lisa the world\u2019s most famous painting ever."

              "Scholars all around, however, knew better, and for decades have been coming up with suggestions as to who she might be, until she was as confused as to her identity as Shakespeare\u2019s Dark Lady of the sonnets.",
              "At last the matter is solved, and it is we who have been right all along.",
              "This month\u2019s Burlington Magazine publishes an article by Janice Shell and Grazioso Sironi, who have come up with a document of 1525 in the Milan State Archives, the inventory of goods on death of Leonardo\u2019s assistant for thirty years, Salai\u0300, which lists a \u201cQuadro dicto la Joconda\u201d (a painting called la Joconda) with an enormously high value assigned to it.",
              "The significance of this find is that it is the earliest known reference to the painting in the Louvre by that name and it settles the above- mentioned confusion as to the identity of the sitter, which has come about because of two conflicting sixteenth-century accounts of the work.",
              "The first is the only eye-witness description of what Leonardo was up to in his chateau of Cloux, by one Antonio de Beatis who visited him in 1517, two years before the great man died.",
              "De Beatis tells that he was shown a \u201ccertain Florentine woman done from life at the behest of Giuliano de Medici\u201d.",

              "It now belongs to King Francis of France at Fontainebleu\u201d?",
              "The attempts to reconcile these two accounts have led to some remarkable intellectual acrobatics on the part of scholars, and the Burlington Magazine article enjoyably lists many of them in the footnotes, ending with the dry comment: \u201cSuggestions that the Louvre portrait actually depicts a man, possibly Leonardo himself, may be rejected out of hand\u201d.",
              "What the Salai\u0300 inventory proves is that Leonardo really did paint Lisa del Giocondo, and this portrait, as Vasari said, went into Francis I\u2019s collection at Fontainebleu.",
              "Since we know that the painting in the Louvre is definitely the one that was in Fontainebleu ergo the painting in the Louvre is the portrait of Lisa del Giocondo (which is why she gets called the Gioconda\u2014nothing to do with her jocund little smile).",

              "How Leonardo da Vinci Made Mona Lisa Smile - The Atlantic",
              "How Leonardo da Vinci engineered the world\u2019s most famous painting Leonardo da Vinci liked to think that he was as good at engineering as he was at painting, and though this was not actually the case (nobody was as good at engineering as he was at painting), the basis for his creativity was an enthusiasm for interweaving diverse disciplines.",
              "With a passion both playful and obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, mechanics, art, music, optics, birds, the heart, flying machines, geology, and weaponry.",
              "He wanted to know everything there was to know about everything that could be known.",
              "By standing astride the intersection of the arts and the sciences, he became history\u2019s most creative genius.",
              "His science informed his art.",
              "He studied human skulls, making drawings of the bones and teeth, and conveyed the skeletal agony of Saint Jerome in the Wilderness.",
              "He explored the mathematics of optics, showing how light rays enter the eye, and produced magical illusions of changing visual perspectives in The Last Supper.",
              "His greatest triumph of combining art, science, optics, and illusion was the smile of the Mona Lisa, which he started working on in 1503 and continued laboring over nearly until his death 16 years later.",
              "He dissected human faces, delineating the muscles that move the lips, and combined that knowledge with the science of how the retina processes perceptions.",
              "The result was a masterpiece that invites and responds to human interactions, making Leonardo a pioneer of virtual reality.",
              "The magic of the Mona Lisa\u2019s smile is that it seems to react to our gaze.",
              "What is she thinking?",
              "She smiles back mysteriously.",
              "Look again.",
              "Her smile seems to flicker.",
              "We glance away, and the enigmatic smile lingers in our minds, as it does in the collective mind of humanity.",
              "In no other painting are motion and emotion, the paired touchstones of Leonardo\u2019s art, so intertwined.",
              "The artist Giorgio Vasari, a near-contemporary, told of how Leonardo kept Lisa del Giocondo, the young wife of a Florentine silk merchant, smiling during her portrait sessions.",
              "\u201cWhile painting her portrait, he employed people to play and sing for her, and jesters to keep her merry, to put an end to the melancholy that painters often succeed in giving to their portraits.",
              "\u201d The result, Vasari said, was \u201ca smile so pleasing that it was more divine than human,\u201d and he proclaimed that it was a product of superhuman skills that came directly from God.",
              "That\u2019s a typical Vasari cliche\u0301, and it\u2019s misleading.",
              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s smile came not from some divine intervention.",
              "Instead, it was the product of years of painstaking and studied human effort involving applied science as well as artistic skill.",
              "Using his technical and anatomical knowledge, Leonardo generated the optical impressions that made possible this brilliant display of virtuosity.",
              "In doing so, he showed how the most-profound examples of creativity come from embracing both the arts and the sciences.",
              "Leonardo\u2019s efforts to fashion the Mona Lisa\u2019s effects began with the preparation of the painting\u2019s wood panel.",
              "On a thin-grained plank cut from the center of a trunk of poplar, he applied a primer coat of lead white, rather than just a mix of chalk and pigment.",
              "That undercoat, he knew, would be better at reflecting back the light that made it through his fine layers of translucent glazes and thereby would enhance the impression of depth, luminosity, and volume.",
              "Some of the light that penetrates the layers of paint reaches the white undercoat and is reflected back through those same layers.",
              "As a result, our eyes see the interplay between the light rays that bounce off the colors on the surface and those that dance back from the depths of the painting.",
              "This creates shifting and elusive subtleties.",
              "The contours of Lisa\u2019s cheeks and smile are created by soft transitions of tone that seem veiled by the glaze layers, and they vary as the light in the room and the angle of our gaze change.",
              "The painting comes alive.",
              "Like 15th-century Netherlandish painters such as Jan van Eyck, Leonardo used glazes that had a very small proportion of pigment mixed into the oil.",
              "Leonardo\u2019s distinctive approach was to apply the glaze in extraordinarily thin and tiny strokes and then very slowly, over months and sometimes years, apply additional layer upon thin layer.",
              "This permitted him to create forms that looked three-dimensional, show subtle gradations in shadows, and blur the borders of objects in a sfumato style.",
              "His strokes were so light and layered that many individual brushstrokes are imperceptible.",
              "For the shadows that form the contours of Lisa\u2019s face and especially around her smile, he pioneered the use of an iron-and-manganese mix to create a pigment that was burnt umber in color.",
              "\u201cThe thickness of a brown glaze placed over the pink base of the Mona Lisa\u2019s cheek grades smoothly from just 2\u20135 micrometers to around thirty micrometers in the deepest shadow,\u201d according to a Nature article about a recent study using X-ray-fluorescence spectroscopy.",
              "The strokes were applied in an intentionally irregular way that served to make the grain of the skin look more lifelike.",
              "During the years when he was perfecting Lisa\u2019s smile, Leonardo was spending his nights in the depths of the morgue at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova, near his Florence studio, peeling the skin off cadavers and studying the muscles and nerves underneath.",
              "He became fascinated by how a smile begins to form, and he analyzed every possible movement of each part of the face to determine the origin of every nerve that controlled each facial muscle.",
              "Leonardo was especially interested in how the human brain and nervous system translate emotions into movements of the body.",
              "In one drawing, he showed the spinal cord sawed in half, and delineated all the nerves that ran down to it from the brain.",
              "\u201cThe spinal cord is the source of the nerves that give voluntary movement to the limbs,\u201d he wrote.",
              "Of these nerves and related muscles, the ones controlling the lips were the most important to Leonardo.",
              "Dissecting them was exceedingly difficult, because lip muscles are small and plentiful and attach deep in the skin.",
              "\u201cThe muscles which move the lips are more numerous in man than in any other animal,\u201d he wrote.",
              "\u201cOne will always find as many muscles as there are positions of the lips and many more that serve to undo these positions.",
              "\u201d Despite these difficulties, Leonardo depicted the facial muscles and nerves with remarkable accuracy.",
              "On one delightfully crammed anatomical sheet (Figure 1, below), Leonardo drew the muscles of two dissected arms and hands, and he placed alongside them two partially dissected faces in profile.",
              "The faces show the muscles that control the lips and other elements of expression.",
              "In the one on the left, Leonardo has removed part of the jawbone to expose the buccinator muscle, which pulls back the angle of the mouth and flattens the cheek as a smile begins to form.",
              "Here we can see, revealed with masterful scalpel cuts and then pen strokes, the actual mechanisms that transmit emotions into facial expressions.",
              "\u201cRepresent all the causes of motion possessed by the skin, flesh and muscles of the face and see if these muscles receive their motion from nerves which come from the brain or not,\u201d he wrote next to one of his face drawings.",
              "He labeled one of the muscles in the left-hand drawing \u201cH\u201d and called it \u201cthe muscle of anger.",
              "\u201d Another is labeled \u201cP\u201d and designated as the muscle of sadness or pain.",
              "He showed how these muscles not only move the lips but also serve to move the eyebrows downward and together, causing wrinkles.",
              "Leonardo also describes pursuing the comparative anatomy he needed for a battle painting that he was planning;",
              "he matched the anger on the faces of the humans to that on the faces of the horses.",
              "After his note about representing the causes of motion of the human face, he added: \u201cAnd do this first for the horse that has large muscles.",
              "Notice whether the muscle that raises the nostrils of the horse is the same as that which lies here in man.",
              "\u201d Thus we discover another secret to Leonardo\u2019s unique ability to paint a facial expression: He is probably the only artist in history ever to dissect with his own hands the face of a human and that of a horse to see whether the muscles that move the lips are the same ones that can raise the nostrils of the horse\u2019s nose.",
              "Leonardo\u2019s excursions into comparative anatomy allowed him to delve deeper into the physiological mechanisms of humans as they smiled or grimaced (Figure 2, below).",
              "He focused on the role of various nerves in sending signals to the muscles, and he asked a question that was central to his art: Which of these are cranial nerves originating in the brain and which are spinal nerves?",
              "His notes begin with a description of how to portray angry expressions.",
              "\u201cMake the nostrils drawn up, causing furrows in the side of the nose, and the lips arched to disclose the upper teeth, with the teeth parted in order to shriek lamentations,\u201d he wrote.",
              "He then began to explore other expressions.",
              "In the top-left corner of another page, he drew lips that were tightly pursed, under which he wrote, \u201cThe maximum shortening of the mouth is equal to half its maximum extension, and it is equal to the greatest width of the nostrils of the nose and to the interval between the ducts of the eye.",
              "\u201d He tested in himself and in the cadaver how each muscle of the cheek could move the lips, and how the muscles of the lips can also pull the lateral muscles of the wall of the cheek.",
              "\u201cThe muscle shortening the lips is the same muscle forming the lower lip itself,\u201d he wrote.",
              "This led him to a discovery that any of us could make on our own, but it is a testament to Leonardo\u2019s keen power of observation that he noticed it when most of us don\u2019t: Because we pucker our lips by contracting the muscle that forms the lower lip, we can pucker both lips at the same time or the lower lip alone, but we cannot pucker our top lip alone.",
              "It was a tiny discovery, but for an anatomist who was also an artist, especially one who was painting the Mona Lisa, it was worth noting.",
              "Other movements of the lips involve different muscles, including \u201cthose which bring the lips to a point, others which spread them, and others which curl them back, others which straighten them out, others which twist them transversely, and others which return them to their first position.",
              "\u201d He sketched head-on and profile drawings of retracted lips with the skin still on, then a row of lips with the skin layer peeled off.",
              "This is the first known anatomical drawing of the human smile.",
              "Floating above the grotesque grimaces on the top of the page in Figure 2 is a faint sketch in black chalk of a simple set of lips that are rendered in a way that is artistic rather than anatomical.",
              "The lips peek out of the page directly at us with just a hint\u2014flickering and haunting and alluring\u2014of a mysterious smile.",
              "Even though the fine lines at the ends of the mouth turn down almost imperceptibly, the impression is that the lips are smiling.",
              "Here amid the anatomy drawings we find the makings of the Mona Lisa\u2019s smile.",
              "Another piece of science that augments the Mona Lisa\u2019s smile comes from Leonardo\u2019s research on optics: He realized that light rays do not come to a single point in the eye, but instead hit the whole area of the retina.",
              "The central area of the retina, known as the fovea, has closely packed cones and is best at seeing small details;",
              "the area surrounding the fovea is best at picking up shadows and shadings of black and white.",
              "When we look at an object straight on, it appears sharper.",
              "When we look at it peripherally, glimpsing it with the corner of our eye, it is a bit blurrier, as if it were farther away.",
              "Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.",
              "With this knowledge, Leonardo was able to create an interactive smile, one that is elusive if we are too intent on seeing it.",
              "The fine lines at the corners of Lisa\u2019s mouth show a small downturn\u2014just like the mouth floating atop the anatomy sheet.",
              "If you stare directly at the mouth, the retina catches these tiny details and delineations, making her appear not to be smiling.",
              "But if you move your gaze slightly away, to look at her eyes or cheeks or some other part of the painting, you will catch sight of her mouth only peripherally.",
              "It will be a bit blurrier.",
              "The tiny delineations at the corners of the mouth become indistinct, but you will still see the shadows at her mouth\u2019s edge.",
              "These shadows and the soft sfumato at the edge of her mouth make her lips seem to turn upward into a subtle smile.",
              "The result is a smile that twinkles brighter the less you search for it.",
              "Scientists recently found a technical way to describe all of this.",
              "\u201cA clear smile is much more apparent in the low spatial frequency [blurrier] images than in the high spatial frequency image,\u201d according to the Harvard Medical School neuroscientist Margaret Livingstone.",
              "\u201cThus, if you look at the painting so that your gaze falls on the background or on Mona Lisa\u2019s hands, your perception of her mouth would be dominated by low spatial frequencies, so it would appear much more cheerful than when you look directly at her mouth.",
              "\u201d So the world\u2019s most famous smile is inherently and fundamentally elusive, and therein lies Leonardo\u2019s ultimate realization about human nature.",
              "His expertise was in depicting the outer manifestation of inner emotions, but here in the Mona Lisa he shows something more important: that we can never fully know another person\u2019s true emotions.",
              "They always have a sfumato quality, a veil of mystery.",
              "Leonardo once wrote and performed at the court of Milan a discourse on why painting should be considered the most exalted of all the art forms, more worthy than poetry or sculpture or even the writing of history.",
              "One of his arguments was that painters did more than simply depict reality\u2014they also augmented it.",
              "They combined observation with imagination.",
              "Using tricks and illusions, painters could enhance reality with cobbled-together creations, such as dragons, monsters, angels with wondrous wings, and landscapes more magical than any that ever existed.",
              "\u201cPainting,\u201d he wrote, \u201cembraces not only the works of nature but also infinite things that nature never created.",
              "\u201d Leonardo believed in basing knowledge on experience, but he also indulged his love of fantasy.",
              "He relished the wonders that could be seen by the eye but also those seen only by the imagination.",
              "As a result, his mind could dance magically, and sometimes frenetically, back and forth across the smudgy line that separates reality from fantasia.",
              "Stand before the Mona Lisa, and the science and the magic and the art all blur together into an augmented reality.",
              "While Leonardo worked on it, for most of the last 16 years of his life, it became more than a portrait of an individual.",
              "It became universal, a distillation of Leonardo\u2019s accumulated wisdom about the outward manifestations of our inner lives and about the connections between ourselves and our world.",
              "Like Vitruvian Man standing in the square of the Earth and the circle of the heavens, Lisa sitting on her balcony is Leonardo\u2019s profound meditation on what it means to be human.",
              "When the British needed to contact their allies in the French resistance during World War II, they used a code phrase: La Joconde garde un sourire\u2014\u201cThe Mona Lisa keeps her smile.",
              "\u201d Even though it may seem to flicker, her smile contains the immutable wisdom of the ages.",
              "The Mona Lisa became the most famous painting in the world not just because of hype and happenstance, but because viewers were able to feel an emotional engagement with her.",
              "It is a brilliant depiction of reality\u2014an alluring and emotionally mysterious woman sitting alone on a loggia\u2014that is augmented radiantly by science and magical illusions.",
              "She provokes a complex series of psychological reactions, ones that she in turn seems to exhibit as well.",
              "Most miraculously, she seems aware\u2014conscious\u2014both of us and of herself.",
              "That is what makes her seem alive, more alive than any other portrait ever painted.",
              "And what about all the scholars and critics over the years who despaired that Leonardo squandered too much time immersed in his studies of optics, anatomy, technology, and the patterns of the cosmos?",

              "By gaining insights into these key factors, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to identify and appreciate these art forms more effectively.",
              "Understanding Lithographs A lithograph is a type of printmaking technique that involves the process of drawing or painting on a stone or metal plate.",
              "It is based on the principle of oil and water repelling each other.",
              "The artist creates an image on the stone using specialized tools, and then applies ink to the stone's surface.",
              "The ink adheres to the image while being repelled by the wet areas, and a piece of paper is pressed onto the plate to transfer the image.",
              "A more detailed article on Lithographs can be referenced in the article What Is A Lithograph.",
              "Analyzing Painting Techniques Painting, on the other hand, involves the application of pigments onto a surface, typically canvas, using various tools like brushes, knives, or even fingers.",
              "Paintings can be created with different types of paints, such as oil, acrylic, watercolor, or gouache.",
              "Artists have greater freedom to manipulate the paint, creating textures, layering colors, and incorporating various brushstrokes, thereby resulting in a unique and original piece of artwork.",
              "There are a few key differences between lithographs and paintings that can help you tell them apart.",
              "Paper: Lithographs are typically printed on high-quality paper, such as rag paper or watercolor paper.",
              "Paintings, on the other hand, can be painted on any type of paper, including newsprint, canvas, or wood.",
              "Ink: Lithographs are printed with ink that is specifically designed for lithography.",
              "This ink is water-based and has a high viscosity, which means that it is thick and does not flow easily.",
              "Paintings, on the other hand, can be painted with any type of paint, including oil paint, acrylic paint, or watercolor paint.",
              "Printing process: Lithographs are printed using a process called intaglio printing.",
              "This process involves pressing the plate against the paper in a very controlled manner.",
              "Paintings, on the other hand, are painted by hand, and there is no such control over the application of paint.",
              "Texture: Lithographs typically have a smooth, even texture.",
              "Paintings, on the other hand, can have a variety of textures, depending on the type of paint and brushstrokes used.",
              "Signature: Lithographs are typically signed by the artist.",
              "Paintings, on the other hand, are not always signed.",
              "Examining the Surface One of the key ways to differentiate between a lithograph and a painting is by examining the surface closely.",
              "Lithographs typically have a flat, smooth texture with even ink distribution.",
              "Due to the nature of the printing process, the lines and colors in lithographs tend to be more uniform and consistent.",
              "In contrast, paintings often exhibit varied textures, visible brushstrokes, and an overall three-dimensional quality.",
              "The presence of texture is a strong indicator of an original painting.",
              "Inspecting the Signature Another important aspect to consider is the presence of an artist's signature.",
              "In most cases, lithographs are signed in pencil, usually at the bottom margin, while paintings are typically signed in paint directly on the artwork itself.",
              "Examining the signature can provide valuable insights into the authenticity and origin of the piece.",
              "Additionally, lithographs may have edition numbers or impressions indicating the total number of prints made from the original plate.",
              "Assessing the Color Saturation Color saturation is another distinguishing factor between lithographs and paintings.",
              "Lithographs tend to have more consistent color saturation throughout the print, with an absence of subtle variations that are commonly seen in paintings.",
              "Paintings, on the other hand, often exhibit subtle color shifts, gradients, and nuanced tonal variations, showcasing the artist's hand in mixing and applying the pigments.",
              "Considering the Frame and Glass The framing and glass used can also provide clues about whether you're looking at a lithograph or a painting.",
              "Paintings are usually framed with a mat and glass, which helps protect the artwork and enhance its presentation.",
              "In contrast, lithographs are typically framed without glass, as the glass can cause unwanted reflections and interfere with viewing the image.",
              "Moreover, lithographs are often mounted directly on the backing board to prevent any damage caused by the pressure of the glass.",
              "Conclusion Distinguishing between a lithograph and a painting requires a keen eye and understanding of the key differences in technique, materials, and characteristics.",
              "By examining the surface, signature, color saturation, and framing, you can confidently identify whether you are looking at a painting or a Lithograph.",
