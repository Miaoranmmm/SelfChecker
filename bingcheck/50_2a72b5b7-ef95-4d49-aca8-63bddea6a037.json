              "However, a persistent difference called the \u201cHubble Tension\u201d is seen between the value of the constant measured with a wide range of independent distance indicators and its value predicted from the big bang afterglow.",
              "NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope provides new capabilities to scrutinize and refine some of the strongest observational evidence for this tension.",
              "Nobel Laureate Adam Riess from the Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute presents his and his colleagues\u2019 recent work using Webb observations to improve the precision of local measurements of the Hubble constant.",
              "\u201cDid you ever struggle to see a sign that was at the edge of your vision?",
              "What does it say?",
              "What does it mean?",
              "Even with the most powerful telescopes, the \u2018signs\u2019 astronomers want to read appear so small that we struggle too.",
              "\u201cThe sign cosmologists want to read is a cosmic speed limit sign that tells us how fast the universe is expanding \u2014 a number called the Hubble constant.",
              "Our sign is written into the stars in distant galaxies.",
              "The brightnesses of certain stars in those galaxies tell us how far away they are and thus for how much time this light has been traveling to reach us, and the redshifts of the galaxies tell us how much the universe expanded over that time, hence telling us the expansion rate.",
              "\u201cA particular class of stars, Cepheid variables, has given us the most precise measurements of distance for over a century because these stars are extraordinarily bright: They are supergiant stars, a hundred thousand times the luminosity of the Sun.",
              "What\u2019s more, they pulsate (that is, expand and contract in size) over a period of weeks that indicates their relative luminosity.",
              "The longer the period, the intrinsically brighter they are.",
              "They are the gold standard tool for the purpose of measuring the distances of galaxies a hundred million or more light years away, a crucial step to determine the Hubble constant.",
              "Unfortunately, stars in galaxies are crowded together in a small space from our distant vantage point and so we often lack the resolution to separate them from their line-of-sight neighbors.",
              "\u201cA major justification for building the Hubble Space Telescope was to solve this problem.",
              "Prior to Hubble\u2019s 1990 launch and its subsequent Cepheid measurements, the expansion rate of the universe was so uncertain astronomers weren\u2019t sure if the universe has been expanding for 10 billion or 20 billion years.",
              "That\u2019s because a faster expansion rate will lead to a younger age for the universe, and a slower expansion rate will lead to an older age of the universe.",
              "Hubble has better visible-wavelength resolution than any ground-based telescope because it sits above the blurring effects of Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
              "As a result, it can identify individual Cepheid variables in galaxies that are more than a hundred million light-years away and measure the time interval over which they change their brightness.",
              "\u201cHowever, we also must observe the Cepheids at the near-infrared part of the spectrum to see the light which passes unscathed through intervening dust.",
              "(Dust absorbs and scatters blue optical light, making distant objects look faint and fooling us into believing they are farther away than they are).",
              "Unfortunately, Hubble\u2019s red-light vision is not as sharp as its blue, so the Cepheid starlight we see there is blended with other stars in its field of view.",
              "We can account for the average amount of blending, statistically, the same way a doctor figures out your weight by subtracting the average weight of clothes from the scale reading, but doing so adds noise to the measurements.",
              "Some people\u2019s clothes are heavier than others.",
              "\u201cHowever, sharp infrared vision is one of the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s superpowers.",
              "With its large mirror and sensitive optics, it can readily separate the Cepheid light from neighboring stars with little blending.",
              "In the first year of Webb operations with our General Observers program 1685, we collected observations of Cepheids found by Hubble at two steps along what\u2019s known as the cosmic distance ladder.",
              "The first step involves observing Cepheids in a galaxy with a known, geometric distance that allows us to calibrate the true luminosity of Cepheids.",
              "For our program that galaxy is NGC 4258.",
              "The second step is to observe Cepheids in the host galaxies of recent Type Ia supernovae.",
              "The combination of the first two steps transfers knowledge of the distance to the supernovae to calibrate their true luminosities.",
              "Step three is to observe those supernovae far away where the expansion of the universe is apparent and can be measured by comparing the distances inferred from their brightness and the redshifts of the supernova host galaxies.",
              "This sequence of steps is known as the distance ladder.",
              "\u201cWe recently got our first Webb measurements from steps one and two which allows us to complete the distance ladder and compare to the previous measurements with Hubble (see figure) Webb\u2019s measurements have dramatically cut the noise in the Cepheid measurements due to the observatory\u2019s resolution at near-infrared wavelengths.",
              "This kind of improvement is the stuff astronomers dream of!",
              "We observed more than 320 Cepheids across the first two steps.",
              "We confirmed that the earlier Hubble Space Telescope measurements were accurate, albeit noisier.",
              "We have also observed four more supernova hosts with Webb and we see a similar result for the whole sample.",
              "\u201cWhat the results still do not explain is why the universe appears to be expanding so fast!",
              "We can predict the expansion rate of the universe by observing its baby picture, the cosmic microwave background, and then employing our best model of how it grows up over time to tell us how fast the universe should be expanding today.",
              "The fact that the present measure of the expansion rate significantly exceeds the prediction is a now decade-long problem called \u201cThe Hubble Tension.",
              "\u201d The most exciting possibility is that the Tension is a clue about something we are missing in our understanding of the cosmos.",
              "\u201cIt may indicate the presence of exotic dark energy, exotic dark matter, a revision to our understanding of gravity, or the presence of a unique particle or field.",
              "The more mundane explanation would be multiple measurement errors conspiring in the same direction (astronomers have ruled out a single error by using independent steps), so that is why it is so important to redo the measurements with greater fidelity.",
              "With Webb confirming the measurements from Hubble, the Webb measurements provide the strongest evidence yet that systematic errors in Hubble\u2019s Cepheid photometry do not play a significant role in the present Hubble Tension.",
              "As a result, the more interesting possibilities remain on the table and the mystery of the Tension deepens.",

              "Instead, most of the gas is expelled from the vicinity of the black hole as atomic or molecular outflows, and returns to the gas disk to participate again into an accretion flow towards the black hole, much like how water gets recycled in a water fountain.",

              "Astronomers used to think that all of the stars in the universe were part of the Milky Way, but that changed in the 1920s when Edwin Hubble, the American astronomer after whom the famous telescope is named, managed to calculate the distance of the Andromeda nebula (today known as the Andromeda galaxy).",
              "He found that it was too far to be part of the Milky Way.",
              "The primary way astronomers estimate the number of stars in a galaxy is by determining the galaxy's mass.",
              "This can be done by analyzing the rotation of the galaxy and the spectrum of the light it emits.",
              "In general, galaxies move away from each other as a result of the expansion of the universe (unless they are on a collision course).",
              "As a result, we see the light of distant galaxies shifted towards longer wavelengths due to the so-called redshift (that is essentially the Doppler Effect, the same effect that distorts the frequency of a passing siren as it moves away from a bystander).",
              "In a rotating galaxy, however, there will be a portion that is more blueshifted (stretched towards the shorter wavelengths) because that portion is rotating toward Earth.",
              "Astronomers must also know what the inclination or orientation of the galaxy is before making an estimate, which is sometimes simply an \"educated guess,\" Kornreich said.",
              "A technique called long-slit spectroscopy is best for performing this type of work.",
              "Here, an elongated object such as a galaxy is viewed through an elongated slit, and the light is refracted using a prism.",
              "This breaks down the colors of the stars into the colors of the rainbow.",
              "Some of those colors will be missing, displaying patterns of missing portions as elements of the periodic table that absorbed parts of the light.",
              "This lets astronomers figure out what elements are in the stars.",
              "Each type of star has a unique chemical fingerprint that would show up in telescopes.",

              "Kornreich often uses the 200-inch telescope at the Palomar Observatory at the California Institute of Technology, but he added that almost any telescope of sufficient size would be adequate.",
              "The ideal would be using a telescope in orbit because scattering occurs in Earth's atmosphere.",
              "The Hubble Space Telescope is one observatory known for this sort of work, Kornreich added.",
              "It's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in December 2021, will contribute to this work as well.",
              "Between different galaxies of the same mass, there could be differences as to the types of stars and the overall mass.",
              "Kornreich cautioned this would be very hard to speak about generally, but said that one difference could be looking at elliptical galaxies vs. spiral galaxies such as our own, the Milky Way.",
              "Elliptical galaxies tend to have more K- and M-type red dwarf stars than spiral galaxies.",
              "Because elliptical galaxies are older, they will have less gas because that was blown away during their evolution.",
              "Once a galaxy's mass is determined, the other tricky thing is figuring out how much of that mass is made of stars.",
              "Most of the mass will be made up of dark matter, a type of matter that emits no light but which is believed to make up most of the mass of the universe.",
              "\"You have to model the galaxy and see if you can understand what the percentage of that mass of stars is,\" Kornreich said.",
              "\"In a typical galaxy, if you measure its mass by looking at the rotation curve, about 90% of that is dark matter.\"",
              "With much of the remaining stuff in the galaxy made up of diffuse gas and dust, Kornreich estimated that about 3% of the galaxy's mass will be made up of stars, but that could vary.",
              "Further, the size of the stars itself can greatly vary from something the is the size of our sun, to something dozens of times smaller or bigger.",
              "So is there any way to figure out how many stars are in the Milky Way for sure?",
              "According to Jos de Bruijne, a scientist at the European Space Agency (ESA) who works on the galaxy-mapping Gaia mission, the current estimate is between 100 to 400 billion stars.",
              "Getting to a definitive number, de Bruijne told Space.",

              "They are highly concentrated along the plane of the Galaxy and slowly decrease in number outward from its centre.",
              "The large-scale distribution of these clusters cannot be learned directly because their existence in the Milky Way plane means that dust obscures those that are more than a few thousand light-years from the Sun.",

              "In structure they look very different from globular clusters, though they can be understood in terms of similar dynamical models.",
              "The most important structural difference is their small total mass and relative looseness, which result from their comparatively large core radii.",
              "These two features have disastrous consequences as far as their ultimate fate is concerned, because open clusters are not sufficiently gravitationally bound to be able to withstand the disruptive tidal effects in the Galaxy (see star cluster: Open clusters).",
              "Judging from the sample of open clusters within 3,000 light-years of the Sun, only half of them can withstand such tidal forces for more than 200 million years, and a mere 2 percent have life expectancies as high as 1 billion years.",

              "Ages of open clusters are determined by comparing their stellar membership with theoretical models of stellar evolution.",
              "Because all the stars in a cluster have very nearly the same age and chemical composition, the differences between the member stars are entirely the result of their different masses.",
              "As time progresses after the formation of a cluster, the massive stars, which evolve the fastest, gradually disappear from the cluster, becoming white dwarf stars or other underluminous stellar remnants.",
              "Theoretical models of clusters show how this effect changes the stellar content with time, and direct comparisons with real clusters give reliable ages for them.",
              "To make this comparison, astronomers use a diagram (the colour-magnitude diagram) that plots the temperatures of the stars against their luminosities.",
              "Colour-magnitude diagrams have been obtained for more than 1,000 open clusters, and ages are thus known for this large sample.",
              "Because open clusters are mostly young objects, they have chemical compositions that correspond to the enriched environment from which they formed.",
              "Most of them are like the Sun in their abundance of the heavy elements, and some are even richer.",
              "For instance, the Hyades, which compose one of the nearest clusters, have almost twice the abundance of heavy elements as the Sun.",
              "It became possible in the 1990s to discover very young open clusters that previously had been entirely hidden in deep, dusty regions.",
              "Using infrared array detectors, astronomers found that many molecular clouds contained very young groups of stars that had just formed and, in some cases, were still forming.",
              "Even younger than open clusters, stellar associations are very loose groupings of young stars that share a common place and time of origin but that are not generally tied closely enough together gravitationally to form a stable cluster.",
              "Stellar associations are limited strictly to the plane of the Galaxy and appear only in regions of the system where star formation is occurring, notably in the spiral arms. They are very luminous objects.",
              "The brightest are even brighter than the brightest globular clusters, but this is not because they contain more stars;",
              "instead it is the result of the fact that their constituent stars are very much brighter than the stars constituting globular clusters.",
              "The most luminous stars in stellar associations are very young stars of spectral types O and B.",
              "They have absolute luminosities as bright as any star in the Galaxy\u2014on the order of one million times the luminosity of the Sun.",
              "Such stars have very short lifetimes, only lasting a few million years.",
              "With luminous stars of this type there need not be very many to make up a highly luminous and conspicuous grouping.",

              "They are so large and loosely structured that their self-gravitation is insufficient to hold them together, and in a matter of a few million years the members disperse into surrounding space, becoming separate and unconnected stars in the galactic field.",
              "These objects are organizations of stars that share common measurable motions.",
              "Sometimes these do not form a noticeable cluster.",
              "This definition allows the term to be applied to a range of objects from the nearest gravitationally bound clusters to groups of widely spread stars with no apparent gravitational identity, which are discovered only by searching the catalogs for stars of common motion.",
              "Among the best known of the moving groups is the Hyades in the constellation Taurus.",
              "Also known as the Taurus moving cluster or the Taurus stream, this system comprises the relatively dense Hyades cluster along with a few very distant members.",
              "It contains a total of about 350 stars, including several white dwarfs.",
              "Its centre lies about 150 light-years away.",
              "Other notable moving stellar groups include the Ursa Major, Scorpius-Centaurus, and Pleiades groups.",
              "Besides these remote organizations, investigators have observed what appear to be groups of high-velocity stars near the Sun.",
              "One of these, called the Groombridge 1830 group, consists of a number of subdwarfs and the star RR Lyrae, after which the RR Lyrae variables were named.",

              "Jump to Earth is not alone, and a stunning new animation created using NASA data beautifully illustrates that point.",
              "There may be trillions of other planets in our galaxy, the Milky Way (which itself is one of hundreds of billions of other galaxies in the universe).",
              "But finding such extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, is not easy \u2014 even when they're relatively close by.",
              "In fact, it takes more than four years for light to travel from the nearest star to our solar system.",
              "Meanwhile, exoplanets are both small and dim, and the Milky Way is a 100,000-light-year-wide haystack for astronomers to scour.",
              "Despite their long odds, however, astronomers have logged thousands of exoplanets since a team confirmed the existence of the first one in October 1991.",
              "This June, in fact, marked a milestone: Researchers logged the 4,000th discovery in an ever-growing NASA archive of exoplanets.",
              "To celebrate the achievement, two artists pulled all of that data and compiled it into a short animated map and timeline called \"4000 Exoplanets,\" shown below.",
              "The animation was created by the artist Matt Russo and scored by the musician Andrew Santaguida, who both work with a science-art outreach project called System Sound.",

              "For example, purple circles show a planet found by its transit, or passage in front of a parent star;",
              "this is detectable because it causes periodic subtle drops in the parent star's brightness level relative to Earth.",
              "Pink, meanwhile, shows distant worlds that were located because their gravitational pull was strong enough to make their star \"wiggle\" sufficiently for astronomers to detect.",
              "Read more: Jupiter is so big it does not actually orbit the sun The pace of discoveries in the 60-second timeline starts off slowly, with only about 70 extrasolar worlds located in the first decade of discoveries.",
              "That's because finding and confirming the existence of exoplanets was extraordinarily difficult without advanced tools and resources.",
              "But as funding grows, techniques improve, more ground telescopes help with the search, and new space observatories launch into space, the rate at which exoplanets have been found has increased.",
              "The pace of discovery really exploded after 2009, when NASA launched its Kepler Space Telescope.",
              "Kepler focused its search on a small patch of the sky and used the transit method of exoplanet detection on 150,000 stars.",
              "This is why, in the animation, a big purple blob suddenly begins to appear around 2010 (at top left) and the exoplanet count skyrockets.",
              "NASA deactivated Kepler in 2018, but in April 2018, NASA launched a similar planet hunter called the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).",
              "TESS is expected to scan 200,000 nearby stars across 85% of the night sky, revealing thousands of additional planets.",
              "Below is an animation of TESS's planned survey.",
              "Around 50 of the planets TESS detects should be Earth-sized and potentially habitable, creating promising targets for more detailed observations by telescopes that can image objects much deeper in space.",
              "The first pictures of Earthlike worlds may come from enormous ground-based observatories, including the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile, which are poised to come online starting in the mid-2020s.",
              "Astronomers hope such telescopes can take raw exoplanet discoveries a step further by picking up light from their atmospheres \u2014 and potentially \"sniffing\" out biosignatures that may indicate the presence of alien life.",
