    "query": "What is the most significant breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence that has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach problem-solving and decision-making, and what are the ethical implications surrounding its implementation?",
    "response": "That is a very broad and complex question that does not have a definitive answer. However, based on some of the search results I found, I can try to give you a brief overview of some of the possible breakthroughs and ethical implications of artificial intelligence.\n\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs in AI is the development and application of **deep learning**, which is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from large amounts of data and perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech synthesis, and more[^2^] [^5^] [^6^]. Deep learning has enabled many advances in AI, such as **autonomous vehicles**, **computer vision**, **natural language generation**, **facial recognition**, and **generative adversarial networks**[^2^] [^5^] [^6^].\n\nAnother breakthrough in AI is the use of AI for **vaccine development**, especially for covid-19. AI algorithms can help researchers analyze vast amounts of data about the virus and its variants, and predict the most immunogenic subcomponents for designing targeted vaccines. AI can also help optimize the mRNA sequence design for candidate vaccines[^3^].\n\nA third breakthrough in AI is the progress in **quantum computing**, which is a type of computing that uses quantum mechanical phenomena to perform operations on data. Quantum computers can potentially solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, such as optimization, cryptography, simulation, and machine learning. Quantum computing can also enhance AI by speeding up training, inference, and data processing[^3^].\n\nHowever, along with these breakthroughs, AI also poses many ethical challenges and risks for society. Some of the ethical implications of AI include:\n\n- **Privacy and surveillance**: AI systems can collect, store, analyze, and share large amounts of personal data from users, which can infringe on their privacy and expose them to identity theft, fraud, hacking, or manipulation. AI systems can also enable mass surveillance by governments or corporations, which can threaten civil liberties and human rights[^7^] [^8^] [^9^].\n- **Bias and discrimination**: AI systems can reflect or amplify the biases and prejudices of their creators, users, or data sources, which can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes for certain groups or individuals. For example, AI systems can discriminate based on race, gender, age, disability, or other factors in domains such as hiring, lending, education, health care, or criminal justice[^7^] [^8^] [^9^].\n- **Human judgment**: AI systems can influence or replace human decision-making in various contexts, which can raise questions about the accountability, transparency, explainability, and trustworthiness of AI. For example, who is responsible if an AI system makes a mistake or causes harm? How can humans understand or challenge the logic or reasoning behind an AI system's output? How can humans ensure that AI systems align with their values and goals? How can humans maintain their autonomy and dignity in the face of increasing automation and intelligence[^7^] [^8^] [^9^]?\n\nThese are just some of the possible breakthroughs and ethical implications of artificial intelligence. There are many more aspects and perspectives to consider in this rapidly evolving field. I hope this answer gives you some insight into the current state and future direction of AI.",

              "People are using AI more today to dictate to their phone, get recommendations for shopping, news, or entertainment, enhance their backgrounds on conference calls, and so much more.",
              "The core technology behind most of the most visible advances is machine learning, especially deep learning (including generative adversarial networks or GANs) and reinforcement learning powered by large-scale data and computing resources.",
              "GANs are a major breakthrough, endowing deep networks with the ability to produce artificial content such as fake images that pass for the real thing.",
              "GANs consist of two interlocked components\u2014a generator, responsible for creating realistic content, and a discriminator, tasked with distinguishing the output of the generator from naturally occurring content.",
              "The two learn from each other, becoming better and better at their respective tasks over time.",
              "One of the practical applications can be seen in GAN-based medical-image augmentation, in which artificial images are produced automatically to expand the data set used to train networks for producing diagnoses1.",
              "Recognition of the remarkable power of deep learning has been steadily growing over the last decade.",
              "Recent studies have begun to uncover why and under what conditions deep learning works well2.",
              "In the past ten years, machine-learning technologies have moved from the academic realm into the real world in a multitude of ways that are both promising and concerning.",
              "Language processing technology made a major leap in the last five years, leading to the development of network architectures with enhanced capability to learn from complex and context-sensitive data.",
              "These advances have been supported by ever-increasing data resources and computing power.",
              "Of particular note are neural network language models, including ELMo, GPT, mT5, and BERT.",
              "3 These models learn about how words are used in context\u2014including elements of grammar, meaning, and basic facts about the world\u2014from sifting through the patterns in naturally occurring text.",
              "They consist of billions of tunable parameters and are engineered to be able to process unprecedented quantities of data (over one trillion words for GPT-3, for example).",
              "By stringing together likely sequences of words, several of these models can generate passages of text that are often indistinguishable from human-generated text, including news stories, poems, fiction and even computer code.",
              "Performance on question-answering benchmarks (large quizzes with questions like \u201cWhere was Beyonce\u0301 born?",
              "\u201d) have reached superhuman levels,4 although the models that achieve this level of proficiency exploit spurious correlations in the benchmarks and exhibit a level of competence on naturally occurring questions that is still well below that of human beings.",
              "These models\u2019 facility with language is already supporting applications such as machine translation, text classification, speech recognition, writing aids, and chatbots.",
              "Future applications could include improving human-AI interactions across diverse languages and situations.",
              "Current challenges include how to obtain quality data for languages used by smaller populations, and how to detect and remove biases in their behavior.",
              "In addition, it is worth noting that the models themselves do not exhibit deep understanding of the texts that they process, fundamentally limiting their utility in many sensitive applications.",
              "Part of the art of using these models, to date, is in finding scenarios where their incomplete mastery still provides value.",
              "Related to language processing is the tremendous growth in conversational interfaces over the past five years.",
              "The near ubiquity of voice-control systems like Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa is a consequence of both improvements on the voice-recognition side, powered by the AI advances discussed above, and also improvements in how information is organized and integrated for voice-based delivery.",
              "Google Duplex, a conversational interface that can call businesses to make restaurant reservations and appointments, was rolled out in 2018 and received mixed initial reviews due to its impressive engineering but off-putting system design.",
              "5 Image-processing technology is now widespread, finding uses ranging from video-conference backgrounds to the photo-realistic images known as deepfakes.",
              "Many image-processing approaches use deep learning for recognition, classification, conversion, and other tasks.",
              "Training time for image processing has been substantially reduced.",
              "Programs running on ImageNet, a massive standardized collection of over 14 million photographs used to train and test visual identification programs, complete their work 100 times faster than just three years ago.",
              "6 Real-time object-detection systems such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) that notice important objects when they appear in an image are widely used for video surveillance of crowds and are important for mobile robots including self-driving cars.",
              "Face-recognition technology has also improved significantly over the last five years, and now some smartphones and even office buildings rely on it to control access.",
              "In China, facial-recognition technology is used widely in society, from security to payment, although there are very recent moves to pull back on the broad deployment of this technology.",
              "7 Of course, while facial-recognition technology can be a powerful tool to improve efficiency and safety, it raises issues around bias and privacy.",
              "Some companies have suspended providing face-recognition services.",
              "And, in fact, the creator of YOLO has said that he no longer works on the technology because \u201cthe military applications and privacy concerns became impossible to ignore.",
              "\u201d8 It is now possible to generate photorealistic images and even videos using GANs.",
              "Sophisticated image-processing systems enhanced by deep learning let users seamlessly replace existing images with new ones, such as inserting someone into a video of an event they did not attend.",
              "While such modifications could be carried out by skilled artists decades ago, AI automation has substantially lowered the barriers.",
              "These so-called deepfakes are being used in illicit activity such as \u201crevenge porn,\u201d in which an attacker creates artificial sexual content featuring a specific victim, and identity theft, in which a profile of a non-existent person is generated and used to gain access to services, and have spurred research into improving automatic detection of deepfake images.",
              "Developing algorithms for games and simulations in adversarial situations has long been a fertile training ground and a showcase for the advancement of AI techniques.",
              "DeepMind\u2019s application of deep networks to Atari video games and the game of Go around 2015 helped bring deep learning to wide public prominence, and the last five years have seen significant additional progress.",

              "12 The DeepMind team that developed AlphaGo went on to create AlphaGoZero,13 which discarded the use of direct human guidance in the form of a large collection of data from past Go matches.",
              "Instead, it developed moves and tactics on its own, starting from scratch.",
              "This idea was further augmented with AlphaZero,14 a single network architecture that could learn to play expert-level Go, Shogi, or Chess.",
              "The last five years have seen consistent progress in intelligent robotics driven by machine learning, powerful computing and communication capabilities, and increased availability of sophisticated sensor systems. Although these systems are not fully able to take advantage of all the advances in AI, primarily due to the physical constraints of the environments, highly agile and dynamic robotics systems are now available for home and industrial use.",
              "In industrial robotics, with the implementation of deep-learning-based vision systems, manipulator-type robots\u2014those that grab things, as opposed to those that roll across the floor\u2014can pick up randomly placed overlapping objects at speeds that are practical for real-world applications.",
              "Bipedal and four-legged robots continue to advance in agility.",
              "Atlas, a state-of-the-art humanoid robot built by Boston Dynamics, demonstrated the ability to jump, run, backflip, and maneuver uneven terrain\u2014feats that were impossible for robots just a few years ago.",
              "Spot, a quadruped robot also from Boston Dynamics,15 also maneuvers through difficult environments and is being used on construction sites for delivery and monitoring of lightweight materials and tools.",
              "It is worth noting, however, that these systems are built using a combination of learning techniques honed in the last several years, classical control theory akin to that used in autopilots, and painstaking engineering and design.",
              "Cassie, a biped robot developed by Agility Robotics and Oregon State University, uses deep reinforcement learning for its walking and running behaviors.",
              "16 Whereas deployment of AI in user-facing vision and language technologies is now commonplace, the majority of types of robotics systems remain lab-bound.",
              "During 2020, robotics development was driven in part by the need to support social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
              "A group of restaurants opened in China staffed by a team of 20 robots to help cook and serve food.",
              "Some early delivery robots were deployed on controlled campuses18 to carry books and food.",
              "A diverse collection of companies worldwide are actively pursuing business opportunities in autonomous delivery systems for the last mile.",
              "While these types of robots are being increasingly used in the real world, they are by no means mainstream yet and are still prone to mistakes, especially when deployed in unmapped or novel environments.",
              "In Japan, a new legal framework is being discussed to ensure that autonomous robotics systems are able to be safely deployed on public roads at limited speeds.",
              "19 The combination of deep learning with agile robotics is opening up new opportunities in industrial robotics as well.",
              "Leveraging improvements in vision, robotic grippers are beginning to be able to select and pick randomly placed objects and use them to construct stacks.",
              "Being able to pick up and put down diverse objects is a key competence in a variety of potential applications, from tidying up homes to preparing packages for shipping.",
              "Autonomous vehicles or self-driving cars have been one of the hottest areas in deployed robotics, as they impact the entire automobile industry as well as city planning.",
              "The design of self-driving cars requires integration of a range of technologies including sensor fusion, AI planning and decision-making, vehicle dynamics prediction, on-the-fly rerouting, inter-vehicle communication, and more.",
              "Driver assist systems are increasingly widespread in production vehicles.",
              "20 These systems use sensors and AI-based analysis to carry out tasks such as adaptive cruise control to safely adjust speed, and lane-keeping assistance to keep vehicles centered on the road.",
              "The optimistic predictions from five years ago of rapid progress in fully autonomous driving have failed to materialize.",
              "The reasons may be complicated,21 but the need for exceptional levels of safety in complex physical environments makes the problem more challenging, and more expensive, to solve than had been anticipated.",
              "Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are now operating in certain locales such as Phoenix, Arizona, where driving and weather conditions are particularly benign, and outside Beijing, where 5G connectivity allows remote drivers to take over if needed.",
              "22 AI is increasingly being used in biomedical applications, particularly in diagnosis, drug discovery, and basic life science research.",
              "Recent years have seen AI-based imaging technologies move from an academic pursuit to commercial projects.",
              "23 Tools now exist for identifying a variety of eye and skin disorders,24 detecting cancers,25 and supporting measurements needed for clinical diagnosis.",
              "26 Some of these systems rival the diagnostic abilities of expert pathologists and radiologists, and can help alleviate tedious tasks (for example, counting the number of cells dividing in cancer tissue).",
              "In other domains, however, the use of automated systems raises significant ethical concerns.",
              "27 AI-based risk scoring in healthcare is also becoming more common.",
              "Predictors of health deterioration are now integrated into major health record platforms (for example, EPIC Deterioration Index), and individual health centers are increasingly integrating AI-based risk predictions into their operations.",
              "28 Although some amount of bias is evident in these systems,29 they appear exceptionally promising for overall improvements in healthcare.",
              "Beyond treatment support, AI now augments a number of other health operations and measurements, such as helping predict durations of surgeries to optimize scheduling, and identifying patients at risk of needing transfer to intensive care.",
              "30 There are technologies for digital medical transcription,31 for reading ECG systems, for producing super-resolution images to reduce the amount of time patients are in MRI machines, and for identifying questions for clinicians to ask pediatric patients.",
              "32 While current penetration is relatively low, we can expect to see uses of AI expand in this domain in the future;",
              "in many cases, these are applications of already-mature technologies in other areas of operations making their way into healthcare.",
              "AI has been increasingly adopted into finance.",
              "Deep learning models now partially automate lending decisions for several lenders33 and have transformed payments with credit scoring, for example WeChat Pay.",
              "34 These new systems often take advantage of consumer data that are not traditionally used in credit scoring.",
              "In some cases, this approach can open up credit to new groups of people;",
              "in others, it can be used to force people to adopt specific social behaviors.",
              "35 High-frequency trading relies on a combination of models as well as the ability to make fast decisions.",
              "In the space of personal finance, so-called robo-advising\u2014automated financial advice\u2014is quickly becoming mainstream for investment and overall financial planning.",
              "36 For financial institutions, uses of AI are going beyond detecting fraud and enhancing cybersecurity to automating legal and compliance documentation as well as detecting money laundering.",
              "37 Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) of Japan, the world\u2019s largest pension fund, introduced a deep-learning-based system to monitor investment styles of contracting fund managers and identify risk from unexpected change in market situations known as regime switch.",
              "38 Such applications enable financial institutions to recognize otherwise invisible risks, contributing to more robust and stable asset-management practices.",
              "With the explosion of information available to us, recommender systems that automatically prioritize what we see when we are online have become absolutely essential.",
              "Such systems have always drawn heavily on AI, and now they have a dramatic influence on people\u2019s consumption of products, services, and content\u2014from news, to music, to videos, and more.",
              "Apart from a general trend toward more online activity and commerce, the AI technologies powering recommender systems have changed considerably in the past five years.",
              "One shift is the near-universal incorporation of deep neural networks to better predict user responses to recommendations.",
              "39 There has also been increased usage of sophisticated machine-learning techniques for analyzing the content of recommended items, rather than using only meta-data and user click or consumption behavior.",
              "That is, AI systems are making more of an effort to understand why a specific item might be a good recommendation for a particular person or query.",
              "Examples include Spotify\u2019s use of audio analysis of music40 or the application of large language models such as BERT to improve recommendations of news or social media posts.",
              "41 Another trend is modeling and prediction of multiple distinct user behaviors, instead of making recommendations for only one activity at a time;",
              "functionality facilitated by the use of so-called multi-task models.",
              "42 Of course, applying recommendation to multiple tasks simultaneously raises the challenging question of how best to make tradeoffs among these different objectives.",
              "The use of ever-more-sophisticated machine-learned models for recommending products, services, and (especially) content has raised significant concerns about the issues of fairness, diversity, polarization, and the emergence of filter bubbles, where the recommender system suggests, for example, news stories that other people like you are reading instead of what is truly most important.",
              "While these problems require more than just technical solutions, increasing attention is paid to technologies that can at least partly address such issues.",
              "Promising directions include research on the tradeoffs between popularity and diversity of content consumption,43 and fairness of recommendations among different users and other stakeholders (such as the content providers or creators).",

              "Using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks.",
              "The bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models.",
              "These constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be competitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems. We then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous quantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime.",
              "For near-term implementations, we demonstrate a significant prediction advantage over some classical models on engineered data sets designed to demonstrate a maximal quantum advantage in one of the largest numerical tests for gate-based quantum machine learning to date, up to 30 qubits.",

              "At the same time, machine learning on classical computers has made great strides, revolutionizing applications in image recognition, text translation, and even physics applications, with more computational power leading to ever increasing performance1.",
              "As such, if quantum computers could accelerate machine learning, the potential for impact is enormous.",
              "At least two paths towards quantum enhancement of machine learning have been considered.",
              "First, motivated by quantum applications in optimization2,3,4, the power of quantum computing could, in principle, be used to help improve the training process of existing classical models5,6, or enhance inference in graphical models7.",
              "This could include finding better optima in a training landscape or finding optima with fewer queries.",
              "However, without more structure known in the problem, the advantage along these lines may be limited to quadratic or small polynomial speedups8,9.",
              "The second vein of interest is the possibility of using quantum models to generate correlations between variables that are inefficient to represent through classical computation.",
              "The recent success both theoretically and experimentally for demonstrating quantum computations beyond classical tractability can be taken as evidence that quantum computers can sample from probability distributions that are exponentially difficult to sample from classically10,11.",
              "If these distributions were to coincide with real-world distributions, this would suggest the potential for significant advantage.",
              "This is typically the type of advantage that has been sought in recent work on both quantum neural networks12,13,14, which seek to parameterize a distribution through some set of adjustable parameters, and quantum kernel methods15 that use quantum computers to define a feature map that maps classical data into the quantum Hilbert space.",
              "The justification for the capability of these methods to exceed classical models often follows similar lines as refs.",
              "10,11 or quantum simulation results.",
              "That is, if the model leverages a quantum circuit that is hard to sample results from classically, then there is potential for a quantum advantage.",
              "In this work, we show quantitatively how this picture is incomplete in machine learning (ML) problems where some training data are provided.",
              "The provided data can elevate classical models to rival quantum models, even when the quantum circuits generating the data are hard to compute classically.",
              "We begin with a motivating example and complexity-theoretic argument showing how classical algorithms with data can match quantum output.",
              "Following this, we provide rigorous prediction error bounds for training classical and quantum ML methods based on kernel functions15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 to learn quantum mechanical models.",
              "We focus on kernel methods, as they not only provide provable guarantees, but are also very flexible in the functions they can learn.",
              "For example, recent advancements in theoretical machine learning show that training neural networks with large hidden layers is equivalent to training an ML model with a particular kernel, known as the neural tangent kernel19,20,21.",
              "Throughout, when we refer to classical ML models related to our theoretical developments, we will be referring to ML models that can be easily associated with a kernel, either explicitly as in kernel methods, or implicitly as in the neural tangent kernels.",
              "However, in the numerical section, we will also include performance comparisons to methods where direct association of a kernel is challenging, such as random forest methods.",
              "In the quantum case, we will also show how quantum ML based on kernels can be made equivalent to training an infinite depth quantum neural network.",

              "The most important test is a geometric difference between kernel functions defined by classical and quantum ML.",
              "Formally, the geometric difference is defined by the closest efficient classical ML model.",
              "In practice, one should consider the geometric difference with respect to a suite of optimized classical ML models.",
              "If the geometric difference is small, then a classical ML method is guaranteed to provide similar or better performance in prediction on the dataset, independent of the function values or labels.",
              "Hence this represents a powerful, function independent prescreening that allows one to evaluate if there is any possibility of better performance.",
              "On the other hand, if the geometry differs greatly, we show both the existence of a dataset that exhibits large prediction advantage using the quantum ML model and how one can construct it efficiently.",
              "While the tools we develop could be used to compare and construct hard classical models like hash functions, we enforce restrictions that allow us to say something about a quantum separation.",
              "In particular, the feature map will be white box, in that a quantum circuit specification is available for the ideal feature map, and that feature map can be made computationally hard to evaluate classically.",
              "A constructive example of this is a discrete log feature map, where a provable separation for our kernel is given in Supplementary Section 11.",
              "Additionally, the minimum over classical models means that classical hash functions are reproduced formally by definition.",
              "Moreover, application of these tools to existing models in the literature rules many of them out immediately, providing a powerful sieve for focusing development of new data encodings.",
              "Following these constructions, in numerical experiments, we find that a variety of common quantum models in the literature perform similarly or worse than classical ML on both classical and quantum datasets due to a small geometric difference.",
              "The small geometric difference is a consequence of the exponentially large Hilbert space employed by existing quantum models, where all inputs are too far apart.",
              "To circumvent the setback, we propose an improvement, which enlarges the geometric difference by projecting quantum states embedded from classical data back to approximate classical representation25,26,27.",
              "With the large geometric difference endowed by the projected quantum model, we are able to construct engineered datasets to demonstrate large prediction advantage over common classical ML models in numerical experiments up to 30 qubits.",
              "Despite our constructions being based on methods with associated kernels, we find empirically that the prediction advantage remains robust across tested classical methods, including those without an easily determined kernel.",
              "This opens the possibility to use a small quantum computer to generate efficiently verifiable machine learning problems that could be challenging for classical ML models.",
              "We begin by setting up the problems and methods of interest for classical and quantum models, and then provide a simple motivating example for studying how data can increase the power of classical models on quantum data.",
              "The focus will be a supervised learning task with a collection of N training examples {(xi, yi)}, where xi is the input data and yi is an associated label or value.",
              "We assume that xi are sampled independently from a data distribution \\({\\mathcal{D}}\\).",
              "In our theoretical analysis, we will consider \\({y}_{i}\\in {\\mathbb{R}}\\) to be generated by some quantum model.",
              "In particular, we consider a continuous encoding unitary that maps a classical input data xi into quantum state \\(\\left|{x}_{i}\\right\\rangle ={U}_{\\text{enc}}({x}_{i}){\\left|0\\right\\rangle }^{\\otimes n}\\) and refer to the corresponding density matrix as \u03c1(xi).",
              "The expressive power of these embeddings have been investigated from a functional analysis point of view28,29;",
              "however, the setting where data are provided requires special attention.",
              "The encoding unitary is followed by a unitary UQNN(\u03b8).",
              "We then measure an observable O after the quantum neural network.",
              "This produces the label/value for input xi given as \\({y}_{i}=f({x}_{i})=\\left\\langle {x}_{i}\\right|{U}_{\\,\\text{QNN}}^{\\dagger }O{U}_{\\text{QNN}}\\left|{x}_{i}\\right\\rangle \\).",
              "The quantum model considered here is also referred to as a quantum neural network (QNN) in the literature14,30.",
              "The goal is to understand when it is easy to predict the function f(x) by training classical/quantum machine learning models.",
              "With notation in place, we turn to a simple motivating example to understand how the availability of data in machine learning tasks can change computational hardness.",
              "Consider data points \\({\\{{{\\bf{x}}}_{i}\\}}_{i = 1}^{N}\\) that are p-dimensional classical vectors with \u2223\u2223xi\u2223\u22232 = 1, and use amplitude encoding31,32,33 to encode the data into an n-qubit state \\(\\left|{{\\bf{x}}}_{i}\\right\\rangle =\\mathop{\\sum }\\nolimits_{k = 1}^{p}{x}_{i}^{k}\\left|k\\right\\rangle \\), where \\({x}_{i}^{k}\\) is the individual coordinate of the vector xi.",
              "If UQNN is a time-evolution under a many-body Hamiltonian, then the function \\(f({\\bf{x}})=\\left\\langle {\\bf{x}}\\right|{U}_{\\,\\text{QNN}}^{\\dagger }O{U}_{\\text{QNN}}\\left|{\\bf{x}}\\right\\rangle \\) is in general hard to compute classically34, even for a single input state.",
              "In particular, we have the following proposition showing that if a classical algorithm can compute f(x) efficiently, then quantum computers will be no more powerful than classical computers;",
              "see Supplementary Section 1 for a proof.",
              "If a classical algorithm without training data can compute f(x) efficiently for any UQNN and O, then BPP = BQP.",
              "Nevertheless, it is incorrect to conclude that training a classical model from data to learn this evolution is hard.",
              "To see this, we write out the expectation value as which is a quadratic function with p2 coefficients \\({B}_{kl}=\\left\\langle k\\right|{U}_{\\,\\text{QNN}}^{\\dagger }O{U}_{\\text{QNN}}\\left|l\\right\\rangle \\).",
              "Using the theory developed later in this work, we can show that, for any UQNN and O, training a specific classical ML model on a collection of N training examples {(xi, yi = f(xi))} would give rise to a prediction model h(xi) with for a constant c > 0.",
              "We refer to Supplementary Section 1 for the proof of this result.",
              "Hence, with N \u221d p2/\u03b52 training data, one can train a classical ML model to predict the function f(x) up to an additive prediction error \u03b5.",
              "This elevation of classical models through some training samples is illustrative of the power of data.",

              "Classical algorithms that can learn from data define a complexity class that can solve problems beyond classical computation (BPP), but it is still expected that quantum computation can efficiently solve problems that classical ML algorithms with data cannot.",

              "One can first evaluate a geometric quantity gCQ that measures the possibility of an advantageous quantum/classical prediction separation without yet considering the actual function to learn.",
              "We show how one can efficiently construct an adversarial function that saturates this limit if the test is passed, otherwise the classical approach is guaranteed to match performance for any function of the data.",
              "To subsequently consider the actual function provided, a label/function-specific test may be run using the model complexities sC and sQ.",
              "If one specifically uses the quantum kernel (QK) method, the red dashed arrows can evaluate if all possible choices of UQNN lead to an easy classical function for the chosen encoding of the data.",
              "While this simple example makes the basic point that sufficient data can change complexity considerations, it perhaps opens more questions than it answers.",
              "For example, it uses a rather weak encoding into amplitudes and assumes one has access to an amount of data that is on par with the dimension of the model.",
              "The more interesting cases occur if we strengthen the data encoding, include modern classical ML models, and consider the number of data N much less than the dimension of the model.",
              "These more interesting cases are the ones we quantitatively answer.",
              "Our primary interest will be ML algorithms that are much stronger than fitting a quadratic function and the input data are provided in more interesting ways than an amplitude encoding.",
              "In this work, we focus on both classical and quantum ML models based on kernel functions k(xi, xj).",
              "At a high level, a kernel function can be seen as a measure of similarity, if k(xi, xj) is large when xi and xj are close.",
              "When considered for finite input data, a kernel function may be represented as a matrix Kij = k(xi, xj) and the conditions required for kernel methods are satisfied when the matrix representation is Hermitian and positive semi-definite.",
              "A given kernel function corresponds to a nonlinear feature mapping \u03c6(x) that maps x to a possibly infinite-dimensional feature space, such that \\(k({x}_{i},{x}_{j})=\\phi {({x}_{i})}^{\\dagger }\\phi ({x}_{j})\\).",
              "This is the basis of the so-called \u201ckernel trick\u201d where intricate and powerful maps \u03c6(xi) can be implemented through the evaluation of relatively simple kernel functions k.",

              "Note that we also constructed engineered datasets saturating the geometric inequality between classical ML and the original quantum kernel, but the small geometric difference g presented no empirical advantage at large system size (see Supplementary Section 13).",
              "In keeping with our arguments about the role of data, when we increase the number of training data N, all methods improve, and the advantage will gradually diminish.",
              "While this dataset is engineered, it shows the strongest empirical separation on the largest system size to date.",
              "We conjecture that this procedure could be used with a quantum computer to create challenging datasets that are easy to learn with a quantum device, hard to learn classically, while still being easy to verify classically given the correct labels.",
              "Moreover, the size of the margin implies that this separation may even persist under moderate amounts of noise in a quantum device.",
              "The use of quantum computing in machine learning remains an exciting prospect, but quantifying quantum advantage for such applications has some subtle issues that one must approach carefully.",
              "Here, we constructed a foundation for understanding opportunities for quantum advantage in a learning setting.",
              "We showed quantitatively how classical ML algorithms with data can become computationally more powerful, and a prediction advantage for quantum models is not guaranteed even if the data come from a quantum process that is challenging to independently simulate.",
              "Motivated by these tests, we introduced projected quantum kernels.",
              "On engineered datasets, projected quantum kernels outperform all tested classical models in prediction error.",
              "To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of such a large separation between quantum and classical ML models.",
              "This work suggests a simple guidebook for generating ML problems which give a large separation between quantum and classical models, even at a modest number of qubits.",
              "The size of this separation and trend up to 30 qubits suggests the existence of learning tasks that may be easy to verify, but hard to model classically, requiring just a modest number of qubits and allowing for device noise.",
              "Claims of true advantage in a quantum machine learning setting require not only benchmarking classical machine learning models, but also classical approximations of quantum models.",
              "Additional work will be needed to identify embeddings that satisfy the sometimes conflicting requirements of being hard to approximate classically and exhibiting meaningful signal on local observables for very large numbers of qubits.",
              "Further research will be required to find use cases on datasets closer to practical interest and evaluate potential claims of advantage, but we believe the tools developed in this work will help to pave the way for this exciting frontier.",
