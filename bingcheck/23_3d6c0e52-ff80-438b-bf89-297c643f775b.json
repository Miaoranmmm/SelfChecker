    "query": "Can you tell me the story behind the discovery of the structure of DNA and the role Rosalind Franklin played in it?",
    "response": "The story behind the discovery of the structure of DNA is a fascinating one. It involves many scientists working in different fields and using different techniques to unravel the mystery of the genetic material.\n\nThe discovery of the structure of DNA was announced in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick, who used X-ray diffraction images of crystallized DNA created by Rosalind Franklin[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^5^]. DNA is a double helix of two strands of nucleotide pairs that store the genetic code for all living things[^1^] [^2^]. The discovery of DNA structure changed the world of science and medicine, leading to a greater understanding of genetics and diseases[^1^] [^3^].\n\nRosalind Franklin played a crucial role in this discovery, although she did not receive the recognition she deserved at the time. She was an expert in X-ray crystallography, a technique that uses X-rays to produce images of the molecular structure of crystals. She worked at King's College London with Maurice Wilkins, who was also interested in DNA structure. Franklin produced several high-quality images of DNA, including the famous Photo 51, which showed a clear X-shaped pattern indicating a helical structure[^2^] [^3^].\n\nWatson and Crick were working at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, trying to build a model of DNA based on existing data. They had access to some of Franklin's images through Wilkins, who shared them without her permission. They also used Chargaff's rules, which stated that the amount of adenine (A) always equals the amount of thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) always equals the amount of cytosine (C) in DNA[^2^]. They realized that A pairs with T and G pairs with C, forming complementary base pairs that hold the two strands together by hydrogen bonds. They also figured out that the two strands run in opposite directions, forming an antiparallel arrangement[^2^] [^3^].\n\nWatson and Crick published their model of DNA structure in a one-page paper in Nature on April 25, 1953. They acknowledged Franklin and Wilkins for their contribution, but did not mention how they obtained Franklin's images or how crucial they were for their model[^2^] [^3^]. Franklin published her own paper on DNA structure in the same issue of Nature, but it was overshadowed by Watson and Crick's paper. She died in 1958 from ovarian cancer at the age of 37, before she could receive any recognition for her work[^2^] [^3^].\n\nIn 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of the structure of DNA. Franklin was not eligible for the prize, as it is not awarded posthumously. However, her contribution to the discovery has been widely acknowledged and celebrated by later generations of scientists and historians[^2^] [^3^].",

              "The discovery in 1953 of the double helix, the twisted-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), by James Watson and Francis Crick marked a milestone in the history of science and gave rise to modern molecular biology, which is largely concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells.",
              "In short order, their discovery yielded ground-breaking insights into the genetic code and protein synthesis.",
              "During the 1970s and 1980s, it helped to produce new and powerful scientific techniques, specifically recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies, techniques on which today's multi-billion dollar biotechnology industry is founded.",
              "Major current advances in science, namely genetic fingerprinting and modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and the promise, yet unfulfilled, of gene therapy, all have their origins in Watson and Crick's inspired work.",
              "The double helix has not only reshaped biology, it has become a cultural icon, represented in sculpture, visual art, jewelry, and toys.",
              "Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information, but they did not know what a gene actually looked like structurally and chemically, or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation.",
              "In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria.",
              "Nevertheless, many scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins, much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform a multitude of biological functions in the cell.",
              "Crick and Watson recognized, at an early stage in their careers, that gaining a detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional configuration of the gene was the central problem in molecular biology.",
              "Without such knowledge, heredity and reproduction could not be understood.",
              "They seized on this problem during their very first encounter, in the summer of 1951, and pursued it with single-minded focus over the course of the next eighteen months.",
              "This meant taking on the arduous intellectual task of immersing themselves in all the fields of science involved: genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography.",
              "Drawing on the experimental results of others (they conducted no DNA experiments of their own), taking advantage of their complementary scientific backgrounds in physics and X-ray crystallography (Crick) and viral and bacterial genetics (Watson), and relying on their brilliant intuition, persistence, and luck, the two showed that DNA had a structure sufficiently complex and yet elegantly simple enough to be the master molecule of life.",
              "Other researchers had made important but seemingly unconnected findings about the composition of DNA;",
              "it fell to Watson and Crick to unify these disparate findings into a coherent theory of genetic transfer.",
              "The organic chemist Alexander Todd had determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups.",
              "The biochemist Erwin Chargaff had found that while the amount of DNA and of its four types of bases--the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine(T)--varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C.",
              "Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape.",
              "Linus Pauling, then the world's leading physical chemist, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms. Moreover, he had pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to uncover the structure of DNA.",
              "Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his own model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.",
              "The time, then, was ripe for their discovery.",
              "After several failed attempts at model building, including their own ill-fated three-stranded version and one in which the bases were paired like with like (adenine with adenine, etc.)",
              ", they achieved their break-through.",
              "Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect.",
              "On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models by moving a hydrogen atom from a position where it bonded with oxygen to a neighboring position where it bonded with nitrogen.",
              "While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds.",
              "If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder.",
              "The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis, all of which were structural features demanded by the X-ray evidence.",
              "Similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the fact, also established by the X-ray diffraction pattern, that the backbones ran in opposite direction to each other, one up, the other down.",
              "Watson and Crick published their findings in a one-page paper, with the understated title \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\" in the British scientific weekly Nature on April 25, 1953, illustrated with a schematic drawing of the double helix by Crick's wife, Odile.",
              "A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors.",
              "Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G.",
              "The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain.",
              "Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in a second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.",
              "The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions.",
              "During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis, revolutionary then but widely-accepted since, that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted.",
              "Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first.",
              "Its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened, only towards the end of the 1950s, when the structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Arthur Kornberg, and others.",
              "Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery.",
              "As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\"",
              "Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement, but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\"",
              "He revealed that \"years later she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\"",
              "As he recounted her words, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally I thought nothing of it.\"",
              "Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy.",
              "Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into his privacy, and a distortion of his motives.",
              "He waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication.",
              "He eventually became reconciled to Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.",
              "A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, which was shown to them, without her knowledge, by her estranged colleague, Maurice Wilkins, and by Max Perutz.",
              "Her evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel.",
              "Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery.",
              "Yet, they gave her scant acknowledgment.",
              "Even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them.",
              "She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two.",
              "She soon left DNA research to study tobacco mosaic virus.",
              "She became friends with both Watson and Crick, and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house (Franklin died in 1958).",
              "Crick believed that he and Watson used her evidence appropriately, while admitting that their patronizing attitude towards her, so apparent in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.",

              "With the Signer DNA, Franklin was able to exploit a discovery that Wilkins had made earlier \u2014 DNA in solution could take two forms, what she called the crystalline or A form, and the paracrystalline or B form.",

              "Initially, Franklin understood both A and B as helical.",
              "In notes for a seminar she gave in November 1951, she described them collectively: \u201cbig helix with several chains, phosphates on outside, phosphate\u2013phosphate interhelical bonds, disrupted by water\u201d5.",

              "This explains why, in late 1952 and early 1953, she rejected the argument that DNA was intrinsically helical.",
              "From a chemist\u2019s perspective, Franklin\u2019s decision to focus on the crystalline A form was perfectly logical, as were the conclusions she drew from analysing it.",
              "But her focus on the drier A form ignored the very wet reality of the inside of a cell \u2014 which would mean that DNA took the more humid B form.",
              "Together with her insistence that the diffraction data be fully analysed before any modelling was attempted, it would hamper Franklin\u2019s efforts for more than a year.",
              "Even Franklin\u2019s advocates often unwittingly perpetuate a caricatured view of her science \u2014 one that can be traced back to Watson\u2019s reality-distorting 1968 bestseller, The Double Helix8.",

              "Wilkins, he wrote, rescued him from the confrontation and then showed him Photograph 51, a particularly clear image of the B form, taken 8 months earlier by Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling.",
              "Franklin had put the photograph aside to concentrate on the A form.",
              "She was preparing to transfer to Birkbeck College, also in London, and had been instructed to leave her DNA work behind.",
              "Gosling was now being supervised by Wilkins, and he had given Wilkins the photograph.",

              "The image, Watson claimed in The Double Helix, showed that a DNA helix \u201cmust exist\u201d \u2014 only a helical structure could produce those marks8.",
              "Because of Watson\u2019s narrative, people have made a fetish of Photograph 51.",
              "It has become the emblem of both Franklin\u2019s achievement and her mistreatment.",
              "Franklin and Gosling\u2019s X-ray diffraction image of B DNA, known as Photograph 51.",
              "Credit: King's College London Archives/Science Photo Library But Watson\u2019s narrative contains an absurd presumption.",
              "It implies that Franklin, the skilled chemist, could not understand her own data, whereas he, a crystallographic novice, apprehended it immediately.",
              "Moreover, everyone, even Watson, knew it was impossible to deduce any precise structure from a single photograph \u2014 other structures could have produced the same diffraction pattern.",
              "Without careful measurements \u2014 which Watson has insisted he did not make \u2014 all the image revealed was that the B form was probably some kind of helix, which no one doubted.",
              "Furthermore, various lines of evidence \u2014 including The Double Helix itself, read carefully \u2014 show that it played little, if any, part in Watson and Crick\u2019s inching towards the correct structure between January and March 1953.",
              "In fact, it was other data from Franklin and Wilkins that proved crucial, and even then, what really happened was less malicious than is widely assumed.",
              "Watson did get a jolt from seeing the photograph \u2014 because of when he saw it.",
              "Just days before, the Cambridge group had received a manuscript from the US chemist Linus Pauling, in which he\u2019d claimed to have solved the DNA structure.",
              "Although Pauling had made some elementary errors, Lawrence Bragg, head of the Cavendish Laboratory, who had a long-standing rivalry with Pauling, had encouraged Watson and Crick to resume their model building.",
              "Watson had dropped in at King\u2019s to show off Pauling\u2019s blunder, and Wilkins had shown him the photograph.",
              "Fashioning that moment into the climax of The Double Helix was a literary device: a classic eureka moment, easy for lay readers to understand.",
              "From 1951, Wilkins had kept Watson and Crick abreast of his work on the B form, in particular his belief that the structure contained one or more helices, repeated every 34 angstroms, and he might have said that within each repeat there were probably 10 elements.",
              "Shortly after Watson saw Photograph 51, Crick\u2019s supervisor, Max Perutz, handed them an informal report of the activity of the King\u2019s MRC unit, which he had been given as part of an official visit to the unit in December 1952.",
              "This included a page from Franklin, describing her work.",
              "In a 1969 letter to Science, although Perutz said that he regretted sharing the report without first consulting the King\u2019s group, it was not confidential10.",
              "Indeed, a letter we have discovered from a King\u2019s researcher, Pauline Cowan, written to Crick in January 1953, invites Crick to a talk by Franklin and Gosling, who, Cowan continues, \u201csay that it is mostly for a non-crystallographic audience + that Perutz already knows more about it than they are likely to get across so you may not think it worthwhile coming\u201d.",
              "Thus, Franklin seems to have assumed that Perutz would share his knowledge with Crick as part of the usual informal scientific exchange11.",
              "In her contribution to the MRC report, Franklin had confirmed the 34 A\u030a result for the B form.",
              "She also reported that the unit cell (the repeating unit of the crystal) of DNA was huge;",
              "it contained a larger number of atoms than any other unit cell in any other known molecular structure.",
              "Franklin also added some key crystallographic data for the A form, indicating that it had a \u2018C2\u2019 symmetry, which in turn implied that the molecule had an even number of sugar-phosphate strands running in opposite directions.",
              "Notes by Crick for a lecture on the history of the double helix, given to historians of science at the University of Oxford in May 1961, together with formal and informal remarks made throughout his life, reveal that, unlike Photograph 51, this report was truly significant for confirming the structure that Watson and Crick eventually obtained.",
              "In the end, however, neither Photograph 51 nor the MRC report \u2018gave\u2019 Watson and Crick the double helix.",
              "What did was six weeks of what they later described as \u201ctrial and error\u201d \u2014 making chemical calculations and fiddling about with cardboard models.",
              "(Watson made this plain in The Double Helix;",
              "Crick did so in a series of interviews with the historian Robert Olby in the late 1960s and early 1970s.)",
              "Franklin\u2019s data and Watson and Crick\u2019s many conversations with Wilkins had provided what seem like key pieces of information \u2014 the phosphate groups were on the outside of the molecule;",
              "there was a repeat every 34 A\u030a;",
              "perhaps there were ten bases per repeat and an even number of strands running in opposite directions (the implication of the C2 symmetry).",
              "Yet, according to their own accounts, the pair ignored every one of these facts at one point or another during those six weeks.",
              "Once they had hit on a conceptual model of the structure, the MRC report provided a valuable check on their assumptions.",
              "So it was not a case of them stealing the King\u2019s group\u2019s data and then, voila, those data gave them the structure of DNA.",
              "Instead, they solved the structure through their own iterative approach and then used the King\u2019s data \u2014 without permission \u2014 to confirm it.",
              "Franklin contributed several key insights to the discovery of the double helix.",
              "She clearly differentiated the A and B forms, solving a problem that had confused previous researchers.",
              "(X-ray diffraction experiments in the 1930s had inadvertently used a mixture of the A and B forms of DNA, yielding muddy patterns that were impossible to fully resolve.)",
              "Her measurements told her that the DNA unit cell was enormous;",
              "she also determined the C2 symmetry exhibited by that unit cell12.",
              "The C2 symmetry was one of 230 types of crystallographic 3D \u2018space groups\u2019 that had been established by the end of the nineteenth century.",
              "Franklin failed to appreciate its significance not because she was obtuse, but because she was unfamiliar with it.",
              "According to her colleague Aaron Klug, Franklin later said that she \u201ccould have kicked herself\u201d for not realizing the structural implications13.",
              "Crick did realize the implications because he happened to have studied C2 symmetry intensely.",
              "But even he did not use Franklin\u2019s determination of this symmetry when building the model;",
              "rather, it provided a powerful corroboration when their model was complete.",
              "James Watson (left) and Francis Crick modelled the structure of the DNA double helix.",
              "Credit: A.",
              "Barrington Brown, Gonville & Caius College/Science Photo Library Franklin also grasped, independently, one of the fundamental insights of the structure: how, in principle, DNA could specify proteins.",
              "In February 1953, she was working hard to finish her analyses of DNA before leaving King\u2019s.",
              "The A form had continued to resist her attempts to interpret it, so she had turned to the much simpler, clearly helical B form.",
              "Her notes reveal that by late February, she had accepted that the A form was also probably helical, with two strands, and she had realized that the order of the bases on a given strand had no effect on the overall structure.",
              "This meant that any sequence of bases was possible.",
              "As she noted, \u201can infinite variety of nucleotide sequences would be possible to explain the biological specificity of DNA\u201d14.",
              "This idea, which Watson and Crick grasped at around the same time, had first been proposed in 1947 by chemist John Masson Gulland at University College Nottingham, UK (now the University of Nottingham)15.",
              "Franklin did not apprehend complementary base-pairing \u2014 that A could bond only with T and C only with G, with each pair of bases forming an identical structure in the molecule.",
              "In fact, she was not working with the correct forms of the bases, so she could not have made a satisfactory model had she tried (the same was true of Watson and Crick until the very last phase of their work).",
              "Neither did she realize that her data implied that the two strands were oriented in different directions \u2014 or that the B form, found at high levels of humidity, must be the biologically functional form.",
              "(The A form is found only under laboratory conditions.)",
              "She did not have time to make these final leaps, because Watson and Crick beat her to the answer.",
              "Franklin did not succeed, partly because she was working on her own without a peer with whom to swap ideas.",
              "She was also excluded from the world of informal exchanges in which Watson and Crick were immersed.",
              "Even though some at the time \u2014 notably the researchers at King\u2019s and a small flock of what Watson called \u201cminor Cambridge biochemists\u201d16 \u2014 were not happy about Watson and Crick\u2019s use of the King\u2019s group\u2019s data, the lead scientists at the Cavendish \u2014 Perutz, Bragg, John Kendrew \u2014 thought it was quite normal.",
              "And there is no evidence that Franklin thought otherwise.",
              "After Watson and Crick had read the MRC report, they could not unsee it.",
              "But they could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 requested permission to use the data and made clear exactly what they had done, first to Franklin and Wilkins, and then to the rest of the world, in their publications.",
              "In April 1953, Nature published three back-to-back papers on DNA structure, from Watson and Crick, from Wilkins and his co-workers, and from Franklin and Gosling1\u20133.",
              "Watson and Crick declared that they had been \u201cstimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas\u201d of Wilkins and Franklin.",
              "They insisted, though, that they were \u201cnot aware of the details\u201d, claiming that the structure \u201crests mainly though not entirely on published experimental data and stereochemical arguments\u201d1.",
              "The truth of those statements depends on highly charitable interpretations of \u201cdetails\u201d and \u201cmainly though not entirely\u201d.",
              "Rosalind Franklin was so much more than the \u2018wronged heroine\u2019 of DNA Rosalind Franklin was so much more than the \u2018wronged heroine\u2019 of DNA In a full description of the structure in a paper submitted in August 1953 and published in 1954, Crick and Watson did attempt to set the record straight17.",
              "They acknowledged that, without Franklin\u2019s data, \u201cthe formulation of our structure would have been most unlikely, if not impossible\u201d, and implicitly referred to the MRC report as a \u201cpreliminary report\u201d in which Franklin and Wilkins had \u201cindependently suggested that the basic structure of the paracrystalline [B] form is helical and contains two intertwined chains\u201d.",
              "They also noted that the King\u2019s researchers \u201csuggest that the sugar-phosphate backbone forms the outside of the helix and that each chain repeats itself after one revolution in 34 A\u030a\u201d.",
              "This clear acknowledgement of both the nature and the source of the information Watson and Crick had used has been overlooked in previous accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA.",
              "As well as showing the Cambridge duo finally trying to do the right thing, it strengthens our case that Franklin was an equal member in a group of four scientists working on the structure of DNA.",
              "She was recognized by her colleagues as such, although that acknowledgement was both belated and understated.",
              "All this helps to explain one of the lasting enigmas of the affair \u2014 why neither Franklin nor Wilkins ever questioned how the structure had been discovered.",
              "They knew the answer, because they expected that Perutz would share his knowledge and because they had read Watson and Crick\u2019s 1954 article17.",
              "Three weeks after the three DNA papers were published in Nature, Bragg gave a lecture on the discovery at Guy\u2019s Hospital Medical School in London, which was reported on the front page of the British News Chronicle daily newspaper.",
              "This drew the attention of Joan Bruce, a London journalist working for Time.",
              "Although Bruce\u2019s article has never been published \u2014 or described by historians, until now \u2014 it is notable for its novel take on the discovery of the double helix.",
              "Bruce portrayed the work as being done by \u201ctwo teams\u201d: one, consisting of Wilkins and Franklin, gathering experimental evidence using X-ray analysis;",
              "\u201cthe other\u201d comprising Watson and Crick, working on theory.",
              "To a certain extent, wrote Bruce, the teams worked independently, although \u201cthey linked up, confirming each other\u2019s work from time to time, or wrestling over a common problem\u201d.",
              "For example, Watson and Crick had \u201cstarted to work on the double helix theory as a result of Wilkins\u2019 X-rays\u201d.",
              "Conversely, she wrote, Franklin was \u201cchecking the Cavendish model against her own X-rays, not always confirming the Cavendish structural theory\u201d18.",
              "It has not escaped our notice that both examples render Franklin in a position of strength, every bit a peer of Wilkins, Crick and Watson.",
              "Unfortunately, Bruce was not so strong on the science.",
              "Her article got far enough for Time to send a Cambridge photographer, Anthony Barrington Brown, to shoot portraits of Watson and Crick, and for Watson to tell his friends to watch for it19.",
              "But it never appeared, perhaps because Franklin told Bruce that it needed an awful lot of work to get the science straight.",
              "Bruce\u2019s take on the discovery was buried, and Barrington Brown\u2019s compelling images disappeared until Watson resurrected the best of them 15 years later, for The Double Helix20.",
              "It is tantalizing to think how people might remember the double-helix story had Bruce\u2019s article been published, suitably scientifically corrected.",
              "From the outset, Franklin would have been represented as an equal member of a quartet who solved the double helix, one half of the team that articulated the scientific question, took important early steps towards a solution, provided crucial data and verified the result.",
              "Indeed, one of the first public displays of the double helix, at the Royal Society Conversazione in June 1953, was signed by the authors of all three Nature papers1\u20133,21.",
              "In this early incarnation, the discovery of the structure of DNA was not seen as a race won by Watson and Crick, but as the outcome of a joint effort.",
              "According to journalist Horace Freeland Judson and Franklin\u2019s biographer, Brenda Maddox, Rosalind Franklin has been reduced to the \u201cwronged heroine\u201d of the double helix22,23.",
              "She deserves to be remembered not as the victim of the double helix, but as an equal contributor to the solution of the structure.",

              "[2] Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, Franklin's contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely unrecognized during her life, for which Franklin has been variously referred to as the \"wronged heroine\",[3] the \"dark lady of DNA\",[4] the \"forgotten heroine\",[5] a \"feminist icon\",[6] and the \"Sylvia Plath of molecular biology\".",
              "[7] Franklin graduated in 1941 with a degree in natural sciences from Newnham College, Cambridge, and then enrolled for a PhD in physical chemistry under Ronald George Wreyford Norrish, the 1920 Chair of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge.",

              "After joining King's College London in 1951 as a research associate, Franklin discovered some key properties of DNA, which eventually facilitated the correct description of the double helix structure of DNA.",
              "[3] Owing to disagreement with her director, John Randall, and her colleague Maurice Wilkins, Franklin was compelled to move to Birkbeck College in 1953.",
              "In April 2023, Matthew Cobb and Nathaniel Comfort suggested new evidence in an opinion piece that Franklin was a contributor and \"equal player\" in process leading to the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA, rather than otherwise, as may have been presented subsequently after the time of the discovery.",

              "[14][15] Watson suggested that Franklin would have ideally been awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with Wilkins but, although there was not yet a rule against posthumous awards,[16] the Nobel Committee generally did not make posthumous nominations.",

              "[45][46] Franklin was awarded a research fellowship at Newnham College, with which she joined the physical chemistry laboratory of the University of Cambridge to work under Ronald George Wreyford Norrish, who later won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "In her one year of work there, Franklin did not have much success.",
              "[47] As described by his biographer, Norrish was \"obstinate and almost perverse in argument, overbearing and sensitive to criticism\".",
              "[48] He could not decide upon the assignment of work for her.",
              "At that time, Norrish was succumbing due to heavy drinking.",
              "Franklin wrote that he made her despise him completely.",
              "[49] Resigning from Norrish's Lab, Franklin fulfilled the requirements of the National Service Acts by working as an assistant research officer at the British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) in 1942.",
              "[19] The BCURA was located on the Coombe Springs Estate near Kingston upon Thames near the southwestern boundary of London.",

              "Bennett was the director.",
              "Marcello Pirani and Victor Goldschmidt, both refugees from the Nazis, were consultants and lectured at BCURA while Franklin worked there.",
              "[2] During her BCURA research, Franklin initially stayed at Adrienne Weill's boarding house in Cambridge until her cousin, Irene Franklin, proposed that they share living quarters at a vacated house in Putney that belonged to her uncle.",
              "With Irene, Rosalind volunteered as an Air Raid Warden and regularly made patrols to see the welfare of people during air raids.",
              "[50] Franklin studied the porosity of coal using helium to determine its density.",
              "[51] Through this, she discovered the relationship between the fine constrictions in the pores of coals and the permeability of the porous space.",
              "By concluding that substances were expelled in order of molecular size as temperature increased, she helped classify coals and accurately predict their performance for fuel purposes and for production of wartime devices such as gas masks.",
              "[52] This work was the basis of Franklin's PhD thesis The physical chemistry of solid organic colloids with special reference to coal for which the University of Cambridge awarded her a PhD in 1945.",
              "[9] It was also the basis of several papers.",
              "[2] With World War II ending in 1945, Franklin asked Adrienne Weill for help and to let her know of job openings for \"a physical chemist who knows very little physical chemistry, but quite a lot about the holes in coal.\"",
              "At a conference in the autumn of 1946, Weill introduced Franklin to Marcel Mathieu, a director of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), the network of institutes that comprises the major part of the scientific research laboratories supported by the French government.",
              "This led to her appointment with Jacques Mering at the Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'E\u0301tat in Paris.",
              "Franklin joined the labo (as referred to by the staff) of Mering on 14 February 1947 as one of the fifteen chercheurs (researchers).",
              "[53][54] Mering was an X-ray crystallographer who applied X-ray diffraction to the study of rayon and other amorphous substances, in contrast to the thousands of regular crystals that had been studied by this method for many years.",
              "[2] He taught her the practical aspects of applying X-ray crystallography to amorphous substances.",
              "This presented new challenges in the conduct of experiments and the interpretation of results.",
              "Franklin applied them to further problems related to coal and to other carbonaceous materials, in particular the changes to the arrangement of atoms when these are converted to graphite.",
              "[2] She published several further papers on this work which has become part of the mainstream of the physics and chemistry of coal and carbon.",
              "Franklin coined the terms graphitising and non-graphitising carbon.",
              "The coal work was covered in a 1993 monograph,[55] and in the regularly-published textbook Chemistry and Physics of Carbon.",
              "[56] Mering continued the study of carbon in various forms, using X-ray diffraction and other methods.",
              "[57] In 1950, Franklin was granted a three-year Turner & Newall Fellowship to work at King's College London.",
              "In January 1951, she started working as a research associate in the Medical Research Council's (MRC) Biophysics Unit, directed by John Randall.",
              "[58] She was originally appointed to work on X-ray diffraction of proteins and lipids in solution, but Randall redirected Franklin's work to DNA fibres[59] because of new developments in the field, and she was to be the only experienced experimental diffraction researcher at King's at the time.",
              "[60][61] Randall made this reassignment, even before Franklin started working at King's, because of the pioneering work by DNA researcher Maurice Wilkins, and he reassigned Raymond Gosling, the graduate student who had been working with Wilkins, to be her assistant.",
              "[62] In 1950, Swiss chemist Rudolf Signer in Berne prepared a highly purified DNA sample from calf thymus.",
              "He freely distributed the DNA sample, later referred to as the Signer DNA, in early May 1950 at the meeting of the Faraday Society in London, and Wilkins was one of the recipients.",
              "[63] Even using crude equipment, Wilkins and Gosling had obtained a good-quality diffraction picture of the DNA sample which sparked further interest in this molecule.",
              "[64] But Randall had not indicated to them that he had asked Franklin to take over both the DNA diffraction work and guidance of Gosling's thesis.",
              "[65] It was while Wilkins was away on holiday that Randall, in a letter in December 1950, assured Franklin that \"as far as the experimental X-ray effort there would be for the moment only yourself and Gosling.\"",
              "[66] Randall's lack of communication about this reassignment significantly contributed to the well documented friction that developed between Wilkins and Franklin.",
              "[67] When Wilkins returned, he handed over the Signer DNA and Gosling to Franklin.",
              "[66] Franklin, now working with Gosling,[68] started to apply her expertise in X-ray diffraction techniques to the structure of DNA.",
              "She used a new fine-focus X-ray tube and microcamera ordered by Wilkins, but which she refined, adjusted and focused carefully.",
              "Drawing upon her physical chemistry background, a critical innovation Franklin applied was making the camera chamber that could be controlled for its humidity using different saturated salt solutions.",
              "[66] When Wilkins enquired about this improved technique, she replied in terms which offended him as she had \"an air of cool superiority\".",
              "[69] Franklin's habit of intensely looking people in the eye while being concise, impatient and direct unnerved many of her colleagues.",
              "In stark contrast, Wilkins was very shy, and slowly calculating in speech while he avoided looking anyone directly in the eye.",
              "[70] With the ingenious humidity-controlling camera, Franklin was soon able to produce X-ray images of better quality than those of Wilkins.",
              "She immediately discovered that the DNA sample could exist in two forms: at a relative humidity higher than 75%, the DNA fibre became long and thin;",
              "when it was drier, it became short and fat.",
              "She originally referred to the former as \"wet\" and the latter as \"crystalline.\"",
              "[66] On the structure of the crystalline DNA, Franklin first recorded the analysis in her notebook, which reads: \"Evidence for spiral [meaning helical] structure.",
              "Straight chain untwisted is highly improbable.",
              "Absence of reflections on meridian in \u03c7talline [crystalline] form suggests spiral structure.\"",
              "[66] An immediate discovery from this was that the phosphate group lies outside of the main DNA chain;",
              "Franklin, however could not make out whether there could be two or three chains.",
              "[71] She presented their data at a lecture in November 1951, in King's College London.",
              "In her lecture notes, Franklin wrote the following: The results suggest a helical structure (which must be very closely packed) containing 2, 3 or 4 co-axial nucleic acid chains per helical unit, and having the phosphate groups near the outside.",
              "[72] Franklin then named \"A\" and \"B\" respectively for the \"crystalline\" and \"wet\" forms. (The biological functions of A-DNA were discovered only 60 years later.",
              "[73]) Because of the intense personality conflict developing between Franklin and Wilkins, Randall divided the work on DNA.",
              "Franklin chose the data rich \"A\" form while Wilkins selected the \"B\" form.",
              "[74][75] By the end of 1951, it became generally accepted at King's that the B-DNA was a helix, but after Franklin had recorded an asymmetrical image in May 1952, Franklin became unconvinced that the A-DNA was a helix.",
              "[76] In July 1952, as a practical joke on Wilkins (who frequently expressed his view that both forms of DNA were helical), Franklin and Gosling produced a funeral notice regretting the 'death' of helical A-DNA, which runs: It is with great regret that we have to announce the death, on Friday 18th July 1952 of DNA helix (crystalline).",
              "Death followed a protracted illness which an intensive course of Besselised [referring to Bessel function that was used to analyse the X-ray diffraction patterns[77]] injections had failed to relieve.",
              "A memorial service will be held next Monday or Tuesday.",
              "It is hoped that Dr M H F Wilkins will speak in memory of the late helix.",
              "[Signed Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling.]",
              "[78] During 1952, they worked at applying the Patterson function to the X-ray pictures of DNA they had produced.",
              "This was a long and labour-intensive approach but would yield significant insight into the structure of the molecule.",
              "[79] Franklin was fully committed to experimental data and was sternly against theoretical or model buildings, as she said, \"We are not going to speculate, we are going to wait, we are going to let the spots on this photograph tell us what the [DNA] structure is.\"",
              "[78] The X-ray diffraction pictures, including the landmark Photo 51 taken by Gosling at this time,[64] have been called by John Desmond Bernal as \"amongst the most beautiful X-ray photographs of any substance ever taken\".",
              "[80] By January 1953, Franklin had reconciled her conflicting data, concluding that both DNA forms had two helices, and had started to write a series of three draft manuscripts, two of which included a double helical DNA backbone (see below).",
              "Franklin's two A-DNA manuscripts reached Acta Crystallographica in Copenhagen on 6 March 1953, the day before Crick and Watson had completed their model on B-DNA.",
              "Franklin must have mailed them while the Cambridge team was building their model, and certainly had written them before she knew of their work.",
              "[81] On 8 July 1953, Franklin modified one of these \"in proof\" Acta articles, \"in light of recent work\" by the King's and Cambridge research teams.[82] The third draft paper was on the B-DNA, dated 17 March 1953, which was discovered years later amongst her papers, by Franklin's Birkbeck colleague, Aaron Klug.",
              "[83] He then published in 1974 an evaluation of the draft's close correlation with the third of the original trio of 25 April 1953 Nature DNA articles.",
              "[79] Klug designed this paper to complement the first article he had written in 1968 defending Franklin's significant contribution to DNA structure.",
              "Klug had written this first article in response to the incomplete picture of Franklin's work depicted in James Watson's 1968 memoir, The Double Helix.",
              "[71] As vividly described by Watson, he travelled to King's on 30 January 1953 carrying a preprint of Linus Pauling's incorrect proposal for DNA structure.",
              "Since Wilkins was not in his office, Watson went to Franklin's lab with his urgent message that they should all collaborate before Pauling discovered his error.",
              "The unimpressed Franklin became angry when Watson suggested she did not know how to interpret her own data.",
              "Watson hastily retreated, backing into Wilkins who had been attracted by the commotion.",
              "Wilkins commiserated with his harried friend and then showed Watson Franklin's DNA X-ray image.",
              "[84] Watson, in turn, showed Wilkins a prepublication manuscript by Pauling and Robert Corey, which contained a DNA structure remarkably like their first incorrect model.",
              "[85] In November 1951, James Watson and Francis Crick of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge University had started to build a molecular model of the B-DNA using data similar to that available to both teams at King's.",
              "Based on Franklin's lecture in November 1951 that DNA was helical with either two or three stands, they constructed a triple helix model, which was immediately proven to be flawed.",
              "[66] In particular, the model had the phosphate backbone of the molecules forming a central core.",
              "But Franklin pointed out that the progressive solubility of DNA crystals in water meant that the strongly hydrophilic phosphate groups were likely to be on the outside of the structure;",
              "while the experimental failure to titrate the CO- and NH2 groups of the bases meant that these were more likely to be inaccessible in the interior of the structure.",
              "This initial setback led Watson and Crick to focus on other topics for most of the next year.",
              "Model building had been applied successfully in the elucidation of the structure of the alpha helix by Linus Pauling in 1951,[75][86] but Franklin was opposed to prematurely building theoretical models, until sufficient data were obtained to properly guide the model building.",
              "She took the view that building a model was to be undertaken only after enough of the structure was known.",
              "[76][87] Franklin's conviction was only reinforced when Pauling and Corey also came up in the late 1952 (published in February 1953[88]) with an erroneous triple helix model.",
              "[78] Ever cautious, Franklin wanted to eliminate misleading possibilities.",
              "Photographs of her Birkbeck work table show that Franklin routinely used small molecular models, although certainly not ones on the grand scale successfully used at Cambridge for DNA.",
              "The arrival in Cambridge of Linus Pauling's flawed paper in January 1953 prompted the head of the Cavendish Laboratory, Lawrence Bragg, to encourage Watson and Crick to resume their own model building.",
              "[89] Six weeks of intense efforts followed, as they tried to guess how the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA structure, within the broad parameters set by the experimental data from the team at King's, that the structure should contain one or more helices with a repeat distance of 34 Angstroms, with probably ten elements in each repeat;",
              "and that the hydrophilic phosphate groups should be on the outside (though as Watson and Crick struggled to come up with a structure they at times departed from each of these assumptions during the process).",
              "[89] Crick and Watson received a further impetus in the middle of February 1953 when Crick's thesis advisor, Max Perutz, gave Crick a copy of a report written for a Medical Research Council biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952, containing many of Franklin's crystallographic calculations.",
              "[90] This decisively confirmed the 34 Angstrom repeat distance;",
              "and established that the structure had C2 symmetry, immediately confirming to Crick that it must contain an equal number of parallel and anti-parallel strands running in opposite directions.",
              "[89] Since Franklin had decided to transfer to Birkbeck College and Randall had insisted that all DNA work must stay at King's, Wilkins was given copies of Franklin's diffraction photographs by Gosling.",
              "By 28 February 1953, Watson and Crick felt they had solved the problem enough for Crick to proclaim (in the local pub) that they had \"found the secret of life\".",
              "[91] However, they knew they must complete their model before they could be certain.",
              "[92] The closeness of fit to the experimental data from King's was an essential corroboration of the structure.",
              "[89][93] Watson and Crick finished building their model on 7 March 1953, a day before they received a letter from Wilkins stating that Franklin was finally leaving and they could put \"all hands to the pump\".",
              "[94] This was also one day after Franklin's two A-DNA papers had reached Acta Crystallographica.",
              "Wilkins came to see the model the following week, according to Franklin's biographer Brenda Maddox, on 12 March, and allegedly informed Gosling on his return to King's.",
              "[95] One of the most critical and overlooked moments in DNA research was how and when Franklin realised and conceded that B-DNA was a double helical molecule.",
              "When Klug first examined Franklin's documents after her death, he initially came to an impression that Franklin was not convinced of the double helical nature until the knowledge of the Cambridge model.",
              "[71] But Klug later discovered the original draft of the manuscript (dated 17 March 1953) from which it became clear that Franklin had already resolved the correct structure.",
              "The news of Watson\u2013Crick model reached King's the next day, 18 March,[79] suggesting that Franklin would have learned of it much later since she had moved to Birkbeck.",
              "Further scrutiny of her notebook revealed that Franklin had already thought of the helical structure for B-DNA in February 1953 but was not sure of the number of strands, as she wrote: \"Evidence for 2-chain (or 1-chain helix).\"",
              "[96] Her conclusion on the helical nature was evident, though she failed to understand the complete organisation of the DNA strands, as the possibility of two strands running in opposite directions did not occur to her.",
              "[79] Towards the end of February, Franklin began to work out the indications of double strands, as she noted: \"Structure B does not fit single helical theory, even for low layer-lines.\"",
              "It soon dawned to her that the B-DNA and A-DNA were structurally similar,[96] and perceived A-DNA as an \"unwound version\" of B-DNA.",
              "[79] Franklin and Gosling wrote a five-paged manuscript on 17 March titled \"A Note on Molecular Configuration of Sodium Thymonucleate.\"",
              "[97] After the Watson\u2013Crick model was known, there appeared to be only one (hand-written) modification after the typeset at the end of the text which states that their data was consistent with the model,[79] and appeared as such in the trio of 25 April 1953 Nature articles;",
              "the other modification being a deletion of \"A Note on\" from the title.",
              "[98][99] As Franklin considered the double helix, she also realised that the structure would not depend on the detailed order of the bases, and noted that \"an infinite variety of nucleotide sequences would be possible to explain the biological specificity of DNA\".",
              "[89] However she did not yet see the complementarity of the base-pairing \u2013 Crick and Watson's breakthrough of 28 February, with all its biological significance;",
              "nor indeed at this point did she yet have the correct structures of the bases, so even if she had tried, she would not have been able to make a satisfactory structure.",
              "[89] As Cobb and Comfort (2023) note \"She did not have time to make these final leaps, because Watson and Crick beat her to the answer.\"",
              "[89] Weeks later, on 10 April, Franklin wrote to Crick for permission to see their model.",
              "[100] Franklin retained her scepticism for premature model building even after seeing the Watson\u2013Crick model, and remained unimpressed.",
              "She is reported to have commented, \"It's very pretty, but how are they going to prove it?\"",
              "As an experimental scientist, Franklin seems to have been interested in producing far greater evidence before publishing-as-proven a proposed model.",
              "Accordingly, her response to the Watson\u2013Crick model was in keeping with her cautious approach to science.",
              "[101] Crick and Watson published their model in Nature on 25 April 1953, in an article describing the double-helical structure of DNA with only a footnote acknowledging \"having been stimulated by a general knowledge of Franklin and Wilkins' 'unpublished' contribution.\"",
              "[102] Actually, although it was the bare minimum, they had just enough specific knowledge of Franklin and Gosling's data upon which to base their model.",
              "As a result of a deal struck by the two laboratory directors, articles by Wilkins and Franklin, which included their X-ray diffraction data, were modified and then published second and third in the same issue of Nature, seemingly only in support of the Crick and Watson theoretical paper which proposed a model for the B-DNA.",

              "[208] Indeed, after the publication of Watson's The Double Helix exposed Perutz's act, he received so many letters questioning his judgment that he felt the need to both answer them all[209] and to post a general statement in Science excusing himself on the basis of being \"inexperienced and casual in administrative matters\".",

              "The upshot of all this was that, when Crick and Watson started to build their model, in February 1953, they were working with critical parameters that had been determined by Franklin in 1951, and which she and Gosling had significantly refined in 1952, as well as with published data and other very similar data to those available at King's.",
              "It was generally believed that Franklin was never aware that her work had been used during construction of the model,[212] but Gosling, when asked in his 2013 interview if he believed she learned of this before her death, asserted \"Yes.",

              "[219] Upon the completion of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure.",
              "[220] Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model.",
              "[221] He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this might have helped to clarify the contribution the work at King's had made to the discovery.",
              "[222] There is no doubt that Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953.",
              "Some, including Maddox, have explained this citation omission by suggesting that it may be a question of circumstance, because it would have been very difficult to cite the unpublished work from the MRC report they had seen.",
              "[95] Indeed, a clear timely acknowledgment would have been awkward, given the unorthodox manner in which data were transferred from King's to Cambridge.",
              "However, methods were available.",
              "Watson and Crick could have cited the MRC report as a personal communication or else cited the Acta articles in press, or most easily, the third Nature paper that they knew was in press.",
              "One of the most important accomplishments of Maddox's widely acclaimed biography is that Maddox made a well-received case for inadequate acknowledgement.",
              "\"Such acknowledgement as they gave her was very muted and always coupled with the name of Wilkins\".",
              "[223] Fifteen years after the fact, the first clear recitation of Franklin's contribution appeared as it permeated Watson's account, The Double Helix, although it was buried under descriptions of Watson's (often quite negative) regard towards Franklin during the period of their work on DNA.",
              "This attitude is epitomized in the confrontation between Watson and Franklin over a preprint of Pauling's mistaken DNA manuscript.",
              "[224] Watson's words impelled Sayre to write her rebuttal, in which the entire chapter nine, \"Winner Take All\", has the structure of a legal brief dissecting and analyzing the topic of acknowledgement.",
              "[225] Sayre's early analysis was often ignored because of perceived feminist overtones in her book.",
              "Watson and Crick did not cite the X-ray diffraction work of Wilkins and Franklin in their original paper, though they admit having \"been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr.",

              "[102] In fact, Watson and Crick cited no experimental data at all in support of their model.",
              "Franklin and Gosling's publication of the DNA X-ray image, in the same issue of Nature, served as the principal evidence: Thus our general ideas are not inconsistent with the model proposed by Watson and Crick in the preceding communication.",
              "[99] Franklin was never nominated for a Nobel Prize.",
              "[226][227] Her work was a crucial part in the discovery of DNA's structure, which along with subsequent related work led to Francis Crick, James Watson, and Maurice Wilkins being awarded a Nobel Prize in 1962.",
              "[228] Franklin had died in 1958, and during her lifetime, the DNA structure was not considered to be fully proven.",
              "It took Wilkins and his colleagues about seven years to collect enough data to prove and refine the proposed DNA structure.",
              "Moreover, its biological significance, as proposed by Watson and Crick, was not established.",
              "General acceptance for the DNA double helix and its function did not start until late in the 1950s, leading to Nobel nominations in 1960, 1961, and 1962 for Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and in 1962 for Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "[229] The first breakthrough was from Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958, who experimentally showed the DNA replication of a bacterium Escherichia coli.",
              "[230] In what is now known as the Meselson\u2013Stahl experiment, DNA was found to replicate into two double-stranded helices, with each helix having one of the original DNA strands.",
              "This DNA replication was firmly established by 1961 after further demonstration in other species,[231] and of the stepwise chemical reaction.",
              "[232][233] According to the 1961 Crick\u2013Monod letter, this experimental proof, along with Wilkins having initiated the DNA diffraction work, were the reasons why Crick felt that Wilkins should be included in the DNA Nobel Prize.",
              "[93] In 1962 the Nobel Prize was subsequently awarded to Crick, Watson, and Wilkins.",
              "[19][234][235] Nobel rules now prohibit posthumous nominations (though this statute was not formally in effect until 1974) or splitting of Prizes more than three ways.",
              "[236][237] The award was for their body of work on nucleic acids and not exclusively for the discovery of the structure of DNA.",
              "[238] By the time of the award Wilkins had been working on the structure of DNA for more than 10 years, and had done much to confirm the Watson\u2013Crick model.",
              "[239] Crick had been working on the genetic code at Cambridge and Watson had worked on RNA for some years.",
              "[240] Watson has suggested that ideally Wilkins and Franklin would have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "[17] Pauling, who received the Nobel Peace Prize that year, believed and earlier warned the Nobel Committee in 1960 that \"it might well be premature to make an award of a Prize to Watson and Crick, because of existing uncertainty about the detailed structure of nucleic acid.",
              "I myself feel that it is likely that the general nature of the Watson-Crick structure is correct, but that there is doubt about details.\"",
              "[241] He was partly right as an alternative of Watson-Crick base pairing, called the Hoogsteen base pairing that can form triple DNA strand, was discovered by Karst Hoogsteen in 1963.",
              "[242][243] Aaron Klug, Franklin's colleague and principal beneficiary in her will, was the sole winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1982, \"for his development of crystallographic electron microscopy and his structural elucidation of biologically important nucleic acid-protein complexes\".",
              "[244] This work was exactly what Franklin had started and which she introduced to Klug, and it is highly plausible that, were she alive, Franklin would have shared the Nobel Prize.",
              "[245] Franklin's part in the discovery of the nature of DNA was shown in the 1987 TV Movie Life Story, starring Juliet Stevenson as Franklin, and with Tim Pigott-Smith as Crick, Alan Howard as Wilkins and Jeff Goldblum as Watson.",
              "This movie portrayed Franklin as somewhat stern, but also alleged that Watson and Crick did use a lot of her work to do theirs.",
              "[309][310] A 56-minute documentary of the life and scientific contributions of Franklin, DNA \u2013 Secret of Photo 51, was broadcast in 2003 on PBS Nova.",

              "[313] The UK version produced by BBC is titled Rosalind Franklin: DNA's Dark Lady.",
              "[314] The first episode of another PBS documentary serial, DNA, was aired on 4 January 2004.",
              "[315] The episode titled The Secret of Life centres much around the contributions of Franklin.",
              "Narrated by Jeff Goldblum, it features Watson, Wilkins, Gosling and Peter Pauling (son of Linus Pauling).",
              "[316] A play entitled Rosalind: A Question of Life was written by Deborah Gearing to mark the work of Franklin, and was first performed on 1 November 2005 at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre,[317] and published by Oberon Books in 2006.",
              "[318] Another play, Photograph 51 by Anna Ziegler, published in 2011,[319] has been produced at several places in the US[319] and in late 2015 was put on at the Noel Coward Theatre, London, with Nicole Kidman playing Franklin.",
              "[320] Ziegler's version of the 1951\u201353 'race' for the structure of DNA sometimes emphasizes the pivotal role of Franklin's research and her personality.",
              "Although sometimes altering history for dramatic effect, the play nevertheless illuminates many of the key issues of how science was and is conducted.",
              "[321] False Assumptions by Lawrence Aronovitch is a play about the life of Marie Curie in which Franklin is portrayed as frustrated and angry at the lack of recognition for her scientific contributions.",

              "Franklin\u2019s research career began in the physical sciences.",
              "In some of her earliest work, in the 1940s, including her PhD, Franklin helped to determine the density, structure and composition of coal, a fossil fuel that was used widely to heat homes and to power industry.",
              "Franklin wanted to understand the porosity of coal, mainly to learn how to make it burn more efficiently.",
              "But, as Patricia Fara, a historian of science at the University of Cambridge, UK, points out, the porosity of coal was also a key factor in the effectiveness of Second World War gas masks, which contained activated-charcoal filters.",

              "The following year, she laid out her most important contribution to coal science: the discovery that the carbon formed as coal burns falls into one of two categories, graphitizing or non-graphitizing, and that each has a distinct molecular structure3.",
              "This work revealed the main difference between coke and char \u2014 two products of burning coal.",
              "Coke could be transformed into crystalline graphite at high temperatures, whereas char could not.",
              "The work also helped to explain why coke burns so efficiently \u2014 hot and with little smoke.",
              "This makes it useful in industrial processes that need to create vast quantities of heat, such as smelting in steel foundries.",
              "From coal, Franklin moved on to the study of viruses, which would fascinate her for the remainder of her life.",
              "During the 1950s, she spent five productive years at Birkbeck College in London using her X-ray skills to determine the structure of RNA in the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), which attacks plants and destroys tobacco crops.",
              "The virus was discovered in the 1890s, when researchers were attempting to isolate the pathogen that was harming the plants, and found that it was too small to be a bacterium.",
              "Franklin produced detailed X-ray diffraction images, which would become her hallmark.",
              "At one point, she corrected James Watson\u2019s interpretation of TMV\u2019s helical structure.",
              "Knowledge of the virus\u2019s structure allowed other scientists to forge ahead in the early days of molecular biology and use TMV as a model to help break the genetic code.",
              "With the structure of TMV resolved, Franklin set out to study other plant viruses blighting important agricultural crops, including the potato, turnip, tomato and pea.",
              "Then, in 1957, she pivoted again to begin studying the virus that causes polio, which is structurally similar to the turnip yellow mosaic virus.",
              "At the time, polio was a feared communicable disease.",
              "It has since been mostly eradicated, although cases linger in Pakistan and Afghanistan.",

              "Franklin, a specialist in X-ray crystallography, continued previous X-ray crystallography experiments on DNA with Gosling when she joined the King \u0301s College London lab in 1951.",
              "Before joining the lab, Franklin conducted X-ray diffraction experiments on carbon compounds at a government lab in Paris, France, and published several papers on X-ray crystallography of coal and coal compounds.",
              "Throughout Franklin \u0301s early work at King \u0301s College London, she found that DNA fibers with a higher water content produced a different diffraction pattern than DNA fibers with a lower water content, indicating that wet and dry DNA adopted different three-dimensional conformations.",
              "Franklin later defined the drier DNA conformation as the A-Form DNA and the wetter DNA conformation as B-Form DNA.",
              "As of 2018, scientists continue to use the A Form and B Form designations for the two conformations of DNA.",
              "In addition to identifying the two forms of DNA, Franklin determined that Asbury \u0301s diffraction patterns of DNA came from a mixture of A and B-Forms of DNA.",
              "By improving her methods of collecting DNA X-ray diffraction images, Franklin obtained Photo 51 from an X-ray crystallography experiment she conducted on 6 May 1952.",
              "First, she minimized how much the X-rays scattered off the air surrounding the crystal by pumping hydrogen gas around the crystal.",
              "Because hydrogen only has one electron, it does not scatter X-rays well.",
              "She pumped hydrogen gas through a salt solution to maintain the targeted hydration of the DNA fibers.",
              "Franklin tuned the salt concentration of the solution and the humidity surrounding the crystal to keep DNA entirely in the B-Form.",
              "After exposing the DNA fibers to X-rays for a total of sixty-two hours, Franklin collected the resulting diffraction pattern and labeled it Number 51 that became Photo 51.",
              "Photo 51 presents a clear diffraction pattern for B-Form DNA.",
              "The outermost edge of the diffraction pattern consists of a black diamond shape.",
              "The diamond has rounded corners with the darkest corners situated at the top and bottom of the film.",
              "The diamond shape of the DNA diffraction pattern is not made of fine, definite lines, but rather thick, fuzzy boarders that vary in darkness such that the boarders fade on the left and right hand sides of the film.",
              "Inside the diamond is a cross shape like the letter \"X.\"",
              "The X shape is not made of continuous lines.",
              "Instead, along each line of the X are four horizontal dashes, called spots that become darker moving closer to the center of the film.",
              "There is a hole at the center of the film, with dark spots lining the outside of the center hole.",
              "Researchers could interpret an X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA with knowledge about DNA \u0301s composition, which scientists had at the time Franklin collected photo 51.",
              "Years prior to Franklin \u0301s work, scientists determined that DNA consists of a chain of repeating units called nucleotides.",
              "Each nucleotide has three key features.",
              "Each nucleotide consists of a center sugar ring called deoxyribose.",
              "Attached to one end of the deoxyribose ring is a negatively charged phosphate group consisting of phosphorus and oxygen atoms. Attached to the other end of the deoxyribose ring is a molecule called a base consisting of either single or double rings of carbon and nitrogen.",
              "There are four types of bases in DNA.",
              "Using the available knowledge about DNA \u0301s composition and mathematical techniques, Franklin learned of some key features regarding the structure of B-Form DNA from Photo 51.",

              "Each dash of the X shape marks the repetition of atoms, or atomic repeats, in DNA.",
              "Therefore, based on the distances between the dashes, Franklin determined the distance between nucleotides, the smallest repeating units in DNA.",
              "The angles of the X shape revealed to Franklin the radius of DNA, or half the horizontal distance from one side of the molecule to the other.",
              "From the distance between the top and bottom of the outer diamond shape, Franklin found that there are ten nucleotides between each turn of the DNA molecule.",
              "Lastly, the lighter nature of the diamond on the top and bottom of the film showed Franklin that the DNA bases face the inside of the helix whereas the phosphate groups face outside.",

              "In reality, this is not the case.",
              "Rather, DNA was first identified in the late 1860s by Swiss chemist Friedrich Miescher.",
              "Then, in the decades following Miescher's discovery, other scientists--notably, Phoebus Levene and Erwin Chargaff--carried out a series of research efforts that revealed additional details about the DNA molecule, including its primary chemical components and the ways in which they joined with one another.",
              "Without the scientific foundation provided by these pioneers, Watson and Crick may never have reached their groundbreaking conclusion of 1953: that the DNA molecule exists in the form of a three-dimensional double helix.",
              "Although few people realize it, 1869 was a landmark year in genetic research, because it was the year in which Swiss physiological chemist Friedrich Miescher first identified what he called \"nuclein\" inside the nuclei of human white blood cells.",
              "(The term \"nuclein\" was later changed to \"nucleic acid\" and eventually to \"deoxyribonucleic acid,\" or \"DNA.\"",
              ") Miescher's plan was to isolate and characterize not the nuclein (which nobody at that time realized existed) but instead the protein components of leukocytes (white blood cells).",
              "Miescher thus made arrangements for a local surgical clinic to send him used, pus-coated patient bandages;",
              "once he received the bandages, he planned to wash them, filter out the leukocytes, and extract and identify the various proteins within the white blood cells.",
              "But when he came across a substance from the cell nuclei that had chemical properties unlike any protein, including a much higher phosphorous content and resistance to proteolysis (protein digestion), Miescher realized that he had discovered a new substance (Dahm, 2008).",
              "Sensing the importance of his findings, Miescher wrote, \"It seems probable to me that a whole family of such slightly varying phosphorous-containing substances will appear, as a group of nucleins, equivalent to proteins\" (Wolf, 2003).",
              "More than 50 years passed before the significance of Miescher's discovery of nucleic acids was widely appreciated by the scientific community.",

              "Based upon years of work using hydrolysis to break down and analyze yeast nucleic acids, Levene proposed that nucleic acids were composed of a series of nucleotides, and that each nucleotide was in turn composed of just one of four nitrogen-containing bases, a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group.",

              "Erwin Chargaff was one of a handful of scientists who expanded on Levene's work by uncovering additional details of the structure of DNA, thus further paving the way for Watson and Crick.",
              "Chargaff, an Austrian biochemist, had read the famous 1944 paper by Oswald Avery and his colleagues at Rockefeller University, which demonstrated that hereditary units, or genes, are composed of DNA.",
              "This paper had a profound impact on Chargaff, inspiring him to launch a research program that revolved around the chemistry of nucleic acids.",
              "Of Avery's work, Chargaff (1971) wrote the following: \"This discovery, almost abruptly, appeared to foreshadow a chemistry of heredity and, moreover, made probable the nucleic acid character of the gene.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "Avery gave us the first text of a new language, or rather he showed us where to look for it.",
              "I resolved to search for this text.\"",
              "As his first step in this search, Chargaff set out to see whether there were any differences in DNA among different species.",
              "After developing a new paper chromatography method for separating and identifying small amounts of organic material, Chargaff reached two major conclusions (Chargaff, 1950).",
              "First, he noted that the nucleotide composition of DNA varies among species.",
              "In other words, the same nucleotides do not repeat in the same order, as proposed by Levene.",
              "Second, Chargaff concluded that almost all DNA--no matter what organism or tissue type it comes from--maintains certain properties, even as its composition varies.",
              "In particular, the amount of adenine (A) is usually similar to the amount of thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) usually approximates the amount of cytosine (C).",
              "In other words, the total amount of purines (A + G) and the total amount of pyrimidines (C + T) are usually nearly equal.",
              "(This second major conclusion is now known as \"Chargaff's rule.\"",
              ") Chargaff's research was vital to the later work of Watson and Crick, but Chargaff himself could not imagine the explanation of these relationships--specifically, that A bound to T and C bound to G within the molecular structure of DNA (Figure 2).",
              "Chargaff's realization that A = T and C = G, combined with some crucially important X-ray crystallography work by English researchers Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, contributed to Watson and Crick's derivation of the three-dimensional, double-helical model for the structure of DNA.",
              "Watson and Crick's discovery was also made possible by recent advances in model building, or the assembly of possible three-dimensional structures based upon known molecular distances and bond angles, a technique advanced by American biochemist Linus Pauling.",
              "In fact, Watson and Crick were worried that they would be \"scooped\" by Pauling, who proposed a different model for the three-dimensional structure of DNA just months before they did.",
              "In the end, however, Pauling's prediction was incorrect.",
              "Using cardboard cutouts representing the individual chemical components of the four bases and other nucleotide subunits, Watson and Crick shifted molecules around on their desktops, as though putting together a puzzle.",
              "They were misled for a while by an erroneous understanding of how the different elements in thymine and guanine (specifically, the carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen rings) were configured.",
              "Only upon the suggestion of American scientist Jerry Donohue did Watson decide to make new cardboard cutouts of the two bases, to see if perhaps a different atomic configuration would make a difference.",
              "It did.",
              "Not only did the complementary bases now fit together perfectly (i.",
              "e., A with T and C with G), with each pair held together by hydrogen bonds, but the structure also reflected Chargaff's rule (Figure 3).",

              "The discovery in 1953 of the double helix, the twisted-ladder structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), by James Watson and Francis Crick marked a milestone in the history of science and gave rise to modern molecular biology, which is largely concerned with understanding how genes control the chemical processes within cells.",
              "In short order, their discovery yielded ground-breaking insights into the genetic code and protein synthesis.",
              "During the 1970s and 1980s, it helped to produce new and powerful scientific techniques, specifically recombinant DNA research, genetic engineering, rapid gene sequencing, and monoclonal antibodies, techniques on which today's multi-billion dollar biotechnology industry is founded.",
              "Major current advances in science, namely genetic fingerprinting and modern forensics, the mapping of the human genome, and the promise, yet unfulfilled, of gene therapy, all have their origins in Watson and Crick's inspired work.",
              "The double helix has not only reshaped biology, it has become a cultural icon, represented in sculpture, visual art, jewelry, and toys.",
              "Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information, but they did not know what a gene actually looked like structurally and chemically, or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation.",
              "In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria.",
              "Nevertheless, many scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins, much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform a multitude of biological functions in the cell.",
              "Crick and Watson recognized, at an early stage in their careers, that gaining a detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional configuration of the gene was the central problem in molecular biology.",
              "Without such knowledge, heredity and reproduction could not be understood.",
              "They seized on this problem during their very first encounter, in the summer of 1951, and pursued it with single-minded focus over the course of the next eighteen months.",
              "This meant taking on the arduous intellectual task of immersing themselves in all the fields of science involved: genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography.",
              "Drawing on the experimental results of others (they conducted no DNA experiments of their own), taking advantage of their complementary scientific backgrounds in physics and X-ray crystallography (Crick) and viral and bacterial genetics (Watson), and relying on their brilliant intuition, persistence, and luck, the two showed that DNA had a structure sufficiently complex and yet elegantly simple enough to be the master molecule of life.",
              "Other researchers had made important but seemingly unconnected findings about the composition of DNA;",
              "it fell to Watson and Crick to unify these disparate findings into a coherent theory of genetic transfer.",
              "The organic chemist Alexander Todd had determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups.",
              "The biochemist Erwin Chargaff had found that while the amount of DNA and of its four types of bases--the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine(T)--varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C.",
              "Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape.",
              "Linus Pauling, then the world's leading physical chemist, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms. Moreover, he had pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to uncover the structure of DNA.",
              "Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his own model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.",
              "The time, then, was ripe for their discovery.",
              "After several failed attempts at model building, including their own ill-fated three-stranded version and one in which the bases were paired like with like (adenine with adenine, etc.)",
              ", they achieved their break-through.",
              "Jerry Donohue, a visiting physical chemist from the United States who shared Watson and Crick's office for the year, pointed out that the configuration for the rings of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen (the elements of all four bases) in thymine and guanine given in most textbooks of chemistry was incorrect.",
              "On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models by moving a hydrogen atom from a position where it bonded with oxygen to a neighboring position where it bonded with nitrogen.",
              "While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds.",
              "If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder.",
              "The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis, all of which were structural features demanded by the X-ray evidence.",
              "Similarly, the complementary pairing of the bases was compatible with the fact, also established by the X-ray diffraction pattern, that the backbones ran in opposite direction to each other, one up, the other down.",
              "Watson and Crick published their findings in a one-page paper, with the understated title \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid,\" in the British scientific weekly Nature on April 25, 1953, illustrated with a schematic drawing of the double helix by Crick's wife, Odile.",
              "A coin toss decided the order in which they were named as authors.",
              "Foremost among the \"novel features\" of \"considerable biological interest\" they described was the pairing of the bases on the inside of the two DNA backbones: A=T and C=G.",
              "The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain.",
              "Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in a second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.",
              "The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions.",
              "During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis, revolutionary then but widely-accepted since, that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted.",
              "Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first.",
              "Its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened, only towards the end of the 1950s, when the structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Arthur Kornberg, and others.",
              "Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery.",
              "As Watson recalled, after their conceptual breakthrough on February 28, 1953, Crick declared to the assembled lunch patrons at The Eagle that they had \"found the secret of life.\"",
              "Crick himself had no memory of such an announcement, but did recall telling his wife that evening \"that we seemed to have made a big discovery.\"",
              "He revealed that \"years later she told me that she hadn't believed a word of it.\"",
              "As he recounted her words, \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally I thought nothing of it.\"",
              "Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy.",
              "Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into his privacy, and a distortion of his motives.",
              "He waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication.",
              "He eventually became reconciled to Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.",
              "A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, which was shown to them, without her knowledge, by her estranged colleague, Maurice Wilkins, and by Max Perutz.",
              "Her evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel.",
              "Franklin's superb experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery.",
              "Yet, they gave her scant acknowledgment.",
              "Even so, Franklin bore no resentment towards them.",
              "She had presented her findings at a public seminar to which she had invited the two.",
              "She soon left DNA research to study tobacco mosaic virus.",
              "She became friends with both Watson and Crick, and spent her last period of remission from ovarian cancer in Crick's house (Franklin died in 1958).",
              "Crick believed that he and Watson used her evidence appropriately, while admitting that their patronizing attitude towards her, so apparent in The Double Helix, reflected contemporary conventions of gender in science.",

              "In reality, this is not the case.",
              "Rather, DNA was first identified in the late 1860s by Swiss chemist Friedrich Miescher.",
              "Then, in the decades following Miescher's discovery, other scientists--notably, Phoebus Levene and Erwin Chargaff--carried out a series of research efforts that revealed additional details about the DNA molecule, including its primary chemical components and the ways in which they joined with one another.",
              "Without the scientific foundation provided by these pioneers, Watson and Crick may never have reached their groundbreaking conclusion of 1953: that the DNA molecule exists in the form of a three-dimensional double helix.",
              "Although few people realize it, 1869 was a landmark year in genetic research, because it was the year in which Swiss physiological chemist Friedrich Miescher first identified what he called \"nuclein\" inside the nuclei of human white blood cells.",
              "(The term \"nuclein\" was later changed to \"nucleic acid\" and eventually to \"deoxyribonucleic acid,\" or \"DNA.\"",
              ") Miescher's plan was to isolate and characterize not the nuclein (which nobody at that time realized existed) but instead the protein components of leukocytes (white blood cells).",
              "Miescher thus made arrangements for a local surgical clinic to send him used, pus-coated patient bandages;",
              "once he received the bandages, he planned to wash them, filter out the leukocytes, and extract and identify the various proteins within the white blood cells.",
              "But when he came across a substance from the cell nuclei that had chemical properties unlike any protein, including a much higher phosphorous content and resistance to proteolysis (protein digestion), Miescher realized that he had discovered a new substance (Dahm, 2008).",
              "Sensing the importance of his findings, Miescher wrote, \"It seems probable to me that a whole family of such slightly varying phosphorous-containing substances will appear, as a group of nucleins, equivalent to proteins\" (Wolf, 2003).",
              "More than 50 years passed before the significance of Miescher's discovery of nucleic acids was widely appreciated by the scientific community.",
              "For instance, in a 1971 essay on the history of nucleic acid research, Erwin Chargaff noted that in a 1961 historical account of nineteenth-century science, Charles Darwin was mentioned 31 times, Thomas Huxley 14 times, but Miescher not even once.",
              "This omission is all the more remarkable given that, as Chargaff also noted, Miescher's discovery of nucleic acids was unique among the discoveries of the four major cellular components (i.",

              ") Chargaff's research was vital to the later work of Watson and Crick, but Chargaff himself could not imagine the explanation of these relationships--specifically, that A bound to T and C bound to G within the molecular structure of DNA (Figure 2).",
              "Chargaff's realization that A = T and C = G, combined with some crucially important X-ray crystallography work by English researchers Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, contributed to Watson and Crick's derivation of the three-dimensional, double-helical model for the structure of DNA.",
              "Watson and Crick's discovery was also made possible by recent advances in model building, or the assembly of possible three-dimensional structures based upon known molecular distances and bond angles, a technique advanced by American biochemist Linus Pauling.",

              "Researchers working on DNA in the early 1950s used the term \"gene\" to mean the smallest unit of genetic information, but they did not know what a gene actually looked like structurally and chemically, or how it was copied, with very few errors, generation after generation.",
              "In 1944, Oswald Avery had shown that DNA was the \"transforming principle,\" the carrier of hereditary information, in pneumococcal bacteria.",
              "Nevertheless, many scientists continued to believe that DNA had a structure too uniform and simple to store genetic information for making complex living organisms. The genetic material, they reasoned, must consist of proteins, much more diverse and intricate molecules known to perform a multitude of biological functions in the cell.",

Moreover, he had pioneered the method of model building in chemistry by which Watson and Crick were to uncover the structure of DNA.",
              "Indeed, Crick and Watson feared that they would be upstaged by Pauling, who proposed his own model of DNA in February 1953, although his three-stranded helical structure quickly proved erroneous.",

              "On February 28, 1953, Watson, acting on Donohue's advice, put the two bases into their correct form in cardboard models by moving a hydrogen atom from a position where it bonded with oxygen to a neighboring position where it bonded with nitrogen.",
              "While shifting around the cardboard cut-outs of the accurate molecules on his office table, Watson realized in a stroke of inspiration that A, when joined with T, very nearly resembled a combination of C and G, and that each pair could hold together by forming hydrogen bonds.",
              "If A always paired with T, and likewise C with G, then not only were Chargaff's rules (that in DNA, the amount of A equals that of T, and C that of G) accounted for, but the pairs could be neatly fitted between the two helical sugar-phosphate backbones of DNA, the outside rails of the ladder.",
              "The bases connected to the two backbones at right angles while the backbones retained their regular shape as they wound around a common axis, all of which were structural features demanded by the X-ray evidence.",

              "The pairing rule immediately suggested a copying mechanism for DNA: given the sequence of the bases in one strand, that of the other was automatically determined, which meant that when the two chains separated, each served as a template for a complementary new chain.",
              "Watson and Crick developed their ideas about genetic replication in a second article in Nature, published on May 30, 1953.",
              "The two had shown that in DNA, form is function: the double-stranded molecule could both produce exact copies of itself and carry genetic instructions.",
              "During the following years, Crick elaborated on the implications of the double-helical model, advancing the hypothesis, revolutionary then but widely-accepted since, that the sequence of the bases in DNA forms a code by which genetic information can be stored and transmitted.",
              "Although recognized today as one of the seminal scientific papers of the twentieth century, Watson and Crick's original article in Nature was not frequently cited at first.",
              "Its true significance became apparent, and its circulation widened, only towards the end of the 1950s, when the structure of DNA they had proposed was shown to provide a mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, and when their conclusions were confirmed in the laboratory by Matthew Meselson, Arthur Kornberg, and others.",
              "Crick himself immediately understood the significance of his and Watson's discovery.",

              "Retrospective accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA have continued to elicit a measure of controversy.",
              "Crick was incensed at Watson's depiction of their collaboration in The Double Helix (1968), castigating the book as a betrayal of their friendship, an intrusion into his privacy, and a distortion of his motives.",
              "He waged an unsuccessful campaign to prevent its publication.",
              "He eventually became reconciled to Watson's bestseller, concluding that if it presented an unfavorable portrait of a scientist, it was of Watson, not of himself.",
              "A more enduring controversy has been generated by Watson and Crick's use of Rosalind Franklin's crystallographic evidence of the structure of DNA, which was shown to them, without her knowledge, by her estranged colleague, Maurice Wilkins, and by Max Perutz.",
              "Her evidence demonstrated that the two sugar-phosphate backbones lay on the outside of the molecule, confirmed Watson and Crick's conjecture that the backbones formed a double helix, and revealed to Crick that they were antiparallel.",

              "This page has been archived and is no longer updated Many people believe that American biologist James Watson and English physicist Francis Crick discovered DNA in the 1950s.",
              "In reality, this is not the case.",
              "Rather, DNA was first identified in the late 1860s by Swiss chemist Friedrich Miescher.",
              "Then, in the decades following Miescher's discovery, other scientists--notably, Phoebus Levene and Erwin Chargaff--carried out a series of research efforts that revealed additional details about the DNA molecule, including its primary chemical components and the ways in which they joined with one another.",
              "Without the scientific foundation provided by these pioneers, Watson and Crick may never have reached their groundbreaking conclusion of 1953: that the DNA molecule exists in the form of a three-dimensional double helix.",
              "Although few people realize it, 1869 was a landmark year in genetic research, because it was the year in which Swiss physiological chemist Friedrich Miescher first identified what he called \"nuclein\" inside the nuclei of human white blood cells.",
              "(The term \"nuclein\" was later changed to \"nucleic acid\" and eventually to \"deoxyribonucleic acid,\" or \"DNA.\"",
              ") Miescher's plan was to isolate and characterize not the nuclein (which nobody at that time realized existed) but instead the protein components of leukocytes (white blood cells).",
              "Miescher thus made arrangements for a local surgical clinic to send him used, pus-coated patient bandages;",
              "once he received the bandages, he planned to wash them, filter out the leukocytes, and extract and identify the various proteins within the white blood cells.",
              "But when he came across a substance from the cell nuclei that had chemical properties unlike any protein, including a much higher phosphorous content and resistance to proteolysis (protein digestion), Miescher realized that he had discovered a new substance (Dahm, 2008).",
              "Sensing the importance of his findings, Miescher wrote, \"It seems probable to me that a whole family of such slightly varying phosphorous-containing substances will appear, as a group of nucleins, equivalent to proteins\" (Wolf, 2003).",
              "More than 50 years passed before the significance of Miescher's discovery of nucleic acids was widely appreciated by the scientific community.",
              "For instance, in a 1971 essay on the history of nucleic acid research, Erwin Chargaff noted that in a 1961 historical account of nineteenth-century science, Charles Darwin was mentioned 31 times, Thomas Huxley 14 times, but Miescher not even once.",
              "This omission is all the more remarkable given that, as Chargaff also noted, Miescher's discovery of nucleic acids was unique among the discoveries of the four major cellular components (i.",
              "e., proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids) in that it could be \"dated precisely.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "[to] one man, one place, one date.\"",
              "Meanwhile, even as Miescher's name fell into obscurity by the twentieth century, other scientists continued to investigate the chemical nature of the molecule formerly known as nuclein.",
              "One of these other scientists was Russian biochemist Phoebus Levene.",
              "A physician turned chemist, Levene was a prolific researcher, publishing more than 700 papers on the chemistry of biological molecules over the course of his career.",
              "Levene is credited with many firsts.",
              "For instance, he was the first to discover the order of the three major components of a single nucleotide (phosphate-sugar-base);",
              "the first to discover the carbohydrate component of RNA (ribose);",
              "the first to discover the carbohydrate component of DNA (deoxyribose);",
              "and the first to correctly identify the way RNA and DNA molecules are put together.",
              "During the early years of Levene's career, neither Levene nor any other scientist of the time knew how the individual nucleotide components of DNA were arranged in space;",
              "discovery of the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule was still years away.",
              "The large number of molecular groups made available for binding by each nucleotide component meant that there were numerous alternate ways that the components could combine.",
              "Several scientists put forth suggestions for how this might occur, but it was Levene's \"polynucleotide\" model that proved to be the correct one.",
              "Based upon years of work using hydrolysis to break down and analyze yeast nucleic acids, Levene proposed that nucleic acids were composed of a series of nucleotides, and that each nucleotide was in turn composed of just one of four nitrogen-containing bases, a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group.",
              "Levene made his initial proposal in 1919, discrediting other suggestions that had been put forth about the structure of nucleic acids.",
              "In Levene's own words, \"New facts and new evidence may cause its alteration, but there is no doubt as to the polynucleotide structure of the yeast nucleic acid\" (1919).",
              "Indeed, many new facts and much new evidence soon emerged and caused alterations to Levene's proposal.",
              "One key discovery during this period involved the way in which nucleotides are ordered.",
              "Levene proposed what he called a tetranucleotide structure, in which the nucleotides were always linked in the same order (i.",
              "e., G-C-T-A-G-C-T-A and so on).",
              "However, scientists eventually realized that Levene's proposed tetranucleotide structure was overly simplistic and that the order of nucleotides along a stretch of DNA (or RNA) is, in fact, highly variable.",
              "Despite this realization, Levene's proposed polynucleotide structure was accurate in many regards.",
              "For example, we now know that DNA is in fact composed of a series of nucleotides and that each nucleotide has three components: a phosphate group;",
              "either a ribose (in the case of RNA) or a deoxyribose (in the case of DNA) sugar;",
              "and a single nitrogen-containing base.",
              "We also know that there are two basic categories of nitrogenous bases: the purines (adenine [A] and guanine [G]), each with two fused rings, and the pyrimidines (cytosine [C], thymine [T], and uracil [U]), each with a single ring.",
              "Furthermore, it is now widely accepted that RNA contains only A, G, C, and U (no T), whereas DNA contains only A, G, C, and T (no U) (Figure 1).",
              "Erwin Chargaff was one of a handful of scientists who expanded on Levene's work by uncovering additional details of the structure of DNA, thus further paving the way for Watson and Crick.",
              "Chargaff, an Austrian biochemist, had read the famous 1944 paper by Oswald Avery and his colleagues at Rockefeller University, which demonstrated that hereditary units, or genes, are composed of DNA.",
              "This paper had a profound impact on Chargaff, inspiring him to launch a research program that revolved around the chemistry of nucleic acids.",
              "Of Avery's work, Chargaff (1971) wrote the following: \"This discovery, almost abruptly, appeared to foreshadow a chemistry of heredity and, moreover, made probable the nucleic acid character of the gene.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "Avery gave us the first text of a new language, or rather he showed us where to look for it.",
              "I resolved to search for this text.\"",
              "As his first step in this search, Chargaff set out to see whether there were any differences in DNA among different species.",
              "After developing a new paper chromatography method for separating and identifying small amounts of organic material, Chargaff reached two major conclusions (Chargaff, 1950).",
              "First, he noted that the nucleotide composition of DNA varies among species.",
              "In other words, the same nucleotides do not repeat in the same order, as proposed by Levene.",
              "Second, Chargaff concluded that almost all DNA--no matter what organism or tissue type it comes from--maintains certain properties, even as its composition varies.",
              "In particular, the amount of adenine (A) is usually similar to the amount of thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) usually approximates the amount of cytosine (C).",
              "In other words, the total amount of purines (A + G) and the total amount of pyrimidines (C + T) are usually nearly equal.",
              "(This second major conclusion is now known as \"Chargaff's rule.\"",
              ") Chargaff's research was vital to the later work of Watson and Crick, but Chargaff himself could not imagine the explanation of these relationships--specifically, that A bound to T and C bound to G within the molecular structure of DNA (Figure 2).",
              "Chargaff's realization that A = T and C = G, combined with some crucially important X-ray crystallography work by English researchers Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, contributed to Watson and Crick's derivation of the three-dimensional, double-helical model for the structure of DNA.",
              "Watson and Crick's discovery was also made possible by recent advances in model building, or the assembly of possible three-dimensional structures based upon known molecular distances and bond angles, a technique advanced by American biochemist Linus Pauling.",
              "In fact, Watson and Crick were worried that they would be \"scooped\" by Pauling, who proposed a different model for the three-dimensional structure of DNA just months before they did.",
              "In the end, however, Pauling's prediction was incorrect.",
              "Using cardboard cutouts representing the individual chemical components of the four bases and other nucleotide subunits, Watson and Crick shifted molecules around on their desktops, as though putting together a puzzle.",
              "They were misled for a while by an erroneous understanding of how the different elements in thymine and guanine (specifically, the carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen rings) were configured.",
              "Only upon the suggestion of American scientist Jerry Donohue did Watson decide to make new cardboard cutouts of the two bases, to see if perhaps a different atomic configuration would make a difference.",
              "It did.",
              "Not only did the complementary bases now fit together perfectly (i.",
              "e., A with T and C with G), with each pair held together by hydrogen bonds, but the structure also reflected Chargaff's rule (Figure 3).",

              "These features are as follows: One of the ways that scientists have elaborated on Watson and Crick's model is through the identification of three different conformations of the DNA double helix.",
              "In other words, the precise geometries and dimensions of the double helix can vary.",
              "The most common conformation in most living cells (which is the one depicted in most diagrams of the double helix, and the one proposed by Watson and Crick) is known as B-DNA.",
              "There are also two other conformations: A-DNA, a shorter and wider form that has been found in dehydrated samples of DNA and rarely under normal physiological circumstances;",
              "and Z-DNA, a left-handed conformation.",
              "Z-DNA is a transient form of DNA, only occasionally existing in response to certain types of biological activity (Figure 5).",
              "Z-DNA was first discovered in 1979, but its existence was largely ignored until recently.",
              "Scientists have since discovered that certain proteins bind very strongly to Z-DNA, suggesting that Z-DNA plays an important biological role in protection against viral disease (Rich & Zhang, 2003).",

              "Wilkins was stuck with poorer quality stuff from the Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff, at Columbia University in New York City.",
              "With the Signer DNA, Franklin was able to exploit a discovery that Wilkins had made earlier \u2014 DNA in solution could take two forms, what she called the crystalline or A form, and the paracrystalline or B form.",

              "lowering it again restored the crystalline A form.",

              "The B form, by contrast, yielded patterns that were blurrier and less detailed, but simpler to analyse.",
              "Initially, Franklin understood both A and B as helical.",
              "In notes for a seminar she gave in November 1951, she described them collectively: \u201cbig helix with several chains, phosphates on outside, phosphate\u2013phosphate interhelical bonds, disrupted by water\u201d5.",
              "Unable to resolve the A-form structure, Franklin had decided by the middle of 1952 that it was not actually helical \u2014 she even teased Wilkins with a mock funeral notice for the crystalline DNA helix6.",
              "She was not alone in being thrown off by the A-form data: after the double-helix paper1 had been published, Crick wrote of Franklin\u2019s precise but complex, data-rich A-form image, \u201cI am glad I didn\u2019t see it earlier, as it would have worried me considerably\u201d7.",

              "This explains why, in late 1952 and early 1953, she rejected the argument that DNA was intrinsically helical.",
              "From a chemist\u2019s perspective, Franklin\u2019s decision to focus on the crystalline A form was perfectly logical, as were the conclusions she drew from analysing it.",
              "But her focus on the drier A form ignored the very wet reality of the inside of a cell \u2014 which would mean that DNA took the more humid B form.",
              "Together with her insistence that the diffraction data be fully analysed before any modelling was attempted, it would hamper Franklin\u2019s efforts for more than a year.",
              "Even Franklin\u2019s advocates often unwittingly perpetuate a caricatured view of her science \u2014 one that can be traced back to Watson\u2019s reality-distorting 1968 bestseller, The Double Helix8.",
              "Watson\u2019s version of the next, crucial stage in the story is often repeated to highlight how Franklin was deprived of due credit.",
              "Inadvertently, this undermines her.",
              "According to Watson, in early 1953, he visited King\u2019s and got into a row with Franklin.",
              "Wilkins, he wrote, rescued him from the confrontation and then showed him Photograph 51, a particularly clear image of the B form, taken 8 months earlier by Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling.",
              "Franklin had put the photograph aside to concentrate on the A form.",
              "She was preparing to transfer to Birkbeck College, also in London, and had been instructed to leave her DNA work behind.",
              "Gosling was now being supervised by Wilkins, and he had given Wilkins the photograph.",
              "(He says he did so with Franklin\u2019s knowledge9.)",
              "The image, Watson claimed in The Double Helix, showed that a DNA helix \u201cmust exist\u201d \u2014 only a helical structure could produce those marks8.",
              "Because of Watson\u2019s narrative, people have made a fetish of Photograph 51.",
              "It has become the emblem of both Franklin\u2019s achievement and her mistreatment.",

              "Credit: King's College London Archives/Science Photo Library But Watson\u2019s narrative contains an absurd presumption.",
              "It implies that Franklin, the skilled chemist, could not understand her own data, whereas he, a crystallographic novice, apprehended it immediately.",
              "Moreover, everyone, even Watson, knew it was impossible to deduce any precise structure from a single photograph \u2014 other structures could have produced the same diffraction pattern.",
              "Without careful measurements \u2014 which Watson has insisted he did not make \u2014 all the image revealed was that the B form was probably some kind of helix, which no one doubted.",
              "Furthermore, various lines of evidence \u2014 including The Double Helix itself, read carefully \u2014 show that it played little, if any, part in Watson and Crick\u2019s inching towards the correct structure between January and March 1953.",
              "In fact, it was other data from Franklin and Wilkins that proved crucial, and even then, what really happened was less malicious than is widely assumed.",
              "Watson did get a jolt from seeing the photograph \u2014 because of when he saw it.",
              "Just days before, the Cambridge group had received a manuscript from the US chemist Linus Pauling, in which he\u2019d claimed to have solved the DNA structure.",
              "Although Pauling had made some elementary errors, Lawrence Bragg, head of the Cavendish Laboratory, who had a long-standing rivalry with Pauling, had encouraged Watson and Crick to resume their model building.",
              "Watson had dropped in at King\u2019s to show off Pauling\u2019s blunder, and Wilkins had shown him the photograph.",
              "Fashioning that moment into the climax of The Double Helix was a literary device: a classic eureka moment, easy for lay readers to understand.",
              "From 1951, Wilkins had kept Watson and Crick abreast of his work on the B form, in particular his belief that the structure contained one or more helices, repeated every 34 angstroms, and he might have said that within each repeat there were probably 10 elements.",
              "Shortly after Watson saw Photograph 51, Crick\u2019s supervisor, Max Perutz, handed them an informal report of the activity of the King\u2019s MRC unit, which he had been given as part of an official visit to the unit in December 1952.",
              "This included a page from Franklin, describing her work.",
              "In a 1969 letter to Science, although Perutz said that he regretted sharing the report without first consulting the King\u2019s group, it was not confidential10.",
              "Indeed, a letter we have discovered from a King\u2019s researcher, Pauline Cowan, written to Crick in January 1953, invites Crick to a talk by Franklin and Gosling, who, Cowan continues, \u201csay that it is mostly for a non-crystallographic audience + that Perutz already knows more about it than they are likely to get across so you may not think it worthwhile coming\u201d.",
              "Thus, Franklin seems to have assumed that Perutz would share his knowledge with Crick as part of the usual informal scientific exchange11.",
              "In her contribution to the MRC report, Franklin had confirmed the 34 A\u030a result for the B form.",
              "She also reported that the unit cell (the repeating unit of the crystal) of DNA was huge;",
              "it contained a larger number of atoms than any other unit cell in any other known molecular structure.",
              "Franklin also added some key crystallographic data for the A form, indicating that it had a \u2018C2\u2019 symmetry, which in turn implied that the molecule had an even number of sugar-phosphate strands running in opposite directions.",
              "Notes by Crick for a lecture on the history of the double helix, given to historians of science at the University of Oxford in May 1961, together with formal and informal remarks made throughout his life, reveal that, unlike Photograph 51, this report was truly significant for confirming the structure that Watson and Crick eventually obtained.",
              "In the end, however, neither Photograph 51 nor the MRC report \u2018gave\u2019 Watson and Crick the double helix.",
              "What did was six weeks of what they later described as \u201ctrial and error\u201d \u2014 making chemical calculations and fiddling about with cardboard models.",
              "(Watson made this plain in The Double Helix;",
              "Crick did so in a series of interviews with the historian Robert Olby in the late 1960s and early 1970s.)",
              "Franklin\u2019s data and Watson and Crick\u2019s many conversations with Wilkins had provided what seem like key pieces of information \u2014 the phosphate groups were on the outside of the molecule;",
              "there was a repeat every 34 A\u030a;",
              "perhaps there were ten bases per repeat and an even number of strands running in opposite directions (the implication of the C2 symmetry).",
              "Yet, according to their own accounts, the pair ignored every one of these facts at one point or another during those six weeks.",
              "Once they had hit on a conceptual model of the structure, the MRC report provided a valuable check on their assumptions.",
              "So it was not a case of them stealing the King\u2019s group\u2019s data and then, voila, those data gave them the structure of DNA.",
              "Instead, they solved the structure through their own iterative approach and then used the King\u2019s data \u2014 without permission \u2014 to confirm it.",
              "Franklin contributed several key insights to the discovery of the double helix.",
              "She clearly differentiated the A and B forms, solving a problem that had confused previous researchers.",
              "(X-ray diffraction experiments in the 1930s had inadvertently used a mixture of the A and B forms of DNA, yielding muddy patterns that were impossible to fully resolve.)",
              "Her measurements told her that the DNA unit cell was enormous;",
              "she also determined the C2 symmetry exhibited by that unit cell12.",
              "The C2 symmetry was one of 230 types of crystallographic 3D \u2018space groups\u2019 that had been established by the end of the nineteenth century.",
              "Franklin failed to appreciate its significance not because she was obtuse, but because she was unfamiliar with it.",
              "According to her colleague Aaron Klug, Franklin later said that she \u201ccould have kicked herself\u201d for not realizing the structural implications13.",
              "Crick did realize the implications because he happened to have studied C2 symmetry intensely.",
              "But even he did not use Franklin\u2019s determination of this symmetry when building the model;",
              "rather, it provided a powerful corroboration when their model was complete.",
              "James Watson (left) and Francis Crick modelled the structure of the DNA double helix.",
              "Credit: A.",
              "Barrington Brown, Gonville & Caius College/Science Photo Library Franklin also grasped, independently, one of the fundamental insights of the structure: how, in principle, DNA could specify proteins.",
              "In February 1953, she was working hard to finish her analyses of DNA before leaving King\u2019s.",
              "The A form had continued to resist her attempts to interpret it, so she had turned to the much simpler, clearly helical B form.",
              "Her notes reveal that by late February, she had accepted that the A form was also probably helical, with two strands, and she had realized that the order of the bases on a given strand had no effect on the overall structure.",
              "This meant that any sequence of bases was possible.",
              "As she noted, \u201can infinite variety of nucleotide sequences would be possible to explain the biological specificity of DNA\u201d14.",
              "This idea, which Watson and Crick grasped at around the same time, had first been proposed in 1947 by chemist John Masson Gulland at University College Nottingham, UK (now the University of Nottingham)15.",
              "Franklin did not apprehend complementary base-pairing \u2014 that A could bond only with T and C only with G, with each pair of bases forming an identical structure in the molecule.",
              "In fact, she was not working with the correct forms of the bases, so she could not have made a satisfactory model had she tried (the same was true of Watson and Crick until the very last phase of their work).",
              "Neither did she realize that her data implied that the two strands were oriented in different directions \u2014 or that the B form, found at high levels of humidity, must be the biologically functional form.",
              "(The A form is found only under laboratory conditions.)",
              "She did not have time to make these final leaps, because Watson and Crick beat her to the answer.",
              "Franklin did not succeed, partly because she was working on her own without a peer with whom to swap ideas.",
              "She was also excluded from the world of informal exchanges in which Watson and Crick were immersed.",
              "Even though some at the time \u2014 notably the researchers at King\u2019s and a small flock of what Watson called \u201cminor Cambridge biochemists\u201d16 \u2014 were not happy about Watson and Crick\u2019s use of the King\u2019s group\u2019s data, the lead scientists at the Cavendish \u2014 Perutz, Bragg, John Kendrew \u2014 thought it was quite normal.",
              "And there is no evidence that Franklin thought otherwise.",
              "After Watson and Crick had read the MRC report, they could not unsee it.",
              "But they could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 requested permission to use the data and made clear exactly what they had done, first to Franklin and Wilkins, and then to the rest of the world, in their publications.",

              "They acknowledged that, without Franklin\u2019s data, \u201cthe formulation of our structure would have been most unlikely, if not impossible\u201d, and implicitly referred to the MRC report as a \u201cpreliminary report\u201d in which Franklin and Wilkins had \u201cindependently suggested that the basic structure of the paracrystalline [B] form is helical and contains two intertwined chains\u201d.",
              "They also noted that the King\u2019s researchers \u201csuggest that the sugar-phosphate backbone forms the outside of the helix and that each chain repeats itself after one revolution in 34 A\u030a\u201d.",
              "This clear acknowledgement of both the nature and the source of the information Watson and Crick had used has been overlooked in previous accounts of the discovery of the structure of DNA.",
              "As well as showing the Cambridge duo finally trying to do the right thing, it strengthens our case that Franklin was an equal member in a group of four scientists working on the structure of DNA.",
              "She was recognized by her colleagues as such, although that acknowledgement was both belated and understated.",
              "All this helps to explain one of the lasting enigmas of the affair \u2014 why neither Franklin nor Wilkins ever questioned how the structure had been discovered.",
              "They knew the answer, because they expected that Perutz would share his knowledge and because they had read Watson and Crick\u2019s 1954 article17.",

              "This drew the attention of Joan Bruce, a London journalist working for Time.",
              "Although Bruce\u2019s article has never been published \u2014 or described by historians, until now \u2014 it is notable for its novel take on the discovery of the double helix.",
              "Bruce portrayed the work as being done by \u201ctwo teams\u201d: one, consisting of Wilkins and Franklin, gathering experimental evidence using X-ray analysis;",
              "\u201cthe other\u201d comprising Watson and Crick, working on theory.",
              "To a certain extent, wrote Bruce, the teams worked independently, although \u201cthey linked up, confirming each other\u2019s work from time to time, or wrestling over a common problem\u201d.",
              "For example, Watson and Crick had \u201cstarted to work on the double helix theory as a result of Wilkins\u2019 X-rays\u201d.",
              "Conversely, she wrote, Franklin was \u201cchecking the Cavendish model against her own X-rays, not always confirming the Cavendish structural theory\u201d18.",
              "It has not escaped our notice that both examples render Franklin in a position of strength, every bit a peer of Wilkins, Crick and Watson.",
              "Unfortunately, Bruce was not so strong on the science.",
              "Her article got far enough for Time to send a Cambridge photographer, Anthony Barrington Brown, to shoot portraits of Watson and Crick, and for Watson to tell his friends to watch for it19.",
              "But it never appeared, perhaps because Franklin told Bruce that it needed an awful lot of work to get the science straight.",
              "Bruce\u2019s take on the discovery was buried, and Barrington Brown\u2019s compelling images disappeared until Watson resurrected the best of them 15 years later, for The Double Helix20.",
              "It is tantalizing to think how people might remember the double-helix story had Bruce\u2019s article been published, suitably scientifically corrected.",
              "From the outset, Franklin would have been represented as an equal member of a quartet who solved the double helix, one half of the team that articulated the scientific question, took important early steps towards a solution, provided crucial data and verified the result.",
              "Indeed, one of the first public displays of the double helix, at the Royal Society Conversazione in June 1953, was signed by the authors of all three Nature papers1\u20133,21.",
              "In this early incarnation, the discovery of the structure of DNA was not seen as a race won by Watson and Crick, but as the outcome of a joint effort.",
              "According to journalist Horace Freeland Judson and Franklin\u2019s biographer, Brenda Maddox, Rosalind Franklin has been reduced to the \u201cwronged heroine\u201d of the double helix22,23.",
              "She deserves to be remembered not as the victim of the double helix, but as an equal contributor to the solution of the structure.",

              "Immediately following this article were two data-rich papers by researchers from King\u2019s College London: one by Maurice Wilkins and two colleagues, the other by Franklin and a PhD student, Ray Gosling.",
              "The model the Cambridge duo put forward did not simply describe the DNA molecule as a double helix.",
              "It was extremely precise, based on complex measurements of the angles formed by different chemical bonds, underpinned by some extremely powerful mathematics and based on interpretations that Crick had recently developed as part of his PhD thesis.",
              "The historical whodunnit, and the claims of data theft, turn on the origin of those measurements.",
              "The four protagonists would make good characters in a novel \u2013 Watson was young, brash, and obsessed with finding the structure of DNA;",
              "Crick was brilliant with a magpie mind, and had struck up a friendship with Wilkins, who was shy and diffident.",
              "Franklin, an expert in X-ray crystallography, had been recruited to King\u2019s in late 1950.",
              "Wilkins expected she would work with him, but the head of the King\u2019s group, John Randall, led her to believe she would be independent.",

              "Wilkins was quiet and hated arguments;",
              "Franklin was forceful and thrived on intellectual debate.",
              "Her friend Norma Sutherland recalled: \u201cHer manner was brusque and at times confrontational \u2013 she aroused quite a lot of hostility among the people she talked to, and she seemed quite insensitive to this.",
              "\u201d Watson and Crick\u2019s first foray into trying to crack the structure of DNA took place in 1952.",
              "It was a disaster.",
              "Their three-stranded, inside-out model was hopelessly wrong and was dismissed at a glance by Franklin.",
              "Following complaints from the King\u2019s group that Watson and Crick were treading on their toes, Sir Lawrence Bragg, the head of their lab in Cambridge told them to cease all work on DNA.",
              "However, at the beginning of 1953, a US competitor, Linus Pauling, became interested in the structure of DNA, so Bragg decided to set Watson and Crick on the problem once more.",
              "At the end of January 1953, Watson visited King\u2019s, where Wilkins showed him an X-ray photo that was subsequently used in Franklin\u2019s Nature article.",
              "This image, often called \u2018Photo 51\u2019, had been made by Raymond Gosling, a PhD student who had originally worked with Wilkins, had then been transferred to Franklin (without Wilkins knowing), and was now once more being supervised by Wilkins, as Franklin prepared to leave the terrible atmosphere at King\u2019s and abandon her work on DNA.",
              "Watson recalled that when he saw the photo \u2013 which was far clearer than any other he had seen \u2013 \u2018my mouth fell open and my pulse began to race.",
              "\u2019 According to Watson, photo 51 provided the vital clue to the double helix.",
              "But despite the excitement that Watson felt, all the main issues, such as the number of strands and above all the precise chemical organisation of the molecule, remained a mystery.",
              "A glance at photo 51 could not shed any light on those details.",
              "What Watson and Crick needed was far more than the idea of a helix \u2013 they needed precise observations from X-ray crystallography.",
              "Those numbers were unwittingly provided by Franklin herself, included in a brief informal report that was given to Max Perutz of Cambridge University.",
              "In February 1953, Perutz passed the report to Bragg, and thence to Watson and Crick.",
              "Crick now had the material he needed to do his calculations.",
              "Those numbers, which included the relative distances of the repetitive elements in the DNA molecule, and the dimensions of what is called the monoclinic unit cell \u2013 which indicated that the molecule was in two matching parts, running in opposite directions \u2013 were decisive.",
              "The report was not confidential, and there is no question that the Cambridge duo acquired the data dishonestly.",
              "However, they did not tell anyone at King\u2019s what they were doing, and they did not ask Franklin for permission to interpret her data (something she was particularly prickly about).",
              "Their behaviour was cavalier, to say the least, but there is no evidence that it was driven by sexist disdain: Perutz, Bragg, Watson and Crick would have undoubtedly behaved the same way had the data been produced by Maurice Wilkins.",
              "Ironically, the data provided by Franklin to the MRC were virtually identical to those she presented at a small seminar in King\u2019s in autumn 1951, when Jim Watson was in the audience.",
              "Had Watson bothered to take notes during her talk, instead of idly musing about her dress sense and her looks, he would have provided Crick with the vital numerical evidence 15 months before the breakthrough finally came.",
              "By chance, Franklin\u2019s data chimed completely with what Crick had been working on for months: the type of monoclinic unit cell found in DNA was also present in the horse haemoglobin he had been studying for his PhD.",
              "This meant that DNA was in two parts or chains, each matching the other.",
              "Crick\u2019s expertise explains why he quickly realised the significance of these facts, whereas it took Franklin months to get to the same point.",
              "While Watson and Crick were working feverishly in Cambridge, fearful that Pauling might scoop them, Franklin was finishing up her work on DNA before leaving the lab.",
              "The progress she made on her own, increasingly isolated and without the benefit of anyone to exchange ideas with, was simply remarkable.",
              "Franklin\u2019s laboratory notebooks reveal that she initially found it difficult to interpret the outcome of the complex mathematics \u2013 like Crick, she was working with nothing more than a slide rule and a pencil \u2013 but by 24 February, she had realised that DNA had a double helix structure and that the way the component nucleotides or bases on each strand were connected meant that the two strands were complementary, enabling the molecule to replicate.",
              "Above all, Franklin noted that \u2018an infinite variety of nucleotide sequences would be possible to explain the biological specificity of DNA\u2019, thereby showing that she had glimpsed the most decisive secret of DNA: the sequence of bases contains the genetic code.",
              "To prove her point, she would have to convert this insight into a precise, mathematically and chemically rigorous model.",
              "She did not get the chance to do this, because Watson and Crick had already crossed the finishing line \u2013 the Cambridge duo had rapidly interpreted the double helix structure in terms of precise spatial relationships and chemical bonds, through the construction of a physical model.",
              "In the middle of March 1953, Wilkins and Franklin were invited to Cambridge to see the model, and they immediately agreed it must be right.",
              "It was agreed that the model would be published solely as the work of Watson and Crick, while the supporting data would be published by Wilkins and Franklin \u2013 separately, of course.",

              "She never learned the full extent to which Watson and Crick had relied on her data to make their model;",
              "if she suspected, she did not express any bitterness or frustration, and in subsequent years she became very friendly with Crick and his wife, Odile.",
              "Our picture of how the structure of DNA was discovered, and the myth about Watson and Crick stealing Franklin\u2019s data, is almost entirely framed by Jim Watson\u2019s powerful and influential memoir, The Double Helix.",
              "Watson included frank descriptions of his own appalling attitude towards Franklin, whom he tended to dismiss, even down to calling her \u2018Rosy\u2019 in the pages of his book \u2013 a nickname she never used (her name was pronounced \u2018Ros-lind\u2019).",
              "The epilogue to the book, which is often overlooked in criticism of Watson\u2019s attitude to Franklin, contains a generous and fair description by Watson of Franklin\u2019s vital contribution and a recognition of his own failures with respect to her \u2013 including using her proper name.",
              "It is clear that, had Franklin lived, the Nobel prize committee ought to have awarded her a Nobel prize, too \u2013 her conceptual understanding of the structure of the DNA molecule and its significance was on a par with that of Watson and Crick, while her crystallographic data were as good as, if not better, than those of Wilkins.",
              "The simple expedient would have been to award Watson and Crick the prize for Physiology or Medicine, while Franklin and Watkins received the prize for Chemistry.",
              "Whether the committee would have been able to recognise Franklin\u2019s contribution is another matter.",

              "She displayed exceptional intelligence from early childhood, knowing from the age of 15 that she wanted to be a scientist.",
              "She received her education at several schools, including North London Collegiate School, where she excelled in science, among other things.",
              "Franklin enrolled at Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1938 and studied chemistry.",
              "In 1941, she was awarded Second Class Honors in her finals, which, at that time, was accepted as a bachelor's degree in the qualifications for employment.",
              "She went on to work as an assistant research officer at the British Coal Utilisation Research Association, where she studied the porosity of coal\u2014work that was the basis of her 1945 Ph.",

              "thesis \"The physical chemistry of solid organic colloids with special reference to coal.\"",
              "In the fall of 1946, Franklin was appointed at the Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'Etat in Paris, where she worked with crystallographer Jacques Mering.",
              "He taught her X-ray diffraction, which would play an important role in her research that led to the discovery of \"the secret of life\"\u2014the structure of DNA.",
              "In addition, Franklin pioneered the use of X-rays to create images of crystallized solids in analyzing complex, unorganized matter, not just single crystals.",
              "In January 1951, Franklin began working as a research associate at the King's College London in the biophysics unit, where director John Randall used her expertise and X-ray diffraction techniques (mostly of proteins and lipids in solution) on DNA fibers.",
              "Studying DNA structure with X-ray diffraction, Franklin and her student Raymond Gosling made an amazing discovery: They took pictures of DNA and discovered that there were two forms of it, a dry \"A\" form and a wet \"B\" form.",
              "One of their X-ray diffraction pictures of the \"B\" form of DNA, known as Photograph 51, became famous as critical evidence in identifying the structure of DNA.",
              "The photo was acquired through 100 hours of X-ray exposure from a machine Franklin herself had refined.",
              "John Desmond Bernal, one of the United Kingdom\u2019s most well-known and controversial scientists and a pioneer in X-ray crystallography, spoke highly of Franklin around the time of her death in 1958.",
              "\"As a scientist Miss Franklin was distinguished by extreme clarity and perfection in everything she undertook,\" he said.",
              "\"Her photographs were among the most beautiful X-ray photographs of any substance ever taken.",
              "Their excellence was the fruit of extreme care in preparation and mounting of the specimens as well as in the taking of the photographs.\"",
              "Despite her cautious and diligent work ethic, Franklin had a personality conflict with colleague Maurice Wilkins, one that would end up costing her greatly.",
              "In January 1953, Wilkins changed the course of DNA history by disclosing without Franklin's permission or knowledge her Photo 51 to competing scientist James Watson, who was working on his own DNA model with Francis Crick at Cambridge.",
              "Upon seeing the photograph, Watson said, \"My jaw fell open and my pulse began to race,\" according to author Brenda Maddox, who in 2002 wrote a book about Franklin titled Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA.",
              "The two scientists did, in fact, use what they saw in Photo 51 as the basis for their famous model of DNA, which they published on March 7, 1953, and for which they received a Nobel Prize in 1962.",
              "Crick and Watson were also able to take most of the credit for the finding: When publishing their model in Nature magazine in April 1953, they included a footnote acknowledging that they were \"stimulated by a general knowledge\" of Franklin's and Wilkins' unpublished contribution, when in fact, much of their work was rooted in Franklin's photo and findings.",
              "Randall and the Cambridge laboratory director came to an agreement, and both Wilkins' and Franklin's articles were published second and third in the same issue of Nature.",
              "Still, it appeared that their articles were merely supporting Crick and Watson's.",
              "According to Maddox, Franklin didn't know that these men based their Nature article on her research, and she didn't complain either, likely as a result of her upbringing.",

              "Because Randall let Franklin leave on the condition that she would not work on DNA, she turned her attention back to studies of coal.",
              "In five years, Franklin published 17 papers on viruses, and her group laid the foundations for structural virology.",
              "In the fall of 1956, Franklin discovered that she had ovarian cancer.",
