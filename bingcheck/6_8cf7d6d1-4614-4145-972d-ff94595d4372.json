    "query": "What is the exact process and mechanism behind our brain's ability to store and retrieve memories?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. The brain is a complex organ that controls thought, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, hunger and every process that regulates our body[^5^]. Memory is the faculty of the brain by which information is encoded (process often known as Learning), stored, and retrieved when needed[^1^]. Memory is vital to experiences and related to limbic systems, it is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action[^1^].\n\nMemory operates according to a \"dual-process,\" where more unconscious, more routine thought processes (known as \"System 1\") interact with more conscious, more problem-based thought processes (known as \"System 2\")[^6^]. System 1 is associated with memorization and recall of information, while System 2 describes more analytical or critical thinking[^6^].\n\nEncoding is the process of getting information into memory by transforming it into a form that can be stored. Storage is the process of maintaining information in memory over time. Retrieval or recall is the process of accessing and bringing back information from memory when needed[^6^].\n\nDifferent types of memory involve different parts of the brain. For example, declarative memory (memory for facts and events) involves the hippocampus and the temporal lobes, while procedural memory (memory for skills and habits) involves the basal ganglia and the cerebellum[^5^].\n\nThe brain sends and receives chemical and electrical signals throughout the body. Different signals control different processes, and your brain interprets each[^5^].",

              "This outcome shows the power of distinctiveness that we discussed in the section on encoding: one picture is perfectly recalled from among 99 words because it stands out.",

              "In this situation, the recognition test would likely produce better performance from participants than the recall test.",
              "We usually think of recognition tests as being quite easy, because the cue for retrieval is a copy of the actual event that was presented for study.",
              "After all, what could be a better cue than the exact target (memory) the person is trying to access?",
              "In most cases, this line of reasoning is true;",
              "nevertheless, recognition tests do not provide perfect indexes of what is stored in memory.",
              "That is, you can fail to recognize a target staring you right in the face, yet be able to recall it later with a different set of cues (Watkins & Tulving, 1975).",
              "For example, suppose you had the task of recognizing the surnames of famous authors.",
              "At first, you might think that being given the actual last name would always be the best cue.",

              "When given names such as Tolstoy, Shaw, Shakespeare, and Lee, subjects might well say that Tolstoy and Shakespeare are famous authors, whereas Shaw and Lee are not.",
              "But, when given a cued recall test using first names, people often recall items (produce them) that they had failed to recognize before.",
              "For example, in this instance, a cue like George Bernard ________ often leads to a recall of \u201cShaw,\u201d even though people initially failed to recognize Shaw as a famous author\u2019s name.",
              "Yet, when given the cue \u201cWilliam,\u201d people may not come up with Shakespeare, because William is a common name that matches many people (the cue overload principle at work).",
              "This strange fact\u2014that recall can sometimes lead to better performance than recognition\u2014can be explained by the encoding specificity principle.",
              "As a cue, George Bernard _________ matches the way the famous writer is stored in memory better than does his surname, Shaw, does (even though it is the target).",

              "Roediger & Karpicke, 2006).",
              "However, retrieving some information can actually cause us to forget other information related to it, a phenomenon called retrieval-induced forgetting (Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork, 1994).",
              "Thus the act of retrieval can be a double-edged sword\u2014strengthening the memory just retrieved (usually by a large amount) but harming related information (though this effect is often relatively small).",

              "Just as retrieval practice (repetition) enhances accurate memories, so will it strengthen errors or false memories (McDermott, 2006).",

              "To recap: to improve learning and memory, we need to encode information in conjunction with excellent cues that will bring back the remembered events when we need them.",
              "But how do we do this?",
              "Keep in mind the two critical principles we have discussed: to maximize retrieval, we should construct meaningful cues that remind us of the original experience, and those cues should be distinctive and not associated with other memories.",
              "These two conditions are critical in maximizing cue effectiveness (Nairne, 2002).",
              "So, how can these principles be adapted for use in many situations?",
              "Let\u2019s go back to how we started the module, with Simon Reinhard\u2019s ability to memorize huge numbers of digits.",
              "Although it was not obvious, he applied these same general memory principles, but in a more deliberate way.",
              "In fact, all mnemonic devices, or memory aids/tricks, rely on these fundamental principles.",
              "In a typical case, the person learns a set of cues and then applies these cues to learn and remember information.",
              "Consider the set of 20 items below that are easy to learn and remember (Bower & Reitman, 1972).",
              "It would probably take you less than 10 minutes to learn this list and practice recalling it several times (remember to use retrieval practice!)",
              ".",
              "If you were to do so, you would have a set of peg words on which you could \u201chang\u201d memories.",
              "In fact, this mnemonic device is called the peg word technique.",
              "If you then needed to remember some discrete items\u2014say a grocery list, or points you wanted to make in a speech\u2014this method would let you do so in a very precise yet flexible way.",
              "Suppose you had to remember bread, peanut butter, bananas, lettuce, and so on.",
              "The way to use the method is to form a vivid image of what you want to remember and imagine it interacting with your peg words (as many as you need).",
              "For example, for these items, you might imagine a large gun (the first peg word) shooting a loaf of bread, then a jar of peanut butter inside a shoe, then large bunches of bananas hanging from a tree, then a door slamming on a head of lettuce with leaves flying everywhere.",
              "The idea is to provide good, distinctive cues (the weirder the better!)",
              "for the information you need to remember while you are learning it.",
              "If you do this, then retrieving it later is relatively easy.",
              "You know your cues perfectly (one is gun, etc.)",
              ", so you simply go through your cue word list and \u201clook\u201d in your mind\u2019s eye at the image stored there (bread, in this case).",
              "This peg word method may sound strange at first, but it works quite well, even with little training (Roediger, 1980).",
              "One word of warning, though, is that the items to be remembered need to be presented relatively slowly at first, until you have practice associating each with its cue word.",
              "People get faster with time.",
              "Another interesting aspect of this technique is that it\u2019s just as easy to recall the items in backwards order as forwards.",
              "This is because the peg words provide direct access to the memorized items, regardless of order.",
              "How did Simon Reinhard remember those digits?",
              "Essentially he has a much more complex system based on these same principles.",
              "In his case, he uses \u201cmemory palaces\u201d (elaborate scenes with discrete places) combined with huge sets of images for digits.",
              "For example, imagine mentally walking through the home where you grew up and identifying as many distinct areas and objects as possible.",
              "Simon has hundreds of such memory palaces that he uses.",
              "Next, for remembering digits, he has memorized a set of 10,000 images.",
              "Every four-digit number for him immediately brings forth a mental image.",
              "So, for example, 6187 might recall Michael Jackson.",
              "When Simon hears all the numbers coming at him, he places an image for every four digits into locations in his memory palace.",
              "He can do this at an incredibly rapid rate, faster than 4 digits per 4 seconds when they are flashed visually, as in the demonstration at the beginning of the module.",
              "As noted, his record is 240 digits, recalled in exact order.",
              "Simon also holds the world record in an event called \u201cspeed cards,\u201d which involves memorizing the precise order of a shuffled deck of cards.",
              "Simon was able to do this in 21.",
              "19 seconds!",
              "Again, he uses his memory palaces, and he encodes groups of cards as single images.",
              "Many books exist on how to improve memory using mnemonic devices, but all involve forming distinctive encoding operations and then having an infallible set of memory cues.",
              "We should add that to develop and use these memory systems beyond the basic peg system outlined above takes a great amount of time and concentration.",
              "The World Memory Championships are held every year and the records keep improving.",
              "However, for most common purposes, just keep in mind that to remember well you need to encode information in a distinctive way and to have good cues for retrieval.",

              "How Memory Works | Derek Bok Center, Harvard University",
              "Memory is the ongoing process of information retention over time.",
              "Because it makes up the very framework through which we make sense of and take action within the present, its importance goes without saying.",
              "But how exactly does it work?",
              "And how can teachers apply a better understanding of its inner workings to their own teaching?",
              "In light of current research in cognitive science, the very, very short answer to these questions is that memory operates according to a \"dual-process,\" where more unconscious, more routine thought processes (known as \"System 1\") interact with more conscious, more problem-based thought processes (known as \"System 2\").",
              "At each of these two levels, in turn, there are the processes through which we \"get information in\" (encoding), how we hold on to it (storage), and and how we \"get it back out\" (retrieval or recall).",
              "With a basic understanding of how these elements of memory work together, teachers can maximize student learning by knowing how much new information to introduce, when to introduce it, and how to sequence assignments that will both reinforce the retention of facts (System 1) and build toward critical, creative thinking (System 2).",
              "Think back to a time when you learned a new skill, such as driving a car, riding a bicycle, or reading.",
              "When you first learned this skill, performing it was an active process in which you analyzed and were acutely aware of every movement you made.",
              "Part of this analytical process also meant that you thought carefully about why you were doing what you were doing, to understand how these individual steps fit together as a comprehensive whole.",
              "However, as your ability improved, performing the skill stopped being a cognitively-demanding process, instead becoming more intuitive.",
              "As you continue to master the skill, you can perform other, at times more intellectually-demanding, tasks simultaneously.",
              "Due to your knowledge of this skill or process being unconscious, you could, for example, solve an unrelated complex problem or make an analytical decision while completing it.",
              "In its simplest form, the scenario above is an example of what psychologists call dual-process theory.",
              "The term \u201cdual-process\u201d refers to the idea that some behaviors and cognitive processes (such as decision-making) are the products of two distinct cognitive processes, often called System 1 and System 2 (Kaufmann, 2011:443-445).",
              "While System 1 is characterized by automatic, unconscious thought, System 2 is characterized by effortful, analytical, intentional thought (Osman, 2004:989).",
              "How do System 1 and System 2 thinking relate to teaching and learning?",
              "In an educational context, System 1 is associated with memorization and recall of information, while System 2 describes more analytical or critical thinking.",
              "Memory and recall, as a part of System 1 cognition, are focused on in the rest of these notes.",
              "As mentioned above, System 1 is characterized by its fast, unconscious recall of previously-memorized information.",
              "Classroom activities that would draw heavily on System 1 include memorized multiplication tables, as well as multiple-choice exam questions that only need exact regurgitation from a source such as a textbook.",
              "These kinds of tasks do not require students to actively analyze what is being asked of them beyond reiterating memorized material.",
              "System 2 thinking becomes necessary when students are presented with activities and assignments that require them to provide a novel solution to a problem, engage in critical thinking, or apply a concept outside of the domain in which it was originally presented.",
              "It may be tempting to think of learning beyond the primary school level as being all about System 2, all the time.",
              "However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that successful System 2 thinking depends on a lot of System 1 thinking to operate.",
              "In other words, critical thinking requires a lot of memorized knowledge and intuitive, automatic judgments to be performed quickly and accurately.",
              "In its simplest form, memory refers to the continued process of information retention over time.",
              "It is an integral part of human cognition, since it allows individuals to recall and draw upon past events to frame their understanding of and behavior within the present.",
              "Memory also gives individuals a framework through which to make sense of the present and future.",
              "As such, memory plays a crucial role in teaching and learning.",
              "There are three main processes that characterize how memory works.",
              "These processes are encoding, storage, and retrieval (or recall).",
              "Retrieval is subject to error, because it can reflect a reconstruction of memory.",
              "This reconstruction becomes necessary when stored information is lost over time due to decayed retention.",
              "In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted an experiment in which he tested how well individuals remembered a list of nonsense syllables over increasingly longer periods of time.",
              "Using the results of his experiment, he created what is now known as the \u201cEbbinghaus Forgetting Curve\u201d (Schaefer, 2015).",
              "Through his research, Ebbinghaus concluded that the rate at which your memory (of recently learned information) decays depends both on the time that has elapsed following your learning experience as well as how strong your memory is.",
              "Some degree of memory decay is inevitable, so, as an educator, how do you reduce the scope of this memory loss?",
              "The following sections answer this question by looking at how to improve recall within a learning environment, through various teaching and learning techniques.",
              "As a teacher, it is important to be aware of techniques that you can use to promote better retention and recall among your students.",
              "Three such techniques are the testing effect, spacing, and interleaving.",
              "As useful as it is to know which techniques you can use, as a teacher, to improve student recall of information, it is also crucial for students to be aware of techniques they can use to improve their own recall.",
              "This section looks at four of these techniques: state-dependent memory, schemas, chunking, and deliberate practice.",

              "This neural system encompasses the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and other structures, all working together to manage emotional responses, especially those tied to survival instincts, social bonding, and memory consolidation.",
              "These functions include but are not limited to emotional processing, memory formation, motivation, and the regulation of essential physiological functions such as stress responses, feeding, reproduction, and the fight or flight response.",
              "The limbic system is located within the cerebrum of the brain, immediately below the temporal lobes, and buried under the cerebral cortex (the cortex is the outermost part of the brain).",
              "The limbic system was originally called the rhinencephalon (meaning \u2018smell brain\u2019) because it was thought to primarily involve the sense of smell.",
              "Psychologists now recognize that the limbic system serves many more functions than previously believed.",
              "These structures are known to be involved in processing and regulating emotions, forming and storing memories, sexual arousal, and learning.",
              "The limbic system is thought to be an important element in the body\u2019s response to stress, being highly connected to the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems. The nerve cells (neurons) within the limbic system are structured differently from those in the cerebral cortex.",
              "In the cerebral cortex, the cells are primarily neocortical, meaning they are formed into six layers.",
              "Within the limbic system, the cells are either arranged in fewer layers or are more jumbled.",
              "As there is less complexity of the cells within the limbic system, this has led people to believe that this system is evolutionarily older than the cerebral cortex itself.",
              "There are two hippocampi located in each hemisphere of the brain.",
              "They are seahorse-shaped and are structures mainly associated with being the memory centers of our brains.",
              "Episodic memories are formed in the hippocampus and then filed away into long-term storage throughout other parts of the cerebral cortex.",
              "The hippocampus plays a role in spatial navigation and has also been associated with learning and emotions (Tyng, Amin, Saad, & Malik, 2017).",

              "Damage can also be detrimental to spatial memory, for instance, remembering directions to locations that should be familiar to the individual.",
              "Damage to the hippocampus can disrupt cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and spatial navigation and contribute to dementia symptoms like memory loss, disorientation, and confusion (Gulyaeva, 2019) In Parkinson\u2019s disease, hippocampus damage can worsen cognitive symptoms like executive dysfunction, visual-spatial deficits, and memory problems that many patients experience (Xie et al.",

              "A review of 92 putative definitions and nine skeptical statements (Kleinginna and Kleinginna, 1981) suggests a definition with a rather broad consensus: Although this definition may be adequate for everyday purposes, it does not encompass some important aspects of emotional systems such as how emotions operate to create subjectively experienced feelings and how they control personality dimensions.",
              "Accordingly, Panksepp (1998) suggested the following: He went further to propose seven primary emotional systems/prototype emotional states, namely SEEKING, RAGE, FEAR, LUST, CARE, PANIC/GRIEF, and PLAY that represent basic foundations for living and learning.",
              "Moods last longer than emotions, which are also characterized by positive and negative moods.",
              "In contrast, feelings refer to mental experiences that are necessarily valence, either good or bad as well as accompanied by internal physiological changes in the body, specifically the viscera, including the heart, lungs, and gut, for maintaining or restoring homeostatic balances.",
              "Feelings are not commonly caused emotions.",
              "Because the generation of emotional feelings requires a neural re-mapping of different features of the body state in the CNS, resulting from cognitive \u201cappraisal\u201d where the anterior insular cortex plays a key integrative role (Craig and Craig, 2009;",
              "Damasio and Carvalho, 2013).",
              "Nonetheless, Panksepp (2005) has defended the view that emotional operating systems (caudal and medial subcortical brain regions) appeared to generate emotional experiences via localized electrical stimulation of the brain stimulation (ESB) rather dependent on changes of the external environment or bodily states.",
              "Affects are subjective experienced emotional feelings that are difficult to describe, but have been linked to bodily states such as homeostatic drives (hunger and thirst) and external stimuli (visual, auditory, taste, touch, smell) (Panksepp, 2005).",
              "The latter are sometimes called \u201ccore affect,\u201d which refers to consciously accessible elemental processes involving pleasure and arousal that span bipolar dimensions (Russell and Barrett, 1999).",

              "\u201d In brief, a crucial characteristic shared by emotion, mood, feeling, affect and drive is their intrinsic valence, which lies on the spectrum of positive and negative valence (pleasure-displeasure/goodness-badness).",
              "The term emotion exemplifies the \u201cumbrella\u201d concept that includes affective, cognitive, behavioral, expressive and physiological changes;",
              "emotion is triggered by external stimuli and associated with the combination of feeling and motivation.",
              "The impact of emotion on learning processes is the focus of many current studies.",
              "Although it is well established that emotions influence memory retention and recall, in terms of learning, the question of emotional impacts remains questionable.",
              "Some studies report that positive emotions facilitate learning and contribute to academic achievement, being mediated by the levels of self-motivation and satisfaction with learning materials (Um et al.",
              ", 2012).",
              "Conversely, a recent study reported that negative learning-centered state (confusion) improve learning because of an increased focus of attention on learning material that leads to higher performances on post tests and transfer tests (D\u2019Mello et al.",
              ", 2014).",
              "Confusion is not an emotion but a cognitive disequilibrium state induced by contradictory data.",
              "A confused student might be frustrated with their poor understanding of subject matter, and this is related to both the SEEKING and RAGE systems, with a low-level of activation of rage or irritation, and amplification of SEEKING.",
              "Hence, motivated students who respond to their confusion seek new understanding by doing additional cognitive work.",
              "Further clarification of this enhances learning.",
              "Moreover, stress, a negative emotional state, has also been reported to facilitate and/or impair both learning and memory, depending on intensity and duration (Vogel and Schwabe, 2016).",
              "More specifically, mild and acute stress facilitates learning and cognitive performance, while excess and chronic stress impairs learning and is detrimental to memory performance.",
              "Many other negative consequences attend owing to overactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which results in both impaired synaptic plasticity and learning ability (Joe\u0308ls et al.",
              ", 2004).",
              "Nonetheless, confounding influences of emotions on learning and memory can be explained in terms of attentional and motivational components.",
              "Attentional components enhance perceptual processing, which then helps to select and organize salient information via a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach to higher brain functions and awareness (Vuilleumier, 2005).",
              "Motivational components induce curiosity, which is a state associated with psychological interest in novel and/or surprising activities (stimuli).",
              "A curiosity state encourages further exploration and apparently prepares the brain to learn and remember in both children and adults (Oudeyer et al.",
              ", 2016).",
              "The term \u201csurprising\u201d might be conceptualized as an incongruous situation (expectancy violation) refers to a discrepancy between prior expectations and the new information;",
              "it may drive a cognitive reset for \u201clearned content\u201d that draws one\u2019s attention.",
              "Similarly, emotionally enhanced memory functions have been reported in relation to selective attention elicited by emotionally salient stimuli (Vuilleumier, 2005;",
              "Schupp et al.",
              ", 2007).",
              "During the initial perceptual stage, attention is biased toward emotionally salient information that supports detection by the salient input.",
              "Thus, stimulating selective attention increases the likelihood for emotional information to become encoded in LTM storage associated with a top-down control in sensory pathways that are modulated by the frontal and parietal cortices.",
              "This is an example of an indirect influence on perception and attention that regulates selective sensory processing and behavioral determination (Vuilleumier, 2005).",
              "Because the human sensory systems have no capacity to simultaneously process everything at once, which necessitates attentional mechanisms. Top-down attentional processing obtains adequate attentional resource allocation to process emotional valence information for encoding and retrieval via cooperation with the brain regions such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus, along with the primary visual cortex (helps to realize both emotion and conceptualization).",
              "Similarly, experimental studies have examined the phenomenon by using various attentional tasks, including filtering (dichotic listening and Stroop task), search (visual search), cuing (attentional probe, spatial cuing) and attentional blink [rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)] paradigms (Yiend, 2010).",
              "These investigations demonstrated biased attentional processing toward emotionally stimulating material content attended by increased sensory responses.",
              "One study reported that emotional stimuli induce a \u201cpop-out\u201d effect that leads to the attentional capture and privileged processing (O\u0308hman et al.",
              ", 2001).",
              "Moreover, a study using the RSVP paradigm compared healthy subjects with a group of patients with bilateral amygdala damage.",
              "The results revealed that healthy subjects exhibited increased perception and attention toward emotional words compared to patients, indicating that the amygdala plays a crucial role in emotional processing (Anderson and Phelps, 2001).",
              "In addition, functional neuroimaging showed that the insular cortex, the secondary somatosensory cortex, the cingulate cortex and nuclei in the tegmentum and hypothalamus are the brain regions that regulate attentional focus by integrating external and internal inputs to create emotional feeling states, thus modulating a motivational state that obtains homeostasis (Damasio et al.",
              ", 2000).",

              "Thus, several issues should take into consideration: (i) methodological issues to assess hemispheric asymmetry, including requires repeat measures of anterior asymmetry for at least two sessions, stimulus content should comprise both positive valence and negative valence while maintaining at a similar level of arousal and with a baseline resting condition, appropriate selection of reference electrode and individual differences, etc;",

              "Appropriate screening with psychological testing as well as balancing experimental cohorts in terms of sex can help reduce spurious results owing to individual differences.",
              "Studies have also shown that older adults are associated with the greater familiarity with psychological stress and emotional experiences, thus causing positivity biases in emotional processing and better emotional control than in younger adults (Urry and Gross, 2010;",
              "Allard and Kensinger, 2014).",
              "Consequently, the age of participants in a sample population should be considered for both cognitive and emotional studies.",
              "The selection of emotional stimuli for experimental studies is generally divided into two streams: (1) discrete emotional, and (2) dimensional emotions of valence, arousal, dominance and familiarity (Russell, 1980;",
              "Barrett, 1998).",
              "The latter include pictures from the IAPS database and words from the ANEW database, which are both available for non-commercial research.",
              "Appropriate selection of emotional stimuli is another important consideration that ensures experimental tasks are suitable for the investigation of emotional processing in learning and memory.",
              "Furthermore, the type of stimulus determines stimulus presentation duration, especially for experimental tasks involving the induction of emotions.",
              "There are numerous self-assessment techniques used to measure individual emotional states (Bradley and Lang, 1994).",
              "The most widely used techniques are the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), the Semantic Differential (SD) scale, and the Likert scale.",
              "The SAM is a non-verbal pictorial assessment technique directly measures emotional responses to emotional stimuli for valence, arousal, and dominance.",
              "The SD scale consists of a set of bipolar adjective pairs for the subjective rating of image stimuli.",
              "The Likert\u2019s \u201cx-point\u201d scale allows participants to rate their own emotional responses.",
              "If a study does not seek to assess distinct emotional states but rather involves the assessment of two primary dimensions of emotion (positive and negative valence), then the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a recommended method (Watson et al.",
              ", 1988).",
              "Thus, selection of the most appropriate self-assessment technique is an important part of the experimental design but can also become an overwhelming task.",
              "As mentioned above, the two major types of brain imaging techniques EEG (direct) and fMRI/PET/fNIRS (indirect) have respective advantages and disadvantages.",
              "To overcome these limitations, simultaneous or combined dual-modality imaging (EEG-fMRI or EEG-fNIRS) can now be implemented for complementary data collection.",
              "Although functional neuroimaging works to identify the neural correlates of emotional states, technologies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and connectivity maps might provide new opportunities to seek understanding of emotions and its corresponding psychological responses.",
              "The neuroscience of cognition and emotion requires appropriate task designs to accomplish specific study objectives (Amin and Malik, 2013).",
              "Environmental factors, ethical issues, memory paradigms, cognitive task difficulty, and emotional induction task intensity must be considered for this.",
              "Numerous neuroimaging studies cited thus far have indicated that emotions influence memory processes, to include memory encoding, memory consolidation, and memory retrieval.",
              "Emotional attentional and motivational components might explain why emotional content exhibits privileged information processing.",
              "Emotion has a \u201cpop-out\u201d effect that increases attention and promotes bottom-up instinctual impact that enhances awareness.",
              "Significant emotional modulation affects memory consolidation in the amygdala, and emotional content also appears to mediate memory encoding and retrieval in the PFC, leading to slow rates of memory lapse accompanied by the accurate recall.",
              "Moreover, cognitive and emotional interactions also appear to modulate additional memory-related CNS regions, such as the frontal, posterior parietal and visual cortices.",
              "The latter are involved in attentional control, association information, and the processing of visual information, respectively.",
              "Therefore, higher-level cognitive functions such as learning and memory, appear to be generally guided by emotion, as outlined in the Panksepp\u2019s framework of brain processing (Panksepp, 1998).",
              "Neuroimaging findings also indicate the involvement of the PFC in emotional processing by indirectly influencing WM and semantic memory (Kensinger and Corkin, 2003).",
              "This is reflected by the involvement of the DLPFC in WM and the role played by VLPFC in semantic processing, both of which have been found to enhance or impair semantic encoding task performance when emotion is involved.",
              "Various parts of the lateral PFC (ventrolateral, dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortical regions) are suspected of having key roles that support memory retrieval (Simons and Spiers, 2003).",
              "All of these findings suggest that PFC-MTL interactions underlie effective semantic memory encoding and thus strategically mediate information processing with increased transfer to the hippocampus, consequently enhancing memory retrieval.",
              "Accordingly, learning strategies that emphasize emotional factors are more likely to result in long-term knowledge retention.",
              "This consideration is potentially useful in the design of educational materials for academic settings and informed intelligent tutoring systems. Based on numerous previous findings, future research might take emotional factors more seriously and more explicitly in terms of their potential impact on learning.",
              "By monitoring the emotional state of students, the utilization of scientifically derived knowledge of stimulus selection can be particularly useful in the identification of emotional states that advance learning performance and outcomes in educational settings.",
              "Moreover, functional neuroimaging investigations now include single and/or combined modalities that obtain complementary datasets that inform a more comprehensive overview of neuronal activity in its entirety.",
              "For example, curiosity and motivation promote learning, as it appears cognitive network become energized by the mesolimbic-mesocortical dopamine system (generalized motivational arousal/SEEKING system).",
              "In addition, the identification of emotional impact on learning and memory potentially has direct implications for healthy individuals as well as patients with psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism, mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Panksepp, 2011a).",
              "To emphasize, depression and anxiety are the two most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders associated with learning/memory impairment and pose negative consequences that (i) limit the total amount of information that can otherwise be learned, and (ii) inhibit immediate recall as well as memory retention and retrieval of newly learned information.",
              "Depression and anxiety are also associated with negative emotions such as hopelessness, anxiety, apathy, attention deficit, lack of motivation, and motor and mental insufficiencies.",
              "Likewise, neuroscience studies report that decreased activation of the dorsal limbic (the anterior and posterior cingulate) as well as in the prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortices causes attentional disturbance, while increased neural activation in the ventral paralimbic region (the subgenual cingulate, anterior insula, hypothalamus and caudate) is associated with emotional and motivational disorders (Mayberg, 1997).",
              "Substantial evidence has established that emotional events are remembered more clearly, accurately and for longer periods of time than are neutral events.",
              "Emotional memory enhancement appears to involve the integration of cognitive and emotional neural networks, in which activation of the amygdala enhances the processing of emotionally arousing stimuli while also modulating enhanced memory consolidation along with other memory-related brain regions, particularly the amygdala, hippocampus, MTL, as well as the visual, frontal and parietal cortices.",
              "Similarly, activation of the PFC enhances cognitive functions, such as strategic and semantic processing that affect WM and also promote the establishment of LTM.",
              "Previous studies have primarily used standardized emotional visual, or auditory stimuli such as pictures, words, facial expression, and film clips, often based on the IAPS, ANEW, and POFA databases for emotional pictures, words and facial expressions, respectively.",
              "Further studies have typically focused on the way individuals memorize (intentional or incidental episodic memory paradigm) emotional stimuli in controlled laboratory settings.",
              "To our knowledge, there are few objective studies that employed brain-mapping techniques to examine semantic memory of learning materials (using subject matter) in the education context.",
              "Furthermore, influences derived from emotional factors in human learning and memory remains unclear as to whether positive emotions facilitate learning or negative emotions impair learning and vice versa.",
              "Thus, several remaining questions should be addressed in future studies, including (i) the impact of emotion on semantic knowledge encoding and retrieval, (ii) psychological and physiological changes associated with semantic learning and memory, and (iii) the development of methods that incorporate emotional and motivational aspects that improve educational praxes, outcomes, and instruments.",
              "The results of studies on emotion using educational learning materials can indeed provide beneficial information for informed designs of new educational courses that obtain more effective teaching and help establish better informed learning environments.",
              "Hence, to understand how emotion influence learning and memory requires understanding of an evolutionary consideration of the nested hierarchies of CNS emotional-affective processes as well as a large-scale network, including the midbrain\u2019s PAG and VTA, basal ganglia (amygdala and NAc), and insula, as well as diencephalon (the cingulate and medial frontal cortices through the lateral and medial hypothalamus and medial thalamus) together with the MTL, including the hippocampus as well as the entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortices that responsible for declarative memories.",
              "Moreover, the SEEKING system generates positive subjective emotional states-positive expectancy, enthusiastic exploration, and hopefulness, apparently, initiates learning and memory in the brain.",

              "In psychology, a dual process theory provides an account of how thought can arise in two different ways, or as a result of two different processes.",
              "Often, the two processes consist of an implicit (automatic), unconscious process and an explicit (controlled), conscious process.",
              "Verbalized explicit processes or attitudes and actions may change with persuasion or education;",
              "though implicit process or attitudes usually take a long amount of time to change with the forming of new habits.",
              "Dual process theories can be found in social, personality, cognitive, and clinical psychology.",
              "It has also been linked with economics via prospect theory and behavioral economics, and increasingly in sociology through cultural analysis.",
              "[1][2] The foundations of dual process theory likely come from William James.",
              "He believed that there were two different kinds of thinking: associative and true reasoning.",
              "James theorized that empirical thought was used for things like art and design work.",
              "For James, images and thoughts would come to mind of past experiences, providing ideas of comparison or abstractions.",
              "He claimed that associative knowledge was only from past experiences describing it as \"only reproductive\".",
              "James believed that true reasoning could enable overcoming \u201cunprecedented situations\u201d just as a map could enable navigating past obstacles.",
              "There are various dual process theories that were produced after William James's work.",
              "Dual process models are very common in the study of social psychological variables, such as attitude change.",
              "Examples include Petty and Cacioppo's elaboration likelihood model (explained below) and Chaiken's heuristic systematic model.",
              "According to these models, persuasion may occur after either intense scrutiny or extremely superficial thinking.",
              "In cognitive psychology, attention and working memory have also been conceptualized as relying on two distinct processes.",
              "[3] Whether the focus be on social psychology or cognitive psychology, there are many examples of dual process theories produced throughout the past.",

              "He suggested that during heuristic processes, an individual chooses which information is relevant to the current situation.",
              "Relevant information is then processed further whereas irrelevant information is not.",
              "Following the heuristic processes come analytic processes.",
              "During analytic processes, the relevant information that is chosen during the heuristic processes is then used to make judgments about the situation.",

              "Their theory is called the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion.",
              "In their theory, there are two different routes to persuasion in making decisions.",
              "The first route is known as the central route and this takes place when a person is thinking carefully about a situation, elaborating on the information they are given, and creating an argument.",
              "This route occurs when an individual's motivation and ability are high.",
              "The second route is known as the peripheral route and this takes place when a person is not thinking carefully about a situation and uses shortcuts to make judgments.",
              "This route occurs when an individual's motivation or ability are low.",
              "[6] Steven Sloman produced another interpretation on dual processing in 1996.",
              "He believed that associative reasoning takes stimuli and divides it into logical clusters of information based on statistical regularity.",
              "He proposed that how you associate is directly proportional to the similarity of past experiences, relying on temporal and similarity relations to determine reasoning rather than an underlying mechanical structure.",
              "The other reasoning process in Sloman's opinion was of the Rule-based system.",
              "The system functioned on logical structure and variables based upon rule systems to come to conclusions different from that of the associative system.",
              "He also believed that the Rule-based system had control over the associative system, though it could only suppress it.",
              "[7] This interpretation corresponds well to earlier work on computational models of dual processes of reasoning.",
              "[8] Daniel Kahneman provided further interpretation by differentiating the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning in 2003.",
              "Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process.",
              "Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate.",
              "Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.",
              "[9] Fritz Strack and Roland Deutsch proposed another dual process theory focused in the field of social psychology in 2004.",
              "According to their model, there are two separate systems: the reflective system and the impulsive system.",
              "In the reflective system, decisions are made using knowledge and the information that is coming in from the situation is processed.",
              "On the other hand, in the impulsive system, decisions are made using schemes and there is little or no thought required.",
              "[10] Ron Sun proposed a dual-process model of learning (both implicit learning and explicit learning).",
              "The model (named CLARION) re-interpreted voluminous behavioral data in psychological studies of implicit learning and skill acquisition in general.",
              "The resulting theory is two-level and interactive, based on the idea of the interaction of one-shot explicit rule learning (i.",
              "e., explicit learning) and gradual implicit tuning through reinforcement (i.",
              "e. implicit learning), and it accounts for many previously unexplained cognitive data and phenomena based on the interaction of implicit and explicit learning.",
              "[11] The Dual Process Learning model can be applied to a group-learning environment.",
              "This is called The Dual Objective Model of Cooperative Learning and it requires a group practice that consists of both cognitive and affective skills among the team.",
              "[12] It involves active participation by the teacher to monitor the group throughout its entirety until the product has been successfully completed.",
              "[12] The teacher focuses on the effectiveness of cognitive and affective practices within the group's cooperative learning environment.",
              "The instructor acts as an aide to the group by encouraging their positive affective behavior and ideas.",
              "In addition, the teacher remains, continually watching for improvement in the group's development of the product and interactions amongst the students.",
              "The teacher will interject to give feedback on ways the students can better contribute affectively or cognitively to the group as a whole.",
              "The goal is to foster a sense of community amongst the group while creating a proficient product that is a culmination of each student's unique ideas.",
              "[12] Using a somewhat different approach, Allan Paivio has developed a dual-coding theory of information processing.",
              "According to this model, cognition involves the coordinated activity of two independent, but connected systems, a nonverbal system and a verbal system that is specialized to deal with language.",
              "The nonverbal system is hypothesized to have developed earlier in evolution.",
              "Both systems rely on different areas of the brain.",
              "Paivio has reported evidence that nonverbal, visual images are processed more efficiently and are approximately twice as memorable.",
              "Additionally, the verbal and nonverbal systems are additive, so one can improve memory by using both types of information during learning.",
              "[13] This additive dual coding claim is compatible with evidence that verbalized thinking does not necessarily overcome common faulty intuitions or heuristics, such as studies showing that thinking aloud during heuristics and biases tests did not necessarily improve performance on the test.",
              "[14] Dual-process accounts of reasoning postulate that there are two systems or minds in one brain.",
              "A current theory is that there are two cognitive systems underlying thinking and reasoning and that these different systems were developed through evolution.",
              "[15] These systems are often referred to as \"implicit\" and \"explicit\" or by the more neutral \"System 1\" and \"System 2\", as coined by Keith Stanovich and Richard West.",
              "[16] The systems have multiple names by which they can be called, as well as many different properties.",
              "John Bargh reconceptualized the notion of an automatic process by breaking down the term \"automatic\" into four components: awareness, intentionality, efficiency, and controllability.",
              "One way for a process to be labeled as automatic is for the person to be unaware of it.",
              "There are three ways in which a person may be unaware of a mental process: they can be unaware of the presence of the stimulus (subliminal), how the stimulus is categorized or interpreted (unaware of the activation of stereotype or trait constructs), or the effect the stimulus has on the person's judgments or actions (misattribution).",
              "Another way for a mental process to be labeled as automatic is for it to be unintentional.",
              "Intentionality refers to the conscious \"start up\" of a process.",
              "An automatic process may begin without the person consciously willing it to start.",
              "The third component of automaticity is efficiency.",
              "Efficiency refers to the amount of cognitive resources required for a process.",
              "An automatic process is efficient because it requires few resources.",
              "The fourth component is controllability, referring to the person's conscious ability to stop a process.",
              "An automatic process is uncontrollable, meaning that the process will run until completion and the person will not be able to stop it.",
              "Bargh conceptualized automaticity as a component view (any combination awareness, intention, efficiency, and control) as opposed to the historical concept of automaticity as an all-or-none dichotomy.",
              "[17] One takeaway from the psychological research on dual process theory is that our System 1 (intuition) is more accurate in areas where we\u2019ve gathered a lot of data with reliable and fast feedback, like social dynamics,[18] or even cognitive domains in which we've become expert or even merely familiar.",
              "[19] System 2 is evolutionarily recent and speculated as specific to humans.",
              "It is also known as the explicit system, the rule-based system, the rational system,[15] or the analytic system.",
              "[20] It performs the more slow and sequential thinking.",
              "It is domain-general, performed in the central working memory system.",
              "Because of this, it has a limited capacity and is slower than System 1 which correlates it with general intelligence.",
              "It is known as the rational system because it reasons according to logical standards.",
              "[20] Some overall properties associated with System 2 are that it is rule-based, analytic, controlled, demanding of cognitive capacity, and slow.",
              "[15] The dual process has impact on social psychology in such domains as stereotyping, categorization, and judgment.",
              "Especially, the study of automaticity and of implicit in dual process theories has the most influence on a person's perception.",
              "People usually perceive other people's information and categorize them by age, gender, race, or role.",
              "According to Neuberg and Fiske (1987) a perceiver who receives a good amount of information about the target person then will use their formal mental category (Unconscious) as a basis for judging the person.",
              "When the perceiver is distracted, the perceiver has to pay more attention to target information (Conscious).",
              "[21] Categorization is the basic process of stereotyping in which people are categorized into social groups that have specific stereotypes associated with them.",
              "[22] It is able to retrieve people's judgment automatically without subjective intention or effort.",
              "Attitude can also be activated spontaneously by the object.",
              "John Bargh's study offered an alternative view, holding that essentially all attitudes, even weak ones are capable of automatic activation.",
              "Whether the attitude is formed automatically or operates with effort and control, it can still bias further processing of information about the object and direct the perceivers' actions with regard to the target.",
              "According to Shelly Chaiken, heuristic processing is the activation and application of judgmental rules and heuristics are presumed to be learned and stored in memory.",
              "It is used when people are making accessible decisions such as \"experts are always right\" (system 1) and systematic processing is inactive when individuals make effortful scrutiny of all the relevant information which requires cognitive thinking (system 2).",
              "[23] The heuristic and systematic processing then influence the domain of attitude change and social influence.",
              "Unconscious thought theory is the counterintuitive and contested view that the unconscious mind is adapted to highly complex decision making.",
              "Where most dual system models define complex reasoning as the domain of effortful conscious thought, UTT argues complex issues are best dealt with unconsciously.",
              "[citation needed] Dual process models of stereotyping propose that when we perceive an individual, salient stereotypes pertaining to them are activated automatically.",
              "These activated representations will then guide behavior if no other motivation or cognition take place.",
              "However, controlled cognitive processes can inhibit the use of stereotypes when there is motivation and cognitive resources to do so.",
              "Devine (1989) provided evidence for the dual process theory of stereotyping in a series of three studies.",
              "Study 1 linked found prejudice (according to the Modern Racism Scale) was unrelated to knowledge of cultural stereotypes of African Americans.",
              "Study 2 showed that subjects used automatically activated stereotypes in judgments regardless of prejudice level (personal belief).",
              "Participants were primed with stereotype relevant or non-relevant words and then asked to give hostility ratings of a target with an unspecified race who was performing ambiguously hostile behaviors.",
              "Regardless of prejudice level, participants who were primed with more stereotype-relevant words gave higher hostility ratings to the ambiguous target.",
              "Study 3 investigated whether people can control stereotype use by activating personal beliefs.",
              "Low-prejudice participants asked to list African Americans listed more positive examples than did those high in prejudice.",
              "[24] According to psychologists Pyszczynski, Greenberg, & Solomon, the dual process model, in relation to terror management theory, identifies two systems by which the brain manages fear of death: distal and proximal.",
              "[25] Distal defenses fall under the system 1 category because it is unconscious whereas proximal defenses fall under the system 2 category because it operates with conscious thought.",
              "However, recent work by the ManyLabs[26] project has shown that the mortality salience effect (e.",
              "g., reflecting on one's own death encouraging a greater defense of one's own worldview) has failed to replicate (ManyLabs attempt to replicate a seminal theoretical finding across multiple laboratories -- in this case some of these labs included input from the original terror management theorists.)",
              "Habituation can be described as decreased response to a repeated stimulus.",
              "According to Groves and Thompson, the process of habituation also mimics a dual process.",
              "The dual process theory of behavioral habituation relies on two underlying (non-behavioral) processes;",
              "depression and facilitation with the relative strength of one over the other determining whether or not habituation or sensitization is seen in the behavior.",
              "Habituation weakens the intensity of a repeated stimulus over time subconsciously.",
              "As a result, a person will give the stimulus less conscious attention over time.",
              "Conversely, sensitization subconsciously strengthens a stimulus over time, giving the stimulus more conscious attention.",
              "Though these two systems are not both conscious, they interact to help people understand their surroundings by strengthening some stimuli and diminishing others.",
              "[27] According to Walker, system 1 functions as a serial cognitive steering processor for system 2, rather than a parallel system.",
              "In large-scale repeated studies with school students, Walker tested how students adjusted their imagined self-operation in different curriculum subjects of maths, science and English.",
              "He showed that students consistently adjust the biases of their heuristic self-representation to specific states for the different curriculum subjects.",
              "[28] The model of cognitive steering proposes that, in order to process epistemically varied environmental data, a heuristic orientation system is required to align varied, incoming environmental data with existing neural algorithmic processes.",
              "The brain's associative simulation capacity, centered around the imagination, plays an integrator role to perform this function.",
              "Evidence for early-stage concept formation and future self-operation within the hippocampus supports the model,.",
              "[29][30] In the cognitive steering model, a conscious state emerges from effortful associative simulation, required to align novel data accurately with remote memory, via later algorithmic processes.",
              "By contrast, fast unconscious automaticity is constituted by unregulated simulatory biases, which induce errors in subsequent algorithmic processes.",
              "The phrase \u2018rubbish in, rubbish out' is used to explain errorful heuristic processing: errors will always occur if the accuracy of initial retrieval and location of data is poorly self-regulated.",
              "According to Alos-Ferrer and Strack the dual-process theory has relevance in economic decision-making through the multiple-selves model, in which one person's self-concept is composed of multiple selves depending on the context.",
              "An example of this is someone who as a student is hard working and intelligent, but as a sibling is caring and supportive.",

Rather, Kahneman used the two systems as a metaphor.",
              "But this caveat raises the question: What exactly is being described here?",
              "Indeed, if you know the literature, you know that many scholars have proposed different terms for these cognitive processes.",
              "In addition to Kahneman's System 1 and System 2, we have Freud's primary and secondary, Keith Stanovich advocates for Type 1 and Type 2, and many in cognitive science use \"automatic\" versus \"deliberate\" or \"controlled.\"",
              "This diversity of framing is consistent with a central point we have repeatedly made in our work together: there is much confusion and equivocation regarding the meaning of cognitive and the ontology of the mental and we need big picture perspectives to sort out the confusion.",

              "Over the last two years, we have found that they work together in a highly synergistic fashion.",
              "Interestingly, when we combine our metatheoretical viewpoints and look at the System 1 and 2 versus Type 1 and 2 terminologies, a new picture emerges.",
              "Specifically, we contend that it makes sense to divide human mental processes into two different types and two different systems. To see the two types of cognitive processes, we can use Vervaeke\u2019s metatheory of cognition.",
              "As described in this post, Vervaeke has posited a general model of cognition framed as the 3 Rs of recursive relevance realization.",
              "The short summary is that the mind works to scan the inputs for relevant information and then moves to realize both what is the case and what paths of action can be taken.",
              "In addition, there is a secondary recursive process that functions to place a check on the initial grip that the relevance realization process forms on the situation.",
              "This recursive process can then update the initial inference based on how it conforms to anticipated expectations and based on how it aligns with other modeling processes held in the mind.",
              "Applying Vervaeke\u2019s frame to the dual processing model, we can suggest that the initial sizing up of relevance to be realized can be framed as Type 1 processes.",
              "That is, when confronted with a scene or set of stimuli, there are a group of primary cognitive processes that are quickly making inferences about what is relevant and try to \u201crealize\u201d a match between the model it initially makes and the incoming information.",
              "Then there are Type 2 secondary recursive processes that operate to check the match and align it with other mental models.",
              "These Type 2 recursions come online if the first type of processing results in an unexpected surprise or if it conflicts with other models.",
              "As such, they function as a kind of deliberative and corrective process.",
              "It is helpful to note that Keith Stanovich, who emphasized the Type 1 versus Type 2 terminology, proposed that the defining difference between Type 1 and Type 2 processes is that the latter involves working memory2.",
              "Given the work of Hasher and others that working memory is a higher-order relevance filter where we can perform chunking and do counterfactual simulations of things, it makes sense to see working memory as an important hub of recursive relevance realization3.",
              "We also see that there is no clear dividing line between Type 1 and Type 2 processes, but a continuum of increasing demand placed on working memory.",
              "Such a continuum is less consistent with the idea of distinct systems. Thus, when we look at dual processing through the lens of Vervaeke\u2019s model, we can see why a more accurate nomenclature is the Type 1 versus Type 2 processes.",
              "However, there is another angle provided by Henriques' work on the Unified Theory of Knowledge (UTOK)5 that can validate the System 1 versus System 2 distinction.",

              "Via Justification Systems Theory7, UTOK posits that we should think of the human ego as a mental organ of justification that evolves in response to the evolution of propositional language and the resulting question-answer dynamics of justification that emerge with it.",
              "UTOK\u2019s model of human psychology thus posits that humans have a primary animal-mammal-primate system of nonverbal cognition and a secondary, self-conscious, justifying mind that is a propositional knowing system that allows us to navigate the Culture-Person plane of existence.",
              "As such, the primate-experiential system can be framed as \u201cSystem 1\u201d and the person-propositional system as \u201cSystem 2\u201d.",

              "When Henriques' analysis is placed in relation to the set of analyses framed by Vervaeke\u2019s theory of recursive relevance realization, we can see that both types of cognitive processes would be present in both systems. That is, there are Type 1 (relevance realizing) and Type 2 (recursive checking) processes in both System 1 (primate-experiential) and System 2 (justifying person).",
              "In this analysis, the example of the ball and bat would be processed in System 2 because it is propositional, but the conclusion that the bat is $1 is a function of Type 1 processes in System 2.",

              "How Memory Works | Derek Bok Center, Harvard University",
              "Memory is the ongoing process of information retention over time.",
              "Because it makes up the very framework through which we make sense of and take action within the present, its importance goes without saying.",
              "But how exactly does it work?",
              "And how can teachers apply a better understanding of its inner workings to their own teaching?",
              "In light of current research in cognitive science, the very, very short answer to these questions is that memory operates according to a \"dual-process,\" where more unconscious, more routine thought processes (known as \"System 1\") interact with more conscious, more problem-based thought processes (known as \"System 2\").",
              "At each of these two levels, in turn, there are the processes through which we \"get information in\" (encoding), how we hold on to it (storage), and and how we \"get it back out\" (retrieval or recall).",
              "With a basic understanding of how these elements of memory work together, teachers can maximize student learning by knowing how much new information to introduce, when to introduce it, and how to sequence assignments that will both reinforce the retention of facts (System 1) and build toward critical, creative thinking (System 2).",
              "Think back to a time when you learned a new skill, such as driving a car, riding a bicycle, or reading.",
              "When you first learned this skill, performing it was an active process in which you analyzed and were acutely aware of every movement you made.",
              "Part of this analytical process also meant that you thought carefully about why you were doing what you were doing, to understand how these individual steps fit together as a comprehensive whole.",
              "However, as your ability improved, performing the skill stopped being a cognitively-demanding process, instead becoming more intuitive.",
              "As you continue to master the skill, you can perform other, at times more intellectually-demanding, tasks simultaneously.",
              "Due to your knowledge of this skill or process being unconscious, you could, for example, solve an unrelated complex problem or make an analytical decision while completing it.",
              "In its simplest form, the scenario above is an example of what psychologists call dual-process theory.",
              "The term \u201cdual-process\u201d refers to the idea that some behaviors and cognitive processes (such as decision-making) are the products of two distinct cognitive processes, often called System 1 and System 2 (Kaufmann, 2011:443-445).",
              "While System 1 is characterized by automatic, unconscious thought, System 2 is characterized by effortful, analytical, intentional thought (Osman, 2004:989).",
              "How do System 1 and System 2 thinking relate to teaching and learning?",
              "In an educational context, System 1 is associated with memorization and recall of information, while System 2 describes more analytical or critical thinking.",
              "Memory and recall, as a part of System 1 cognition, are focused on in the rest of these notes.",
              "As mentioned above, System 1 is characterized by its fast, unconscious recall of previously-memorized information.",
              "Classroom activities that would draw heavily on System 1 include memorized multiplication tables, as well as multiple-choice exam questions that only need exact regurgitation from a source such as a textbook.",
              "These kinds of tasks do not require students to actively analyze what is being asked of them beyond reiterating memorized material.",
              "System 2 thinking becomes necessary when students are presented with activities and assignments that require them to provide a novel solution to a problem, engage in critical thinking, or apply a concept outside of the domain in which it was originally presented.",
              "It may be tempting to think of learning beyond the primary school level as being all about System 2, all the time.",
              "However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that successful System 2 thinking depends on a lot of System 1 thinking to operate.",
              "In other words, critical thinking requires a lot of memorized knowledge and intuitive, automatic judgments to be performed quickly and accurately.",
              "In its simplest form, memory refers to the continued process of information retention over time.",
              "It is an integral part of human cognition, since it allows individuals to recall and draw upon past events to frame their understanding of and behavior within the present.",
              "Memory also gives individuals a framework through which to make sense of the present and future.",
              "As such, memory plays a crucial role in teaching and learning.",
              "There are three main processes that characterize how memory works.",
              "These processes are encoding, storage, and retrieval (or recall).",
              "Retrieval is subject to error, because it can reflect a reconstruction of memory.",
              "This reconstruction becomes necessary when stored information is lost over time due to decayed retention.",
              "In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted an experiment in which he tested how well individuals remembered a list of nonsense syllables over increasingly longer periods of time.",
              "Using the results of his experiment, he created what is now known as the \u201cEbbinghaus Forgetting Curve\u201d (Schaefer, 2015).",
              "Through his research, Ebbinghaus concluded that the rate at which your memory (of recently learned information) decays depends both on the time that has elapsed following your learning experience as well as how strong your memory is.",
              "Some degree of memory decay is inevitable, so, as an educator, how do you reduce the scope of this memory loss?",
              "The following sections answer this question by looking at how to improve recall within a learning environment, through various teaching and learning techniques.",
              "As a teacher, it is important to be aware of techniques that you can use to promote better retention and recall among your students.",

              "A memory palace is also known as a \u201dmind palace\u201c.",
              "If you\u2019ve ever heard of people who can memorize thousands of digits of pi or shuffled decks of cards, it\u2019s likely that they are using the memory palace technique.",

              "Check out the method of loci page for an example of how to create your own memory palace in 5 minutes!",
              "A mnemonic image is a picture in your mind that represents a piece of information in the real world.",
              "You can link the mnemonic image with the thing you\u2019re trying to remember in order to make it more memorable.",
              "For most people it\u2019s easier to remember mental pictures than words, so the linked mnemonic image helps the information stick in your brain more easily.",
              "For example, if you need to remember that the Spanish word dormir means to sleep, you could picture a dorm room, because dorm sounds like dormir, and you can sleep in a dorm.",
              "The link between the word and the image will help you recall the word or meaning later.",
              "To learn more about them, see our tutorial on how to create mnemonic images.",
              "There are several ways to memorize names and faces.",
              "One of the most common ways is to find a memorable feature on someone\u2019s face.",
              "Then use a mnemonic image (see above), to create a picture that represents their name.",
              "For example, if you meet someone named Alan, you could picture an image of an Allen wrench (shown below), and imagine the wrench interacting with a feature on his face that stands out to you.",
              "When you see the person again, you would notice the feature that stands out the most to you, and then try to recall the mnemonic image that you created.",
              "The mental picture of the Allan wrench would remind you that his name is Alan.",
              "Active recall is the process of actively trying to retrieve information from your memory.",
              "When you try to recall information from your mind, it makes the information stick better than if you just passively read the information.",
              "In the book The Principles of Psychology, William James described it like this: A curious peculiarity of our memory is that things are impressed better by active than by passive repetition.",
              "I mean that in learning (by heart, for example), when we almost know the piece, it pays better to wait and recollect by an effort from within, than to look at the book again.",

              "if in the latter way, we shall very likely need the book once more.",
              "\u201d Here\u2019s an example of the difference between active recall and passive recall: with passive recall, you\u2019re just reviewing the information by repetitively looking at your notes.",
              "Re-reading your notes can help, but trying to recall the information from your own memory is far more effective for long-term memory.",
              "To use the active recall technique while studying, you could create test questions as you take your notes.",
              "For example, if you\u2019re studying JavaScript data types, you could write down the question \u201cWhat are the 8 basic data types in JavaScript?",
              "\u201c.",
              "Then put your notes away and look at the questions you\u2019ve written down.",
              "See if you can answer them without looking at your notes.",
              "If you can\u2019t remember some of the items, no problem \u2014 look at your notes, and then try the active recall again later.",
              "Basic active recall can also be combined with other techniques like spaced repetition and the Feynman Technique (see below).",
              "This study technique appears under several names, but it is often referred to as the Feynman Technique due to the popularity of a book called Ultralearning.",
              "This is an essential technique for any serious student, and it\u2019s simple to do.",
              "After you read a little bit of your book, or study a little bit of your course, stop for a moment and pretend to teach the material to an imaginary student.",
              "Alternatively, you can write down the material in your notes as if you were teaching somebody else.",
              "Forcing yourself to put the material into your own words helps you lock the information into your brain and make sure that you understand it completely before moving on.",
              "Learning by \u201cteaching\u201d is one of the most important memory techniques, so definitely give it a try!",
              "Getting a good night\u2019s sleep can help with memory, and there\u2019s an extra trick you can use to boost that effect ever further.",
              "Every night before you go to sleep, do a bit of studying.",
              "Several studies have shown that studying right before you sleep can help with remembering the material: At the 24-hour retest, with all subjects having received both a full night of sleep and a full day of wakefulness, subjects\u2019 memories were superior when sleep occurred shortly after learning, rather than following a full day of wakefulness.",
              "If you already know how to say the alphabet in order, you can use that ability to remember long lists of other information, using a technique called the Alphabet Peg System.",
              "First, make a list of the letters in the alphabet and think of an animal that begins with that letter.",
              "Here\u2019s an example for the beginning of the alphabet: Then make a list of the facts that you want to memorize, for example, the periodic table of elements.",
              "Create a mnemonic image for each item in the list, like this: To memorize the elements, create a mental picture that links each item from one list with the corresponding item and the other list.",
              "Review your images a few times, and then recall the list by walking through the alphabet letters (A, B, C, D, etc.)",
              ", thinking of the corresponding animal, remembering what the animal was doing, and then turning the mnemonic images back into the chemical elements.",
              "You can create as many alphabet peg list as you want, using different animals, fruits, vegetables, peoples names, or anything else that can be linked with the letters.",
              "If you\u2019re going to memorize a list with more than 26 items (like the periodic table), it may be easier to use a memory palace or number pegs.",
              "After you learn alphabet pegs (above), try learning how to use Number Pegs.",
              "To make a simple number peg system, create a mnemonic image for each number from 1 to 10.",
              "For example, you could use pictures that rhyme with the numbers: Once you have created the pegs, then make a list out of the facts you want to memorize.",
              "For example, you could memorize a shopping list: Now link each item from the two lists together: When you get to the grocery store, you can recall the items by counting the numbers: There are many ways to expand on this technique, which you can learn about by creating a free account on this site.",
              "You can make a peg list out of any information that you know in order.",
              "You probably know the months in order, so you could create an image for each month like this (adjust for your local climate): To memorize facts with the list, attach your mnemonic image of the fact to the mnemonic image for the month.",
              "Then, to recall the facts, walk through the months in order, and convert all the images back to facts.",
              "Also check out Simon\u2019s peg list images for a kind of alphabet peg system that uses actions that can be applied to each fact that you want to memorize.",
              "A peg list can be made from any list of facts that you might know in order: days of the week, zodiac signs, TV/movie/book series titles, and more.",
              "The only limit is your imagination.",
              "Chunking is a mnemonic technique where you break up the information you want to memorize into smaller chunks.",
              "You can see an example of this in the telephone numbers of many countries.",
              "For example, in the United States, phone numbers are chunked in groups of 3, 3, and 4 like this: This makes phone numbers much easier to remember than if they were written as a 10-digit number like \u201c5555551212\u201d.",
              "Whenever you see an overwhelming amount of information that you have to learn, try breaking it into chunks.",
              "The chunks can be grouped by their order, by category, or in whatever way makes sense to you.",
              "The Lanier Verbatim Memory System is a complex memory technique for memorizing text word-for-word.",
              "It requires knowledge of several other memory techniques and is not for the faint of heart.",
              "Even if you never end up using it, the design of the system is quite interesting.",
              "Creating a story out of information can make it memorable.",
              "To use this technique, put all of the information that you want to memorize into a list, and then link the items together by creating a story about them.",
              "You can exaggerate the story to make it more memorable.",
              "This technique can be especially useful when combined with other techniques like memory palaces.",
              "A memory board is a kind of mnemonic device that is kind of like a memory palace on a board.",
              "You can make them with various materials like wood, beads, and shells.",
              "Each item on the board can represent a location in the memory space, and you can mentally walk through the memory space (just like with a mind palace) to recall the information.",
              "A great way to learn about memory boards is to read the book Memory Craft by Lynne Kelly.",
              "The photo below shows a lukasa \u2014 a type of memory board used by the Luba people in Central Africa.",
              "To create an acronym take the first letter of each thing you want to memorize, and combine the letters together into a word.",
              "For example, the colors of the rainbow are traditionally described as: Combining the first letters from each color into a word gives you the made-up name: Roy G.",
              "Biv.",
              "If you can remember \u201cRoy G.",
              "Biv\u201d, then you can convert the letters back into colors to remember the order.",
              "An acrostic mnemonic is a phrase or poem that represents the facts you want to remember.",
              "Acrostics are commonly used by medical students, for example to create mnemonics for tarsal bones.",
              "Here\u2019s an example of an acrostic mnemonic: The first letter of each word there can remind you of the cranial bones: The difference between an acronym and an acrostic is that an acronym spells out a word (like \u201dROY G.",
              "BIV\u201d, explained in the acronyms section), and an acrostic is more like a poem or phrase where the first letters represent facts.",
              "An example of an acrostic for the colors of the rainbow is \u201dRichard Of York Gave Battle In Vain\u201d.",
              "A number rhyme system involves finding a word that rhymes with each number (usually from 0 to 9).",
              "We already saw a quick example of it in the peg list section above.",
              "Because pictures are much easier to remember than numbers, you can chain those pictures together with the story method to remember the digits.",
              "Here are some examples of how to creating number rhymes for digits: If you want to remember the number 4314, you could convert the digits into their rhyming pictures like this: Then create a story (story method) to keep them in order: a giant DOOR falls on a TREE, knocking it onto a GUN, which fires at another DOOR, destroying it.",
              "This only works for short numbers, but the technique is easy to use.",
              "If you want to memorize longer numbers, keep reading to learn more about advanced number memorization systems. A number shape system is similar to a number rhyme system, but instead of creating mnemonic images based on rhymes, you create them by finding pictures that look like the digits.",
              "Here\u2019s an example: Once you have pictures for each digit, you can use them as a peg list or as a way to remember numbers in the same was as with the number rhyme system.",
              "You can take number shapes to the next level by using the Shaper System.",
              "In the Shaper System, you convert every 2-digit number (00-99) into a picture that looks like the number.",
              "The pictures make it easier to remember the numbers, especially if you place the pictures into a mind palace.",
              "Here are some examples of Shaper System images: Check out this page for a full list of example images.",
              "Spaced repetition is a simple technique that you can use to remember things better.",
              "To use spaced repetition, you review the information that you\u2019re trying to memorize at increasing intervals.",
              "For example, after learning some new material, you might create a review schedule like this: The increasing intervals will help you maintain the information in your memory.",
              "You can experiment with intervals to see what kind of spacing works best for you.",
              "We also offer memory palace software that automatically schedules the spaced repetition for you.",
              "A 2-digit consonant-vowel system is a variation on an idea from the Ben System.",
              "In the Ben System, 3-digit numbers are given a 1-syllable pronunciation by converting the digits into a consonant-vowel-consonant pattern.",
              "A 2-digit consonant-vowel system is similar but it\u2019s designed for 2-digit numbers.",
              "The first digit gets translated into a consonant, and the second digit becomes a vowel.",
              "Here\u2019s a sample translation table: Note: the digits represent sounds, not letters.",
              "This is a common source of confusion, especially for English speakers.",
              "The English alphabet isn\u2019t consistent and one letter can have many different sounds, but in these kinds of consonant-based memory systems, the digits represent exact, specific sounds, not letters.",
              "That\u2019s why the vowels are written with uppercase letters.",
              "They aren\u2019t English letters, but are symbols that represent exact vowel sounds.",
              "Here\u2019s an example of how to create mnemonic images for numbers using this kind of system.",
              "To complete the system, create a fixed image for each number from 00 to 99.",
              "You can then use your system to memorize numbers of any length.",
              "The Major System is a classic technique for memorize long numbers.",
              "In the Major System, each digit is given the sound of a consonant, and then a word is created from the consonants.",
              "For example, the digit 2 becomes an \u201cn\u201d.",
              "To make a mnemonic image for the number 22, you would find a word that has \u201cn\u201d as the first two consonant sounds.",
              "The word \u201coNioN\u201d would be a good fit.",
              "Another example: the number 2 in \u201cn\u201d and 0 is and \u201cs\u201d or \u201cz\u201d sound.",
              "So the number 20 could be converted into the word \u201ceiNStein\u201d, because the first two consonant sounds in Einstein are \u201cn\u201d and \u201cs\u201d.",
              "After you have fixed images for all the numbers betwee 00 and 99, you can then memorize numbers of any length by placing the images into a memory palace!",
              "The Mnemotechnic Words technique builds on the Major System to make it useful for memorizing things like historic dates.",
              "In this system you\u2019ll create Major System images on the spot to memorize facts like historical dates.",
              "Start with an event that you want to remember, like \u201cthe founding of Rome\u201d.",
              "Then take the date (753 BCE) and create an image from it using the Major System (or other number conversion method).",
              "Try to pick a word that can be easily linked with the fact.",
              "753 in the Major System could be the world \u201dCoLuMn\u201d, and Rome has a lot of architectural columns, so it fits well.",
              "Now you have the name of the event (\u201cthe founding of Rome\u201d), and a mnemonic image that represents the year (\u201dCoLuMn\u201d).",
              "The next step is to link them together with a memorable phrase or idea.",
              "It\u2019s easy to link \u201cRome\u201d with \u201ccolumn\u201d \u2014 you might come up with a phrase like \u201cRome was founded on columns.",
              "\u201d To recall the date, you just need to recall the phrase and convert the word \u201dCoLuMn\u201d back into a date using the Major System (or whatever number system you used to encode the date): 753.",
              "When you have to remember lists that have lots of repeated information, you can combine the items that have similarities and just memorize the differences.",
              "This compresses the data and reduces the number of facts that you have to memorize.",
              "Here\u2019s an example that uses patterns in a list of data.",
              "It\u2019s a sleep log that contains a lot of repeated information: You don\u2019t need to remember eight pairs of words.",
              "First, determine the number of states.",
              "In this case, the number of states is two: \u201cgood sleep\u201d and \u201cbad sleep\u201d.",
              "Count the number in each group like this: Now you only need to memorize the names of the two states and the number 23211 (easy to do with a technique like the Major System), and you\u2019ve losslessly memorized the information without as much effort.",
              "This is an exaggerated example, but the basic concept is useful whenever you see lists of information that have repeated values.",
              "Here\u2019s another example using a list of triggers from a programming language: At first glance, it looks like seven items to memorize, but if you look closer there are patterns: So now you can remember the list by realizing that triggers happen either before or after something else.",
              "They relate to the mutating actions of a basic CRUD pattern (Create, Read, Update, Delete).",
              "There\u2019s just one item in the list that doesn\u2019t fit the pattern, which is undelete, and it only appears in the after group.",
              "Identifiying the patterns might be all you need to do to remember the information, but you can also supplement this method with another technique like a peg list or memory palace.",
              "For another example, see the Memory Town section of this page.",
              "The Dominic System is similiar to the Major System, but instead of turning digits into consonants, you turn them into letters which then become the initials of people.",

              "But what system 1 primarily does is rapidly sift through information and ideas without you even noticing it by prioritising whatever seems relevant and filtering out the rest by taking shortcuts.",
              "These shortcuts are also called heuristics.",
              "We\u2019ll explain them in the next section.",
              "We are all irrational human-beings Above all, we all have to accept that we are irrational human beings almost all the time.",

              "A second very important insight from his work is that our decisions are driven by heuristics and biases.",
              "We\u2019ll dive deeper into those in the next two sections.",
              "The shortcuts our system 1 makes are heuristics.",
              "The definition of a heuristic, as can be found on Wikipedia, is: Any approach to problem-solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method, not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, logical, or rational.",

              "A heuristic is our automatic brain at work If we bring it back to Kahneman\u2019s thinking, a heuristic is simply a shortcut our automatic (system 1) brain makes to save the mental energy of our deliberate (system 2) brain.",

              "You\u2019re probably already familiar with the experience of heuristics.",
              "We sometimes refer to them as a gut feeling, guestimate, common sense, or intuition.",
              "We use heuristics for problem-solving that isn\u2019t a routine or habit.",
              "The way we \u2018build\u2019 heuristics is by reviewing the information at hand and connecting that information to our experience.",
              "Heuristics are strategies derived from previous experiences with similar problems. The most common heuristic is trial and error, trying to solve a problem based on experience instead of theory.",
              "Another example is the so-called availability heuristic.",
              "When making a decision, this heuristic provides us with a mental short-cut that relies on immediate cases that come to our mind.",
              "Or easier put: we value information that springs to mind quickly as being more significant.",
              "So, when we have to make a decision, we automatically think about related events or situations.",
              "As a result, we might judge those events as being more frequent or more probable than others.",

              "How Memory Works | Derek Bok Center, Harvard University",
              "Memory is the ongoing process of information retention over time.",
              "Because it makes up the very framework through which we make sense of and take action within the present, its importance goes without saying.",
              "But how exactly does it work?",
              "And how can teachers apply a better understanding of its inner workings to their own teaching?",
              "In light of current research in cognitive science, the very, very short answer to these questions is that memory operates according to a \"dual-process,\" where more unconscious, more routine thought processes (known as \"System 1\") interact with more conscious, more problem-based thought processes (known as \"System 2\").",
              "At each of these two levels, in turn, there are the processes through which we \"get information in\" (encoding), how we hold on to it (storage), and and how we \"get it back out\" (retrieval or recall).",
              "With a basic understanding of how these elements of memory work together, teachers can maximize student learning by knowing how much new information to introduce, when to introduce it, and how to sequence assignments that will both reinforce the retention of facts (System 1) and build toward critical, creative thinking (System 2).",
              "Think back to a time when you learned a new skill, such as driving a car, riding a bicycle, or reading.",
              "When you first learned this skill, performing it was an active process in which you analyzed and were acutely aware of every movement you made.",
              "Part of this analytical process also meant that you thought carefully about why you were doing what you were doing, to understand how these individual steps fit together as a comprehensive whole.",
              "However, as your ability improved, performing the skill stopped being a cognitively-demanding process, instead becoming more intuitive.",
              "As you continue to master the skill, you can perform other, at times more intellectually-demanding, tasks simultaneously.",
              "Due to your knowledge of this skill or process being unconscious, you could, for example, solve an unrelated complex problem or make an analytical decision while completing it.",
              "In its simplest form, the scenario above is an example of what psychologists call dual-process theory.",
              "The term \u201cdual-process\u201d refers to the idea that some behaviors and cognitive processes (such as decision-making) are the products of two distinct cognitive processes, often called System 1 and System 2 (Kaufmann, 2011:443-445).",
              "While System 1 is characterized by automatic, unconscious thought, System 2 is characterized by effortful, analytical, intentional thought (Osman, 2004:989).",
              "How do System 1 and System 2 thinking relate to teaching and learning?",
              "In an educational context, System 1 is associated with memorization and recall of information, while System 2 describes more analytical or critical thinking.",
              "Memory and recall, as a part of System 1 cognition, are focused on in the rest of these notes.",
              "As mentioned above, System 1 is characterized by its fast, unconscious recall of previously-memorized information.",
              "Classroom activities that would draw heavily on System 1 include memorized multiplication tables, as well as multiple-choice exam questions that only need exact regurgitation from a source such as a textbook.",
              "These kinds of tasks do not require students to actively analyze what is being asked of them beyond reiterating memorized material.",
              "System 2 thinking becomes necessary when students are presented with activities and assignments that require them to provide a novel solution to a problem, engage in critical thinking, or apply a concept outside of the domain in which it was originally presented.",
              "It may be tempting to think of learning beyond the primary school level as being all about System 2, all the time.",
              "However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that successful System 2 thinking depends on a lot of System 1 thinking to operate.",
              "In other words, critical thinking requires a lot of memorized knowledge and intuitive, automatic judgments to be performed quickly and accurately.",
              "In its simplest form, memory refers to the continued process of information retention over time.",
              "It is an integral part of human cognition, since it allows individuals to recall and draw upon past events to frame their understanding of and behavior within the present.",
              "Memory also gives individuals a framework through which to make sense of the present and future.",
              "As such, memory plays a crucial role in teaching and learning.",
              "There are three main processes that characterize how memory works.",
              "These processes are encoding, storage, and retrieval (or recall).",
              "Retrieval is subject to error, because it can reflect a reconstruction of memory.",
              "This reconstruction becomes necessary when stored information is lost over time due to decayed retention.",
              "In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted an experiment in which he tested how well individuals remembered a list of nonsense syllables over increasingly longer periods of time.",
              "Using the results of his experiment, he created what is now known as the \u201cEbbinghaus Forgetting Curve\u201d (Schaefer, 2015).",
              "Through his research, Ebbinghaus concluded that the rate at which your memory (of recently learned information) decays depends both on the time that has elapsed following your learning experience as well as how strong your memory is.",
              "Some degree of memory decay is inevitable, so, as an educator, how do you reduce the scope of this memory loss?",

              "Memories give an organism the capability to learn and adapt from previous experiences as well as build relationships.",
              "Encoding allows a perceived item of use or interest to be converted into a construct that can be stored within the brain and recalled later from long-term memory.",
              "[1] Working memory stores information for immediate use or manipulation, which is aided through hooking onto previously archived items already present in the long-term memory of an individual.",
              "[1] Encoding is still relatively new and unexplored but origins of encoding date back to age old philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato.",
              "A major figure in the history of encoding is Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850\u20131909).",
              "Ebbinghaus was a pioneer in the field of memory research.",
              "Using himself as a subject he studied how we learn and forget information by repeating a list of nonsense syllables to the rhythm of a metronome until they were committed to his memory.",
              "[2] These experiments led him to suggest the learning curve.",
              "[2] He used these relatively meaningless words so that prior associations between meaningful words would not influence learning.",
              "He found that lists that allowed associations to be made and semantic meaning was apparent were easier to recall.",
              "Ebbinghaus' results paved the way for experimental psychology in memory and other mental processes.",
              "During the 1900s, further progress in memory research was made.",
              "Ivan Pavlov began research pertaining to classical conditioning.",
              "His research demonstrated the ability to create a semantic relationship between two unrelated items. In 1932, Frederic Bartlett proposed the idea of mental schemas.",
              "This model proposed that whether new information would be encoded was dependent on its consistency with prior knowledge (mental schemas).",
              "[3] This model also suggested that information not present at the time of encoding would be added to memory if it was based on schematic knowledge of the world.",
              "[3] In this way, encoding was found to be influenced by prior knowledge.",
              "With the advance of Gestalt theory came the realization that memory for encoded information was often perceived as different from the stimuli that triggered it.",
              "It was also influenced by the context that the stimuli were embedded in.",
              "With advances in technology, the field of neuropsychology emerged and with it a biological basis for theories of encoding.",
              "In 1949, Donald Hebb looked at the neuroscience aspect of encoding and stated that \"neurons that fire together wire together,\" implying that encoding occurred as connections between neurons were established through repeated use.",
              "The 1950s and 60's saw a shift to the information processing approach to memory based on the invention of computers, followed by the initial suggestion that encoding was the process by which information is entered into memory.",
              "In 1956, George Armitage Miller wrote his paper on how short-term memory is limited to seven items, plus-or-minus two, called The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two.",
              "This number was appended when studies done on chunking revealed that seven, plus or minus two could also refer to seven \"packets of information\".",
              "In 1974, Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch proposed their model of working memory, which consists of the central executive, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and phonological loop as a method of encoding.",
              "In 2000, Baddeley added the episodic buffer.",
              "[4] Simultaneously Endel Tulving (1983) proposed the idea of encoding specificity whereby context was again noted as an influence on encoding.",
              "There are two main approaches to coding information: the physiological approach, and the mental approach.",
              "The physiological approach looks at how a stimulus is represented by neurons firing in the brain, while the mental approach looks at how the stimulus is represented in the mind.",
              "[5] There are many types of mental encoding that are used, such as visual, elaborative, organizational, acoustic, and semantic.",
              "However, this is not an extensive list Visual encoding is the process of converting images and visual sensory information to memory stored in the brain.",

              "[4] The visuo-spatial sketchpad is connected to the central executive, which is a key area of working memory.",
              "The amygdala is another complex structure that has an important role in visual encoding.",
              "It accepts visual input in addition to input, from other systems, and encodes the positive or negative values of conditioned stimuli.",
              "[8] Elaborative encoding is the process of actively relating new information to knowledge that is already in memory.",
              "Memories are a combination of old and new information, so the nature of any particular memory depends as much on the old information already in our memories as it does on the new information coming in through our senses.",
              "[9] In other words, how we remember something depends on how we think about it at the time.",
              "Many studies have shown that long-term retention is greatly enhanced by elaborative encoding.",
              "[10] Semantic encoding is the processing and encoding of sensory input that has particular meaning or can be applied to a context.",
              "Various strategies can be applied such as chunking and mnemonics to aid in encoding, and in some cases, allow deep processing, and optimizing retrieval.",
              "Words studied in semantic or deep encoding conditions are better recalled as compared to both easy and hard groupings of nonsemantic or shallow encoding conditions with response time being the deciding variable.",
              "[11] Brodmann's areas 45, 46, and 47 (the left inferior prefrontal cortex or LIPC) showed significantly more activation during semantic encoding conditions compared to nonsemantic encoding conditions regardless of the difficulty of the nonsemantic encoding task presented.",
              "The same area showing increased activation during initial semantic encoding will also display decreasing activation with repetitive semantic encoding of the same words.",
              "This suggests the decrease in activation with repetition is process specific occurring when words are semantically reprocessed but not when they are nonsemantically reprocessed.",
              "[11] Lesion and neuroimaging studies suggest that the orbitofrontal cortex is responsible for initial encoding and that activity in the left lateral prefrontal cortex correlates with the semantic organization of encoded information.",
              "[12] Acoustic encoding is the encoding of auditory impulses.",
              "According to Baddeley, processing of auditory information is aided by the concept of the phonological loop, which allows input within our echoic memory to be sub vocally rehearsed in order to facilitate remembering.",
              "[4] When we hear any word, we do so by hearing individual sounds, one at a time.",
              "Hence the memory of the beginning of a new word is stored in our echoic memory until the whole sound has been perceived and recognized as a word.",
              "[13] Studies indicate that lexical, semantic and phonological factors interact in verbal working memory.",
              "The phonological similarity effect (PSE), is modified by word concreteness.",
              "This emphasizes that verbal working memory performance cannot exclusively be attributed to phonological or acoustic representation but also includes an interaction of linguistic representation.",
              "[14] What remains to be seen is whether linguistic representation is expressed at the time of recall or whether the representational methods used (such as recordings, videos, symbols, etc.)",
              "participate in a more fundamental role in encoding and preservation of information in memory.",
              "[14] The brain relies primarily on acoustic (aka phonological) encoding for use in short-term storage and primarily semantic encoding for use in long-term storage.",

              "[18] The hippocampus is responsible for analyzing these inputs and ultimately deciding if they will be committed to long-term memory;",
              "these various threads of information are stored in various parts of the brain.",
              "However, the exact way in which these pieces are identified and recalled later remains unknown.",
              "[18] Encoding is achieved using a combination of chemicals and electricity.",
              "Neurotransmitters are released when an electrical pulse crosses the synapse which serves as a connection from nerve cells to other cells.",
              "The dendrites receive these impulses with their feathery extensions.",
              "A phenomenon called long-term potentiation allows a synapse to increase strength with increasing numbers of transmitted signals between the two neurons.",
              "For that to happen, NMDA receptor, which influences the flow of information between neurons by controlling the initiation of long-term potentiation in most hippocampal pathways, need to come to the play.",
              "For these NMDA receptors to be activated, there must be two conditions.",
              "Firstly, glutamate has to be released and bound to the NMDA receptor site on postsynaptic neurons.",
              "Secondly, excitation has to take place in postsynaptic neurons.",
              "[19] These cells also organize themselves into groups specializing in different kinds of information processing.",
              "Thus, with new experiences the brain creates more connections and may 'rewire'.",
              "The brain organizes and reorganizes itself in response to one's experiences, creating new memories prompted by experience, education, or training.",
              "[18] Therefore, the use of a brain reflects how it is organised.",
              "[18] This ability to re-organize is especially important if ever a part of the brain becomes damaged.",
              "Scientists are unsure of whether the stimuli of what we do not recall are filtered out at the sensory phase or if they are filtered out after the brain examines their significance.",
              "[18] Positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrates a consistent functional anatomical blueprint of hippocampal activation during episodic encoding and retrieval.",
              "Activation in the hippocampal region associated with episodic memory encoding has been shown to occur in the rostral portion of the region whereas activation associated with episodic memory retrieval occurs in the caudal portions.",
              "[20] This is referred to as the Hippocampal memory encoding and retrieval model or HIPER model.",
              "One study used PET to measure cerebral blood flow during encoding and recognition of faces in both young and older participants.",
              "Young people displayed increased cerebral blood flow in the right hippocampus and the left prefrontal and temporal cortices during encoding and in the right prefrontal and parietal cortex during recognition.",
              "[21] Elderly people showed no significant activation in areas activated in young people during encoding, however they did show right prefrontal activation during recognition.",
              "[21] Thus it may be concluded that as we grow old, failing memories may be the consequence of a failure to adequately encode stimuli as demonstrated in the lack of cortical and hippocampal activation during the encoding process.",
              "[21] Recent findings in studies focusing on patients with post traumatic stress disorder demonstrate that amino acid transmitters, glutamate and GABA, are intimately implicated in the process of factual memory registration, and suggest that amine neurotransmitters, norepinephrine-epinephrine and serotonin, are involved in encoding emotional memory.",
              "[22] The process of encoding is not yet well understood, however key advances have shed light on the nature of these mechanisms. Encoding begins with any novel situation, as the brain will interact and draw conclusions from the results of this interaction.",
              "These learning experiences have been known to trigger a cascade of molecular events leading to the formation of memories.",
              "[23] These changes include the modification of neural synapses, modification of proteins, creation of new synapses, activation of gene expression and new protein synthesis.",
              "One study found that high central nervous system levels of acetylcholine during wakefulness aided in new memory encoding, while low levels of acetylcholine during slow-wave sleep aided in consolidation of memories.",
              "[24] However, encoding can occur on different levels.",
              "The first step is short-term memory formation, followed by the conversion to a long-term memory, and then a long-term memory consolidation process.",
              "[25] Synaptic plasticity is the ability of the brain to strengthen, weaken, destroy and create neural synapses and is the basis for learning.",
              "These molecular distinctions will identify and indicate the strength of each neural connection.",
              "The effect of a learning experience depends on the content of such an experience.",
              "Reactions that are favored will be reinforced and those that are deemed unfavorable will be weakened.",
              "This shows that the synaptic modifications that occur can operate either way, in order to be able to make changes over time depending on the current situation of the organism.",
              "In the short term, synaptic changes may include the strengthening or weakening of a connection by modifying the preexisting proteins leading to a modification in synapse connection strength.",
              "In the long term, entirely new connections may form or the number of synapses at a connection may be increased, or reduced.",
              "[25] A significant short-term biochemical change is the covalent modification of pre-existing proteins in order to modify synaptic connections that are already active.",
              "This allows data to be conveyed in the short term, without consolidating anything for permanent storage.",
              "From here a memory or an association may be chosen to become a long-term memory, or forgotten as the synaptic connections eventually weaken.",
              "The switch from short to long-term is the same concerning both implicit memory and explicit memory.",
              "This process is regulated by a number of inhibitory constraints, primarily the balance between protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.",
              "[25] Finally, long term changes occur that allow consolidation of the target memory.",
              "These changes include new protein synthesis, the formation of new synaptic connections, and finally the activation of gene expression in accordance with the new neural configuration.",
              "[26] The encoding process has been found to be partially mediated by serotonergic interneurons, specifically in regard to sensitization as blocking these interneurons prevented sensitization entirely.",
              "However, the ultimate consequences of these discoveries have yet to be identified.",
              "Furthermore, the learning process has been known to recruit a variety of modulatory transmitters in order to create and consolidate memories.",
              "These transmitters cause the nucleus to initiate processes required for neuronal growth and long-term memory, mark specific synapses for the capture of long-term processes, regulate local protein synthesis, and even appear to mediate attentional processes required for the formation and recall of memories.",
              "Human memory, including the process of encoding, is known to be a heritable trait that is controlled by more than one gene.",
              "In fact, twin studies suggest that genetic differences are responsible for as much as 50% of the variance seen in memory tasks.",
              "[23] Proteins identified in animal studies have been linked directly to a molecular cascade of reactions leading to memory formation, and a sizable number of these proteins are encoded by genes that are expressed in humans as well.",
              "In fact, variations within these genes appear to be associated with memory capacity and have been identified in recent human genetic studies.",
              "[23] The idea that the brain is separated into two complementary processing networks (task positive and task negative) has recently become an area of increasing interest.",
              "[vague] The task positive network deals with externally oriented processing whereas the task negative network deals with internally oriented processing.",
              "Research indicates that these networks are not exclusive and some tasks overlap in their activation.",
              "A study done in 2009 shows encoding success and novelty detection activity within the task-positive network have significant overlap and have thus been concluded to reflect common association of externally oriented processing.",
              "[27] It also demonstrates how encoding failure and retrieval success share significant overlap within the task negative network indicating common association of internally oriented processing.",
              "[27] Finally, a low level of overlap between encoding success and retrieval success activity and between encoding failure and novelty detection activity respectively indicate opposing modes or processing.",
              "[27] In sum task positive and task negative networks can have common associations during the performance of different tasks.",
              "Different levels of processing influence how well information is remembered.",
              "This idea was first introduced by Craik and Lockhart (1972).",
              "They claimed that the level of processing information was dependent upon the depth at which the information was being processed;",
              "mainly, shallow processing and deep processing.",
              "According to Craik and Lockhart, the encoding of sensory information would be considered shallow processing, as it is highly automatic and requires very little focus.",
              "Deeper level processing requires more attention being given to the stimulus and engages more cognitive systems to encode the information.",
              "An exception to deep processing is if the individual has been exposed to the stimulus frequently and it has become common in the individual\u2019s life, such as the person\u2019s name.",
              "[28] These levels of processing can be illustrated by maintenance and elaborate rehearsal.",
              "Maintenance rehearsal is a shallow form of processing information which involves focusing on an object without thought to its meaning or its association with other objects.",
              "For example, the repetition of a series of numbers is a form of maintenance rehearsal.",
              "In contrast, elaborative or relational rehearsal is a process in which you relate new material to information already stored in Long-term memory.",
              "It's a deep form of processing information and involves thought of the object's meaning as well as making connections between the object, past experiences and the other objects of focus.",
              "Using the example of numbers, one might associate them with dates that are personally significant such as your parents' birthdays (past experiences) or perhaps you might see a pattern in the numbers that helps you to remember them.",
              "[29] Due to the deeper level of processing that occurs with elaborative rehearsal it is more effective than maintenance rehearsal in creating new memories.",
              "[29] This has been demonstrated in people's lack of knowledge of the details in everyday objects.",
              "For example, in one study where Americans were asked about the orientation of the face on their country's penny few recalled this with any degree of certainty.",
              "Despite the fact that it is a detail that is often seen, it is not remembered as there is no need to because the color discriminates the penny from other coins.",
              "[30] The ineffectiveness of maintenance rehearsal, simply being repeatedly exposed to an item, in creating memories has also been found in people's lack of memory for the layout of the digits 0-9 on calculators and telephones.",
              "[31] Maintenance rehearsal has been demonstrated to be important in learning but its effects can only be demonstrated using indirect methods such as lexical decision tasks,[32] and word stem completion[33] which are used to assess implicit learning.",
              "In general, however previous learning by maintenance rehearsal is not apparent when memory is being tested directly or explicitly with questions like \" Is this the word you were shown earlier?\"",
              "Studies have shown that the intention to learn has no direct effect on memory encoding.",
              "Instead, memory encoding is dependent on how deeply each item is encoded, which could be affected by intention to learn, but not exclusively.",
              "That is, intention to learn can lead to more effective learning strategies, and consequently, better memory encoding, but if you learn something incidentally (i.",
              "e. without intention to learn) but still process and learn the information effectively, it will get encoded just as well as something learnt with intention.",
              "[34] The effects of elaborative rehearsal or deep processing can be attributed to the number of connections made while encoding that increase the number of pathways available for retrieval.",
              "[35] Organization is key to memory encoding.",

              "The generation effect implies that learning is enhanced when individuals generate information or items themselves rather than reading the content.",
              "[49] The key to properly apply the generation effect is to generate information, rather than passively selecting from information already available like in selecting an answer from a multiple-choice question[50] In 1978, researchers Slameka and Graf conducted an experiment to better understand this effect.",

              "[52] The self-reference effect is the idea that individuals will encode information more effectively if they can personally relate to the information.",

              "[57] In reference to encoding, any event involving survival may be considered salient.",
              "Research has shown that survival may be related to the self-reference effect due to evolutionary mechanisms.[58] Researchers have discovered that even words that are high in survival value are encoded better than words that are ranked lower in survival value.",

              "[61] The benefits of using retrieval practice have been demonstrated in a study done where college students were asked to read a passage for seven minutes and were then given a two-minute break, during which they completed math problems. One group of participants was given seven minutes to write down as much of the passage as they could remember while the other group was given another seven minutes to reread the material.",

              "[63] In brief, every item that one sees can be represented as a vector of the item's attributes, which is extended by a vector representing the context at the time of encoding, and is stored in a memory matrix of all items ever seen.",
              "When a probe item is presented, the sum of the similarities to each item in the matrix (which is inversely proportional to the sum of the distances between the probe vector and each item in the memory matrix) is computed.",
              "If the similarity is above a threshold value, one would respond, \"Yes, I recognize that item.\"",
              "Given that context continually drifts by nature of a random walk, more recently seen items, which each share a similar context vector to the context vector at the time of the recognition task, are more likely to be recognized than items seen longer ago.",
              "In cued recall, an individual is presented with a stimulus, such as a list of words and then asked to remember as many of those words as possible.",
              "They are then given cues, such as categories, to help them remember what the stimuli were.",
              "[41] An example of this would be to give a subject words such as meteor, star, space ship, and alien to memorize.",
              "Then providing them with the cue of \"outer space\" to remind them of the list of words given.",
              "Giving the subject cues, even when never originally mentioned, helped them recall the stimulus much better.",
              "These cues help guide the subjects to recall the stimuli they could not remember for themselves prior to being given a cue.",
              "[41] Cues can essentially be anything that will help a memory that is deemed forgotten to resurface.",
              "An experiment conducted by Tulvig suggests that when subjects were given cues, they were able to recall the previously presented stimuli.",
              "[64] Cued recall can be explained by extending the attribute-similarity model used for item recognition.",
              "Because in cued recall, a wrong response can be given for a probe item, the model has to be extended accordingly to account for that.",
              "This can be achieved by adding noise to the item vectors when they are stored in the memory matrix.",
              "Furthermore, cued recall can be modeled in a probabilistic manner such that for every item stored in the memory matrix, the more similar it is to the probe item, the more likely it is to be recalled.",
              "Because the items in the memory matrix contain noise in their values, this model can account for incorrect recalls, such as mistakenly calling a person by the wrong name.",
              "In free recall, one is allowed to recall items that were learned in any order.",

              "[65] SAM consists of two main components: short-term store (STS) and long-term store (LTS).",
              "In brief, when an item is seen, it is pushed into STS where it resides with other items also in STS, until it displaced and put into LTS.",
              "The longer the item has been in STS, the more likely it is to be displaced by a new item.",
              "When items co-reside in STS, the links between those items are strengthened.",

              "SAM explains both primacy and recency effects.",
              "Probabilistically, items at the beginning of the list are more likely to remain in STS, and thus have more opportunities to strengthen their links to other items. As a result, items at the beginning of the list are made more likely to be recalled in a free-recall task (primacy effect).",
              "Because of the assumption that items in STS are always available for immediate recall, given that there were no significant distractors between learning and recall, items at the end of the list can be recalled excellently (recency effect).",
              "Studies have shown that free recall is one of the most effective methods of studying and transferring information from short term memory to long term memory compared to item recognition and cued recall as greater relational processing is involved.",

              "An example of a transposition error would be recalling the sequence \"apple, orange, banana\" instead of \"apple, banana, orange.\"",
              "Positional coding theory suggests that every item in a list is associated to its position in the list.",
              "For example, if the list is \"apple, banana, orange, mango\" apple will be associated to list position 1, banana to 2, orange to 3, and mango to 4.",
              "Furthermore, each item is also, albeit more weakly, associated to its index +/- 1, even more weakly to +/- 2, and so forth.",
              "So banana is associated not only to its actual index 2, but also to 1, 3, and 4, with varying degrees of strength.",
              "For example, positional coding can be used to explain the effects of recency and primacy.",
              "Because items at the beginning and end of a list have fewer close neighbors compared to items in the middle of the list, they have less competition for correct recall.",
              "Although the models of associative chaining and positional coding are able to explain a great amount of behavior seen for sequence memory, they are far from perfect.",
              "For example, neither chaining nor positional coding is able to properly illustrate the details of the Ranschburg effect, which reports that sequences of items that contain repeated items are harder to reproduce than sequences of unrepeated items. Associative chaining predicts that recall of lists containing repeated items is impaired because recall of any repeated item would cue not only its true successor but also the successors of all other instances of the item.",
              "However, experimental data have shown that spaced repetition of items resulted in impaired recall of the second occurrence of the repeated item.",
              "[67] Furthermore, it had no measurable effect on the recall of the items that followed the repeated items, contradicting the prediction of associative chaining.",
              "Positional coding predicts that repeated items will have no effect on recall, since the positions for each item in the list act as independent cues for the items, including the repeated items. That is, there is no difference between the similarity between any two items and repeated items. This, again, is not consistent with the data.",

              "The pallium is similar to the amygdala, and the part of the fish pallium where the synapses strengthened in the study is full of neurons involved in processing painful stimuli, while the fish lost synapses among neurons that process positive or neutral stimuli, Arnold said.",
              "Emotion is an important component of memory-making, said Avishek Adhikari, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
              "Both positive and negative emotional situations are better-remembered than neutral events, likely for reasons of survival: It's probably important to remember things that were either very good for you, or very bad.",
              "The brain releases higher concentrations of certain neurotransmitters in high-emotion scenarios, Adhikari told Live Science, and the presence of these neurotransmitters can strengthen the memory circuits in the hippocampus.",
              "Other regions involved in memory are the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which handle the motor memory needed to, for instance, play a piano piece, and the prefrontal cortex, which helps with \u201cworking memory,\u201d which is involved when you need to hold information in your head long enough to manipulate it, for instance when solving a math problem, according to the University of Queensland.",
              "The formation of new neurons also plays an important role in memory storage, even in adult brains.",
              "Scientists used to think that the brain stopped producing new neurons after adolescence, but research in the past two decades has shown that not only do adult brains make new neurons, but these neurons are key for learning and memory.",

              "With subsequent reactivations, the memory grows stronger or fainter and takes on different characteristics.",
              "Memories reflect real-world experience, but with varying levels of fidelity to that original experience.",
              "The degree to which the memories we form are accurate or easily recalled depends on a variety of factors, from the psychological conditions in which information is first translated into memory to the manner in which we seek\u2014or are unwittingly prompted\u2014to conjure details from the past.",
              "The creation of a memory requires a conversion of a select amount of the information one perceives into more permanent form.",
              "A subset of that memory will be secured in long-term storage, accessible for future use.",
              "Many factors during and after the creation of a memory influence what (and how much) gets preserved.",
              "Memory serves many purposes, from allowing us to revisit and learn from past experiences to storing knowledge about the world and how things work.",
              "More broadly, a major function of memory in humans and other animals is to help ensure that our behavior fits the present situation and that we can adjust it based on experience.",
              "Encoding is the first stage of memory.",
              "It is the process by which the details of a person\u2019s experience are converted into a form that can be stored in the brain.",
              "People are more likely to encode details of what they are paying attention to and details that are personally significant.",
              "Retention, or storage, is the stage in which information is preserved in memory following its initial encoding.",
              "These stored memories are incomplete: Some of the information that is encoded during an experience fades during retention, sometimes quickly, while other details remain.",
              "A related term, memory consolidation, refers to the neurobiological process of long-term memory formation.",
              "Sleep facilitates the retention of memories, though why exactly this is the case is not fully understood.",

              "Researchers have proposed that sleep supports memory consolidation in the brain, though other explanations include that sleep aids retention by eliminating interference from memories that would be formed while awake.",
              "While memories are usually described in terms of mental concepts, such as single packages of personal experience or specific facts, they are ultimately reducible to the workings and characteristics of the ever-firing cells of the brain.",

              "Neurons in the brain are connected by synapses, which are bound together by chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) to form larger networks.",
              "Memory storage is thought to involve changes in the strength of these connections in the areas of the brain that have been linked to memory.",
              "A memory engram, or memory trace, is a term for the set of changes in the brain on which a memory is based.",

              "After memories are stored in the brain, they must be retrieved in order to be useful.",
              "While we may or may not be consciously aware that information is being summoned from storage at any given moment, this stage of memory is constantly unfolding\u2014and the very act of remembering changes how memories are subsequently filed away.",
              "Retrieval is the stage of memory in which the information saved in memory is recalled, whether consciously or unconsciously.",
              "It follows the stages of encoding and storage.",
              "Retrieval includes both intentional remembering, as when one thinks back to a previous experience or tries to put a name to a face, and more passive recall, as when the meanings of well-known words or the notes of a song come effortlessly to mind.",
              "A retrieval cue is a stimulus that initiates remembering.",
              "Retrieval cues can be external, such as an image, text, a scent, or some other stimulus that relates to the memory.",
              "They can also be internal, such as a thought or sensation that is relevant to the memory.",

              "And the \u201cencoding specificity principle\u201d holds that one is more likely to recall a memory when there is greater similarity between a retrieval cue (such as an image or sound in the present) and the conditions in which the memory was initially formed.",
              "After a memory is retrieved, it is thought to undergo a process called reconsolidation, during which its representation in the brain can change based on input at the time of remembering.",
              "This capacity for memories to be reformed after retrieval has been explored as a potential element of psychotherapeutic interventions (for dampening the intensity of threatening memories, for example).",

              "These may include a person\u2019s knowledge and expectations about the world (used to fill in the blanks of a memory) and misleading suggestions by other people about what occurred.",
              "False memories can be as simple as concluding that you were shown a word that you actually weren\u2019t, but it may also include believing you experienced a dramatic event that you didn\u2019t.",
              "People may produce such false recollections by unwittingly drawing on the details of actual, related experiences, or in some cases, as a response to another person\u2019s detailed suggestions (perhaps involving some true details) about an imaginary event that is purported to be real.",

              "Others have suggested that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu may result from new information somehow being passed straight to long-term memory, or from the spontaneous activation of a part of the brain called the rhinal cortex, involved in the sense of familiarity.",

              "How quickly a memory is retrieved?",

              "Two theories have been given by scientists to explain this phenomenon.",
              "The first is the direct-access perspective, according to which the memory is not strong enough to recall but it is strong enough to trigger the partial recall.",
              "The second is the inferential perspective which states that the state of partial recall occurs when the subject can infer knowledge of the target word, but not able to join the pieces of information together usually because those pieces do not exist in the memory.",
              "The characteristics of the environment in which a memory is encoded are also encoded along with the memory.",
              "This leads to the context-dependency of retrieval which means that the memories are more easily retrieved in the same environmental conditions in which they were encoded.",
              "Studies have shown that females are better than males at recalling episodic memories, but no differences have been seen in the two during retrieval of semantic memories.",

              "It may also affect other areas of the brain.",
              "In this way, physical activity and exercise help in the proper functioning of the neural networks.",

              "Retrieval cues are of two types.",
              "External cues or contextual cues which are in the environment and Internal cues which are inside the human brain.",
              "In these cases, mostly the environment in which memory is being retrieved is different from the environment of its encoding.",
              "Hence there are no external cues present which then leads to retrieval failure of the memory.",

              "Recall in memory refers to the mental process of retrieval of information from the past.",
              "Along with encoding and storage, it is one of the three core processes of memory.",
              "There are three main types of recall: free recall, cued recall and serial recall.",
              "Psychologists test these forms of recall as a way to study the memory processes of humans[1] and animals.",
              "[2] Two main theories of the process of recall are the two-stage theory and the theory of encoding specificity.",
              "The two-stage theory states that the process of recall begins with a search and retrieval process, and then a decision or recognition process where the correct information is chosen from what has been retrieved.",
              "In this theory, recognition only involves the latter of these two stages, or processes, and this is thought to account for the superiority of the recognition process over recall.",
              "Recognition only involves one process in which error or failure may occur, while recall involves two.",
              "[3] However, recall has been found to be superior to recognition in some cases, such as a failure to recognize words that can later be recalled.",
              "[4] Another two stage theory holds that free recall of a list of items begins with the content in working memory and then moves to an associative search.",
              "[5] The theory of encoding specificity finds similarities between the process of recognition and that of recall.",
              "The encoding specificity principle states that memory utilizes information from the memory trace, or the situation in which it was learned, and from the environment in which it is retrieved.",
              "In other words, memory is improved when information available at encoding is also available at retrieval.",
              "For example, if one is to learn about a topic and study it in a specific location, but take their exam in a different setting, they would not have had as much of a successful memory recall as if they were in the location that they learned and studied the topic in.",
              "Encoding specificity helps to take into account context cues because of its focus on the retrieval environment, and it also accounts for the fact recognition may not always be superior to recall.",
              "[4] Philosophical questions regarding how people acquire knowledge about their world spurred the study of memory and learning.",
              "[6] Recall is a major part of memory so the history of the study of memory in general also provides a history of the study of recall.",
              "In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus created nonsense syllables, combinations of letters that do not follow grammatical rules and have no meaning, to test his own memory.",
              "He would memorize a list of nonsense syllables and then test his recall of that list over varying time periods.",
              "He discovered that memory loss occurred rapidly over the first few hours or days, but showed a more steady, gradual decline over subsequent days, weeks, and months.",
              "Furthermore, Ebbinghaus discovered that multiple learning, over-learning, and spacing study times increased retention of information.",
              "[7] Ebbinghaus' research influenced much of the research conducted on memory and recall throughout the twentieth century.",
              "Frederic Bartlett was a prominent researcher in the field of memory during the mid-twentieth century.",
              "He was a British experimental psychologist who focused on the mistakes people made when recalling new information.",
              "One of his well-known works was Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology, which he published in 1932.",
              "He is well known for his use of North American Native folk tales, including The War of the Ghosts.",
              "[8] He would provide participants in his study with an excerpt from a story and then asked them to recall it as accurately as they could.",
              "[8] Retention intervals would vary from directly after reading the story to days later.",
              "Bartlett found that people try to understand the overall meaning of the story.",
              "Since the folk tale included supernatural elements, people would rationalize them to make them fit better with their own culture.",
              "Ultimately, Bartlett argued that the mistakes that the participants made could be attributed to \"schematic intrusions\"[8] - current knowledge interfering with recall.",
              "In the 1950s there was a change in the overall study of memory that has come to be known as the cognitive revolution.",
              "This included new theories on how to view memory, often likening it to a computer processing model.",
              "Two important books influenced the revolution: Plans and Structures of Behavior by George Miller, Eugene Galanter, and Karl H.",

              "Before the 1960s, there was very little research that studied the workings of short-term memory and rapid memory loss.",
              "Lloyd and Margaret Peterson observed that when people are given a short list of words or letters and then are distracted and occupied with another task for few seconds, their memory for the list is greatly decreased.",
              "[6] Atkinson and Shiffrin (1973) created the short-term memory model, which became the popular model for studying short-term memory.",
              "[10] The next major development in the study of memory recall was Endel Tulving's proposition of two kinds of memory: episodic and semantic.",
              "Tulving described episodic memory as a memory about a specific event that occurred at a particular time and place, for example what you got for your 10th birthday.",
              "Semantic memories are abstract words, concepts, and rules stored in long-term memory.",
              "[11] Furthermore, Endel Tulving devised the encoding specificity principle in 1983, which explains the importance of the relation between the encoding of information and then recalling that information.",
              "To explain further, the encoding specificity principle means that a person is more likely to recall information if the recall cues match or are similar to the encoding cues.",
              "[12] The 1960s also saw a development in the study of visual imagery and how it is recalled.",
              "This research was led by Allan Paivio, who found that the more image-arousing a word was the more likely it would be recalled in either free recall or paired associates.",
              "[13] There has been a considerable amount of research into the workings of memory, and specifically recall since the 1980s.",
              "The previously mentioned research was developed and improved upon, and new research was and still is being conducted.",
              "Free recall describes the process in which a person is given a list of items to remember and then is tested by being asked to recall them in any order.",
              "[6] Free recall often displays evidence of primacy and recency effects.",
              "Primacy effects are displayed when the person recalls items presented at the beginning of the list earlier and more often.",
              "The recency effect is when the person recalls items presented at the end of the list earlier and more often.",
              "[6] Free recall often begins with the end of the list and then moves to the beginning and middle of the list.",
              "[5] Cued recall is when a person is given a list of items to remember and is then tested with cues to remember material.",
              "Researchers have used this procedure to test memory.",

              "The word presentation can either be visual or auditory.",
              "There are two basic experimental methods used to conduct cued recall, the study-test method and the anticipation method.",
              "In the study-test method participants study a list of word pairs presented individually.",
              "Immediately after or after a time delay, participants are tested in the study phase of the experiment on the word pairs just previously studied.",
              "One word of each pair is presented in a random order and the participant is asked to recall the item with which it was originally paired.",
              "The participant can be tested for either forward recall, Ai is presented as a cue for Bi, or backward recall, Bi is presented as a cue for Ai.",
              "In the anticipation method, participants are shown Ai and are asked to anticipate the word paired with it, Bi.",
              "If the participant cannot recall the word, the answer is revealed.",
              "During an experiment using the anticipation method, the list of words is repeated until a certain percentage of Bi words are recalled.",
              "The learning curve for cued recall increases systematically with the number of trials completed.",
              "This result has caused a debate about whether or not learning is all-or-none.",
              "One theory is that learning is incremental and that the recall of each word pair is strengthened with repetition.",
              "Another theory suggests that learning is all-or-none, that is one learns the word pair in a single trial and memory performance is due to the average learned pairs, some of which are learned on earlier trials and some on later trials.",
              "To examine the validity of these theories researchers have performed memory experiments.",
              "In one experiment published in 1959, experimental psychologist Irvin Rock and colleague Walter Heimer of the University of Illinois had both a control group and an experimental group learn pairs of words.",
              "The control group studied word pairs that were repeated until the participants learned all the word pairs.",
              "In the experimental group, the learned pairs remained in the list while unlearned pairs were substituted with recombinations of previous words.",
              "Rock believed that associations between two items would be strengthened if learning were incremental even when pairs are not correctly recalled.",
              "His hypothesis was that the control group would have a higher correct recall probability than the experimental group.",
              "He thought that repetition would increase the strength of the word pair until the strength reaches a threshold needed to produce an overt response.",
              "If learning were all or none, then the control group and the experimental group should learn the word pairs at the same rate.",
              "Rock found experimentally there was little difference in learning rates between the two groups.",
              "However, Rock's work did not settle the controversy because in his experiment he rearranged replaced word pairs that could be either easier or harder to learn than the original words in the word- digit pair.",
              "In further experiments that addressed the question, there were mixed results.",
              "The incremental learning hypothesis is supported by the notion that awhile after Ai-Bi pairs are learned, the recall time to recall Bi decreases with continued learning trails.",
              "[14] Another theory that can be tested using cued recall is symmetry of forward and backward recall.",
              "Forward recall is generally assumed to be easier than backward recall, i.",
              "e. forward recall is stronger than backward recall.",

              "To store a sequence in LTM, the sequence is repeated over time until it is represented in memory as a whole, rather than as a series of items. In this way, there is no need to remember the relationships between the items and their original positions.",
              "[2] In STM, immediate serial recall (ISR) has been thought to result from one of two mechanisms. The first refers to ISR as a result of associations between the items and their positions in a sequence, while the second refers to associations between items. These associations between items are referred to as chaining, and is an unlikely mechanism, according to research.",
              "[citation needed] Position-item relationships do not account for recency and primacy effects, or the phonological similarity effect.",
              "The Primacy Model moves away from these two assumptions, suggesting that ISR results from a gradient of activation levels where each item has a particular level of activation that corresponds to its position.",
              "[22] Research has supported the fact that immediate serial recall performance is much better when the list is homogenous (of the same semantic category) than when they are heterogeneous (of different semantic category).",
              "This suggests that semantic representations are beneficial to immediate serial recall performance.",
              "[23] Short-term serial recall is also affected by similar-sounding items, as recall is lower (remembered more poorly) than items that do not sound alike.",
              "This is true when lists are tested independently (when comparing two separate lists of similar-sounding and not similar-sounding items) as well as when tested using a mixed list.",

              "There is evidence indicating that rhythm is highly sensitive to competing motor production.",
              "Actions such as paced finger tapping can have an effect on recall as the disruptive impact of paced finger tapping, but lack of consistent effect of paced irrelevant sound, is indicative of motor feedback from the tapping task disrupting rehearsal and storage.",
              "[24] Eight different effects are generally seen in serial recall studies with humans: The anterior cingulate cortex, globus pallidus, thalamus, and cerebellum show higher activation during recall than during recognition which suggests that these components of the cerebello-frontal pathway play a role in recall processes that they do not in recognition.",

This effect has been termed the subsequent memory effect (SME).",

The recency effect can be eliminated if there is a period of interference between the input and the output of information extending longer than the holding time of short-term memory (15\u201330 seconds).",

              "[70] Involuntary semantic memory retrieval (ISM), or \"semantic-popping\", occurs in the same fashion as IAM retrieval.",
              "However, the elicited memory is devoid of personal grounding and often considered trivial, such as a random word, image, or phrase.",
              "ISM retrieval can occur as a result of spreading activation, where words, thoughts, and concepts activate related semantic memories continually.",
              "When enough related memories are primed that an interrelated concept, word, thought, or image \"pops\" into consciousness and you are unaware of the extent of its relatedness within your memory.",
              "Spreading activation is thought to build over a period of many hours, days, or even weeks before a random semantic memory \"pops\".",
              "[71] False memories result from persistent beliefs, suggestions via authority figures, or statements of false information.",
              "Repeated exposure to these stimuli influence the reorganization of a person's memory, affecting its details, or implanting vivid false accounts of an event.",
              "[72] This is usually accounted for by source-monitoring error, where a person can recall specific facts, but cannot correctly identify the source of that knowledge because of apparent loss of the association between the episodic (specific experience, or source) and semantic (concept-based, or gist) accounts of the stored knowledge.",
              "An example of this is cryptomnesia, or inadvertent plagiarism, where one duplicates a work that they have previously encountered believing it to be their original idea.",
              "[73] False memories can also be accounted for by the generation effect, which is an observable phenomenon where repeated exposure to a belief, suggestion, or false information is better remembered with each subsequent generation.",
              "This can be seen with the misinformation effect, where an eye-witness account of an event can be influenced by a bystander account of the same event, or by suggestion via an authority figure.",
              "It is also believed to influence the recovery of repressed shocking or abusive memories in patients under hypnosis, where the recovered memory, although possibly a vivid account, could be entirely false, or have specific details influenced as the result of persistent suggestion by the therapist.",
              "[72] Retrograde amnesia is typically the result of physical or psychological trauma which manifests itself as the inability to remember information preceding the traumatic event.",
              "It is usually accompanied by some type of anterograde amnesia, or inability to acquire new knowledge.",
              "Focal retrograde amnesia (FRA), sometimes known as functional amnesia, refers to the presence of retrograde amnesia while knowledge acquisition remains intact (no anterograde amnesia).",
              "Memory for how to use objects and perform skills (implicit memory) may remain intact while specific knowledge of personal events or previously learned facts (explicit memory) become inaccessible or lost.",
              "[74][75] Amnesia can result from a number of different causes, including encephalitis, severe traumatic brain injury, vitamin B1 deficiency as seen in Korsakoff's Syndrome, and psychotic episodes, or by witnessing an emotionally traumatic event (Dissociative amnesia).",
              "Dysfunction of the temporal and frontal lobes have been observed in many cases of focal retrograde amnesia, whether metabolic or the result of lesions.",
              "However, this evidence only appears to correlate with the symptoms of retrograde amnesia as cases have been observed where patients with minor concussions, showing no visible brain damage, develop FRA.",
              "It has been suggested that FRA could represent a variety of different disorders, cognitive deficits, or conditions that result in disproportionate loss of explicit memory, hence Disproportionate Retrograde Amnesia.",
              "[75] The Face Advantage allows information and memories to be recalled easier through the presentation of a person's face rather than a person's voice.",
              "[76] Faces and voices are very similar stimuli that reveal similar information and result in similar processes of memory recall.",
              "[77] During face perception, there are three stages of memory recall that include recognition, followed by the remembering of semantic memory and episodic memory, and finally name recall.",
              "[78][79] The Face Advantage is shown through an experiment where participants are presented with faces and voices of unfamiliar faces and recognizable celebrity faces.",

              "The participants are asked to say if the face or voice is familiar.",
              "If the answer is yes, they are asked to recall semantic and episodic memories and finally the name of the face or voice.",
              "[76] It was much easier for those presented with a celebrity's face to recall information than for those presented with a voice.",
              "The results show that in the second stage of face perception when memories are recalled,[79] information is recalled faster and more accurate after a face is perceived, and slower, less accurate and with less detail after a voice is perceived.",
              "A possible explanation is that the connections between face representations and semantic and episodic memory are stronger than that of voices.",
              "[76][78] Memory phenomena are rich sources of storylines and novel situations in popular media.",
              "Two phenomena that appear regularly are total recall abilities and amnesia.",
              "The Argentinean author, Jorge Luis Borges wrote the short story Funes the Memorious in 1944.",
              "It depicts the life of Ireneo Funes, a fictional character who falls off his horse and experiences a head injury.",
              "After this accident, Funes has total recall abilities.",
              "He is said to recall an entire day with no mistakes, but this feat of recall takes him an entire day to accomplish.",
              "It is said that Borges was ahead of his time in his description of memory processes in this story, as it was not until the 1950s and research on the patient HM that some of what the author describes began to be understood.",
              "[80] A more recent instance of total recall in literature is found in is in Stieg Larsson's books The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, in which the lead character, Lisbeth Salander remembers anything she reads, indicating she has total recall ability.",
              "Another example is in Dan Brown's books The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, in which the main character, Dr.",

              "[83] Also, the character of hospital resident Lexie Grey on the television show \"Grey's Anatomy\" has total recall ability.",
              "[84] Amnesia which is the damage or disruption of memory processes, has been a very popular subject in movies since 1915.",
              "Although its portrayal is usually inaccurate, there are some exceptions.",

              "The main character Leonard has anterograde amnesia after a traumatic attack in which his wife dies.",
              "He maintains his identity and shows very little retrograde amnesia.",
              "He also displays some of the daily memory problems that are experiences by most amnesics, such as forgetting names or where he is going.",
              "Another fairly accurate portrayal of memory disturbances is the non-human character Dory in Finding Nemo (2003).",
              "This fish, like Leonard, shows memory problems faced by most amnesics where she forgets names, has difficulty storing and recalling information, and often forgets what she is doing, or why she is doing something.",
              "Movies tend to show amnesia as a result of head injury from accidents or attacks.",
              "The loss of identity and autobiographical memory shown in Santa Who?",
              "(2000) in which Santa has amnesia that destroys his identity and memory of himself is very unlikely in the real world.",
              "This is also portrayed in The Bourne Identity (2002) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004) where the main character forgets he is a trained assassin.",
              "Another misrepresentation of the reality of memory loss in the movies can be seen in Clean Slate (1994) and 50 First Dates (2004) where the characters are able to encode memory during the day but lose all memory of that day at night, while sleeping.",
              "Movies often restore affected person's memory through a second trauma, or through a kind of cued recall when they revisit familiar places or see familiar objects.",
              "The phenomenon of the second trauma can be seen in Singing in the Dark (1956) where the affected individual experiences the onset of amnesia because of the trauma of the Holocaust, but memory is restored with a blow to the head.",
              "Although neurosurgery is often the cause of amnesia, it is seen as a solution in some movies, including Deluxe Annie (1918) and Rascals (1938).",

              "However, since Lashley\u2019s research, other scientists have been able to look more closely at the brain and memory.",
              "They have argued that memory is located in specific parts of the brain, and specific neurons can be recognized for their involvement in forming memories.",

              "The main job of the amygdala is to regulate emotions, such as fear and aggression.",
              "The amygdala plays a part in how memories are stored because storage is influenced by stress hormones.",

              "Many widely discussed examples of flashbulb memories pertain to national or global events, but according to their initial definition by researchers Brown and Kulik (1977) as well as additional work by more recent researchers, such a widely shared event is not required (Hirst & Phelps, 2016).",

              "Karl Lashley began exploring this problem, about 100 years ago, by making lesions in the brains of animals such as rats and monkeys.",
              "He was searching for evidence of the engram: the group of neurons that serve as the \u201cphysical representation of memory\u201d (Josselyn, 2010).",
              "First, Lashley (1950) trained rats to find their way through a maze.",
              "Then, he used the tools available at the time\u2014in this case a soldering iron\u2014to create lesions in the rats\u2019 brains, specifically in the cerebral cortex.",
              "He did this because he was trying to erase the engram, or the original memory trace that the rats had of the maze.",
              "Lashley did not find evidence of the engram, and the rats were still able to find their way through the maze, regardless of the size or location of the lesion.",
              "Based on his creation of lesions and the animals\u2019 reaction, he formulated the equipotentiality hypothesis: if part of one area of the brain involved in memory is damaged, another part of the same area can take over that memory function (Lashley, 1950).",
              "Although Lashley\u2019s early work did not confirm the existence of the engram, modern psychologists are making progress locating it.",
              "Many scientists believe that the entire brain is involved with memory.",
              "However, since Lashley\u2019s research, other scientists have been able to look more closely at the brain and memory.",
              "They have argued that memory is located in specific parts of the brain, and specific neurons can be recognized for their involvement in forming memories.",
              "The main parts of the brain involved with memory are the amygdala, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex.",
              "Long term memory represents the final stage in the information-processing model where informative knowledge is stored permanently (the idea of memory permanences will be discussed in a later section).",
              "Memories we have conscious storage and access to are known as explicit memory (also known as declarative memory) and are encoded by the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, and the perihinal cortex which are important structures in the limbic system.",
              "The limbic system represents a set of brain structures located on both sides of the thalamus, immediately beneath the cerebral cortex, and is important for a variety of functions including emotion, motivation, long-term memory, and olfaction.",
              "Within the category of explicit memories, episodic memories represent times, places, associated emotions and other contextual information that make up autobiographical events.",
              "These types of memories are sequences of experiences and past memories that allows the individual to figuratively travel back in time to relive or recall the event that took place at a particular time and place.",
              "Episodic memories have been demonstrated to rely heavily on neural structures that were activated during a procedure when the event was being experienced.",
              "Gottfried and colleagues (2004) used fMRI scanners to observe brain activity when participants were trying to remember images they had first viewed in the presence of a specific scent.",
              "When recalling the images participants had viewed with the accompanying smell, areas of the primary olfactory cortex (the prirform cortex) were more active compared to no scent pairing conditions (Gottfried, Smith, Rugg & Doland, 2004), suggesting memories are retrieved by reactivating the sensors areas that were active while experiencing the original event.",
              "This indicates sensory input is extremely important for episodic memories which we use to try to recreate the experience of what had occurred.",
              "Semantic memory represents a second of the three main types of explicit memory and refers to general world knowledge we possess and have collected throughout our lives.",
              "These facts about the world, ideas, meanings and concepts are mixed with our experiences from episodic memory and are emphasized by cultural differences.",
              "Within the field of cognitive neuroscience there are many views regarding the locations in the brain where semantic memories are stored.",
              "One view suggests that semantic memories are stored by the same neural structures that assist in creating episodic memories.",
              "Areas such as the medial temporal lobes, the hippocampus and fornix which encode the information and build connections with areas of the cortex where they can be accessed at a later time.",
              "Other research has suggested that the hippocampus and neighboring structures of the limbic system are more crucial to the storage and retrieval of semantic memories than areas related to motor activities or sensory processing used during the time of encoding (Vargha-Khadem et al.",
              ", 1997).",
              "Still other groups have suggested semantic memories are retrieved from areas of the frontal cortex and stored in areas of the temporal lobe (Hartley et al.",
              ", 2014, Binder et al.",
              ", 2009) .",
              "Overall, evidence suggests that many areas of the brain are related to the storage and retrieval of explicit memory as opposed to singular structures.",
              "The final main group of memory under the category of explicit memory is known as Autobiographical memory.",
              "This memory system is made up of both episodic, and semantic aspects of memory and is a collection of memories specifically related to the self.",
              "This could be how you look, your height, specific meaningful points in your life, or the general idea of your concept of self.",
              "The specific locations where this type of memory are stored and accessed are especially controversial due to the close relationship between autobiographical information and conscious experience.",
              "Conway and Pleydell-Pearce (2000) suggested a model describing autobiographical memories as transitory mental compositions stored within a self-memory system containing an autobiographical knowledge base and current goals of the working self.",
              "According to this approach, within the self memory system, control processes exist that modulate the ability to associate information to the self knowledge base by continually editing cues used to activate autobiographical memory.",
              "Therefore the concepts of self and memories related to self can be influenced by the context of self perceptions at the time of memory encoding.",
              "Modern neuroimaging research suggests that autobiographical memory is distributed throughout many complex neural networks including the recruitment neuron groups in the medial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the medial and lateral temporal cortex, the temporal-parietal junction, posterior cingulate cortex, and the cerebellum (Svoboda, E.",

              "In contrast to the memory systems covered above related to explicit encoding and retrieval memory processes, implicit memory as discussed in the previous section refers to memories that are acquired and recalled unconsciously.",
              "Modern research has suggested that the cerebellum, the basal ganglia (a group of subcortical structures associated with voluntary motor control, procedural learning, and emotion as well as many other behaviors), the motor cortex, and various areas of the cerebral cortex (Dharani, 2014) are related to the storage and retrieval of implicit memory.",
              "The amygdala is an extremely important structure for the creation and recall of both explicit and implicit memory.",
              "The main job of the amygdala is to regulate emotions, such as fear and aggression.",
              "The amygdala plays a part in how memories are stored as information storage is influenced by emotions and stress.",
              "Jocelyn (2010) paired a neutral tone with a foot shock to a group of rats to evaluate the rats fear related to the conditioning with the tone.",
              "This produced a fear memory in the rats.",
              "After being conditioned, each time the rats heard the tone, they would freeze (a defense response in rats), indicating a memory for the impending shock.",
              "Then the researchers induced cell death in neurons in the lateral amygdala, which is the specific area of the brain responsible for fear memories in rats.",
              "They found the fear memory became extinct (the fear memory faded).",
              "Because of its role in processing emotional information, the amygdala is also involved in memory consolidation: the process of transferring new learning into long-term memory.",
              "The amygdala seems to facilitate encoding memories at a deeper level when the event is emotionally arousing.",
              "For instance, in terms of the Craik and Lockhart\u2019s (1972) depth of processing model, recent research has demonstrated memories encoded of images that elicit an emotional reaction tend to be remembered more accurately and easier compared to neutral images (Xu et al.",
              ", 2014).",
              "Additionally, fMRI research has demonstrated stronger coupled activation of the amygdala and hippocampus while encoding predicts stronger and more accurate recall memory ability (Phelps, 2004).",
              "Greater activation of the amygdala predicting higher probabilities of accurate recall provides evidence illustrating how association with an emotional response can create a deeper level of processing during encoding, resulting in a stronger memory trace for later recall.",
              "The hippocampal formation is made up of a group of substructures including the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, and the subiculum all of which are located in the interior of the temporal lobe organized in a similar shape to a letter C.",
              "Together these structures represent the main areas of the brain associated with the formation of long term memories.",
              "Clark, Zola and Squire (2000) experimented with rats to learn how the hippocampus functions in memory processing.",
              "They created lesions in the hippocampi of the rats, and found that the rats demonstrated memory impairment on various tasks, such as object recognition and maze running.",
              "They concluded that the hippocampus is involved in creating memories, specifically normal recognition memory as well as spatial memory (when the memory tasks are like recall tests).",
              "The hippocampus also projects information to cortical regions that give memories meaning and connect them to other bits of information.",
              "In addition, it also plays a main role in memory consolidation: the process of transferring new learning into long-term memory.",
              "Injury to this area interferes with the ability to form new memories but does not significantly impair their ability to retrieve memories already stored as long term memories (Hudspeth et al.",
              ", 2013).",
              "One famous patient, known for years only as H.",
              "M.",
              ", had both his left and right temporal lobes (hippocampi) removed in an attempt to help control the seizures he had been suffering from for years (Corkin, Amaral, Gonza\u0301lez, Johnson, & Hyman, 1997).",
              "As a result, his declarative (explicit) memory was significantly affected, and he could not form new semantic knowledge.",
              "He lost the ability to form new memories, yet he could still remember information and events that had occurred prior to the surgery.",
              "His story provides strong evidence in humans that the hippocampus is mainly related to memory consolidation.",
              "The cerebellum plays a large role in implicit memories (procedural memory, motor learning, and classical conditioning).",
              "For example, an individual with damage to their hippocampus will still demonstrate a conditioning response to blink when they are given a series of puffs of air to their eyes.",
              "However, when researchers damaged the cerebellums of rabbits, they discovered that the rabbits were not able to learn the conditioned eye-blink response (Steinmetz, 1999;",
              "Green & Woodruff-Pak, 2000).",
              "This experiment demonstrates the important role the cerebellum plays in the formation of implicit memories and conditioned responses.",
              "Recent estimates of counts of neurons in various brain regions suggests there are about 21 to 26 billion neurons in the human cerebral cortex (Pelvig et al.",
              ", 2008), and 101 billion neurons in the cerebellum (Andersen, Korbo & Pakkenberg, 1992), yet the cerebellum makes up roughly only 10% of the brain (Siegelbaum et al.",
              ", 2013).",
              "The cerebellum is composed of a variety of different regions that receive projections from different parts of the brain and spinal cord, and project mainly to motor related brain systems in the frontal and parietal lobes.",
              "In addition to contributions to implicit memory, conditioned responses, fine motor movements, posture and coordination, the cerebellum also maintains internal representations of the external world, which allow you to navigate through your living room to find your keys in complete darkness, and professional baseball players to coordinate their movement so they can catch outfield fly balls.",
              "Other researchers have used brain imaging measuring metabolic processes, including positron emission tomography (PET) scans, to learn how people process and retain information.",
              "From these studies, the prefrontal cortex appears to be active during a variety of memory related tasks.",
              "In one study, participants had to complete two different tasks: either looking for the letter a in words (considered a perceptual task) or categorizing a noun as either living or non-living (considered a semantic task) (Kapur et al.",
              ", 1994).",
              "Participants were then asked which words they had previously seen, and reported much better recall for the semantic task compared to the perceptual task.",
              "According to PET scans, there was much more activation in the left inferior prefrontal cortex in the semantic task.",
              "In another study, encoding was associated with left frontal activity, while retrieval of information was associated with the right frontal region (Craik et al.",
              ", 1999).",
              "Another widely held view of prefrontal cortex function is that it encodes task relevant information in working memory (Baddeley, 2003).",
              "Many studies have shown greater amounts of prefrontal cortex activity during delay periods in working memory tasks demonstrating prefrontal rehearsal processes leading to the transition of information from short term working memory to long term memory (Wilson et al.",
              ", 1993;",
              "Levy & Goldman-Rakic, 2000).",
              "More recent work evaluating greater prefrontal activity during working memory task delays suggest the activity of the prefrontal cortex during these delay periods may not be neural signatures of long term memory encoding, but may actually be top-down signals that influence encoding in posterior sensory and association areas where the actual working memory representations are maintained (Lara & Wallis, 2015).",
              "There also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory, such as epinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and acetylcholine (Myhrer, 2003).",
              "There continues to be discussion and debate among researchers as to the specific roles each neurotransmitter plays (Blockland, 1996).",
              "Although there is much debate defining conclusive causal relationships between specific neurotransmitters and specific behaviors by way of experimental design, researchers are able to use two general methods to make inferences about these relationships.",

              "When humans and animals are stressed, the brain secretes more of the neurotransmitter glutamate, which helps to remember the stressful event (Szapiro et al, 2003).",
              "This provides the functional basis of a phenomenon commonly referred to as flashbulb memory.",
              "Early research into functional properties of glutamate used a compound known as proline to study responses in the avian (bird) retina.",
              "Cherkin, Eckardt and Gerbrandt (1976), found the administration of proline would reduce learning and memory in birds, suggesting that because proline acts as a glutamate antagonist (reducing the release of glutamate in the synapse), glutamate must be involved in some process related to learning and memory.",
              "Further studies used other glutamate antagonists to demonstrate that overall, reducing the amount of glutamate in the synapse reduces the ability to learn and form memories.",
              "In response to this early research, further studies have summarized a critical process related to learning and memory known as long term potentiation.",
              "This process relies on the stimulation of glutamate pathways in the brain (Malenka and Nicoll, 1999).",
              "Additionally, human conditions related to major disruption of learning and memory have consistently tended to be related to significant absences of glutamate neurotransmitters and receptors.",
              "Squire (1986) found reduced numbers of glutamate receptors in the hippocampus of amnesic patients, and Hyman and colleagues (1987) documented that extreme reductions in glutaminergic neurons in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus represent a distinct feature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
              "Until the discovery of benzodiazepines, GABA had been relatively ignored in terms of its affects on learning and memory processes.",
              "Benzodiazepines were eventually found to drive activity of GABA at one of its various types of receptors (GABAA), as well as produce dramatic learning impairments (Lister, 1985).",
              "McGaugh (1989) used local administration of GABA producing compounds (agonists) or inhibiting compounds (antagonists) demonstrating they could selectively produce learning and memory impairments or enhancements depending on whether they used the GABA agonist (learning and memory impairments) or GABA antagonists (learning and memory enhancements).",
              "This body of research suggests GABA\u2019s inhibitory nature.",
              "Specifically, a reduction of GABA in the synapse or great inhibition of the release of GABA can increase rates of firing between cells leading to greater long term potentiation and thus learning and memory consolidation.",
              "Studies using pharmachological methods to reduce the amount of acetylcholine in the synapse (by way of compounds that inhibit acetylcholine, or compounds that completely block acetylcholine receptors) within human learning tasks and animal models have found cognitive impairment related to learning and memory (Deutsch, 1983, Coyle et al.",
              ", 1983).",
              "Chapoutier (1989) additionally found that memory impairment in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease is correlated with acetylcholine functioning in the frontal cortex.",
              "Winson (1990) has provided evidence that acetylcholine function can modulate rhythmic electrical brain activity (specifically in the theta and gamma frequencies) that are important for producing optimal firing rates leading to long term potentiation.",
              "Catecholamine systems such as epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine have been documented to be recruited during spatial learning and memory recall, and blockage of acetylcholine release has been demonstrated to reduce catecholamine system function (Brandeis, Brandys & Yehuda, 1989).",
              "Hatfield and McGaugh (1999) also demonstrated using a water maze task depletion of noradrenaline affected consolidation processes making the memory trace less stable (worse later recall) and more susceptible to interference.",
              "Other chemical compounds that act as neurotransmitters to bind with receptor sites have been demonstrated to play a role in memory consolidation and recall (D\u2019Hooge & De Deyn, 2001) suggesting many different systems work together and in opposition to modulate our ability to encode and consolidate long term memories.",
              "A flashbulb memory is a highly detailed, exceptionally vivid episodic memory of the circumstances surrounding a piece of surprising, consequential, or emotionally arousing news was heard.",
              "However, even flashbulb memories can have decreased accuracy with the passage of time, even with very important events.",
              "For example, on at least three occasions, when asked how he heard about the terrorist attacks of 9/11, President George W.",
              "Bush responded inaccurately.",
              "In January 2002, less than 4 months after the attacks, the then sitting President Bush was asked how he heard about the attacks.",
              "He responded: I was sitting there, and my Chief of Staff\u2014well, first of all, when we walked into the classroom, I had seen this plane fly into the first building.",

              "2) Contrary to what President Bush recalled, no one saw the first plane hit, except people on the ground near the twin towers.",
              "The first plane was not videotaped because it was a normal Tuesday morning in New York City, until the first plane hit.",
              "Some people attributed Bush\u2019s wrong recall of the event to conspiracy theories.",
              "However, there is a much more benign explanation: human memory, even flashbulb memories, can be frail.",
              "In fact, memory can be so frail that we can convince a person an event happened to them, even when it did not.",
              "In a study, participants were given a list of 15 sleep-related words, but the word \u201csleep\u201d was not on the list.",
              "Participants recalled hearing the word \u201csleep\u201d even though they did not actually hear it (Roediger & McDermott, 2000).",
              "The researchers who discovered this named the theory after themselves and a fellow researcher, calling it the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm.",
              "Beginning with Karl Lashley, researchers and psychologists have been searching for the engram, which is the physical trace of memory.",
              "Lashley did not find the engram, but he did suggest that memories are distributed throughout the entire brain rather than stored in one specific area.",
              "Now we know that three brain areas do play significant roles in the processing and storage of different types of memories: cerebellum, hippocampus, and amygdala.",
              "The cerebellum\u2019s job is to process procedural memories;",
              "the hippocampus is where new memories are encoded;",
              "the amygdala helps determine what memories to store, and it plays a part in determining where the memories are stored based on whether we have a strong or weak emotional response to the event.",
              "Strong emotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters, as well as hormones, which strengthen memory, so that memory for an emotional event is usually stronger than memory for a non-emotional event.",
              "This is shown by what is known as the flashbulb memory phenomenon: our ability to remember significant life events.",

              "Each cerebral hemisphere can be divided into sections, or lobes, each of which specializes in different functions.",
              "To understand each lobe and its specialty, we will take a tour of the cerebral hemispheres.",
              "The two frontal lobes lie directly behind the forehead.",
              "When you plan a schedule, imagine the future, or use reasoned arguments, these two lobes do much of the work.",
              "One of the ways the frontal lobes seem to do these things is by acting as short-term storage sites, allowing one idea to be kept in mind while other ideas are considered.",
              "In the back portion of each frontal lobe is a motor cortex, which helps plan, control, and execute voluntary movement, like moving your arm or kicking a ball.",

          "All sensations, movements, thoughts, memories, and feelings are the result of signals that pass through neurons.",
          "Neurons consist of three parts: the cell body, dendrites, and the axon.",
          "Signals then pass from the dendrites through the cell body and travel away from the cell body down an axon to another neuron, a muscle cell, or cells in some other organ.",
          "When the signal reaches the end of the axon it stimulates the release of tiny sacs called vesicles.",
          "These vesicles release chemicals known as neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft."
