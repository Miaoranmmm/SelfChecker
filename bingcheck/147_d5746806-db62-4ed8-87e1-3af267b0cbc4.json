              "It is important that instructors have the necessary knowledge to effectively integrate AR/VR solutions in their lesson plans.",
              "Because AR/VR adoption is still in its early stages, many educators have not even been exposed to the technology in other contexts, such as training or personal entertainment.",
              "[100] As discussed in this report, many educators are enthusiastic about deploying these technologies in their classrooms. The Department of Education should build on this enthusiasm by offering educators training and resources for using immersive technologies.",
              "For example, the department should provide state education agencies with funding to train educators on how to use different AR/VR devices and applications and identify the best ways to integrate AR/VR technologies to meet state-level standards for classroom and distance learning.",
              "In addition, the department should provide funding for educators to enroll in courses to learn how to create basic immersive content so they can create their own materials to meet specific learning objectives.",

              "[102] The Department of Education should integrate key AR/VR skills into existing digital literacy resources and initiatives for both K-12 and adult learners, including health and safety measures, participant conduct in multiuser experiences, and the fundamentals of content development.",
              "Educational AR/VR content remains in a chicken-and-egg cycle.",
              "Although quantity is expanding, there is still a relative dearth of quality, relevant, age-appropriate content.",
              "This in turn keeps demand for AR/VR solutions relatively low, which discourages further efforts to develop such content.",

              "[104] Government investment in immersive educational content could break this cycle.",
              "[105] There are three key channels through which this could be achieved.",
              "First, federal government bodies that already produce educational content, such as NASA and the Smithsonian Institution, should invest in developing web-based immersive content.",
              "By increasing the amount of quality and relevant immersive educational content available, these investments could encourage more educators and institutions to invest in the devices necessary to fully experience it.",
              "Further, the Department of Education should include AR/VR solutions as a priority in its investment and grantmaking activities.",
              "This could incentivize innovation both in content development and the use of these technologies in different educational contexts and subjects.",
              "Finally, the federal government should encourage colleges and universities to establish AR/VR labs and resources on their campuses.",
              "As discussed in this report, these spaces could spark interest in immersive technologies as educational tools (thereby increasing demand for content), and also encourage students and faculty to develop innovative uses of these technologies across disciplines, which would increase the range of content available.",
              "Although the cost of immersive solutions is going down, it is still prohibitive for many, particularly districts and institutions with limited resources.",
              "Schools that do have the budget for new technology solutions will likely prioritize established, proven technologies such as laptops and tablets over newer devices and applications\u2014such as AR/VR\u2014that carry higher uncertainty and unfamiliarity.",
              "Fortunately, schools do not necessarily need hundreds of high-end headsets to take advantage of the benefits AR/VR educational tools offer.",
              "Many of the tools highlighted in this report are accessible on web-enabled devices including computers, tablets, and mobile phones.",
              "Funding for technology-access initiatives should prioritize proposals that include provisions for using these devices as immersive educational tools.",
              "In addition, to accelerate adoption of more advanced solutions (e.",
              "g., heads-up AR and MR displays or VR headsets) in educational settings and ensure these technologies are accessible to as many learners as possible, the Department of Education should provide funding for public schools and community colleges to establish AR/VR labs that can provide immersive technology resources to students, educators, and community members.",
              "Initially, the department should provide funding for a small number of pilot centers, with preference given to rural and low-income districts where learners stand to benefit most from the opportunities these technologies present for distance and experiential learning.",
              "These preliminary initiatives could inform guidance and best practices for additional funding and encourage state and local governments to implement similar resources.",
              "The use cases highlighted in this report represent only a sample of the ever-expanding field of immersive education.",
              "As the technology continues to advance and gain more widespread adoption, new possibilities will undoubtedly emerge.",
              "Going forward, it will be important to ensure instructors have the necessary skills and knowledge to implement AR/VR solutions in their lesson plans and create opportunities to develop necessary content, including equipping students and educators with the skills to do so.",

              "It makes sense, as teachers and parents we\u2019re often hesitant to allow too much freedom and leash to our students and children for fear something terrible may happen.",
              "While that\u2019s certainly a possibility, especially if we\u2019re not thoughtful and perceptive about the limits of what they can handle, the reality is that by not allowing our students and children opportunities for autonomy and independence we\u2019re doing them a disservice, and in some cases limiting opportunities for academic and emotional growth.",
              "Teachers often fall into two categories when we discuss autonomy.",
              "Some see that as part of our project design rubric and model and feel they\u2019re supposed to turn that knob up to 11, any limits on student autonomy are a failing on the part of the teacher.",
              "That\u2019s simply not true, there are of course plenty of times and ways in which you\u2019ll want to more tightly manage students and your classroom.",

              "Broadly construed, personalized education refers to the adaptation of instruction to a specific learner and is juxtaposed with \u201ctraditional\u201d instruction that is targeted at entire groups of learners.",
              "By changing the mode, content, or rate of instruction in accordance with some characteristic of the learner, it is suggested that individual shortcomings of learners can be addressed and their resources leveraged (Dockterman 2018).",
              "A key argument for the efficacy of personalization can be drawn from empirical demonstrations that learning gains in one-on-one tutoring are up to two standard deviations higher than in conventional classroom instruction (Bloom 1984).",

              "Bloom (1984) explained the considerable effect of one-on-one tutoring in his studies by arguing that a personal tutor is better able to assess the individual characteristics of the specific learner and to select appropriate instructional methods and materials\u2014such as identifying the zone of proximal development (Rieber and Carton 1988) and choosing tasks that are located within it.",

              "The assumption behind these learner-driven approaches is that learners will generally know best what is best for them.",
              "Psychological research on metacognition, however, shows that this is not necessarily the case and learners do not always select the most appropriate tasks (Nugteren et al.",

              "We will then examine different approaches to personalize learning in a classroom setting, before moving on to personalized education in digital learning environments.",
              "The main paradigm under which psychology has studied personalization is called aptitude-treatment interactions (ATI).",
              "The concept was established by Lee Cronbach, who saw in it the synthesis of correlational (aptitudes) and experimental (treatment) psychology (Cronbach 1957).",
              "Using methods of correlational psychology, interindividual differences in relevant characteristics (aptitudes) are assessed and used to group people with similar values together.",
              "Then, relying on experimental psychology, people from these groups get randomly assigned to different treatments.",
              "If a disordinal interaction is found (group A learns best under treatment A, group B under treatment B), there is evidence for the efficacy of providing learners with different treatments, based on that particular aptitude.",
              "The existence of these interactions is a necessary prerequisite for any form of personalization to show direct effects on learning.",
              "Without the existence of ATIs, some learners may learn better than others and some instructional parameters may foster learning better than others but there would be no advantage of adapting instruction to specific learners.",
              "Over the following 40 years, a lot of research was carried out using this paradigm\u2014with remarkably sparse robust results (see Tobias 1989).",
              "While a few disordinal interactions between aptitude measures and different treatments have been found (see Cronbach 1975), the vast majority of ATI studies found no or only ordinal interactions (both groups learn better under treatment A, but the difference between treatments is bigger for one group).",
              "Cronbach and Snow\u2019s (1977) exhaustive review of the early literature on ATI studies concluded that \u201cno aptitude by treatment interactions is so well confirmed that they can be used directly as guides to instruction\u201d (page 492).",
              "Several more recent reviews also reached the same conclusion, speculating on different reasons for this apparent failure, including a focus on laboratory experiments (Shapiro 1975), factorially complex aptitude measures (Bracht 1968), a focus on the surface structure of treatment (Tobias 1989), and low specificity of to-be-learned content (Driscoll 1987).",
              "Besides these mainly conceptual shortcomings, there exists also a series of methodological concerns that may lead to a reduced prevalence of demonstrable ATIs, chief among them a disregard for multilevel structure of data, a lack of statistical power (Preacher and Sterba 2019), and a focus on linear modeling, which may lead to biased or false-negative results when the true relationships between aptitudes and treatments are nonlinear (Bauer and Cai 2009;",
              "Dumas et al.",
              "2020).",
              "Of note, none of the reviews on ATIs has reached the conclusion that they simply do not, or only in very rare circumstances, exist.",
              "The concept has such a high face validity that it seemed more reasonable to assume that researchers just had not yet looked in the right places (Tobias 1989), or in the correct way (Shapiro 1975).",
              "The demonstrated efficacy of data-based individualization also strongly implies some kind of ATIs existing;",
              "no other mechanism has been proposed so far to be responsible for these effects.",
              "A special case of ATI is the expertise reversal effect (Kalyuga 2007).",
              "The expertise reversal effect is present if a certain instructional parameter leads to increased learning gain in novices, but decreased learning gains in experts.",
              "This effect is particularly interesting in the context of this paper as it highlights the need for a dynamic conceptualization of aptitudes.",
              "Instructional parameters that prove effective at the beginning of a learning process (low expertise) can actively impede learning as expertise grows.",
              "Even an intervention as simple as reading a short text can drastically alter the effectiveness of subsequent instruction (Rey and Fischer 2013).",
              "If ATIs exist, why are they so hard to find even when researchers are actively looking for them?",
              "We believe that the aptitude concept used in most ATI studies, which stems from differential/correlational psychology, does not suffice to answer questions about differential effectiveness of treatments.",
              "Instead, a dynamic perspective is needed for the following reason.",
              "By design, ATI research focuses on average differences between groups of students and from there tries to draw conclusions about the learning processes of individual students.",
              "Since learning processes are always intraindividual processes, trying to approach them by analyzing interindividual differences is suboptimal.",
              "Many different combinations of long-term (e.",
              "g., maturational and environmental) and short-term (e.",
              "g., affective-motivational) processes can lead to the same value on a scale of interindividual differences (Borsboom et al.",

              "Studies on the assistance dilemma (Koedinger et al.",
              "2008) generally imply an inverted U-shaped relationship between task difficulty (after assistance) and learning progress, where too little assistance can leave the learner unable to make progress on the task, and too much assistance does not require the learner to engage in the cognitive processes necessary for deep processing (and thus robust learning).",
              "Studies on the expertise reversal effect (Kalyuga et al.",

              "While there are examples of successful personalization based on relatively stable pretest measures, empirical evidence and conceptual considerations strongly point towards an advantage of dynamic modeling, at least for those characteristics that show substantial intraindividual variance.",
              "Assessing such characteristics at a high frequency throughout the learning process provides a variety of relevant information.",
              "It allows to separate individual characteristics at the macro, meso, and micro levels.",

              "Furthermore, the amount of intraindividual variability around average levels or trends may provide useful information.",
              "For example, sustained strong variability in task performance can give hints to instructors that the performance bottleneck lies in a highly volatile characteristic, such as affect, motivation, or metacognitive control, rather than in a stable (or monotonously increasing) characteristic such as domain knowledge.",

              "We argue that a dynamic conceptualization is also needed to bring the science of personalized education (and ATI) forward.",
              "This dynamic conceptualization undoubtedly brings with it an additional load for teaching agents.",
              "They not only need to regularly assess relevant parameters but also have to use this information to inform subsequent instructional decisions.",
              "This load can be partially constrained by knowledge about which characteristics can be reasonably expected to vary over which timescale and the educational relevance of this variance.",
              "The presented framework serves as a starting point for such considerations.",
              "By mapping out the decision space for teaching agents, we identified relevant kinds of learner parameters on each timescale and provided some rough classification of the different levels of instructional practice that can be adapted: goal setting, design of instructional units/task selection, and assistance.",
              "The proposed framework further constrains the selection of both learner parameters and instructional parameters to those that are actually relevant on the specific timescale.",
              "It also provides a frame of reference for the localization of future research questions regarding personalized education by systematically differentiating between different kinds of learner dynamics, the learner characteristics they apply to, and the instructional levers that can be manipulated.",
              "There has been substantial progress in research on personalized education in recent years, not just towards more precise measurement and conceptualization of aptitudes, but also towards a systematic classification of instructional adaptations.",
              "Nevertheless, we are still a long way off from being able to reliably describe adaptations at different timescales based on learner characteristics.",
              "In most formative assessment studies, the instructional adaptations are left up to the practitioners, providing almost no mechanistical information regarding causes of the observed benefit.",
              "Most classical ATI studies only define the treatment in very broad categories (learner vs. teacher driven, high vs. low structure material) and thus fail to account for the complex nature of instructional practice.",

              "What does it mean to be a successful learner or graduate in today\u2019s world?",
              "While in years past, a solid acquisition of the \u201cthree Rs\u201d (reading, writing, and arithmetic) and mastery in the core academic subjects may have been the measure of attainment, the world of the 21st century requires a radically different orientation.",
              "To participate effectively in the increasingly complex societies and globalized economy that characterize today\u2019s world, students need to think critically, communicate effectively, collaborate with diverse peers, solve complex problems, adopt a global mindset, and engage with information and communications technologies, to name but just a few requirements.",
              "The new report from Brookings, \u201cEducation system alignment for 21st century skills: Focus on assessment,\u201d illuminates this imperative in depth.",
              "Recognizing that traditional education systems have generally not been preparing learners to face such challenges, the global education community has increasingly talked about and mobilized in favor of the changes required.",
              "This has resulted in a suite of initiatives and research around the broad area of \u201c21st century skills,\u201d which culminated most notably with the adoption of Sustainable Development Goal 4 and the Education 2030 agenda, including Target 4.",
              "7, which commits countries to ensure that learners acquire knowledge and skills in areas such as sustainable development, human rights, gender equality, global citizenship, and others.",
              "In this landscape, Global Partnership for Education (GPE) has a core mandate of improving equity and learning by strengthening education systems. GPE supports developing countries, many of which are affected by fragility and conflict, to develop and implement robust education sector plans.",
              "Depending on the country, GPE implementation grants support a broad range of activities including teacher training, textbook provision, interventions to promote girls\u2019 education, incentives for marginalized groups, the strengthening of data and learning assessment systems, early childhood education, and many other areas.",
              "This work is buttressed by thematic work at the global level, including in the area of learning assessment.",
              "The strengthening of learning assessment systems is a strategic priority for GPE because of its relevance to both improving learning outcomes and ensuring effective and efficient education systems, which are two of the three key goals of the GPE strategic plan for the 2016-2020 period.",
              "The work on learning assessment includes the Assessment for Learning (A4L) initiative, which aims to strengthen learning assessment systems and to promote a holistic measurement of learning.",
              "Under A4L, we are undertaking a landscape review on the measurement of 21st century skills, using a definition derived from Binkley et.",
              "al.",
              "and Scoular and Care: \u201c21st century skills are tools that can be universally applied to enhance ways of thinking, learning, working and living in the world.",
              "The skills include critical thinking/reasoning, creativity/creative thinking, problem solving, metacognition, collaboration, communication and global citizenship.",
              "21st century skills also include literacies such as reading literacy, writing literacy, numeracy, information literacy, ICT [information and communications technologies] digital literacy, communication and can be described broadly as learning domains.",
              "\u201d Using this lens, the landscape review examines the research literature, the efforts of GPE partners that have been active in this space, and data collected from a sample of countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia in regard to the assessment of these skills.",
              "These research efforts were led by Brookings and coordinated by the UNESCO offices in Dakar and Bangkok.",
              "As another important piece of this work, we are also taking stock of the latest education sector plans and implementation grants of these same countries (nine in sub-Saharan Africa and six in Asia), to explore the extent to which the integration of 21st century skills is reflected in sector plans and, vitally, in their implementation.",
              "Though the work is in progress, the initial findings provide food for thought.",
              "Reflecting the conclusions of the new report by Brookings, as well as its earlier breadth of work on skills mapping, a large majority of these 15 countries note ambitious objectives related to 21st century skills in their education sector plans, particularly in their vision or mission statements and/or statements of policy priorities.",
              "\u201cSkills\u201d such as creativity and innovation, critical thinking, problem-solving, decisionmaking, life and career skills, citizenship, personal and social responsibility, and information and communications technology literacy were strongly featured, as opposed to areas such as collaboration, communication, information literacy, and metacognition.",
              "However, when we look at the planned interventions noted in these sector plans, there is not a strong indication that countries plan to operationalize their intentions to promote 21st century skills.",
              "Not surprisingly then, when we look at their implementation grants, which are one of the financing instruments through which education sector plans are implemented, only two of the 15 grants examined include activities aimed at promoting 21st century skills among their program components.",
              "Because the GPE model mandates that national governments determine the program components and allocation of resources for these within their grant, the bottom line seems to echo the findings of the Brookings report: vision and aspiration are rife, but action is scarce.",
              "While the sample of countries studied in this exercise is small (and other countries\u2019 education sector plans and grants may well include integration of 21st century skills), it\u2019s the disconnect between the 15 countries\u2019 policy orientation around these skills and their implementation that is telling.",
              "Why this gap?",
              "Why, if countries espouse the importance of 21st century skills in their sector plans, do they not concretely move to addressing them in their implementation?",
              "The reasons for this may be manifold, but the challenges highlighted by the Brookings report in terms of incorporating a 21st century learning agenda in education systems are indeed telling.",
              "As a field, we still have much work to do to understand the nature of these skills, to develop learning progressions for them, and to design appropriate and authentic assessment of them.",
              "In other words, it may be that countries have difficulty in imagining how to move from rhetoric to reality.",
              "However, in another perspective, there may be a challenge associated with how countries (and the broader education community) perceive 21st century skills in general.",
              "In contexts of limited resources, crowded curricula, inadequately trained teachers, fragility, weak governance, and other challenges that are characteristic of GPE partner countries, there is sometimes an unfortunate tendency to view 21st century skills and the \u201cbasics\u201d as a tradeoff.",
              "In such settings, there can be a perception that 21st century skills are the concern of more advanced or higher-income countries.",
              "It is thus no wonder that, in the words of the Brookings report, \u201ca global mobilization of efforts to respond to the 21CS [21st century skills] shift is non-existent, and individual countries struggle alone to plan the shift.",
              "\u201d This suggests that those who are committed to a holistic view of education have much work to do in terms of research, sharing of experience, capacity building, and advocacy around the potential and need for all countries, regardless of context, to move in this direction.",
              "The Brookings report makes a very valuable contribution in this regard.",
              "GPE\u2019s landscape review, which will be published this spring, will inform how the partnership thinks about and approaches 21st century skills in its work and will thereby provide a complementary perspective.",

Over the past several decades, there has been increased demand for formal education to include the development of generic skills as well as traditional academic subjects, i.",

              "These skills for today\u2019s rapidly changing society, such as communication, problem solving, collaboration, and critical thinking, are being acknowledged increasingly all over the world.",
              "The big challenge, however, is knowing how to support and teach these skills in schools and classrooms. In the absence of well-established, evidence-based approaches that demonstrate how to teach the skills and show how students have benefited from the process, countries are selecting a variety of paths to explore optimal models.",
              "For example, the \u201cSingapore Swiss Roll\u201d approach, which is starting to be implemented across the core curriculum, adopts a value-centric framework that incorporates 21st century competencies, including civic literacy, global awareness, and cross-cultural skills;",

              "A major recommendation from an Asia-based review of the challenges facing countries as they adopt or integrate \u201c21st century skills\u201d, was to undertake in-depth research into the nature and development of the skills themselves.",
              "If we don\u2019t understand what skills actually \u201clook like\u201d as children and adolescents at different levels of competence demonstrate them, then expecting our subject-based and trained teachers to teach them is an unfair impost at best and destined for failure at worst.",
              "We have historically taught children based on curricula\u2014roadmaps to learning.",
              "These curricula have outlined the substance of what is to be taught, sequences to follow to ensure movement from the simple to complex, and expectations about the quality of anticipated student performance or knowledge.",
              "Where are the curricula for skills?",
              "Surely, in order for teachers and students to know what simple forms of communication through to sophisticated look like, they need a roadmap.",
              "This roadmap then provides the guidelines for how educators can integrate development of student skills within existing and reform subject-based curricula.",
              "Creation of these roadmaps requires us to think developmentally, to identify how we develop the competencies.",
              "An important component is to identify what demonstration of these competencies might look like and how to elicit or stimulate performance so that we know what the individual is ready to learn.",
              "In this new blog series, we will highlight classroom practices that provide concrete examples of how just a few different 21st century skills could be seamlessly integrated throughout the school day\u2014not as a subject area, but by making it part of the classroom culture.",

              "It then focuses on methods that help get to the root of what is actually, truly, going on for them and asks questions like what are their problems and concerns?",
              "What are their thoughts?",
              "Design thinking can begin by observation of a person or group of people in their day-to-day environment to see how they consciously or unconsciously interact with a product, physical or digital, and \u201cuse\u201d it to meet their needs, some of which can be hidden or much harder to identify.",

              "The practitioners, as observers to the patient, had no idea of the actual experience of their patient until they underwent it themselves.",

              "Another method, prototyping, has been around for quite some time and has become more popular with the use of Adobe XD, Figma and Invision.",
              "This method can be built upon by combining it with design thinking methods like think-aloud testing, where a user says what they are thinking and doing out loud.",
