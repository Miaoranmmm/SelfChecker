    "query": "What is the most significant and promising approach for developing sustainable and eco-friendly packaging materials, and how can this be scaled up to reduce waste and pollution in the manufacturing and distribution industries?",
    "response": "That's a great question. There are many approaches for developing sustainable and eco-friendly packaging materials, but one of the most promising ones is using **bioplastics** and **plant-based extracts** that are biodegradable, reusable, and free of hazardous chemicals[^4^]. Bioplastics are plastics made from renewable sources like cornstarch, sugarcane, algae, or vegetable oils[^3^]. Plant-based extracts are materials derived from plants like wheat, wood, bamboo, or seaweed[^4^] [^1^]. These materials can reduce waste and pollution by decomposing quickly and naturally in the environment, or by being recycled or reused for other purposes.\n\nTo scale up this approach, some of the challenges that need to be addressed are: improving the performance and durability of these materials; reducing the cost and energy consumption of their production; ensuring their availability and accessibility in different regions; and increasing consumer awareness and demand for them[^3^]. Some possible solutions are: investing in research and innovation to develop better bioplastics and plant-based extracts; collaborating with farmers and suppliers to ensure sustainable sourcing of raw materials; creating incentives and regulations to encourage the use of eco-friendly packaging; and educating consumers about the benefits and impacts of their packaging choices[^3^] [^1^].",

              "Once the polymeric material has been processed and formed into its final and commercially relevant shape, typically using heat, they are called plastics1.",
              "Most plastics are thermoplastics composed of linear polymer chains that allow thermal reshaping, such as those used in bottles and textiles, whereas some polymers are crosslinked during processing to form thermosets, which are tougher than thermoplastics and their shape is largely unaffected by temperature, such as those used in car tyres and epoxies.",
              "In this Review, we refer to these materials as \u2018polymers\u2019 when discussing their physicochemical properties and their synthesis before processing into their final shape, and use \u2018plastics\u2019 to describe the more commercially relevant forms of polymers processed into products.",

              "Plastics are also essential to many aspects of sustainability: lightweight plastic materials improve the fuel efficiency of cars and aeroplanes, plastic insulators can increase energy savings and plastic food packaging increases shelf life, which can reduce food waste2.",
              "Annual plastic production is >380 million tonnes and increasing at an annual rate of 4%;",
              "consequently, 6,300 million tonnes of plastic waste have been generated since 1950 (refs3,4).",

              "In a circular economy, the use of non-renewable resources and waste production is minimized, while reuse and recycling dominate the life cycles of materials.",
              "Although most commercial plastics are made from fossil resources, these materials can also be made from renewable resources and are commonly referred to as bioplastics.",
              "In this case, the monomers are extracted or synthesized from biomass compounds (such as sugars in plants) and then polymerized to either make a direct replacement for an existing plastic, such as polyethylene (PE), or novel polymers, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs).",
              "Biomass extraction can also yield non-synthetic natural polymers, such as starch, natural rubber and proteins.",
              "Note that, although the term \u2018bioplastic\u2019 is frequently used, it remains misunderstood, owing to the ambiguity of the definition (Box 1).",

              "Bioplastics that are 100% bio-based are currently produced at a scale of ~2 million tonnes per year and are considered a part of future circular economies to help achieve some of the United Nations\u2019 (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, such as by diverting from fossil resources, introducing new recycling or degradation pathways and using less toxic reagents and solvents in production processes5,8,9,10,11.",
              "Depending on type, bioplastics can offer improved circularity by using renewable (non-fossil) resources, a lower carbon footprint, biodegradation as an alternative end-of-life (EOL) option and improved material properties.",
              "These benefits, however, are highly dependent on several factors, including the chemical structure, the manufacturing process and the most likely EOL scenario.",

              "Similar to traditional plastics, bioplastics also raise concerns relating to the leaching of monomers, oligomers and additives, and, therefore, require the same scrutiny in product design and formulation14.",
              "Given the trade-offs, the implementation of bioplastics faces several challenges (Box 1).",

              "The overall capacity of this form of recycling is, however, very limited: globally, ~10% of PET and high-density PE is recycled, whereas for polystyrene and PP, the numbers are closer to zero.",

              "Deposit-refund systems and EPR schemes can increase return and collection rates for post-consumer plastics and increase the quality of the plastic collected187.",
              "The plastic that is most commonly mechanically recycled is PET from beverage bottles.",
              "As a polycondensation polymer, its quality can be upgraded within existing recycling streams, wherein solid-state post-polymerization (effectively, heating of recycled flakes under vacuum to remove volatile polymerization by-products) increases the molecular weight of recyclates for commercial applications.",

              "As this approach provides monomers suitable for repolymerization into high-quality condensation polymers, such as polyesters and polyamides, the design and use of chemically recyclable polymers in plastic applications can solve persisting EOL issues and support a circular materials economy55,181.",
              "In thermolysis, typically polyolefins, which do not possess hydrolysable functional groups, are pyrolysed at temperatures of ~200\u2013800 \u00b0C (depending on the polymer and catalyst used) in the total or partial absence of O2.",
              "Under these conditions, the C\u2013C bonds break, converting the polymer back into feedstock in the form of hydrocarbon oil or gas, or directly into olefin monomers.",

              "This process can be enhanced by embedding metallic catalysts in the polymer203.",
              "Similarly, oxo-degradation (that is, decomposition by oxidation) can be triggered by metals;",
              "however, this can lead to fragmentation into microplastics and insufficient digestion.",
              "Thus, oxo-degradation has been restricted in the EU and Switzerland19,204.",
              "Despite earlier hopes, biodegradation is non-trivial, as the rate of biodegradation is highly dependent on a polymer\u2019s chemical structure, stabilizing additives, the surrounding conditions (such as the presence of H2O and O2) and any microorganisms used205.",

              "Moreover, a recent study, which compared seven traditional plastics, four bioplastics, and one made from both fossil fuel and renewable sources, determined that bioplastic production resulted in greater amounts of pollutants, owing to the fertilizers and pesticides employed in cultivating the crops, in addition to the chemical processing needed to turn organic material into the plastic [109].",
              "It was also found that bioplastics contribute more to ozone depletion than traditional fossil fuel-derived plastics [110].",
              "Furthermore, it has been found that bio-based PET, a hybrid bioplastic, is a potential carcinogen and also has pernicious toxic effects on earth ecosystems [111, 112].",
              "At the same time, bioplastics also have eco-friendly characteristics.",
              "For example, production of PLA saves two-thirds of the energy needed to make traditional plastics [51].",
              "Moreover, it has been scientifically established that during the biodegradation of PLA bioplastics, there is no net increase in carbon dioxide gas [58].",
              "This was evidenced by the fact that the plants from which they were produced absorbed the same amount of carbon dioxide when they were cultivated as was released during their biodegradation [58, 113].",
              "Notably, PLA emits 70% less greenhouse gases when it degrades in landfills [30].",
              "Other studies have also found that substituting traditional plastic with corn-based PLA bioplastics can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% [110, 112].",
              "Such examples provide assurance that the future production of new bioplastics can be accomplished by using renewable energy while substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",
              "To comprehensively compare bioplastics with conventional plastics, it is crucial to evaluate bioplastics' environmental impact from the initial production, utilization, and finally to disposal [114, 115].",
              "The most important tool to evaluate the environmental impact of bioplastics and/or conventional plastics is life cycle assessment (LCA) or cradle-to-grave analysis, a process that can help determine the overall impact of a bioplastic on the environment at each stage in its life cycle [115, 116].",
              "This signifies that the whole life of this industrial product is evaluated, starting from the raw material extraction to the various stages of materials processing, manufacture, distribution, and use [116].",
              "An LCA impact study involves the assessment of global warming, human toxicity, abiotic depletion, eutrophication and acidification [117, 118].",
              "In addition, when conducting the LCA, it is essential to consider Land Use Change (LUC)-related emissions and the cost and benefits of bioplastic disposal [119].",
              "LUC is a guide to consider when land is converted to spaces for composting, biofuel feedstock production or other uses [120].",
              "It is essential to understand the LCA of different bioplastic composting, recycling, and disposal scenarios.",
              "Indeed, a meticulously performed LCAs can serve as an important reference material for policymakers [121].",
              "For example, numerous protocols have been established to conduct LCA/cradle-to-grave studies on PLA bioplastics currently in the market [122].",
              "These studies involve comparisons of their LCA with that of fossil-fuel plastics such as polyethylene and PET [123].",
              "For instance, a recent study revealed that there was a significant reduction in greenhouse gases when manufactured bottles were made by subsisting 20% of the PET bottles with PLA bottles [124].",
              "This study was carried out by using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method and a LCA cradle-to-grave study [124, 125, 126].",
              "Another study, using the Global Warming Potential (GWP) guide in which the greenhouse gas emission was measured in kg of CO2 equivalents, showed that it was possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by substituting petroleum-based plastics with bioplastics [127, 128].",
              "Additional, separate LCAs for other bioplastics can also provide such valuable data.",
              "LCA also provides an important means of identifying the best method of bioplastic waste management and disposal.",
              "For example, LCA has revealed that incineration or landfilling of bioplastic products is not a useful alternative [94, 129].",
              "A plausible solution to bioplastic waste management problem was confirmed by adhering to the LUC emissions principle, which established the reliability of bioplastics as an excellent replacement for petroleum-based plastics [130, 131].",
              "Compared to conventional petroleum-derived plastics, the use of PLA and thermoplastic starch significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions, in the case of the former, by 50\u201370% [132].",
              "Similarly, bio-urethanes and poly (trimethyleneterephthalate) (PTT) have respectively 36% and 44% lower greenhouse gas emissions than their petroleum-derived counterparts [132].",
              "However, to continue the smart management of bioplastic wastes, it has been proposed that the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions must reach zero LUC emissions [119, 130].",
              "Future studies should focus on conducting individual LCAs for the ever-growing range of bioplastics, many of which have been discussed earlier in this review.",
              "A variety of bioplastics have been developed to address environmental issues associated with conventional petroleum-derived plastics \u2013 from well-known and well-studied biodegradable and/or bio-based plastics like PHB, PCL and PLA to recent additions such as mycelium-based and chitin-based biopolymers.",
              "Importantly, however, bioplastics are associated with some shortcomings.",
              "It should be understood that similar to petroleum-based plastics, some bio-based plastics cannot be recycled.",
              "Consequently, many biodegradable bioplastics end up in landfills, which decompose gradually and produce methane gas.",
              "For these reasons, people are starting to believe that bioplastics should be used only when needed, with tailor-made properties.",
              "However, it is important that we weigh these environment-related shortcomings of bioplastics against the harms caused by conventional plastics.",
              "Studies, including several discussed in the present review article, show that the harms associated with bioplastics are still less severe when compared to conventional plastics.",
              "Moreover, as new types of bioplastics such as those discussed in this article keep becoming developed by academic and industry-oriented researchers, it is possible that the drawbacks of currently used bioplastics can be addressed adequately.",
              "In order to confirm the eco-friendliness of these new bioplastics, future studies should conduct thorough LCAs and LUC analyses.",

              "Almost half of the plastic produced around the world is single-use plastic.",
              "1 From straws to packaging material, this plastic not only dominates mounds of non-biodegradable waste but is also amongst the most difficult to manage and recycle.",

              "Since a large section of the plastic waste is single-use plastic, working towards replacing products in this segment with bioplastic composites can be of significant value.",

              "2 This plastic takes over 400 years to degrade.",
              "Thus, having a sustainable alternative in bioplastics that take significantly less time to decompose not only benefits the environment, but also reduces the stress on land resources due to lesser landfills and recycling centres.",
              "Another way to deal with the difficult-to-manage plastic waste that we produce was to mix it with naturally obtained renewable polymers to make bio-based plastics.",
              "They are not simply a blend of synthetic (fossil fuel-based) and natural (plant or animal-based) polymers.",
              "While they do contain around 60% synthetic polymers and more than 40% bio polymers to maintain strength, their production involves including several additives and auto oxidants to facilitate the degradation of both the natural and synthetic part,\" Dr Sailaja explained.",

              "\"Microbes in our soil and natural surroundings attack the natural part of the bio-based plastic and degrade it while ultraviolet rays from the sun facilitate chemical degradation of the synthetic part through oxidation.",

              "She added that TERI has recorded their degradation to be between six to seven months in lab tests.",
              "While the environment friendly nature of bioplastics and the relatively low carbon nature of bio-based plastics is encouraging, it is important to understand the viability of their real-world application and possible use cases.",

              "\"This industry is still emerging.",
              "Also, while producing bioplastics is relatively inexpensive when compared to microbial plastics, the process is still not as cost effective as producing synthetic plastics.",
              "Further, the fact that bioplastics are not at a par in strength and durability with synthetic plastics whose shelf life is years-long adds to the reluctance in its widescale adoption.",
              "As plant or animal-based material is a key ingredient in bioplastics, making them hydrophobic (water repellant) is still a work in progress,\" Dr Sailaja said.",
              "\"Strong policies, research and development (R&D) investments, and subsidies from the government will help strengthen the bioplastic industry.",

              "With its centuries long span of degradation, and its gross mismanagement having lasting effects on the environment, dealing with plastic waste has become paramount.",
              "Since most of the recycling of plastic in India is done by the informal sector, the chances of it being downcycled are much higher.",

              "These properties are determined by the structure of the repeating building blocks of the polymers: the monomers.",
              "Once the polymeric material has been processed and formed into its final and commercially relevant shape, typically using heat, they are called plastics1.",
              "Most plastics are thermoplastics composed of linear polymer chains that allow thermal reshaping, such as those used in bottles and textiles, whereas some polymers are crosslinked during processing to form thermosets, which are tougher than thermoplastics and their shape is largely unaffected by temperature, such as those used in car tyres and epoxies.",
              "In this Review, we refer to these materials as \u2018polymers\u2019 when discussing their physicochemical properties and their synthesis before processing into their final shape, and use \u2018plastics\u2019 to describe the more commercially relevant forms of polymers processed into products.",
              "Many of these materials have an integral role in modern life and are especially important in the transportation, food, health-care and energy industries.",
              "Plastics are also essential to many aspects of sustainability: lightweight plastic materials improve the fuel efficiency of cars and aeroplanes, plastic insulators can increase energy savings and plastic food packaging increases shelf life, which can reduce food waste2.",
              "Annual plastic production is >380 million tonnes and increasing at an annual rate of 4%;",
              "consequently, 6,300 million tonnes of plastic waste have been generated since 1950 (refs3,4).",

              "Although most commercial plastics are made from fossil resources, these materials can also be made from renewable resources and are commonly referred to as bioplastics.",
              "In this case, the monomers are extracted or synthesized from biomass compounds (such as sugars in plants) and then polymerized to either make a direct replacement for an existing plastic, such as polyethylene (PE), or novel polymers, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs).",
              "Biomass extraction can also yield non-synthetic natural polymers, such as starch, natural rubber and proteins.",
              "Note that, although the term \u2018bioplastic\u2019 is frequently used, it remains misunderstood, owing to the ambiguity of the definition (Box 1).",
              "Bioplastics are plastics that are either made from renewable resources (\u2018bio-based\u2019), are biodegradable, are made through biological processes or a combination of these.",
              "Some biodegradable but fossil-based plastics are also referred to as bioplastics2,5;",
              "however, the use of this terminology is advised against, as it is misleading6,7.",
              "Bioplastics that are 100% bio-based are currently produced at a scale of ~2 million tonnes per year and are considered a part of future circular economies to help achieve some of the United Nations\u2019 (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, such as by diverting from fossil resources, introducing new recycling or degradation pathways and using less toxic reagents and solvents in production processes5,8,9,10,11.",
              "Depending on type, bioplastics can offer improved circularity by using renewable (non-fossil) resources, a lower carbon footprint, biodegradation as an alternative end-of-life (EOL) option and improved material properties.",
              "These benefits, however, are highly dependent on several factors, including the chemical structure, the manufacturing process and the most likely EOL scenario.",
              "All these factors have to be evaluated across the life cycle, along metrics such as climate impact, ecotoxicity and recyclability, using tools such as a life cycle assessment (LCA) to elucidate the environmental benefit over alternatives6,12,13.",
              "Similar to traditional plastics, bioplastics also raise concerns relating to the leaching of monomers, oligomers and additives, and, therefore, require the same scrutiny in product design and formulation14.",
              "Given the trade-offs, the implementation of bioplastics faces several challenges (Box 1).",
              "In this Review, we discuss the benefits and risks of technologies for the production and recycling of bioplastics towards informing circular economy principles.",

              "Note that biodegradation refers to the depolymerization of polymers by biological organisms, whereas composting is a form of biodegradation that yields CO2, H2O, heat and humus;",
              "therefore, the compostability of a polymer depends on the microbial and chemical environment.",
              "Bio-based plastics are not, by default, more sustainable than fossil-based plastics.",
              "Although use of renewable resources can reduce carbon emissions, other factors along the life cycle can offset these benefits.",
              "Sustainability benefits and trade-offs must be elucidated from life cycle assessments that scrutinize all steps along the fossil-based and bio-based plastic life cycles, from feedstock harvesting, through various processing steps to end-of-life scenarios6,13,172.",

              "In this scenario, the production of bioplastics mainly from polysaccharides such as starch is a growing strategy and a field of intense research.",
              "The use of plasticizers, the preparation of blends, and the reinforcement of bioplastics with lignocellulosic components have shown promising and environmentally safe alternatives for overcoming the limitations of bioplastics, mainly due to the availability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility of such resources.",
              "This review addresses the production of bioplastics composed of polysaccharides from plant biomass and its advantages and disadvantages.",
              "Over the past two centuries, the significant growth of the world population and its consumption habits have led to several negative impacts on the environment.",
              "The development of a society with more sustainable production/consumption mechanisms should consider scenarios such as deforestation, water pollution, soil silting, and solid waste accumulation.",
              "Regarding plastic wastes, they represent approximately 12% of the composition of the world\u2019s solid waste [1], and their annual production has been increasing since 1950 and exceeded 6 billion tons of waste generated between 1950\u20132015 [2].",
              "Despite technologies and bioproducts (e.",
              "g., bioplastics) being an alternative for the mitigation of such environmental problems, a total replacement of synthetic plastics from petrochemical origin can hardly be considered in the short or even long term.",
              "On the other hand, certain applications of bioplastics may represent areas of large-scale potential replacement [3];",
              "for example, biodegradable materials for packaging and other short-lived use sectors are viable, since they constitute a large part of the total plastics production [4,5,6,7].",
              "Bioplastics can be classified into materials derived directly from natural polymers (agro-polymers), with or without modifications (e.",
              "g., starch-based bioplastics and/or cellulose), polymers produced by microbial fermentation (e.",

              "BPE is derived from the polymerization of ethylene from bio-ethanol, bio-nylons are produced via diacids from biomasses, and bio-polyurethanes are fabricated from the incorporation of polyols of plant origin [8].",
              "However, even oils can represent a feedstock for the development of bioplastics.",
              "Bioplastics from agro-polymers are derived from natural polymers such as polysaccharides (starch, cellulose, pectins, hemicellulose) and proteins (casein, zein, gluten, gelatin) that generally involve intra and intermolecular interactions and cross-links (crosslinking) between polymeric constituents, forming a semi-rigid three-dimensional polymeric network which retains the solvent [3,9].",
              "However, large-scale production of bioplastics for different applications is limited by high costs, in comparison to synthetic plastics derived from fossil oil, and concerns over functionality [10].",
              "Different biopolymers used have disadvantages such as high-water vapor permeability, oxygen permeability, fragility, low thermal resistance, low mechanical properties, vulnerability to degradation, and low processability [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19].",
              "The production and use of bioplastics instead of synthetic plastics (non-biodegradable and oil-based ones) reduce emissions of polluting gases and provide materials from renewable and/or biodegradable sources, availability of raw materials, and a promising alternative for the destination of solid biomass residues.",
              "Regarding environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect (the emission of greenhouse gases is a growing global concern, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)), a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 is required for avoiding a 2 \u00b0C increase in the global temperature.",
              "Biomaterials such as bioplastics and biofuels are considered one of the mitigating measures in relation to global warming [5,7,20,21,22].",
              "This review focuses on the different possibilities of bioplastics production from starch and lignocellulosic fibers, their advantages and disadvantages, and the procedures for obtaining natural polymers from plant biomass.",
              "Therefore, considering the development of several studies on the production of bioplastics from lignocellulosic fibers (from fractionation of the components or in nature and modified), in addition to the different applications that these bioplastics present, a review study on the characteristics (properties) of bioplastics and the processes for obtaining these polymers are justified.",
              "Starch has a great industrial appeal due to different industrial sectors use it for applications such as beverages, textiles, paper, and pharmaceuticals [23].",
              "Starch is insoluble in water and alcohol, composed of molecules of amylopectin and amylose, which are composed of monomers of d-glucose (Figure 1), and represent the main storage polysaccharide in the vegetal cells.",

              "however, the \u03b1 (1\u20136) branches of amylopectin reduce the degree of organization of the polymer [24,25].",
              "Amylopectin consists of a short chain of 10\u201360 units of glucose in a linear and branched-chain, interconnected by \u03b1 (1\u20134) and \u03b1 (1\u20136) glycosidic bonds.",
              "Amylose is comprised of an unbranched linear chain of glucose monomers interconnected by \u03b1 (1\u20134) glycosidic bonds.",
              "On average, the percentage of amylopectin and amylose contained in starch ranges between 72\u201375% and 25\u201328%, respectively [23,26].",
              "Native starch molecules are linked through intermolecular interactions of the hydroxyl group and the oxygen of amylopectin and amylose.",
              "The amylopectin and amylose are joined by hydrogen bonds, which make it insoluble in cold water.",
              "However, the molecules can undergo significant changes when exposed to gelatinization temperatures, provoking the breakage of hydrogen bonds between starch components from the supply of thermal energy in an aqueous solution (Figure 2).",
              "In addition to the breakdown of hydrogen bonds, the viscosity of the starch solution increases between amylose and amylopectin, from amylose leaching, structural loss in the double helix of starch, birefringence, and interactions between water and starch through free hydroxyls [27,28,29].",
              "Therefore, gelatinization begins in the amorphous regions of the polymer.",
              "Gelatinization of starch.",
              "Another process that can occur mainly with amylose molecules is retrogradation, or starch retrogradation, according to which a gelatinized solution shows interactions between amylose molecules and an increase in the ordering degree of hydrogen bonds.",

              "Most plastics are thermoplastics composed of linear polymer chains that allow thermal reshaping, such as those used in bottles and textiles, whereas some polymers are crosslinked during processing to form thermosets, which are tougher than thermoplastics and their shape is largely unaffected by temperature, such as those used in car tyres and epoxies.",

              "In this case, the monomers are extracted or synthesized from biomass compounds (such as sugars in plants) and then polymerized to either make a direct replacement for an existing plastic, such as polyethylene (PE), or novel polymers, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs).",
              "Biomass extraction can also yield non-synthetic natural polymers, such as starch, natural rubber and proteins.",
              "Note that, although the term \u2018bioplastic\u2019 is frequently used, it remains misunderstood, owing to the ambiguity of the definition (Box 1).",
              "Bioplastics are plastics that are either made from renewable resources (\u2018bio-based\u2019), are biodegradable, are made through biological processes or a combination of these.",

              "In this scenario, the production of bioplastics mainly from polysaccharides such as starch is a growing strategy and a field of intense research.",
              "The use of plasticizers, the preparation of blends, and the reinforcement of bioplastics with lignocellulosic components have shown promising and environmentally safe alternatives for overcoming the limitations of bioplastics, mainly due to the availability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility of such resources.",
              "This review addresses the production of bioplastics composed of polysaccharides from plant biomass and its advantages and disadvantages.",
              "Over the past two centuries, the significant growth of the world population and its consumption habits have led to several negative impacts on the environment.",
              "The development of a society with more sustainable production/consumption mechanisms should consider scenarios such as deforestation, water pollution, soil silting, and solid waste accumulation.",
              "Regarding plastic wastes, they represent approximately 12% of the composition of the world\u2019s solid waste [1], and their annual production has been increasing since 1950 and exceeded 6 billion tons of waste generated between 1950\u20132015 [2].",
              "Despite technologies and bioproducts (e.",
              "g., bioplastics) being an alternative for the mitigation of such environmental problems, a total replacement of synthetic plastics from petrochemical origin can hardly be considered in the short or even long term.",
              "On the other hand, certain applications of bioplastics may represent areas of large-scale potential replacement [3];",
              "for example, biodegradable materials for packaging and other short-lived use sectors are viable, since they constitute a large part of the total plastics production [4,5,6,7].",
              "Bioplastics can be classified into materials derived directly from natural polymers (agro-polymers), with or without modifications (e.",
              "g., starch-based bioplastics and/or cellulose), polymers produced by microbial fermentation (e.",

              "g., polylactic acid\u2014PLA, bio-polyethylene-BPE, bio-nylons, and bio-polyurethanes).",
              "BPE is derived from the polymerization of ethylene from bio-ethanol, bio-nylons are produced via diacids from biomasses, and bio-polyurethanes are fabricated from the incorporation of polyols of plant origin [8].",
              "However, even oils can represent a feedstock for the development of bioplastics.",
              "Bioplastics from agro-polymers are derived from natural polymers such as polysaccharides (starch, cellulose, pectins, hemicellulose) and proteins (casein, zein, gluten, gelatin) that generally involve intra and intermolecular interactions and cross-links (crosslinking) between polymeric constituents, forming a semi-rigid three-dimensional polymeric network which retains the solvent [3,9].",
              "However, large-scale production of bioplastics for different applications is limited by high costs, in comparison to synthetic plastics derived from fossil oil, and concerns over functionality [10].",
              "Different biopolymers used have disadvantages such as high-water vapor permeability, oxygen permeability, fragility, low thermal resistance, low mechanical properties, vulnerability to degradation, and low processability [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19].",
              "The production and use of bioplastics instead of synthetic plastics (non-biodegradable and oil-based ones) reduce emissions of polluting gases and provide materials from renewable and/or biodegradable sources, availability of raw materials, and a promising alternative for the destination of solid biomass residues.",
              "Regarding environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect (the emission of greenhouse gases is a growing global concern, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)), a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 is required for avoiding a 2 \u00b0C increase in the global temperature.",
              "Biomaterials such as bioplastics and biofuels are considered one of the mitigating measures in relation to global warming [5,7,20,21,22].",
              "This review focuses on the different possibilities of bioplastics production from starch and lignocellulosic fibers, their advantages and disadvantages, and the procedures for obtaining natural polymers from plant biomass.",
              "Therefore, considering the development of several studies on the production of bioplastics from lignocellulosic fibers (from fractionation of the components or in nature and modified), in addition to the different applications that these bioplastics present, a review study on the characteristics (properties) of bioplastics and the processes for obtaining these polymers are justified.",
              "Starch has a great industrial appeal due to different industrial sectors use it for applications such as beverages, textiles, paper, and pharmaceuticals [23].",
              "Starch is insoluble in water and alcohol, composed of molecules of amylopectin and amylose, which are composed of monomers of d-glucose (Figure 1), and represent the main storage polysaccharide in the vegetal cells.",
              "Representation of the starch structure of amylose and amylopectin.",
              "Similarly, to amylose and amylopectin, starch is a semi-crystalline polymer with linear regions;",
              "however, the \u03b1 (1\u20136) branches of amylopectin reduce the degree of organization of the polymer [24,25].",
              "Amylopectin consists of a short chain of 10\u201360 units of glucose in a linear and branched-chain, interconnected by \u03b1 (1\u20134) and \u03b1 (1\u20136) glycosidic bonds.",
              "Amylose is comprised of an unbranched linear chain of glucose monomers interconnected by \u03b1 (1\u20134) glycosidic bonds.",
              "On average, the percentage of amylopectin and amylose contained in starch ranges between 72\u201375% and 25\u201328%, respectively [23,26].",
              "Native starch molecules are linked through intermolecular interactions of the hydroxyl group and the oxygen of amylopectin and amylose.",
              "The amylopectin and amylose are joined by hydrogen bonds, which make it insoluble in cold water.",
              "However, the molecules can undergo significant changes when exposed to gelatinization temperatures, provoking the breakage of hydrogen bonds between starch components from the supply of thermal energy in an aqueous solution (Figure 2).",
              "In addition to the breakdown of hydrogen bonds, the viscosity of the starch solution increases between amylose and amylopectin, from amylose leaching, structural loss in the double helix of starch, birefringence, and interactions between water and starch through free hydroxyls [27,28,29].",
              "Therefore, gelatinization begins in the amorphous regions of the polymer.",
              "Gelatinization of starch.",
              "Another process that can occur mainly with amylose molecules is retrogradation, or starch retrogradation, according to which a gelatinized solution shows interactions between amylose molecules and an increase in the ordering degree of hydrogen bonds.",
              "Therefore, the amylose chains crystallize with the formation of a double helix [30,31], whereas starch retrogradation takes place more markedly when the solution is cooled.",
              "From the plasticizer effect of water and chemical plasticizers, starch gelatinization provides thermoplastic starch for bioplastics formation.",
              "In this process, starch loses its original conformation and forms a melted gel similar to synthetic thermoplastics, through swelling with water and other substances [32,33,34].",
              "Bioplastics production from thermoplastic starch, or another natural polymer (polysaccharide, lipid, or protein), is completed with the deposition of the gelatinized filmogenic solution on a non-adherent surface.",
              "The solution is then dehydrated (in an oven for example), thus facilitating retrogradation due to the increase in intramolecular interactions between polymers from the reduction of the volume in the polymeric matrix.",
              "This procedure is known as Casting [35].",
              "Apart from casting, other conventional methods of large-scale industrial production (e.",
              "g., extrusion and injection molding) are applied for bioplastics manufacture [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36].",
              "Single-screw and twin-screw extruders are the two main types used for polymer processing.",
              "The key advantages of the former are relatively low cost and a favorable performance/cost ratio, whereas the latter promotes a more complex velocity profile on the molten material, guaranteeing better distributive and dispersive mixing, heat transfer, and heat control.",
              "Besides, they both have flexible modular designs, and the screw configuration can be changed from soft melt mixing to vigorous mixing with high shear forces [37].",
              "Regarding biocomposites, extrusion can be even more efficient, since both melting and mixing occur in a one-step process, which decreases polymer and reinforcement degradation, improves efficiency and suitability for industrial applications that require continuous processing [38,39].",
              "However, the extrusion of biocomposites, particularly when nano-sized particles are used, can be challenging due to the dried nanomaterial\u2019s tendency to aggregate, thus hampering the feeding of the material into the extruder.",
              "A possible approach for solving the problem is to feed the nanoparticles in liquid form (known as liquid-assisted extrusion) with the use of atmospheric and vacuum ventings along the extruder for the removal of vaporized solvents [40].",
              "One of the most used technologies for processing polymers is injection moulding [41];",
              "it provides a good quality/cost ratio when a large production is intended and can potentially process bioplastics and biocomposites [42,43].",
              "Polysaccharide-based bioplastics are brittle, non-continuous, rigid, and fragile when formulated with no additive [44,45,46,47] and plasticizers\u2019 molecules used in the formulation of continuous bioplastics [48].",
              "Examples of plasticizers are glycerol and sorbitol, which are compatible with polysaccharides.",
              "The plasticizer effect results in higher flexibility of the bioplastics due to an increase in the interstitial volume of the polymeric matrix [49].",
              "Therefore, it reduces not only the glass transition temperature (Tg) [45,46,47,48,49,50], but also the number of polymer-polymer interactions (Figure 3), and increases the molecular mobility and hydrophilic degree of the bioplastics [49,50].",
              "Polysaccharides and plasticizer interactions in the bioplastic matrix.",

              "Plastics have become one of the most widespread materials used globally, and global production has on average increased by about 9% per year since 1950, reaching 367 million tonnes per annum in 2020 [1].",
              "According to [2], this rapid growth has been driven by two underlying trends: There are many varieties of plastic being used today.",
              "The main ones, according to [3] are: The combination of the two key elements: high demand due to a variety of applications, and low costs means that plastic is a highly successful product.",
              "The downside is that current plastic production is heavily dependent on fossil fuels [4], and the fact that most plastic materials are not biodegradable has led to a growth in the production and use of bioplastic.",
              "Unfortunately, there is a faulty practice in many countries when using the term \u2018bioplastics\u2019 for two different things.",
              "Firstly, there are bio-based plastics (plastics made at least partly from the biological matter) and secondly, there are biodegradable plastics (plastics that can be completely broken down by microbes in a reasonable timeframe, given specific conditions).",
              "However, not all bio-based plastics are biodegradable.",
              "Also, even biodegradable plastics might not fully biodegrade in unfavorable environments.",
              "Therefore, many issues remain unsolved [2, 5, 6].",
              "Considering international approach within the study, the term \u201cbioplastics\u201d is used for easier evaluation of consumer attitudes.",
              "Another very important issue is that the \u2018end of life in the plastic chain does not mean \u2018end of the impact\u2019.",
              "Because plastic materials persist and pollute long after their intended use, it has become clear that there is no such thing as an \u2018end of life\u2019 for plastics.",
              "Regardless of the disposal method, plastics may pose a significant threat to the environment and the climate when they reach the waste phase of their life cycles.",
              "This phase is when a high proportion of the remaining plastic waste ends up in the environment, in dumping sites, oceans, and other waterways, scattered across natural and human landscapes worldwide.",
              "Also, it should be highlighted that due to the increase in the total manufacturing of plastics, microplastics have become a serious problem.",
              "It is necessary to understand microplastic\u2019s prospective sources and sinks, the process by which its distribution is affected, and their uptake and exchange in ecosystems to understand the potential ecological harm done by microplastics.",
              "Accordingly, it is estimated that there are more than 5 trillion plastic particles in the world\u2019s surface waters [7].",
              "About 12.",
              "7 million metric tons of plastic waste are estimated to enter the ocean each year [8].",
              "Land-based sources include tourism, sewage, and illegal or poorly managed landfills, due to inadequate waste management [2, 9].",
              "Most of the plastic litter arriving in the oceans has been produced, used, and often disposed of on land [8, 10].",
              "According to [11], the microplastics types most commonly observed in the marine environment were PP, LDPE, HDPE, and PET.",
              "It is estimated that approximately 80 percent of ocean plastics come from land-based sources, and the remaining 20 percent are from marine sources [12].",
              "Of the 20 percent from marine sources, it is estimated that around half arises from fishing fleets (such as nets, lines, and abandoned vessels).",
              "Figures from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) suggest that abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gear contributes to approximately 10 percent of the total ocean plastics [13].",
              "Plastic flows depend on the proximity of urban activities, shore, and coastal uses, wind, and currents.",
              "Plastic debris is also carried to the sea by rivers, which flow into the sea after passing through densely populated areas [4].",
              "A study by [10] indicated that between 1.",

              "41 million tonnes of plastic currently flow from the global riverine system into the oceans every year.",
              "The top 20 polluting rivers accounted for two-thirds (67%) of the global annual river input.",
              "Most of the river plastic originates from Asia, representing 86 percent of the global total.",

              "8 percent.",
              "Central & North America, Europe, and the Australia-Pacific region collectively account for just over one percent of the world total [10, 14].",
              "Bioplastics can be defined as bioplastic that is either bio-based or biodegradable or has both of these properties [15].",
              "Bio-based plastics are derived from plant-based biomass or organic material.",
              "In contrast, biodegradable plastic refers to the environmental fate of the bioplastic, which suggests that the plastic will break down within a certain timeframe while leaving no toxic residues behind [16].",
              "Bioplastics are considered to be sustainable, environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional plastics.",
              "With the growing demand and use of plastics in the industry, many have turned to petroleum-based plastics.",
              "However, these are resistant to biodegradation, and the burning of such plastic releases toxic gases, which are harmful to animals, plants, and their natural environment.",
              "In this way, biopolymers are more advantageous due to their ability to degrade easily and can be considered a safer alternative to normal plastics [17].",
              "The production of conventional plastics requires a large amount of energy and petroleum, which is becoming scarce.",
              "However, bioplastic production involves low energy consumption and may reduce oil consumption in the process.",
              "Furthermore, the production emits low carbon and can be carbon neutral due to the absorption of CO2 by the biomass components.",
              "Additionally, using more natural substances diminishes the need for toxic substances that were previously used to produce conventional plastic [18].",
              "However, the production of bioplastics remains limited due to the high costs involved.",
              "This challenge is mainly attributed to the inability to mass-produce, and the cost is 2\u20133 times higher than conventional plastic.",
              "Furthermore, countries lack the technology needed to produce such products.",
              "In other instances, the lack of consumer awareness has decreased the use of bioplastics.",
              "Therefore, increasing the promotion of these products will greatly increase the demand [18].",
              "Bioplastics can be broken down into three main types based on the material they are made up of.",
              "The first group is the bio-based or partly bio-based bioplastics that are not biodegradable such as PP, PET, and PP and bio-based technical performance polymers.",
              "The second category consists of bioplastics that are bio-based and biodegradable, which include PBS and PLA.",
              "Lastly, there are biodegradable bioplastics that are derived from fossil resources [15].",
              "Bio-based and non-biodegradable are the most common type of bioplastics.",
              "These are produced using natural or renewable feedstock and are made using the same pathways, equipment, and technology as their conventional counterparts [16].",
              "They can also be called drop-in or bio-blends.",
              "Sometimes, they may contain starch or small quantities of biodegradable material to aid in the fragmentation process;",
              "however, the overall product is non-biodegradable \u2018[19].",
              "The difference between these bioplastics and their conventional counterparts is seen in the price and environmental friendliness [16].",
              "Bioplastics are more expensive due to the low investment, lower processing capacity, and the cost of raw material.",
              "Furthermore, bio-based bioplastics are more environmentally friendly, as the carbon dioxide produced during processing can be captured and used by plants, thus providing more raw materials, whereas this is not possible for conventional plastics [16, 20].",
              "The second type of bioplastics is both bio-based and biodegradable.",
              "It may be produced from plant-based materials, by-products of microbial fermentation, and animal-derived polymers.",
              "In doing so, the life cycle of biomass is mimicked, and carbon dioxide and water are released while preventing the use of fossil resources [15].",
              "Plant biomass used for this category includes the raw materials from pineapple, barley, starch, wheat, hemp, oat, and flute.",
              "These materials are used to extract thermoplastic starch, lignins, rubber, and cellulose, which are needed to produce the required bioplastic [21].",
              "By-products of microbial fermentation are used to produce polyester bioplastics.",
              "These are storage polymers produced by microbes using various enzymatic processes to aid in their survival upon stimulation from different stressors and nutrients.",
              "However, this method is not commonly used as it has a high production cost and requires more optimization [22].",
              "For animal-derived bioplastics, materials such as chitin, wool, fats, and gelatin are used.",
              "In more recent times, collagen has been used to produce bioplastic to reduce waste from meat production [16].",
              "Fossil-based biodegradable bioplastics are made from fossil resources that have a degree of biodegradability.",
              "However, hydrophilicity, reactivity, and stability determine the biodegradability and molecular weight of the raw materials used, which is not dependent on their origin.",
              "Consequently, these products are less favored in comparison to bio-based bioplastics [23].",
              "In present times, the bioplastics market accounts for the production of nearly 320 million tonnes of plastic annually.",
              "However, with the growing demand for these sustainable products, the markets grow from 20 to 100 percent per annum.",
              "This situation is facilitated by advancement in research, technological creations, and environmental awareness.",
              "As a result, there is a growing demand for these products in various sectors, including packaging, food, textile, automobile, and agriculture.",
              "In the year 2016, packaging accounts for the greatest use of such products at nearly 40 percent, followed by consumer goods that accounted for 22 percent of bioplastic demand [24] and the number of bioplastics produced around the world from 2015\u20132019 has projected an increased production for the years 2020\u20132023.",
              "To make new sustainability schemes, technologies, and products such as bioplastics effective, they need to be accepted by the people, as the major stakeholder in achieving environmental sustainability.",
              "People engage in pro-environmental behaviors such as using bioplastics when they have (a) the right attitude, like a concern for the environment or a belief that their action can help lower plastic\u2019s carbon footprint, and (b) the ability to translate the attitude into behavior such as purchasing bioplastic products [25].",
              "However, adopting such green products can be difficult because of people\u2019s different levels of awareness of and attitudes toward the environmental impacts of their consumptions.",
              "Lack of awareness and public reluctance can be observed in different types of sustainability initiatives such as circular economy approaches [26], initiatives for disaster risk reduction [27], treated wastewater reuse [28], and green technologies and products [29].",
              "The literature indicates that environmental concerns, beliefs, emotions (feeling of doing something good), product shelf life and price, and trust in the safety of the product are the major factors influencing consumer attitudes towards using bio-based plastics [25, 30\u201332].",
              "For example, study [25] found that guilt was the most significant factor influencing respondents\u2019 willingness to pay more for bio-based plastic products.",
              "In a study of factors that influence customer intentions to buy bio-based products in six European countries, the authors [32] found that the intention to purchase bio-based brands is enhanced by personal environmental norms, such as associating a bio-based product with eco-friendliness as well as whether a green brand is a global or private label.",
              "In addition, the study participants indicated their willingness to green purchase only products that consisted of 100% bio-based materials.",
              "This paper [30] investigated consumer attitudes towards bio-based packaging in France, Germany, and the USA.",
              "The study reported that the respondents focused principally on end-of-life packaging attributes such as biodegradability (50\u201360%) and values for reuse (43\u201355%) and recycling (42\u201367%).",
              "Conversely, respondents were less concerned about whether packages are made from renewable resources (10\u201313%) and have a low carbon footprint in production and transportation (8\u201318%).",
              "The authors conclude that even in developed countries, there is less awareness about the environmental friendliness of bio-based packaging, and consumers reject the idea of using land to grow raw material for packaging.",
              "This study [29] investigated the consumers\u2019 emotional assessments of and rational beliefs about green packaging in Norway.",
              "The study found that emotions (perceived benefits of eco-friendly packaging) are the key driver in purchasing plant-based beverage containers rather than the rational assessments of its ecological benefits.",
              "Thus, affective and cognitive processes play a significant role in influencing the consumers\u2019 purchase of green packaging products.",
              "In Germany, [33] explored user preferences for outdoor sporting equipment produced from bioplastics.",
              "The surveyed respondents showed positive attitudes toward sports shoes and drink bottles if they can help reduce carbon emission, are made from raw materials cultivated locally (belief in one\u2019s nation and supporting local economy), and are safe products with comparatively low prices.",
              "The authors deduced that bioplastics have a promising future if potential users understand their quality and ecological friendliness.",
              "A questionnaire was used to explore the level of awareness and attitudes about bioplastics, using a sample of individuals from a set of 42 countries located mostly in Europe and Asia.",
              "The method of data collection was a survey, taking the form of a self-administered questionnaire, and consisting mainly of closed questions that covered the following sections: (i) demographics (country of residence, gender, age, highest level of education, income in the last month, and occupation;",
              "(ii) questions regarding the knowledge level of bioplastics, bio-based and biodegradable products;",
              "(iii) questions related to the usage and buying of bioplastics (frequency and type of products);",
              "(iv) questions regarding the concerns about bioplastics (for instance, the impacts of bioplastics on human and environmental health);",

              "g., replacing of conventional plastic, ways to encourage the use of bioplastics).",
              "Different formats for answers were used.",
              "For instance, to gather information about the respondents\u2019 knowledge of bioplastics, multiple answers were possible (the same for obstacles to buying, the modalities of bioplastics, and the drivers to buy).",
              "To understand the frequency of certain behaviors, a 4-point scale was used (regularly, sometimes, rarely, and never).",
              "To identify and mitigate language and understanding problems, a pre-test of the questionnaire involving a sub-set of the respondents was carried out.",
              "Then the questions and the measurement scales were rearranged to make them clear and easy to understand.",
              "Using the LimeSurvey platform, the questionnaire was made available electronically in several countries for five months (from October 2020 to February 2021).",
