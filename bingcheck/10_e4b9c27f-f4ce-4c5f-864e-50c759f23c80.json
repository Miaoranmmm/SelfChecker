    "query": "What inspired Marie Curie to pursue a career in science, and what were her most significant contributions to the field of chemistry?",
    "response": "Marie Curie was a Polish-born French physicist and chemist who made groundbreaking discoveries in the field of radioactivity. She was inspired by her family's love of education and science, as well as by the discovery of X-rays by Roentgen and the discovery of uranium rays by Becquerel[^1^] [^2^]. She also faced many challenges and hardships, such as losing her mother at a young age, living in poverty, and facing discrimination as a woman in science[^1^] [^2^].\n\nSome of her most significant contributions to chemistry are:\n\n- She coined the term radioactivity to describe the phenomenon of spontaneous emission of radiation by certain elements[^1^] [^5^].\n- She discovered two new radioactive elements, polonium and radium, by isolating them from pitchblende ore[^1^] [^5^] [^6^].\n- She produced radium as a pure metal and documented its properties and compounds[^7^] [^8^].\n- She pioneered the use of radioactivity for medical purposes, such as treating cancer and diagnosing diseases[^1^] [^2^].\n- She founded the Radium Institute (now Curie Institute) in Paris and Warsaw, which became world-renowned centers for nuclear physics and chemistry research[^8^].\n\nMarie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the only person to win two Nobel Prizes in different fields of science: physics (1903) and chemistry (1911)[^1^]. She was also an inspiration for many women and scientists around the world[^2^] [^3^] [^4^].",

              "it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements.",
              "By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach.",
              "[39] The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization.",
              "From a tonne of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902.",
              "In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal.",
              "[32][40] She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.",
              "[32] Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumour-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.",
              "[41] In 1900, Curie became the first woman faculty member at the E\u0301cole Normale Supe\u0301rieure and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris.",
              "[42][43] In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her father's death.",
              "[25] In June 1903, supervised by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris.",
              "[25][44] That month the couple were invited to the Royal Institution in London to give a speech on radioactivity;",
              "being a woman, she was prevented from speaking, and Pierre Curie alone was allowed to.",
              "[45] Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on radium.",
              "[42] The Curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business.",
              "[32][42] In December 1903 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics, \"in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel.\"",
              "[25] At first the committee had intended to honour only Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, but a committee member and advocate for women scientists, Swedish mathematician Magnus Go\u0308sta Mittag-Leffler, alerted Pierre to the situation, and after his complaint, Marie's name was added to the nomination.",
              "[46] Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.",
              "[25] Curie and her husband declined to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person;",
              "they were too busy with their work, and Pierre Curie, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill.",
              "[45][46] As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905.",
              "[46] The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant.",
              "[46] Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre Curie a position, the University of Paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still did not have a proper laboratory.",
              "[25][42][43] Upon Pierre Curie's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.",
              "[46] In December 1904, Curie gave birth to their second daughter, E\u0300ve.",
              "[46] She hired Polish governesses to teach her daughters her native language, and sent or took them on visits to Poland.",
              "[10] On 19 April 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident.",
              "Walking across the Rue Dauphine in heavy rain, he was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels, fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.",
              "[25][47] Curie was devastated by her husband's death.",
              "[48] On 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and offer it to Marie.",
              "She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre.",
              "[48][49] She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.",
              "[25] Curie's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris, however.",
              "In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris.",
              "[49] The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul E\u0301mile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute.",
              "[25][50] Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.",
              "[50] In 1910 Curie succeeded in isolating radium;",
              "she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre: the curie.",
              "[49] Nevertheless, in 1911 the French Academy of Sciences failed, by one[25] or two votes,[51] to elect her to membership in the academy.",
              "Elected instead was E\u0301douard Branly, an inventor who had helped Guglielmo Marconi develop the wireless telegraph.",
              "[52] It was only over half a century later, in 1962, that a doctoral student of Curie's, Marguerite Perey, became the first woman elected to membership in the academy.",
              "Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia\u2014the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair\u2014which also fuelled false speculation that Curie was Jewish.",
              "[25][51] During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right-wing press as a foreigner and atheist.",
              "[51] Her daughter later remarked on the French press's hypocrisy in portraying Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but portraying her as a French heroine when she received foreign honours such as her Nobel Prizes.",
              "[25] In 1911 it was revealed that Curie was involved in a year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's,[53] a married man who was estranged from his wife.",
              "[51] This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents.",
              "Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker.",
              "[54] When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium;",
              "on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.",
              "[51] International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honoured her a second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.",
              "[17] This award was \"in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.\"",
              "[55] Because of the negative publicity due to her affair with Langevin, the chair of the Nobel committee, Svante Arrhenius, attempted to prevent her attendance at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in Chemistry, citing her questionable moral standing.",
              "Curie replied that she would be present at the ceremony, because \"the prize has been given to her for her discovery of polonium and radium\" and that \"there is no relation between her scientific work and the facts of her private life\".",
              "She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each.",
              "A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning, headed by novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz, encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country.",
              "[17] Curie's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government to support the Radium Institute, built in 1914, where research was conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine.",
              "[50] A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment.",
              "For most of 1912, she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton.",
              "She returned to her laboratory only in December, after a break of about 14 months.",
              "[55] In 1912 the Warsaw Scientific Society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie (today rue Pierre-et-Marie-Curie).",
              "[50][55] She was appointed director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.",
              "[56] She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities.",
              "The institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.",
              "[50][55][57] During World War I, Curie recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible.",
              "[58] She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons,[57] including to obviate amputations when in fact limbs could be saved.",
              "[59][60] After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics, she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, and auxiliary generators, and she developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies (\"Little Curies\").",
              "[57] She became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914.",
              "[57] Assisted at first by a military doctor and her 17-year-old daughter Ire\u0300ne, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war.",
              "[50][57] Later, she began training other women as aides.",
              "[61] In 1915, Curie produced hollow needles containing \"radium emanation\", a colourless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue.",
              "She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply.",
              "[61] It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units.",
              "[21][50] Busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that period.",
              "[50] In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, Curie never received any formal recognition of it from the French government.",
              "[57] Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the French National Bank refused to accept them.",
              "[61] She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money.",
              "[61] She said: I am going to give up the little gold I possess.",
              "I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me.",
              "There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns.",
              "This is the chief part of what we possess.",
              "I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans.",
              "The state needs it.",
              "Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost.",
              "[58] She was also an active member in committees of Polonia in France dedicated to the Polish cause.",
              "[62] After the war, she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, Radiology in War (1919).",
              "[61] In 1920, for the 25th anniversary of the discovery of radium, the French government established a stipend for her;",
              "its previous recipient was Louis Pasteur (1822\u201395).",
              "[50] In 1921, she was welcomed triumphantly when she toured the United States to raise funds for research on radium.",

              "[5][65] Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed by the fact that she had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered her a Legion of Honour award, but she refused.",
              "[65][66] In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine.",
              "[50] She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.",
              "[67] Led by Curie, the Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners, including her daughter Ire\u0300ne Joliot-Curie and her son-in-law, Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Joliot-Curie.",

              "the Institute opened in 1932, with her sister Bronis\u0142awa its director.",
              "[50][65] These distractions from her scientific labours, and the attendant publicity, caused her much discomfort but provided resources for her work.",
              "[65] In 1930 she was elected to the International Atomic Weights Committee, on which she served until her death.",
              "[73] In 1931, Curie was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.",
              "[74] Curie visited Poland for the last time in early 1934.",
              "[17][75] A few months later, on 4 July 1934, she died aged 66 at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anemia believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation, causing damage to her bone marrow.",
              "[50] The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed.",
              "[75] She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket,[76] and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark.",
              "[77] Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the First World War.",
              "[61] When Curie's body was exhumed in 1995, the French Office de Protection contre les Rayonnements Ionisants (ORPI) \"concluded that she could not have been exposed to lethal levels of radium while she was alive\".",
              "They pointed out that radium poses a risk only if it is ingested, and speculated that her illness was more likely to have been due to her use of radiography during the First World War.",
              "[78] She was interred at the cemetery in Sceaux, alongside her husband Pierre.",
              "[50] Sixty years later, in 1995, in honour of their achievements, the remains of both were transferred to the Paris Panthe\u0301on.",
              "Their remains were sealed in a lead lining because of the radioactivity.",
              "[79] She became the second woman to be interred at the Panthe\u0301on (after Sophie Berthelot) and the first woman to be honoured with interment in the Panthe\u0301on on her own merits.",
              "[13] Because of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle.",

              "Born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Kingdom of Poland (which was officially made part of the Russian Empire in the year of her birth), Marie Curie was one of the most prominent figures in the field of science and the first woman ever to receive the prestigious Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1911) for her groundbreaking research on radioactivity.",
              "Born Maria Salomea Sklodowska, the youngest child of Wladyslaw and Bronislawa Sklodowski, two well-respected teachers in Warsaw, Curie grew up together with her four siblings (three sisters \u2013 Zofia, Bronislawa, and Helena, and one brother, Josef) in poverty.",
              "Marie Sklodowska-Curie lost her sister Zofia to typhus when she was ten years old and then her mother to tuberculosis when she was only twelve.",
              "These tragedies had a great impact on her spiritual life, making her turn away from Catholicism and become agnostic.",
              "After graduating from a gymnasium for girls in 1883, she enrolled in the pro-Polish underground educational institution called Flying University (open for both sexes, unlike legal universities in which girls were not accepted) and she attended courses held in various private houses in Warsaw.",
              "When she was 18, while working as a governess for the Zorawskis, her father\u2019s relatives, she fell in love with their son, Kazimierz Zorawski, who would become a famous mathematician and the rector of Krakow University.",
              "However, his parents refused to give the couple their blessing because Marie was poor.",
              "From 1890 to 1891, Curie began working in a chemical lab run by Josef Boguski, her cousin and the former assistant of famous chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.",
              "In 1891, Curie began a new life in France where she enrolled at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne) to continue studying physics, mathematics, and chemistry.",
              "She worked as a tutor in the evening and she used the money to pay the rent for the garret located near the Sorbonne and where she spent her nights working intensely on her scientific projects and literally living on bread, butter, and tea.",
              "In 1893, she earned her degree in physics and began working in Professor Gabriel Lippmann\u2019s research laboratory.",
              "In 1894, when she also earned her second degree in mathematics, she met Pierre Curie, who was then an instructor at the School of Physics and Chemistry in Paris.",
              "The couple married in a civil union on July 26, 1895.",
              "She wore a simple navy dress, which would then become her lab outfit.",
              "In addition to their passion for science, the couple also enjoyed trips aboard and long bike rides.",
              "The significance of Curie\u2019s scientific work is mirrored in the multiple and prestigious awards received throughout her career.",
              "She is the first female Nobel Prize winner and the only scientist ever to receive a Nobel Prize in two fields of science, both in chemistry (1911) and physics (1903) without sharing them with co-recipients.",
              "In July of 1898, the couple of scientists announced the discovery of polonium (which they named after her native country) and in December, they announced their discovery of radium.",
              "Curie pioneered valuable techniques for the isolation of radioactive isotopes, which were then used in the first medical studies conducted (under Curie\u2019s direction) into the treatment of malignancies.",

              "Following Henri Becquerel\u2019s discovery (1896) of a new phenomenon (which she later called \u201cradioactivity\u201d), Marie Curie, looking for a subject for a thesis, decided to find out if the property discovered in uranium was to be found in other matter.",

              "Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose activity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity.",

              "She had an excellent aid at her disposal \u2013 an electrometer for the measurement of weak electrical currents, which was constructed by Pierre and his brother, and was based on the piezoelectric effect.",
              "Results were not long in coming.",
              "Just after a few days, Marie discovered that thorium gives off the same rays as uranium.",
              "Her continued systematic studies of the various chemical compounds gave the surprising result that the strength of the radiation did not depend on the compound that was being studied.",
              "It depended only on the amount of uranium or thorium.",
              "Chemical compounds of the same element generally have very different chemical and physical properties: one uranium compound is a dark powder, another is a transparent yellow crystal, but what was decisive for the radiation they gave off was only the amount of uranium they contained.",
              "Marie drew the conclusion that the ability to radiate did not depend on the arrangement of the atoms in a molecule, it must be linked to the interior of the atom itself.",
              "This discovery was absolutely revolutionary.",
              "From a conceptual point of view it is her most important contribution to the development of physics.",
              "She now went through the whole periodic system.",
              "Her findings were that only uranium and thorium gave off this radiation.",
              "Marie\u2019s next idea, seemingly simple but brilliant, was to study the natural ores that contain uranium and thorium.",
              "She obtained samples from geological museums and found that of these ores, pitchblende was four to five times more active than was motivated by the amount of uranium.",
              "It was her hypothesis that a new element that was considerably more active than uranium was present in small amounts in the ore.",
              "Fascinating new vistas were opening up.",
              "Pierre gave up his research into crystals and symmetry in nature which he was deeply involved in and joined Marie in her project.",
              "They found that the strong activity came with the fractions containing bismuth or barium.",
              "When Marie continued her analysis of the bismuth fractions, she found that every time she managed to take away an amount of bismuth, a residue with greater activity was left.",
              "At the end of June 1898, they had a substance that was about 300 times more strongly active than uranium.",
              "In the work they published in July 1898, they write, \u201cWe thus believe that the substance that we have extracted from pitchblende contains a metal never known before, akin to bismuth in its analytic properties.",
              "If the existence of this new metal is confirmed, we suggest that it should be called polonium after the name of the country of origin of one of us.",
              "\u201d It was also in this work that they used the term radioactivity for the first time.",
              "After another few months of work, the Curies informed the l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, on December 26, 1898, that they had demonstrated strong grounds for having come upon an additional very active substance that behaved chemically almost like pure barium.",
              "They suggested the name of radium for the new element.",
              "In order to be certain of showing that it was a matter of new elements, the Curies would have to produce them in demonstrable amounts, determine their atomic weight and preferably isolate them.",
              "To do so, the Curies would need tons of the costly pitchblende.",
              "However, it was known that at the Joachimsthal mine in Bohemia large slag-heaps had been left in the surrounding forests.",
              "Marie considered that radium ought to be left in the residue.",
              "A sample was sent to them from Bohemia and the slag was found to be even more active than the original mineral.",
              "Several tons of pitchblende was later put at their disposal through the good offices of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.",
              "It was now that there began the heroic e\u0301poque in their life that has become legendary.",
              "At this stage they needed more room, and the principal of the school where Pierre worked once again came to their aid.",

              "She processed 20 kilos of raw material at a time.",
              "First of all she had to clear away pine needles and any perceptible debris, then she had to undertake the work of separation.",

              "In a preface to Pierre Curie\u2019s collected works, Marie describes the shed as having a bituminous floor, and a glass roof which provided incomplete protection against the rain, and where it was like a hothouse in the summer, draughty and cold in the winter;",
              "yet it was in that shed that they spent the best and happiest years of their lives.",
              "There they could devote themselves to work the livelong day.",
              "Sometimes they could not do their processing outdoors, so the noxious gases had to be let out through the open windows.",
              "The only furniture were old, worn pine tables where Marie worked with her costly radium fractions.",
              "Since they did not have any shelter in which to store their precious products the latter were arranged on tables and boards.",

              "Her continued systematic studies of the various chemical compounds gave the surprising result that the strength of the radiation did not depend on the compound that was being studied.",
              "It depended only on the amount of uranium or thorium.",
              "Chemical compounds of the same element generally have very different chemical and physical properties: one uranium compound is a dark powder, another is a transparent yellow crystal, but what was decisive for the radiation they gave off was only the amount of uranium they contained.",
              "Marie drew the conclusion that the ability to radiate did not depend on the arrangement of the atoms in a molecule, it must be linked to the interior of the atom itself.",
              "This discovery was absolutely revolutionary.",
              "From a conceptual point of view it is her most important contribution to the development of physics.",

              "Her findings were that only uranium and thorium gave off this radiation.",
              "Marie\u2019s next idea, seemingly simple but brilliant, was to study the natural ores that contain uranium and thorium.",
              "She obtained samples from geological museums and found that of these ores, pitchblende was four to five times more active than was motivated by the amount of uranium.",
              "It was her hypothesis that a new element that was considerably more active than uranium was present in small amounts in the ore.",
              "Fascinating new vistas were opening up.",
              "Pierre gave up his research into crystals and symmetry in nature which he was deeply involved in and joined Marie in her project.",
              "They found that the strong activity came with the fractions containing bismuth or barium.",
              "When Marie continued her analysis of the bismuth fractions, she found that every time she managed to take away an amount of bismuth, a residue with greater activity was left.",
              "At the end of June 1898, they had a substance that was about 300 times more strongly active than uranium.",
              "In the work they published in July 1898, they write, \u201cWe thus believe that the substance that we have extracted from pitchblende contains a metal never known before, akin to bismuth in its analytic properties.",
              "If the existence of this new metal is confirmed, we suggest that it should be called polonium after the name of the country of origin of one of us.",
              "\u201d It was also in this work that they used the term radioactivity for the first time.",
              "After another few months of work, the Curies informed the l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, on December 26, 1898, that they had demonstrated strong grounds for having come upon an additional very active substance that behaved chemically almost like pure barium.",
              "They suggested the name of radium for the new element.",
              "In order to be certain of showing that it was a matter of new elements, the Curies would have to produce them in demonstrable amounts, determine their atomic weight and preferably isolate them.",
              "To do so, the Curies would need tons of the costly pitchblende.",
              "However, it was known that at the Joachimsthal mine in Bohemia large slag-heaps had been left in the surrounding forests.",
              "Marie considered that radium ought to be left in the residue.",
              "A sample was sent to them from Bohemia and the slag was found to be even more active than the original mineral.",

              "In a preface to Pierre Curie\u2019s collected works, Marie describes the shed as having a bituminous floor, and a glass roof which provided incomplete protection against the rain, and where it was like a hothouse in the summer, draughty and cold in the winter;",

              "At a time when any feminine help was considered as minor and secondary to any man\u2019s (examples are for instance Caroline Herschel and more recently Mileva Maric Einstein, as well as pulsar discoverer Jocelyn Bell Burnell) she could nevertheless count on the support of her husband, Pierre Curie, an exceptional scientist himself, to reveal the importance of her work.",
              "Because Pierre insisted that her name be added to the proposal transmitted to the Nobel Committee by the French Academy of Sciences for their work on radiation phenomena (which originally contained only the names of Henri Becquerel and Pierre Curie), she became in 1903 the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize.",
              "she was never elected at the French Academy of Sciences This of course did not instantly demolish all the barriers that women were facing, even one as renowned as Marie Sklodowska-Curie.",
              "As an example, because she was a woman, she was never elected at the French Academy of Sciences.",
              "As the Director of the Physics and Chemistry Laboratory at the Institut du Radium (a first at those times), Marie Curie, assisted by her daughter Ire\u0300ne, strongly encouraged the promotion of women in physics, in France and abroad.",
              "Since 1906 and until her death, she hired 45 women, never practicing discriminatory selection among men and women scientists.",
              "In her lifetime, she received several awards, medals and even a second Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1911.",
              "But even then, the press remained mostly silent and the recognition in her field of work was rather limited.",
              "More than 60 years after her death, her remains and those of Pierre were transferred to the Pantheon.",
              "It is worth noting that to this date, she is still the only woman to be interred in the Pantheon on her personal merit alone.",
              "leading and inspiring figures in the battle for the emancipation of women in sciences Since their times Marie and Ire\u0300ne Joliot-Curie have been considered as leading and inspiring figures in the battle for the emancipation of women in sciences.",
              "They have demonstrated not only the capabilities of women in sciences but also the fact that having children and caring for a family was not an obstacle for conducting research and directing important scientific centers.",
              "it is important to remember Marie Curie as a model to follow and to inspire women Today, at the time of Marie Curie\u2019s 150\u2019s birthday, it is still important to honour her memory and her efforts in favour of the recognition of women in scientific careers.",
              "Although considerable progress has been achieved in this matter, there is still a deficiency of female scientists at the highest levels of the hierarchy and in positions of important duties and authority in most of the scientific disciplines.",

              "At a time when the pandemic is closing schools, her story offers insight and inspiration to students and would-be scientists around the world.",
              "Born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, Maria Skladowska was the youngest of five children.",
              "Her parents were teachers, but one of her sisters and her mother died when she was young.",
              "Although an excellent student, the universities were closed to her, and she and her sister Bronya found it necessary to travel to Paris to get an education, each working to support the other.",

              "After they returned from their bicycling honeymoon, Marie continued to wear her blue wedding dress as her laboratory uniform.",
              "The Curies investigated a new physical phenomenon that Marie would label \u201cradioactivity,\u201d the emission of energy by elements despite the absence of any chemical reaction.",
              "Using instruments devised by Pierre, she identified two new elements, one that for obvious reasons she called Radium and the other Polonium, after her motherland.",
              "Marie also gave birth to two daughters, one named Irene, who would follow her parents into science and eventually garner a Nobel Prize with her husband for work on nuclear reactions.",
              "The younger daughter, Eve, would eventually write the best biography of her mother and marry a United Nations official who would win another Nobel Prize for work with UNICEF.",
              "The Curies received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, which brought worldwide notoriety and a flood of requests for speeches, public appearances, and commercial endorsements.",
              "The Curies treated nearly all such requests with disdain, wishing only to be left alone to continue their scientific research, their great shared passion in life.",
              "Pierre\u2019s health had begun to decline, perhaps because of his work with radioactive elements, and in 1906 he was killed when he slipped on wet pavement and was struck by a horse-drawn cart.",

              "In 1911, despite her worldwide fame, she was denied membership in the French Academy of Sciences, reflecting the concern of many members that admitting a woman would permanently alter the organization\u2019s culture.",
              "That same year, it was publicly revealed that Marie was romantically engaged with another great French physicist, Paul Langevin, who happened to be a husband and father.",
              "The scandal provoked wide outrage, and her heart was again broken when Langevin\u2019s wife precipitated an end to their affair.",
              "In 1911 Marie received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of two chemical elements, and she soon became the director of the Radium Institute.",
              "She had elaborate plans for its scientific program, but they were interrupted by World War I, which brought a halt to all research.",
              "Marie wished to be of service to her adopted country but did not know how to proceed.",
              "At first, Marie thought of giving money to the French forces.",
              "She made plans to donate both her Nobel Prize money and gold medals to the war effort, but French bankers refused to melt down the medals, saying that they were too important to French history.",
              "She knew that the money would likely be lost but donated everything she could, longing for some more direct way of serving the war effort.",
              "She knew that x-rays, which had been discovered by Wilhelm Roentgen the same year she and Pierre were wed, could help to diagnose soldiers\u2019 injuries and illnesses.",
              "Despite opposition from the French military, she began procuring x-ray machines and vehicles to build a mobile x-ray service.",

              "During this time, she met with many American leaders, including President Warren Harding.",

              "When, just a day or so after his discovery, he informed the Monday meeting of l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, his colleagues listened politely, then went on to the next item on the agenda.",
              "It was Ro\u0308ntgen\u2019s discovery and the possibilities it provided that were the focus of the interest and enthusiasm of researchers.",
              "Becquerel himself made certain important observations, for instance that gases through which the rays passed become able to conduct electricity, but he was soon to leave this field.",
              "Marie decided to make a systematic investigation of the mysterious \u201curanium rays\u201d.",
              "She had an excellent aid at her disposal \u2013 an electrometer for the measurement of weak electrical currents, which was constructed by Pierre and his brother, and was based on the piezoelectric effect.",
              "Results were not long in coming.",
              "Just after a few days, Marie discovered that thorium gives off the same rays as uranium.",
              "Her continued systematic studies of the various chemical compounds gave the surprising result that the strength of the radiation did not depend on the compound that was being studied.",
              "It depended only on the amount of uranium or thorium.",
              "Chemical compounds of the same element generally have very different chemical and physical properties: one uranium compound is a dark powder, another is a transparent yellow crystal, but what was decisive for the radiation they gave off was only the amount of uranium they contained.",
              "Marie drew the conclusion that the ability to radiate did not depend on the arrangement of the atoms in a molecule, it must be linked to the interior of the atom itself.",
              "This discovery was absolutely revolutionary.",
              "From a conceptual point of view it is her most important contribution to the development of physics.",
              "She now went through the whole periodic system.",
              "Her findings were that only uranium and thorium gave off this radiation.",
              "Marie\u2019s next idea, seemingly simple but brilliant, was to study the natural ores that contain uranium and thorium.",
              "She obtained samples from geological museums and found that of these ores, pitchblende was four to five times more active than was motivated by the amount of uranium.",
              "It was her hypothesis that a new element that was considerably more active than uranium was present in small amounts in the ore.",
              "Fascinating new vistas were opening up.",
              "Pierre gave up his research into crystals and symmetry in nature which he was deeply involved in and joined Marie in her project.",
              "They found that the strong activity came with the fractions containing bismuth or barium.",
              "When Marie continued her analysis of the bismuth fractions, she found that every time she managed to take away an amount of bismuth, a residue with greater activity was left.",
              "At the end of June 1898, they had a substance that was about 300 times more strongly active than uranium.",
              "In the work they published in July 1898, they write, \u201cWe thus believe that the substance that we have extracted from pitchblende contains a metal never known before, akin to bismuth in its analytic properties.",
              "If the existence of this new metal is confirmed, we suggest that it should be called polonium after the name of the country of origin of one of us.",
              "\u201d It was also in this work that they used the term radioactivity for the first time.",
              "After another few months of work, the Curies informed the l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, on December 26, 1898, that they had demonstrated strong grounds for having come upon an additional very active substance that behaved chemically almost like pure barium.",
              "They suggested the name of radium for the new element.",
              "In order to be certain of showing that it was a matter of new elements, the Curies would have to produce them in demonstrable amounts, determine their atomic weight and preferably isolate them.",
              "To do so, the Curies would need tons of the costly pitchblende.",
              "However, it was known that at the Joachimsthal mine in Bohemia large slag-heaps had been left in the surrounding forests.",
              "Marie considered that radium ought to be left in the residue.",
              "A sample was sent to them from Bohemia and the slag was found to be even more active than the original mineral.",
              "Several tons of pitchblende was later put at their disposal through the good offices of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.",
              "It was now that there began the heroic e\u0301poque in their life that has become legendary.",
              "At this stage they needed more room, and the principal of the school where Pierre worked once again came to their aid.",
              "They could use a large shed which was not occupied.",
              "There the very laborious work of separation and analysis began.",
              "Marie carried out the chemical separations, Pierre undertook the measurements after each successive step.",
              "Physically it was heavy work for Marie.",
              "She processed 20 kilos of raw material at a time.",
              "First of all she had to clear away pine needles and any perceptible debris, then she had to undertake the work of separation.",
              "\u201cSometimes I had to spend a whole day stirring a boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly as big as myself.",
              "I would be broken with fatigue at day\u2019s end,\u201d she writes.",
              "In a preface to Pierre Curie\u2019s collected works, Marie describes the shed as having a bituminous floor, and a glass roof which provided incomplete protection against the rain, and where it was like a hothouse in the summer, draughty and cold in the winter;",
              "yet it was in that shed that they spent the best and happiest years of their lives.",
              "There they could devote themselves to work the livelong day.",
              "Sometimes they could not do their processing outdoors, so the noxious gases had to be let out through the open windows.",
              "The only furniture were old, worn pine tables where Marie worked with her costly radium fractions.",
              "Since they did not have any shelter in which to store their precious products the latter were arranged on tables and boards.",
              "Marie could remember the joy they felt when they came into the shed at night, seeing \u201cfrom all sides the feebly luminous silhouettes\u201d of the products of their work.",
              "The dangerous gases of which Marie speaks contained, among other things, radon \u2013 the radioactive gas which is a matter of concern to us today since small amounts are emitted from certain kinds of building materials.",
              "Wilhelm Ostwald, the highly respected German chemist, who was one of the first to realize the importance of the Curies\u2019 research, traveled from Berlin to Paris to see how they worked.",

              "From 1900 Marie had had a part-time teaching post at the E\u0301cole Normale Supe\u0301rieur de Se\u0300vres for girls.",
              "After thousands of crystallizations, Marie finally \u2013 from several tons of the original material \u2013 isolated one decigram of almost pure radium chloride and had determined radium\u2019s atomic weight as 225.",

              "It was a warmish evening and the group went out into the garden.",
              "Pierre had prepared an effective finale to the day.",
              "When they had all sat down, he drew from his waistcoat pocket a little tube, partly coated with zinc sulfide, which contained a quantity of radium salt in solution.",
              "Suddenly the tube became luminous, lighting up the darkness, and the group stared at the display in wonder, quietly and solemnly.",
              "But in the light from the tube, Rutherford saw that Pierre\u2019s fingers were scarred and inflamed and that he was finding it hard to hold the tube.",

              "After 52 days a permanent grey scar remained.",
              "In that connection Pierre mentioned the possibility of radium being able to be used in the treatment of cancer.",

              "Because her father, a teacher of mathematics and physics, lost his savings through bad investment, she had to take work as a teacher and, at the same time, took part clandestinely in the nationalist \u201cfree university,\u201d reading in Polish to women workers.",
              "At the age of 18 she took a post as governess, where she suffered an unhappy love affair.",
              "From her earnings she was able to finance her sister Bronis\u0142awa\u2019s medical studies in Paris, with the understanding that Bronis\u0142awa would in turn later help her to get an education.",
              "In 1891 Sk\u0142odowska went to Paris and, now using the name Marie, began to follow the lectures of Paul Appell, Gabriel Lippmann, and Edmond Bouty at the Sorbonne.",

              "It was in the spring of that year that she met Pierre Curie.",
              "Their marriage (July 25, 1895) marked the start of a partnership that was soon to achieve results of world significance, in particular the discovery of polonium (so called by Marie in honour of her native land) in the summer of 1898 and that of radium a few months later.",
              "Following Henri Becquerel\u2019s discovery (1896) of a new phenomenon (which she later called \u201cradioactivity\u201d), Marie Curie, looking for a subject for a thesis, decided to find out if the property discovered in uranium was to be found in other matter.",

              "Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose activity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity.",
              "Pierre Curie then joined her in the work that she had undertaken to resolve this problem and that led to the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium.",
              "While Pierre Curie devoted himself chiefly to the physical study of the new radiations, Marie Curie struggled to obtain pure radium in the metallic state\u2014achieved with the help of the chemist Andre\u0301-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre Curie\u2019s pupils.",

              "In early 1896, Paris, no less than other places, was abuzz with talk of the new x radiation.",
              "At the weekly meetings of the prestigious Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, Henri Poincare\u0301 suggested that all luminescent bodies might be emitting x rays, because the x radiation emanated from the glowing spot on the glass tube that was struck by the cathode ray.",
              "That was before better focused x-ray beams were made to emanate from metal targets inserted into cathode-ray tubes.",
              "Becquerel, a physics professor at the Museum of Natural History in Paris and an expert on luminescence, decided to test Poincare\u0301\u2019s conjecture.",
              "Athough most physicists had access to the apparatus necessary to produce x rays, few had anything like Becquerel\u2019s access to the museum\u2019s collections of rocks that glowed in the dark.",
              "He was something of a throwback to the middle of the 19th century, when the study of luminescence in minerals was popular.",
              "His physicist father, and indeed his grandfather, had pioneered the subject.",
              "Becquerel\u2019s working hypothesis was that some of his minerals might emit the penetrating x rays while they glowed.",
              "He therefore wrapped photographic plates in light-tight black paper to exclude visible light, placed luminescent rocks on top of the wrapping, and left those preparations on a window sill so that sunlight could stimulate the rocks.",
              "After some hours, he developed the plates and, for a uranium rock, found an exposed area.",
              "That result seemed to confirm Poincare\u0301, and the news was reported to the Acade\u0301mie.",
              "Soon Becquerel made images with coins and metal cutouts placed between the uranium rock and the wrapping paper.",
              "He noted that the uranium images were fuzzier and required much longer exposures than did x-ray photos from cathode-ray tubes\u2014which themselves took as much as an hour.",
              "So these uranium \u201cx rays\u201d hardly seemed promising for medical imaging.",
              "In the following days, Becquerel prepared more rock and photoplate arrangements.",
              "But the Paris winter skies remained cloudy for almost an entire week.",
              "Awaiting the sun, he stored the preparations in a dark desk drawer.",
              "The next meeting of the Acade\u0301mie was approaching, and Becquerel wished to remain in the spotlight.",
              "So he developed the plates from the desk drawer, presumably so that he could report that uranium rock does not emit the penetrating radiation unless it\u2019s been stimulated by sunlight.",
              "To his surprise, however, the plate under the uranium rock was strongly exposed.",
              "Reluctant to abandon his hypothesis, Becquerel concluded that his uranium compound exhibited a new phenomenon: long-lived phosphorescence.",
              "Subsequent experiments with the rocks continuing to expose photo-plates after being kept in a dark box for longer and longer periods, merely confirmed for him that this was a new kind of phosphorescence.",
              "Further investigation showed him that uranium compounds that never glow, and even uranium metal itself, generated the radiation.",
              "Thus, thought Becquerel, he had extended his discovery of long-lived phosphorescence to metals.",
              "In hindsight this is an interesting example of reluctance to consider radical new explanations.",
              "The element uranium, discovered by Martin Klaproth in 1789 and named after the planet discovered just eight years before (the first planet not known in antiquity) did not seem especially interesting.",
              "Its principal use was to give glass or pottery a greenish-yellow tint.",
              "Because of uranium\u2019s great density, attempts were made to incorporate it into military armor.",
              "For unexplained reasons, Gerhard Schmidt at the University of Erlangen began to look into Becquerel\u2019s uranium rays in late 1897, after others had lost interest.",
              "He then sought to detect similar radiation from other elements, again without explaining his motivation.",
              "Among the elements Schmidt tested, only thorium exhibited a similar ability to penetrate opaque materials and ionize air.",
              "Neither Schmidt nor Becquerel explicitly labeled these rays as an atomic phenomenon, although their work suggests that they both understood that.",
              "In his February 1898 paper, Schmidt did note the high atomic weights of both thorium and uranium.",
              "2 (See my article in Physics Today, February 1996, page 21.)",
              "Just two months after Schmidt, a physicist in Paris independently announced the discovery of activity from thorium.",
              "A systematic worker, she tested a substantial part of the periodic table for such activity.",
              "Marie Sklodowska Curie, born in Warsaw in 1867, had the equivalent of master\u2019s degrees in both physics and mathematics from the Sorbonne.",
              "She also had a husband, Pierre, who was a physicist of international repute, and a newborn daughter, Ire\u0300ne, who would win the 1935 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with her own husband, Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Joliot, for the discovery of artificial radioactivity.",
              "Marie had already published one paper on the magnetic properties of steel.",
              "That investigation was paid research, but it may also have been a test by her to see if the subject was suitable for a doctoral thesis.",
              "If that was so, the subject proved unsuitable, and she did not choose her thesis topic until the end of 1897.",
              "3 Memoirs by Marie Curie and her younger daughter Eve incorrectly suggest that the doctoral topic she did choose was virgin territory.",
              "4 It is inconceivable that Curie had failed to read papers on uranium rays in the major scientific journals soon after they were published, and delusional to claim, decades later, that uranium\u2019s strange emanation was terra incognita.",
              "Curie does deserve credit, not for a leap into an unknown realm, but rather for selecting a topic that already seemed to have been exhausted by some of the best physicists in Europe.",
              "What she expected to extract from the subject is unclear.",
              "It may simply be that she was hoping for some publishable crumbs that would earn her a doctorate while avoiding the competition of a hot field in which she might be scooped and have to start again.",
              "5 Becquerel\u2019s method of detecting uranium rays by their effect on a photographic plate was essentially qualitative.",
              "Seeking to make it quantitative, Marie exploited the rays\u2019 ability to ionize air.",
              "To detect the small resulting current, she used an electrometer of an excellent design created by Pierre and his physicist brother, Jacques, some years earlier.",
              "Marie later claimed that she wished to test every element because she was convinced that she was dealing with an atomic property.",
              "But the original papers lack such an explicit statement.",
              "They merely note that numerous metals, salts, oxides, and minerals were examined.",

              "When she tested pitchblende, a uranium ore consisting mostly of the oxide, it caused her electrometer to read higher than it did for metallic uranium.",
              "That suggested that another active material was entrained in the ore.",
              "So promising was the possibility of discovering a new element that Pierre dropped his own research and joined in his wife\u2019s efforts.",
              "The hint of a new element in pitchblende materialized in July 1898, when the couple reported gathering a substance that was 400 times more active than metallic uranium.",
              "The amount was too small for standard methods of chemical identification (dissolution and precipitation in various reagents) or for spectroscopic identification, which, along with determination of atomic weight, were the techniques required at that time for acceptance of a new element.",
              "On the chance that they did indeed have something new, the Curies proposed to name it \u201cpolonium,\u201d after Marie\u2019s native land.",
              "The April 1898 paper contained something else of note: In it, Marie Curie coined the term \u201cradioactive\u201d to describe the phenomenon.",
              "In retrospect, we see that polonium was the first of many elements discovered solely because they were radioactive.",
              "Indeed, once the laws of radioactive decay were formulated in 1913, the technique was recognized as sufficient to establish a radioelement\u2019s chemical identity.",
              "Polonium remained with the bismuth in pitchblende during numerous precipitations, and was only partially separated from it by sublimation.",
              "While performing these tedious purification tasks, the Curies noticed that the barium fraction was especially radioactive.",
              "Gustave Be\u0301mont, the chief chemistry-lab assistant at the Paris Municipal School, where Pierre worked, now joined the effort, because the Curies were not skilled analytical chemists.",
              "Repeated fractional crystallization yielded a substance of increasing purity and enormous radioactivity, releasing enough energy to glow faintly in the dark.",
              "On the day after Christmas in 1898, the trio\u2019s paper was read to the Acade\u0301mie, and the name \u201cradium\u201d entered the language.",
              "In the first years of the new century, Ernest Rutherford, the Curies, and a handful of other scientists came to understand that the radiation emitted by radioactive materials consisted of alpha and beta particles and the electromagnetic gamma rays.",
              "This small band discovered actinium, \u201cgaseous emanation\u201d (radon), and an assortment of other new radioelements.",
              "They learned, among much else, that the alphas and betas were electrically charged and that some radioelements retained their strength over long periods while others gained or lost activity over measurable time.",
              "At the Municipal School, Marie moved her laboratory from a tiny storeroom to an abandoned shed.",
              "She needed more space to spread out the growing number of dishes in which she was concentrating radium by fractional crystallization.",
              "The initial steps in the concentration involved back-breaking work: chemically treating large quantities of pitchblende residue (ore from which the uranium had already been extracted) in cauldrons.",
              "Marie, although she was a physicist, became responsible for most of the chemical work, while Pierre focused on the physical examination of the rays.",
              "Those were heroic years.",
              "In addition to the intense pressure of research and the teaching positions both held, the Curies, in their beloved, dilapidated shed, had to endure freezing cold in winter and stifling heat in summer.",
              "They were also years of other important accomplishments.",
              "In 1902, Marie determined the atomic weight of radium as 225, just one unit less than the value accepted today.",
              "That was more of a feat than it might seem.",
              "Atomic weight measurements were the province of specialists within the chemical fraternity, experts who had mastered esoteric procedures like refining reagents to exacting purity and removing trapped gases from the interior surfaces of their equipment.",
              "For an amateur like Marie even to undertake the work was rather daring, and her success was impressive.",
              "The Curies with their daughter Ire\u0300ne (1897\u20131956) in 1904.",
              "The Curies with their daughter Ire\u0300ne (1897\u20131956) in 1904.",
              "Radium\u2019s atomic weight, along with its line spectrum, measured by the Curies\u2019 friend Euge\u0300ne DemarC\u0327ay, fulfilled the criteria for including a new element in Dmitri Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table.",
              "By that time, however, Marie\u2019s research career was largely over.",
              "Her scientific work after 1902 consisted mostly of refining established techniques and producing samples of radioactive materials, mostly for medical use.",
              "Pierre also made headlines.",
              "With a young colleague, Albert Laborde, he placed one arm of a thermocouple in a tube of pure barium chloride, and the other arm in a tube of unseparated barium and radium chloride.",
              "The radioactive mixture, they noted, maintained a temperature 1.",
              "5\u00b0C higher than the pure barium salt.",
              "Public attention was riveted when newspapers turned this 1903 laboratory discovery into \u201creal-world\u201d applications such as the ability of one pound of radium to drive a motor car around the globe.",
              "Radium became the exemplar of all radioelements as a cornucopia of energy.",
              "It even threatened to undermine a pillar of 19th-century science: the law of energy conservation.",
              "But then, the explanation of radioactivity as an atomic disintegration, by Rutherford and Frederick Soddy, came to the rescue.",
              "Radium\u2019s fame grew as the public became aware of its enormous cost (about $100 000 a gram) and its ability to destroy cancer cells.",
              "Hospitals sought to obtain a gram for beam therapy or to collect radon, its gaseous daughter product, in tiny tubes that could be surgically implanted in cancerous tissue.",
              "The same crystals that Ro\u0308ntgen had illuminated with x rays could also be made to glow by radioactivity.",
              "Tiny amounts of radium and those crystals, mixed in paint, could make the paint glow in the dark.",
              "This luminous paint was applied to watch dials, light switches, and even to the costumes of nightclub dancers.",
              "The patrons could also drink luminous cocktails.",
              "The variety of radioactive medical nostrums seemed endless: pastes, plasters, muds, inhalers, drinking water, and so forth.",
              "That few people were injured by this exposure to radioactivity suggests the weakness of the products.",
              "The danger was not widely revealed until the 1920s, when some radium watch-dial painters in New Jersey died after \u201cpointing\u201d their brushes on their tongues and ingesting toxic amounts of radioactive paint.",
              "But the danger was already known in smaller circles around 1900, when Becquerel received a burn on his waist after carrying a tube of radium in his vest pocket, and Pierre Curie deliberately gave himself a similar burn.",
              "Some physicians were alerted by such evidence to radium\u2019s clinical potential in dermatology.",
              "While the Curies were not the paupers that some of the mythology suggests, they seem to have poured into their work and gifts of radium whatever was left of their salaries and the substantial prizes they received, most notably their half of the 1903 physics Nobel Prize.",
              "1903 was only the third year in which the Nobel Prizes were given, but the handsome cash awards made the awards famous from the start.",
              "The first physics prize, in 1901, was awarded to Ro\u0308ntgen.",
              "In 1900, Pierre had been offered a professorship in Geneva, but unwilling to interrupt their work by such a move, he declined the chair.",
              "Ultimately, he accepted a minor chair at the University of Paris, where his main responsibility was teaching physics to medical students.",
              "The attraction of the post was better laboratory facilities.",
              "At the time, Marie could not even dream of a professorship, but she was permitted to be her husband\u2019s laboratory chief.",
              "In 1905, Pierre was elected to the Acade\u0301mie.",
              "He had been rejected three years earlier, when he was 43 years old.",
              "For such a relatively young applicant, rejection by the Acade\u0301mie was common.",
              "All too soon after Pierre had acquired the new position and facilities, tragedy struck.",
              "In 1906, emerging from a professional meeting, Pierre was struck and killed by a horse-drawn wagon.",
              "Marie grieved deeply, but with characteristic stubbornness she determined to carry on the work.",
              "Public sympathy pushed the Sorbonne to promote her to her dead husband\u2019s professorship.",
              "Toward the end of the century\u2019s first decade, the still-young widow and her husband\u2019s outstanding student, Paul Langevin, became lovers.",
              "Unfortunately, Langevin was married\u2014unhappily, but nonetheless married.",
              "Portions of the press depicted Marie Curie as a homewrecker and, given her Polish origins, not a true Frenchwoman.",
              "At about that time, she was rejected for admission to the Acade\u0301mie, probably because she was a woman.",
              "She declined ever to apply again.",
              "Even the solo award of the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry did little to mitigate the hostility shown her.",
              "(Linus Pauling and John Bardeen are the only others ever to win two Nobel prizes.)",
              "But finally, her selfless efforts on behalf of wounded soldiers during the war, or perhaps just the passage of time, put an end to the unfriendly attention.",
              "Physicians had immediately seen the value of x rays in diagnostic (and even therapeutic) medicine.",
              "Military surgeons were enthusiastic about the \u201cRo\u0308ntgen-ray apparatus,\u201d and sets were used in military hospitals during Italy\u2019s Abyssinian War (1896), the Greco-Turkish War (1897), the British campaigns at Tyrah and the Khyber Pass (1897) and in the Sudan (1898), aboard a US ship in the Spanish-American War (1898), in the Boer War (1899), the Russo-Japanese War (1905), the Balkan War (1912\u201313), and in probably every other conflict of that era in which at least one combatant was technologically advanced.",

              "What seems clear, however, is that the medical use of x rays was limited by the supply of instruments and trained personnel.",
              "Even in major cities, few units were to be found.",
              "Why such a useful technique did not immediately enjoy more widespread application is uncertain.",
              "Possibly it was the heavy and unwieldy glass photographic plates, the unsteady x-ray tubes, and other such technological difficulties.",
              "Perhaps it was also because physicians and physicists traveled in different circles, and the professional specialty of medical physicist took time to evolve.",
              "Curie learned from an eminent French radiologist that x-ray machines were scarce in the army\u2019s medical corps, and those that were available were \u201crarely in good condition or in good hands.",
              "\u201c 7 Medicine was only then changing from a craft largely taught by apprenticeship to a profession of university-trained specialists willing to adopt the latest instruments.",
              "Organizations to promote innovations were lacking.",
              "Whatever the explanation for the very limited use of x rays in medicine, Marie\u2019s assertion, in her 1921 book La Radiologie et la Guerre (Radiology and the War), that there were very few radiologists in prewar Paris is surprising, even if it\u2019s true.",
              "8 It took the vastly larger number of wounded in World War I to stimulate demand for more radiological units.",
              "9 Caring for the wounded was deemed an appropriate task for women.",
              "But virtually nothing in Marie\u2019s past experiences prepared her for the role she would assume in the Great War.",
              "Her strong social conscience, however, fortified by evidence that radium was a precious medical tool, impelled her to use science and technology in the service of humanity.",
              "Radium was of no conceivable use on the battlefield, but x rays had for years shown their value for the type of wounds one sees in war.",
              "Acquiring the requisite expertise with diagnostic x rays was a small step for Marie.",
              "But, it required a gigantic leap for her to raise the funds, fight the bureaucracy, get the equipment and vehicles, bring the technology to the battlefield\u2014and do all this as a woman in a male society.",
              "All the major combatants employed x rays, scurrying in the first years of the war to train personnel and equip field hospitals.",
              "Curie discussed only France in her book, but we may assume that the problems she encountered were widespread.",
              "She called the French radiological services at the start of the war \u201cnotoriously inadequate.",
              "\u201d Initially, she secured appointment as technical director of radiological services of a private organization.",
              "She then leveraged that position into that of radiology auxiliary to the Military Health Service.",
              "In that role, she was in charge of training x-ray personnel and became a frequent visitor to hospitals and ambulance stations.",
              "Marie not only hauled equipment to these locations, but also set it up and participated in x-ray examination of the wounded\u2014a task in which she was joined by her teenage daughter Ire\u0300ne.",
              "Marie even learned to drive, an uncommon skill for a woman in those days, so that she could dispense with the services of a chauffeur.",
              "Marie Curie near the battlefront in World War I, with three of the many x-ray technicians she trained for war work at the Radium Institute.",
              "Marie Curie near the battlefront in World War I, with three of the many x-ray technicians she trained for war work at the Radium Institute.",
              "Military leaders already recognized the value of x-ray units in rear-area hospitals.",
              "But they were slow to see their usefulness at aid stations close to the front line.",
              "Nor did they think, at first, that more than a few mobile x-ray units would be necessary.",
              "But they soon learned that the fast, accurate determination of a wound\u2019s extent made possible by x rays yielded wiser triage choices.",
              "And faster and more precise surgery led to speedier recovery.",
              "Private individuals donated many automobiles, which were fitted out to serve as mobile units, powered either by a generator or the car\u2019s motor.",
              "Professors and engineers helped install and adjust equipment, while the team accompanying the voiture radiologique (also affectionately called a petit Curie) consisted of a physician, a technician, and a driver, each of whom could eventually perform some of the others\u2019 tasks.",
              "A typical x-ray unit weighed about 100 kg, not including the power source.",
              "The generators could not be standardized, because France used both alternating and direct current, at voltages ranging from 100 to 200 V.",
              "Indeed, buildings selected for field hospitals often lacked any electricity at all, which made the mobile units all the more indispensable.",
              "A transformer boosted the tube voltage to about 50 000 V, and x-ray imaging was done by both fluoroscopy and photography.",
              "For fluoroscopy, which was preferred because of its speed, a physician observed the patient\u2019s wound \u201cin real time\u201d on a fluorescent screen.",
              "X-ray photography provided a permanent record, but it required a darkroom\u2014usually in the car!",
              "Indicative of the improvement in x-ray tubes since the turn of the century is Marie\u2019s comment that exposures of only seconds were now adequate for sharp images.",
              "Toward the end of the war, the US Army began using Coolidge tubes, which had higher-melting-point tungsten anodes in place of the old platinum anodes and were thus able to produce narrower x-ray beams. 10 Proficient teams could be ready for patients within an hour of arrival on the scene\u2014sometimes even within half an hour.",
              "Some individual vehicles provided x-ray diagnosis to as many as 10 000 soldiers during the course of the war.",
              "Bone injuries were the most common damage.",
              "The x-ray teams were aware, to some extent, of the danger to themselves from radiation exposure, particularly from fluoroscopy.",
              "They wore lead aprons and gloves to avoid dermatitis.",
              "The French military trained several hundred technicians.",
              "When that number proved insufficient, Marie and Ire\u0300ne produced about 150 more.",
              "These were women who were given an intensive six- to eight-week course at the Radium Institute in Paris.",
              "It is unclear how novel the presence of these female technicians near the battlefield was.",
              "The statistics that Marie reported in her book on the war work are impressive.",
              "By the end of 1918, France had more than 500 fixed and semifixed radiological units, and about 300 mobile units.",
              "There were by now some 400 French radiological physicians, with their technicians numbering 800 men and 150 women.",
              "In the last two years of the war, almost a million soldiers were examined with x rays.",
              "A medical technique that was but modestly employed in 1914 had become ubiquitous four years later.",
              "By war\u2019s end, no surgeon would think of removing a projectile without precise knowledge of its location.",
              "This remarkably fast change in attitude and practice was notably assisted by the efforts of Marie Curie.",
              "But it took a war unprecedented for its horrific slaughter of young men to inspire this great lifesaving work.",

              "This laboratory was set up just a few streets away from the \u201changar\u201d at the school of industrial chemistry and physics, where Pierre and Marie Curie discovered radioactivity along with polonium and radium in 1898.",
              "The goal was to study radioactivity and its applications in physics, chemistry, biology and medicine.",
              "The set-up was very original for its time: the Institut du Radium featured the Curie laboratory, directed by Marie Curie and entirely devoted to physics and chemistry research, and the Pasteur laboratory, directed by Dr.",
              "Claudius Regaud and devoted to studying the biological effects and medical applications of radioactivity.",
              "In 1911, while her future laboratory was being built on the rue Pierre-Curie in Paris\u2019 5th arrondisssement, Marie Curie won her second Nobel Prize.",
              "This time it was for chemistry, awarded for her work in isolating metallic radium and determining its atomic mass.",
              "Today, she remains the only woman to have ever won two Nobel Prizes.",
              "Once the war ended and they settled into their respective laboratories, Marie Curie and Claudius Regaud proposed a general development project for the Institut du Radium, where research and therapeutic applications would be closely linked.",
              "This well-known research-care continuum, developed by Marie Curie and Claudius Regaud, is still the hallmark of Institut Curie a century later, and its innovations are based on this fundamental mainstay.",
              "The Curie Foundation, created in 1920 under the dual patronage of the Institut du Radium and the Institut Pasteur with financial backing from Henri de Rothschild, was recognized as a public-interest institution the following year.",
              "Its purpose was to finance the research activities of the Institut du Radium and allow medical applications to be offered to patients under optimum conditions.",
              "The Curie Foundation was also behind the opening of a dispensary on the rue d\u2019Ulm in 1922.",
              "In synergy with the Curie laboratory, Dr.",
              "Claudius Regaud and his team developed innovative treatments combining surgery and brand-new radiotherapy methods to treat cancer.",

              "So-called \u201cartificial\u201d radioactivity would come to be a formidable tool for scientific and medical uses of radiation such as imaging, diagnosis and radiotherapy, and it earned them the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1935.",
              "Meanwhile, the influx of patients to the dispensary made it clear that a hospital was urgently needed.",

              "[25][50] Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.",

              "Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present.",
              "[30] She hypothesized that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itself.",
              "[30] This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible.",

              "She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium.",

              "[25] At first the committee had intended to honour only Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, but a committee member and advocate for women scientists, Swedish mathematician Magnus Go\u0308sta Mittag-Leffler, alerted Pierre to the situation, and after his complaint, Marie's name was added to the nomination.",

              "[25][50] Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.",
