    "response": "Marie Curie was a remarkable physicist and chemist who made groundbreaking discoveries on radioactivity and won two Nobel Prizes. One of the most fascinating and little-known facts about her life and career is that she **discovered two new elements: polonium and radium**[^2^] [^5^]. This fact impacted her contributions to science and technology in many ways, such as:\n\n- She coined the term **radioactivity** to describe the phenomenon of atoms spontaneously emitting rays or particles[^2^] [^5^].\n- She developed methods for **isolating radioactive isotopes** and measuring their activity[^2^] [^5^].\n- She founded the **Curie Institutes** in Paris and Warsaw, which are still major centers of medical research today[^2^] [^4^].\n- She championed the development of **X-rays**, especially for medical use during World War I[^2^] [^4^].\n- She inspired generations of scientists, especially women, to pursue careers in physics and chemistry[^2^] [^4^].\n\nMarie Curie's discoveries have had a lasting impact on science and technology, as well as on society and culture.

              "Following Henri Becquerel\u2019s discovery (1896) of a new phenomenon (which she later called \u201cradioactivity\u201d), Marie Curie, looking for a subject for a thesis, decided to find out if the property discovered in uranium was to be found in other matter.",

              "Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose activity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity.",

              "Pierre had managed to arrange that Marie should be allowed to work in the school\u2019s laboratory, and in 1897, she concluded a number of investigations into the magnetic properties of steel on behalf of an industrial association.",

              "Just after a few days, Marie discovered that thorium gives off the same rays as uranium.",
              "Her continued systematic studies of the various chemical compounds gave the surprising result that the strength of the radiation did not depend on the compound that was being studied.",
              "It depended only on the amount of uranium or thorium.",
              "Chemical compounds of the same element generally have very different chemical and physical properties: one uranium compound is a dark powder, another is a transparent yellow crystal, but what was decisive for the radiation they gave off was only the amount of uranium they contained.",
              "Marie drew the conclusion that the ability to radiate did not depend on the arrangement of the atoms in a molecule, it must be linked to the interior of the atom itself.",
              "This discovery was absolutely revolutionary.",
              "From a conceptual point of view it is her most important contribution to the development of physics.",

              "Chemical compounds of the same element generally have very different chemical and physical properties: one uranium compound is a dark powder, another is a transparent yellow crystal, but what was decisive for the radiation they gave off was only the amount of uranium they contained.",
              "Marie drew the conclusion that the ability to radiate did not depend on the arrangement of the atoms in a molecule, it must be linked to the interior of the atom itself.",
              "This discovery was absolutely revolutionary.",
              "From a conceptual point of view it is her most important contribution to the development of physics.",

              "Her findings were that only uranium and thorium gave off this radiation.",
              "Marie\u2019s next idea, seemingly simple but brilliant, was to study the natural ores that contain uranium and thorium.",
              "She obtained samples from geological museums and found that of these ores, pitchblende was four to five times more active than was motivated by the amount of uranium.",
              "It was her hypothesis that a new element that was considerably more active than uranium was present in small amounts in the ore.",
              "Fascinating new vistas were opening up.",
              "Pierre gave up his research into crystals and symmetry in nature which he was deeply involved in and joined Marie in her project.",
              "They found that the strong activity came with the fractions containing bismuth or barium.",
              "When Marie continued her analysis of the bismuth fractions, she found that every time she managed to take away an amount of bismuth, a residue with greater activity was left.",
              "At the end of June 1898, they had a substance that was about 300 times more strongly active than uranium.",
              "In the work they published in July 1898, they write, \u201cWe thus believe that the substance that we have extracted from pitchblende contains a metal never known before, akin to bismuth in its analytic properties.",
              "If the existence of this new metal is confirmed, we suggest that it should be called polonium after the name of the country of origin of one of us.",
              "\u201d It was also in this work that they used the term radioactivity for the first time.",
              "After another few months of work, the Curies informed the l\u2019Acade\u0301mie des Sciences, on December 26, 1898, that they had demonstrated strong grounds for having come upon an additional very active substance that behaved chemically almost like pure barium.",
              "They suggested the name of radium for the new element.",
              "In order to be certain of showing that it was a matter of new elements, the Curies would have to produce them in demonstrable amounts, determine their atomic weight and preferably isolate them.",
              "To do so, the Curies would need tons of the costly pitchblende.",
              "However, it was known that at the Joachimsthal mine in Bohemia large slag-heaps had been left in the surrounding forests.",
              "Marie considered that radium ought to be left in the residue.",
              "A sample was sent to them from Bohemia and the slag was found to be even more active than the original mineral.",

              "In a preface to Pierre Curie\u2019s collected works, Marie describes the shed as having a bituminous floor, and a glass roof which provided incomplete protection against the rain, and where it was like a hothouse in the summer, draughty and cold in the winter;",

              "[25][50] Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.",

              "[55] Because of the negative publicity due to her affair with Langevin, the chair of the Nobel committee, Svante Arrhenius, attempted to prevent her attendance at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in Chemistry, citing her questionable moral standing.",
              "Curie replied that she would be present at the ceremony, because \"the prize has been given to her for her discovery of polonium and radium\" and that \"there is no relation between her scientific work and the facts of her private life\".",
