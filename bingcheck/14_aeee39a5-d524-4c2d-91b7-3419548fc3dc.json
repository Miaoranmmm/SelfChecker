    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. I'm happy to help you with your query. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAccording to Britannica[^1^], Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa between 1503 and 1519, when he was living in Florence. The painting is a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. The alternative title of the painting, La Gioconda, means \"the joyful one\" in Italian.\n\nThe inspiration behind Leonardo's masterpiece is not fully known, but some scholars have suggested that he was influenced by the Northern Renaissance painters who painted portraits in a similar manner to that of the Mona Lisa[^3^]. Others have speculated that he was fascinated by the sitter's personality, beauty, or mysterious smile.\n\nThe technique that Leonardo used to achieve the unique facial expression of the Mona Lisa is called sfumato, which means \"smoky\" in Italian. It is a painting technique that softens the transition between colors and creates a hazy effect. Leonardo applied very thin layers of oil paint to create a realistic and complex rendering of the skin, lips, eyes, and hair of the sitter. He also used subtle shading and perspective to create a sense of depth and harmony between the sitter and the landscape behind her[^5^].\n\nThe Mona Lisa is widely regarded as the pinnacle of portraiture and one of the greatest works of art in history. It has inspired many artists to reinterpret it in different styles and media[^4^]. It is currently displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it attracts millions of visitors every year.",

              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the Mona Lisa\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous possibilities, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo\u2014hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "The Mona Lisa hangs behind bulletproof glass in a gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it has been a part of the museum\u2019s collection since 1804.",
              "It was part of the royal collection before becoming the property of the French people during the Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "The Mona Lisa is priceless.",
              "Any speculative price (some say over a billion dollars!)",
              "would probably be so high that not one person would be able or willing to purchase and maintain the painting.",
              "Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it.",
              "The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for the Mona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment.",
              "Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.",
              "Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece\u2019s celebrity, including its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and its tour to the U.",
              "S.",
              "in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.",
              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal.",
              "Mona Lisa, also called Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, Italian La Gioconda, or French La Joconde, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world\u2019s most famous painting.",
              "It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century.",
              "The sitter\u2019s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.",
              "The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape.",
              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter\u2019s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.",
              "The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting\u2014especially apparent in the sitter\u2019s faint smile\u2014reflects Leonardo\u2019s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo\u2019s vision.",
              "In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits.",
              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",
              "The sitter\u2019s identity has not been definitively proven.",
              "Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo\u2019s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa about 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "French King Francis I, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life, acquired the work after the artist\u2019s death, and it became part of the royal collection.",
              "For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "Following a period hanging in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",
              "During World War II the Mona Lisa, singled out as the most-endangered artwork in the Louvre, was evacuated to various locations in France\u2019s countryside, returning to the museum in 1945 after peace had been declared.",
              "It later traveled to the United States in 1963, drawing about 40,000 people per day during its six-week stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              "It also toured to Tokyo and Moscow in 1974.",

              "French King Francis I, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life, acquired the work after the artist\u2019s death, and it became part of the royal collection.",
              "For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "Following a period hanging in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",
              "During World War II the Mona Lisa, singled out as the most-endangered artwork in the Louvre, was evacuated to various locations in France\u2019s countryside, returning to the museum in 1945 after peace had been declared.",
              "It later traveled to the United States in 1963, drawing about 40,000 people per day during its six-week stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",

              "Scholars have noted that the Mona Lisa is in fairly good condition for its age.",
              "The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its original frame and to braces added by early restorers.",
              "To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting.",
              "Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail.",
              "The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject\u2019s left elbow.",
              "The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work\u2019s visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it."

              "[23][25] In French, the title La Joconde has the same meaning.",

              "Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci.",
              "This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.",
              "[26] In response to the announcement of the discovery of this document, Vincent Delieuvin, the Louvre representative, stated \"Leonardo da Vinci was painting, in 1503, the portrait of a Florentine lady by the name of Lisa del Giocondo.",

              "[27] The catalogue raisonne\u0301 Leonardo da Vinci (2019) confirms that the painting probably depicts Lisa del Giocondo, with Isabella d'Este being the only plausible alternative.",
              "[28] Scholars have developed several alternative views, arguing that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, and identifying at least four other paintings referred to by Vasari as the Mona Lisa.",
              "[29] Several other people have been proposed as the subject of the painting,[30] including Isabella of Aragon,[31] Cecilia Gallerani,[32] Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla,[30] Pacifica Brandano/Brandino, Isabela Gualanda, Caterina Sforza, Bianca Giovanna Sforza, Salai\u0300, and even Leonardo himself.",

              "[36][37] The Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at that time seen as an ideal for womanhood.",

              "Her gaze is fixed on the observer.",
              "The woman appears alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines (sfumato).",
              "The soft blending creates an ambiguous mood \"mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes\".",
              "[39] The depiction of the sitter in three-quarter profile is similar to late 15th-century works by Lorenzo di Credi and Agnolo di Domenico del Mazziere.",
              "[38] Zo\u0308llner notes that the sitter's general position can be traced back to Flemish models and that \"in particular the vertical slices of columns at both sides of the panel had precedents in Flemish portraiture.\"",
              "[40] Woods-Marsden cites Hans Memling's portrait of Benedetto Portinari (1487) or Italian imitations such as Sebastiano Mainardi's pendant portraits for the use of a loggia, which has the effect of mediating between the sitter and the distant landscape, a feature missing from Leonardo's earlier portrait of Ginevra de' Benci.",
              "[41] The painting was one of the first Italian portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape,[43] and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective.",
              "[44] The enigmatic woman is portrayed seated in what appears to be an open loggia with dark pillar bases on either side.",
              "Behind her, a vast landscape recedes to icy mountains, winding paths and a distant bridge, giving only the slightest indications of human presence.",
              "Leonardo has chosen to place the horizon line not at the neck, as he did with Ginevra de' Benci, but on a level with the eyes, thus linking the figure with the landscape and emphasizing the mysterious nature of the painting.",
              "[41] The bridge in the background was identified by Silvano Vincenti as the four-arched Romito di Laterina bridge from Etruscan-Roman times near Laterina, Arezzo over the Arno river.",
              "[45] Other bridges with similar arches suggested as possible locations had more arches.",
              "[45] Mona Lisa has no clearly visible eyebrows or eyelashes, although Vasari describes the eyebrows in detail.",
              "[46][a] In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning.",
              "[49] Cotte discovered that the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made to the size of the face and the direction of gaze.",
              "He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.",
              "[50] There has been much speculation regarding the painting's model and landscape.",
              "For example, Leonardo probably painted his model faithfully since her beauty is not seen as being among the best, \"even when measured by late quattrocento (15th century) or even twenty-first century standards.\"",
              "[51] Some historians in Eastern art, such as Yukio Yashiro, argue that the landscape in the background of the picture was influenced by Chinese paintings,[52] but this thesis has been contested for lack of clear evidence.",
              "[52] Research in 2003 by Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University said that Mona Lisa's smile disappears when observed with direct vision, known as foveal.",
              "Because of the way the human eye processes visual information, it is less suited to pick up shadows directly;",
              "however, peripheral vision can pick up shadows well.",
              "[53] Research in 2008 by a geomorphology professor at Urbino University and an artist-photographer revealed that Mona Lisa's landscape was similar to some views in the Montefeltro region in the Italian provinces of Pesaro and Urbino, and Rimini.",
              "[54][55] Of Leonardo da Vinci's works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned,[56] and one of four works \u2013 the others being Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, Adoration of the Magi and The Last Supper \u2013 whose attribution has avoided controversy.",
              "[57] He had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the model of the Mona Lisa, by October 1503.",
              "[26][27] It is believed by some that the Mona Lisa was begun in 1503 or 1504 in Florence.",
              "[58] Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\",[8] art historian Martin Kemp says that there are some difficulties in confirming the dates with certainty.",
              "[23] Alessandro Vezzosi believes that the painting is characteristic of Leonardo's style in the final years of his life, post-1513.",
              "[59] Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513.",
              "[60] According to Vasari, \"after he had lingered over it four years, [he] left it unfinished\".",
              "[18] In 1516, Leonardo was invited by King Francis I to work at the Clos Luce\u0301 near the Cha\u0302teau d'Amboise;",
              "it is believed that he took the Mona Lisa with him and continued to work on it after he moved to France.",
              "[33] Art historian Carmen C.",
              "Bambach has concluded that Leonardo probably continued refining the work until 1516 or 1517.",

              "[68][69][70] Other later copies of the Mona Lisa, such as those in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design and The Walters Art Museum, also display large flanking columns.",
              "As a result, it was thought that the Mona Lisa had been trimmed.",
              "[71][72][73][74] However, by 1993, Frank Zo\u0308llner observed that the painting surface had never been trimmed;",
              "[75] this was confirmed through a series of tests in 2004.",
              "[76] In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th-century Italian painting at the Louvre, states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version,[77] while Zo\u0308llner states that the sketch may be after another Leonardo portrait of the same subject.",
              "[75] The record of an October 1517 visit by Louis d'Aragon states that the Mona Lisa was executed for the deceased Giuliano de' Medici, Leonardo's steward at Belvedere, Vienna, between 1513 and 1516[78][79][c]\u2014but this was likely an error.",
              "[80][d] According to Vasari, the painting was created for the model's husband, Francesco del Giocondo.",
              "[81] A number of experts have argued that Leonardo made two versions (because of the uncertainty concerning its dating and commissioner, as well as its fate following Leonardo's death in 1519, and the difference of details in Raphael's sketch\u2014which may be explained by the possibility that he made the sketch from memory).",

              "It is sometimes called La Jaconde in French (or in Italian, La Giaconda) because it is believed to be the portrait of the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, whose name was Lisa (Mona = short for \u201cMadonna\u201d (lady)).",

              "The portrait shows what appears to be a typical portrait of a woman in which her wealth is not primary thing on display.",

              "The way Leonardo painted this portrait deviated from the traditional way women were painted like this in Italy.",
              "Mona Lisa looks directly out at us, the viewers, which was something unconventional for a woman in a portrait to do at this time.",
              "She also appears rather content and assured in her demeanor, which reflected more the expectations of the aristocracy among men rather than among women.",
              "Further, until this point in time, portraits of both men and women were typically cut off in the middle of torso and hands were raised so that we the head and face and shoulders occupies more of the panel upon which the paint was applied.",
              "Here, however, the portrait shows not only the woman\u2019s head and upper torso, but much of her body down to just below her waist.",
              "We see all of her arms, which are not raised up but resting comfortably on the armrests of her chair.",
              "The implication of this kind of view is that we are seeing the entire person, rather than just a sliver of her.",
              "Leonardo\u2019s approach was innovative and would start a trend in portrait painting which would influence European painting into 1800s.",
              "The way Leonardo has rendered the body of the woman is nothing less than extraordinary, and it truly reveals the jump forward in the level of naturalism that Italian painters made between 1400 and 1500.",
              "Leonardo makes use of his sfumato technique to show how the light bounces off her skin in certain places while leaving other parts in darker shadows.",
              "Her skin appears to be soft and smooth, and she looks quite like a real, though perhaps somewhat idealized, woman would look like right in front of us.",
              "Leonardo\u2019s skill in this painting particularly impressed the sixteenth-century painter and historian Vasari, who had the following to say about it: In this head, whoever wished to see how closely art could imitate nature, was able to comprehend it with ease;",
              "for in it were counterfeited all the minutenesses that with subtlety are able to be painted, seeing that the eyes had that lustre and watery sheen which are always seen in life, and around them were all those rosy and pearly tints, as well as the lashes, which cannot be represented without the greatest subtlety.",
              "The eyebrows, through his having shown the manner in which the hairs spring from the flesh, here more close and here more scanty, and curve according to the pores of the skin, could not be more natural.",
              "The nose, with its beautiful nostrils, rosy and tender, appeared to be alive.",
              "The mouth, with its opening, and with its ends united by the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the face, seemed, in truth, to be not colours but flesh.",
              "In the pit of the throat, if one gazed upon it intently, could be seen the beating of the pulse.",
              "And, indeed, it may be said that it was painted in such a manner as to make every valiant craftsman, be he who he may, tremble and lose heart.",
              "Apart from the naturalism in the figure, the painting includes a background which provides us with a stark contrast.",
              "Leonardo has placed Lisa against a vast landscape.",
              "The original loggia she was under was cropped out, but you can still see the base of the vertical supports to either side of her (at the right and left edges of the painting).",
              "If we look over her shoulder to the left side, we see a road that leads to distance, and mountains painted in a way which seems similar \u2013 at least on some level \u2013 to Chinese landscape painting of the preceding centuries.",
              "On the right side, we can see a bridge, and a road which leads to sea in the distance.",
              "It is in this vast landscape that we find a compelling juxtaposition in this painting.",
              "We have directly in front of us a touchable woman who is in the world of the here-and-now.",
              "She seems real to us \u2013 a very lifelike figure.",
              "Behind her we have a vast landscape which goes off into unknowable distances, and seems to continue on into a type of misty haze.",
              "The contrast between the woman and the background landscape is therefore quite remarkable, and it lends to the power of the painting.",
              "Overall, the Mona Lisa is a masterpiece in portrait painting which has stood the test of time and continues to inspire and amaze visitors to the Louvre from around the world.",
              "Yet, if we consider it apart from its current role as a leading icon of pop culture in the modern world, we can very much see how this innovative work would have created an impression on Leonardo\u2019s contemporaries in the sixteenth century.",

              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "The Mona Lisa hangs behind bulletproof glass in a gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it has been a part of the museum\u2019s collection since 1804.",

              "Any speculative price (some say over a billion dollars!)",
              "would probably be so high that not one person would be able or willing to purchase and maintain the painting.",
              "Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it.",
              "The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for the Mona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment.",
              "Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.",

              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal.",
              "Mona Lisa, also called Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, Italian La Gioconda, or French La Joconde, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world\u2019s most famous painting.",
              "It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century.",

              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter\u2019s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.",
              "The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting\u2014especially apparent in the sitter\u2019s faint smile\u2014reflects Leonardo\u2019s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo\u2019s vision.",
              "In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits.",

              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",

              "For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "Following a period hanging in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",
              "During World War II the Mona Lisa, singled out as the most-endangered artwork in the Louvre, was evacuated to various locations in France\u2019s countryside, returning to the museum in 1945 after peace had been declared.",
              "It later traveled to the United States in 1963, drawing about 40,000 people per day during its six-week stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",

              "The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its original frame and to braces added by early restorers.",
              "To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting.",
              "Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail.",
              "The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject\u2019s left elbow.",
              "The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work\u2019s visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it."

              "Never mind that the piece of furniture is the only thing that Leonardo's sitter grips in her hand (she's literally pointing at it with every finger she has), the chair must surely be the single most neglected aspect of the otherwise over-stared-at icon.",
              "Hiding in plain sight, it may also be the arrow that points the way to the work's deepest meanings.",
              "More like this: - The fresco with multiple identities - The secret toilet humour in a Titian painting - The tragedy of art's greatest supermodel For centuries, our attention has largely been focused elsewhere in the small (77 x 53cm/30 x 21in) oil-on-poplar panel, which Da Vinci never fully finished and is thought to have continued to tinker with obsessively until his death in 1519 \u2013 as if the painting's endless emergence were the work itself.",
              "A preoccupation principally with Mona Lisa's inscrutable smile is almost as old as the painting, and dates back at least to the reaction of the legendary Renaissance writer and historian Giorgio Vasari, who was born a few years after Da Vinci began work on the likeness.",
              "\"The mouth with its opening and with its ends united by the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the face,\" Vasari observed in his celebrated Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, \"seemed, in truth, to be not colours but flesh.",

              "Not everyone, however, has been content to locate the centre of Mona Lisa's magnetising mystique in her enigmatic grin.",
              "The Victorian writer Walter Pater believed it was the \"delicacy\" with which her hands and eyelids are rendered that transfix and hypnotise us into believing that the work possesses preternatural power.",
              "\"We all know the face and hands of the figure,\" he observed in an article on Da Vinci in 1869, \"in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea\".",
              "Pater proceeds to meditate on the Mona Lisa in such a singularly intense way that in 1936 the Irish poet William Butler Yeats found himself compelled to seize a sentence from Pater's description, break it up into free-verse lines, and install them as the opening poem in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, which Yeats was then compiling.",

              "The portrait \"lives\", Pater concludes, \"only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands\".",
              "Some viewers are as transfixed by Mona Lisa's hands as by her face (Credit: Alamy) Pater's description still astounds.",
              "Unlike Dumesnil and the doomed Maspero before him, Pater sees past the seductive snare of the portrait's smile to a larger vitality that percolates as if from deep below the surface.",
              "Contending that the painting depicts a figure suspended in ceaseless shuttle between the here-and-now and some otherworldly realm that lies beyond, Pater pinpoints the mystical essence of the panel's perennial appeal: its surreal sense of eternal flux.",

              "Perhaps she is.",
              "There is reason to think that such a reading, which sees the sitter as a shape-shifting spring of eternal resurgence, is precisely what Leonardo intended.",
              "Flanked on either side by bodies of flowing water that the artist has ingeniously positioned in such a way as to suggest that they are aspects of his sitter's very being, Da Vinci's subject has a strangely submarine quality to her that is accentuated by the algae green dress she wears \u2013 an amphibious second skin that has only grown murkier and darker with time.",
              "Pivoting her stare slightly to her left to meet ours, Mona Lisa is poised upon not just any old bench or stool, but a deep-seated perch known popularly as a pozzetto chair.",
              "Meaning \"little well\", the pozzetto introduces a subtle symbolism into the narrative that is as revealing as it is unexpected.",
              "By placing Mona Lisa on a 'little well', surrounded by water, Da Vinci could be drawing on earlier spiritual connections with springs (Credit: Alamy) Suddenly, the waters we see meandering with a mazy motion behind Mona Lisa (whether belonging to an actual landscape, such as the valley of the Italian River Arno, as some historians believe, or entirely imaginary, as others contend) are no longer distant and disconnected from the sitter, but are an essential resource that sustain her existence.",
              "They literally flow into her.",
              "By situating Mona Lisa inside a \"little well\", Da Vinci transforms her into an ever-fluctuating dimension of the physical universe she occupies.",
              "Art historian and leading Da Vinci expert Martin Kemp has likewise detected a fundamental connection between Mona Lisa's depiction and the geology of the world she inhabits.",
              "\"The artist was not literally portraying the prehistoric or future Arno,\" Kemp asserts in his study Leonardo: 100 Milestones (2019), \"but was shaping Lisa's landscape on the basis of what he had learned about change in the 'body of the Earth', to stand alongside the implicit transformations in the body of the woman as a 'lesser world' or microcosm.\"",
              "Mona Lisa isn't sitting before a landscape.",
              "She is the landscape.",
              "Drawing from a well As with all visual symbols employed by Leonardo, the pozzetto chair is multivalent and serves more than merely to link Mona Lisa with the artist's well-known fascination with the hydrological forces that shape the Earth.",
              "The subtle insinuation of a \"little well\" in the painting as the very channel through which Mona Lisa emerges into consciousness repositions the painting entirely in cultural discourse.",
              "No longer is this a straightforwardly secular portrait but something spiritually more complex.",
              "Portrayals of women \"at the well\" are a staple throughout Western art history.",
              "Old Testament stories of Eliezar meeting Rebekah at a well and of Jacob meeting Rachel at the well went on to become especially popular in the 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries, as everyone from Bartolome\u0301 Esteban Murillo to Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo to William Holman Hunt tried their hand at one or other of the narratives.",
              "There are many depictions in art of people at wells, such as Christ and the Samaritan Woman (1310-11) by Duccio di Buoninsegna (Credit: Alamy) Moreover apocryphal depictions of the New Testament Annunciation (the moment when the Archangel Gabriel informs the Virgin Mary that she will give birth to Christ) as occurring at the site of a spring were a mainstay among Medieval manuscript illustrators, and may even have inspired the oldest surviving visual portrayal of Mary.",
              "An endlessly elastic emblem, as Walter Pater intimated, Mona Lisa is doubtless capable of absorbing all such reflected resonances and many more besides.",
              "There is no one she isn't.",
              "But perhaps the most pertinent parallel between Da Vinci's Mona Lisa and pictorial precursors is one that can be drawn with the many representations of a biblical episode in which Jesus finds himself at a well, engaged in cryptic conversation with a woman from Samaria.",
              "In the Gospel of John, Jesus makes a distinction between the water that can be drawn from the natural spring \u2013 water which will inevitably leave one \"thirsty\" \u2013 and the \"living water\" that he can provide.",
              "Where water from a well can only sustain a perishable body, 'living water' is capable of quenching the eternal spirit.",
              "Notable depictions of the scene by the Medieval Italian painter Duccio di Buoninsegna and by the German Renaissance master Lucas Cranach the Elder tend to seat Jesus directly on the wall of the well, suggesting his dominion over the fleeting elements of this world.",
              "By placing his female sitter notionally inside the well, however, Da Vinci confounds the tradition, and suggests instead a merging of material and spiritual realms \u2013 a blurring of the here and hereafter \u2013 into a shared plane of eternal emergence.",
              "In Da Vinci's enthralling narrative, Mona Lisa is herself a miraculous surge of \"living water\", serenely content in the knowledge of her own raging infinitude.",

              "Definition of Sfumato: Art History Glossary - ThoughtCo",
              "Leonardo da Vinci / Wikimedia Commons / Public Domain Sfumato (pronounced sfoo\u00b7mah\u00b7toe) is the word art historians use to describe a painting technique taken to dizzying heights by the Italian Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci.",
              "The visual result of the technique is that there are no harsh outlines present (as in a coloring book).",
              "Instead, areas of dark and light blend into one another through miniscule brushstrokes, making for a rather hazy, albeit more realistic, depiction of light and color.",
              "The word sfumato means shaded, and it is the past participle of the Italian verb \"sfumare\" or \"shade.\"",
              "\"Fumare\" means \"smoke\" in Italian, and the combination of smoke and shade perfectly describes the barely perceptible gradation of tones and colors of the technique from light to dark, particularly used in flesh tones.",
              "An early, wonderful example of sfumato can be seen in Leonardo's Mona Lisa.",
              "According to the art historian Giorgio Vasari (1511\u20131574), the technique was first invented by the Primitive Flemish school, including perhaps Jan Van Eyck and Rogier Van Der Weyden.",
              "Da Vinci's first work incorporating sfumato is known as the Madonna of the Rocks, a triptych designed for the chapel in San Francesco Grande, painted between 1483 and 1485.",
              "Madonna of the Rocks was commissioned by the Franciscan Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception which, at the time, was still the object of some controversy.",
              "The Franciscans believed that the Virgin Mary was conceived immaculately (without sex);",
              "the Dominicans argued that would deny the need for Christ's universal redemption of mankind.",
              "The contracted painting needed to show Mary as \"crowned in the living light\" and \"free from shadow,\" reflecting the plenitude of grace while humanity functioned \"in the orbit of the shadow.\"",
              "The final painting included a cave backdrop, which art historian Edward Olszewski says helped to define and signify Mary's immaculacy\u2014expressed by the sfumato technique applied to her face as emerging from the shadow of sin.",
              "Art historians have suggested that the technique was created by the careful application of multiple translucent layers of paint layers.",
              "In 2008, physicists Mady Elias and Pascal Cotte used a spectral technique to (virtually) strip away the thick layer of varnish from the Mona Lisa.",
              "Using a multi-spectral camera, they found that the sfumato effect was created by layers of a single pigment combining 1 percent vermillion and 99 percent lead white.",
              "Quantitative research was conducted by de Viguerie and colleagues (2010) using non-invasive advanced X-ray fluorescence spectrometry on nine faces painted by or attributed to da Vinci.",
              "Their results suggest that he constantly revised and improved the technique, culminating in the Mona Lisa.",
              "In his later paintings, da Vinci developed translucent glazes from an organic medium and laid them on the canvases in very thin films, some of which were only a micron (.",
              "00004 inches) in scale.",
              "Direct optical microscopy has shown that da Vinci achieved flesh tones by superimposing four layers: a priming layer of lead white;",
              "a pink layer of mixed lead white, vermillion, and earth;",
              "a shadow layer made with a translucent glaze with some opaque paint with dark pigments;",
              "and a varnish.",
              "The thickness of each colored layer was found to range between 10-50 microns.",
              "The de Viguerie study identified those glazes on the faces of four of Leonardo's paintings: Mona Lisa, Saint John the Baptist, Bacchus, and Saint Anne, the Virgin, and the Child.",
              "Glaze thicknesses increase on the faces from a few micrometers in the light areas to 30\u201355 microns in the dark areas, which are made of up to 20\u201330 distinct layers.",
              "The thickness of the paint on da Vinci's canvases\u2014not counting the varnish\u2014is never more than 80 microns.",
              "That on St.",
              "John the Baptist is under 50.",
              "But those layers must have been laid down in a slow and deliberate fashion.",
              "The drying time between layers may have lasted from several days to several months, depending on the amount of resin and oil that was used in the glaze.",
              "That might well explain why da Vinci's Mona Lisa took four years, and it was still not completed at da Vinci's death in 1915.",

              "for uncertain purposes, this legal dispute led Leonardo to create another version of the work in about 1508.",
              "During this first Milanese period he also made one of his most famous works, the monumental wall painting Last Supper (1495\u201398) in the refectory of the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie (for more analysis of this work, see below Last Supper).",
              "Also of note is the decorative ceiling painting (1498) he made for the Sala delle Asse in the Milan Castello Sforzesco.",
              "During this period Leonardo worked on a grandiose sculptural project that seems to have been the real reason he was invited to Milan: a monumental equestrian statue in bronze to be erected in honour of Francesco Sforza, the founder of the Sforza dynasty.",
              "Leonardo devoted 12 years\u2014with interruptions\u2014to this task.",
              "In 1493 the clay model of the horse was put on public display on the occasion of the marriage of Emperor Maximilian to Bianca Maria Sforza, and preparations were made to cast the colossal figure, which was to be 16 feet (5 metres) high.",
              "But, because of the imminent danger of war, the metal, ready to be poured, was used to make cannons instead, causing the project to come to a halt.",
              "Ludovico\u2019s fall in 1499 sealed the fate of this abortive undertaking, which was perhaps the grandest concept of a monument in the 15th century.",
              "The ensuing war left the clay model a heap of ruins.",
              "As a master artist, Leonardo maintained an extensive workshop in Milan, employing apprentices and students.",
              "Among Leonardo\u2019s pupils at this time were Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, Ambrogio de Predis, Bernardino de\u2019 Conti, Francesco Napoletano, Andrea Solari, Marco d\u2019Oggiono, and Salai.",
              "The role of most of these associates is unclear, leading to the question of Leonardo\u2019s so-called apocryphal works, on which the master collaborated with his assistants.",
              "Scholars have been unable to agree in their attributions of these works."

              "Leonardo da Vinci - Paintings, Inventions &amp; Quotes - Biography",
              "Leonardo da Vinci was a Renaissance artist and engineer, known for paintings like \"The Last Supper\" and \"Mona Lisa,\u201d and for inventions like a flying machine.",
              "(1452-1519) Leonardo da Vinci was a Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, inventor, military engineer and draftsman \u2014 the epitome of a true Renaissance man.",
              "Gifted with a curious mind and a brilliant intellect, da Vinci studied the laws of science and nature, which greatly informed his work.",
              "His drawings, paintings and other works have influenced countless artists and engineers over the centuries.",
              "Da Vinci was born in a farmhouse outside the village of Anchiano in Tuscany, Italy (about 18 miles west of Florence) on April 15, 1452.",
              "Born out of wedlock to respected Florentine notary Ser Piero and a young peasant woman named Caterina, da Vinci was raised by his father and his stepmother.",
              "At the age of five, he moved to his father\u2019s estate in nearby Vinci (the town from which his surname derives), where he lived with his uncle and grandparents.",
              "Young da Vinci received little formal education beyond basic reading, writing and mathematics instruction, but his artistic talents were evident from an early age.",
              "Around the age of 14, da Vinci began a lengthy apprenticeship with the noted artist Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence.",
              "He learned a wide breadth of technical skills including metalworking, leather arts, carpentry, drawing, painting and sculpting.",
              "His earliest known dated work \u2014 a pen-and-ink drawing of a landscape in the Arno valley \u2014 was sketched in 1473.",
              "At the age of 20, da Vinci qualified for membership as a master artist in Florence\u2019s Guild of Saint Luke and established his own workshop.",
              "However, he continued to collaborate with del Verrocchio for an additional five years.",
              "It is thought that del Verrocchio completed his \u201cBaptism of Christ\u201d around 1475 with the help of his student, who painted part of the background and the young angel holding the robe of Jesus.",
              "According to Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects, written around 1550 by artist Giorgio Vasari, del Verrocchio was so humbled by the superior talent of his pupil that he never picked up a paintbrush again.",
              "(Most scholars, however, dismiss Vasari\u2019s account as apocryphal.)",
              "In 1478, after leaving del Verrocchio\u2019s studio, da Vinci received his first independent commission for an altarpiece to reside in a chapel inside Florence\u2019s Palazzo Vecchio.",
              "Three years later the Augustinian monks of Florence\u2019s San Donato a Scopeto tasked him to paint \u201cAdoration of the Magi.",
              "\u201d The young artist, however, would leave the city and abandon both commissions without ever completing them.",
              "Many historians believe that da Vinci was a homosexual: Florentine court records from 1476 show that da Vinci and four other young men were charged with sodomy, a crime punishable by exile or death.",
              "After no witnesses showed up to testify against 24-year-old da Vinci, the charges were dropped, but his whereabouts went entirely undocumented for the following two years.",
              "Several other famous Florentine artists were also known to have been homosexual, including Michelangelo, Donatello and Sandro Botticelli.",
              "Indeed, homosexuality was such a fact of artistic life in Renaissance Florence that the word \"florenzer\" became German slang for \u201cgay.",
              "\u201d Although da Vinci is known for his artistic abilities, fewer than two dozen paintings attributed to him exist.",
              "One reason is that his interests were so varied that he wasn\u2019t a prolific painter.",
              "Da Vinci\u2019s most famous works include the \u201cVitruvian Man,\u201d \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d and the \u201cMona Lisa.",
              "\u201d Art and science intersected perfectly in da Vinci\u2019s sketch of \u201cVitruvian Man,\u201d drawn in 1490, which depicted a nude male figure in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart inside both a square and a circle.",
              "The now-famous sketch represents da Vinci's study of proportion and symmetry, as well as his desire to relate man to the natural world.",
              "Around 1495, Ludovico Sforza, then the Duke of Milan, commissioned da Vinci to paint \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d on the back wall of the dining hall inside the monastery of Milan\u2019s Santa Maria delle Grazie.",
              "The masterpiece, which took approximately three years to complete, captures the drama of the moment when Jesus informs the Twelve Apostles gathered for Passover dinner that one of them would soon betray him.",
              "The range of facial expressions and the body language of the figures around the table bring the masterful composition to life.",
              "The decision by da Vinci to paint with tempera and oil on dried plaster instead of painting a fresco on fresh plaster led to the quick deterioration and flaking of \u201cThe Last Supper.",
              "\u201d Although an improper restoration caused further damage to the mural, it has now been stabilized using modern conservation techniques.",
              "In 1503, da Vinci started working on what would become his most well-known painting \u2014 and arguably the most famous painting in the world \u2014the \u201cMona Lisa.",
              "\u201d The privately commissioned work is characterized by the enigmatic smile of the woman in the half-portrait, which derives from da Vinci\u2019s sfumato technique.",
              "Adding to the allure of the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d is the mystery surrounding the identity of the subject.",
              "Princess Isabella of Naples, an unnamed courtesan and da Vinci\u2019s own mother have all been put forth as potential sitters for the masterpiece.",
              "It has even been speculated that the subject wasn\u2019t a female at all but da Vinci\u2019s longtime apprentice Salai dressed in women\u2019s clothing.",
              "Based on accounts from an early biographer, however, the \"Mona Lisa\" is a picture of Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Florentine silk merchant.",
              "The painting\u2019s original Italian name \u2014 \u201cLa Gioconda\u201d \u2014 supports the theory, but it\u2019s far from certain.",
              "Some art historians believe the merchant commissioned the portrait to celebrate the pending birth of the couple\u2019s next child, which means the subject could have been pregnant at the time of the painting.",
              "If the Giocondo family did indeed commission the painting, they never received it.",
              "For da Vinci, the \"Mona Lisa\" was forever a work in progress, as it was his attempt at perfection, and he never parted with the painting.",
              "Today, the \"Mona Lisa\" hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, secured behind bulletproof glass and regarded as a priceless national treasure seen by millions of visitors each year.",
              "In 1503, da Vinci also started work on the \"Battle of Anghiari,\" a mural commissioned for the council hall in the Palazzo Vecchio that was to be twice as large as \"The Last Supper.\"",
              "He abandoned the \"Battle of Anghiari\" project after two years when the mural began to deteriorate before he had a chance to finish it.",
              "In 1482, Florentine ruler Lorenzo de' Medici commissioned da Vinci to create a silver lyre and bring it as a peace gesture to Ludovico Sforza.",
              "After doing so, da Vinci lobbied Ludovico for a job and sent the future Duke of Milan a letter that barely mentioned his considerable talents as an artist and instead touted his more marketable skills as a military engineer.",
              "Using his inventive mind, da Vinci sketched war machines such as a war chariot with scythe blades mounted on the sides, an armored tank propelled by two men cranking a shaft and even an enormous crossbow that required a small army of men to operate.",
              "The letter worked, and Ludovico brought da Vinci to Milan for a tenure that would last 17 years.",
              "During his time in Milan, da Vinci was commissioned to work on numerous artistic projects as well, including \u201cThe Last Supper.",
              "\u201d Da Vinci\u2019s ability to be employed by the Sforza clan as an architecture and military engineering advisor as well as a painter and sculptor spoke to da Vinci\u2019s keen intellect and curiosity about a wide variety of subjects.",
              "Always a man ahead of his time, da Vinci appeared to prophesy the future with his sketches of devices that resemble a modern-day bicycle and a type of helicopter.",
              "Perhaps his most well-known invention is a flying machine, which is based on the physiology of a bat.",
              "These and other explorations into the mechanics of flight are found in da Vinci's Codex on the Flight of Birds, a study of avian aeronautics, which he began in 1505.",
              "Like many leaders of Renaissance humanism, da Vinci did not see a divide between science and art.",
              "He viewed the two as intertwined disciplines rather than separate ones.",
              "He believed studying science made him a better artist.",
              "In 1502 and 1503, da Vinci also briefly worked in Florence as a military engineer for Cesare Borgia, the illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI and commander of the papal army.",
              "He traveled outside of Florence to survey military construction projects and sketch city plans and topographical maps.",
              "He designed plans, possibly with noted diplomat Niccolo\u0300 Machiavelli, to divert the Arno River away from rival Pisa in order to deny its wartime enemy access to the sea.",
              "DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S LEONARDO DA VINCI FACT CARD Da Vinci thought sight was humankind\u2019s most important sense and eyes the most important organ, and he stressed the importance of saper vedere, or \u201cknowing how to see.",
              "\u201d He believed in the accumulation of direct knowledge and facts through observation.",
              "\u201cA good painter has two chief objects to paint \u2014 man and the intention of his soul,\u201d da Vinci wrote.",
              "\u201cThe former is easy, the latter hard, for it must be expressed by gestures and the movement of the limbs.",
              "\u201d To more accurately depict those gestures and movements, da Vinci began to study anatomy seriously and dissect human and animal bodies during the 1480s.",
              "His drawings of a fetus in utero, the heart and vascular system, sex organs and other bone and muscular structures are some of the first on human record.",
              "In addition to his anatomical investigations, da Vinci studied botany, geology, zoology, hydraulics, aeronautics and physics.",
              "He sketched his observations on loose sheets of papers and pads that he tucked inside his belt.",
              "Da Vinci placed the papers in notebooks and arranged them around four broad themes\u2014painting, architecture, mechanics and human anatomy.",
              "He filled dozens of notebooks with finely drawn illustrations and scientific observations.",
              "Ludovico Sforza also tasked da Vinci with sculpting a 16-foot-tall bronze equestrian statue of his father and founder of the family dynasty, Francesco Sforza.",
              "With the help of apprentices and students in his workshop, da Vinci worked on the project on and off for more than a dozen years.",
              "Da Vinci sculpted a life-size clay model of the statue, but the project was put on hold when war with France required bronze to be used for casting cannons, not sculptures.",
              "After French forces overran Milan in 1499 \u2014 and shot the clay model to pieces \u2014 da Vinci fled the city along with the duke and the Sforza family.",
              "Ironically, Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, who led the French forces that conquered Ludovico in 1499, followed in his foe\u2019s footsteps and commissioned da Vinci to sculpt a grand equestrian statue, one that could be mounted on his tomb.",
              "After years of work and numerous sketches by da Vinci, Trivulzio decided to scale back the size of the statue, which was ultimately never finished.",
              "Da Vinci returned to Milan in 1506 to work for the very French rulers who had overtaken the city seven years earlier and forced him to flee.",
              "Among the students who joined his studio was young Milanese aristocrat Francesco Melzi, who would become da Vinci\u2019s closest companion for the rest of his life.",
              "He did little painting during his second stint in Milan, however, and most of his time was instead dedicated to scientific studies.",
              "Amid political strife and the temporary expulsion of the French from Milan, da Vinci left the city and moved to Rome in 1513 along with Salai, Melzi and two studio assistants.",
              "Giuliano de\u2019 Medici, brother of newly installed Pope Leo X and son of his former patron, gave da Vinci a monthly stipend along with a suite of rooms at his residence inside the Vatican.",
              "His new patron, however, also gave da Vinci little work.",
              "Lacking large commissions, he devoted most of his time in Rome to mathematical studies and scientific exploration.",
              "After being present at a 1515 meeting between France\u2019s King Francis I and Pope Leo X in Bologna, the new French monarch offered da Vinci the title \u201cPremier Painter and Engineer and Architect to the King.",
              "\u201d Along with Melzi, da Vinci departed for France, never to return.",
              "He lived in the Chateau de Cloux (now Clos Luce) near the king\u2019s summer palace along the Loire River in Amboise.",
              "As in Rome, da Vinci did little painting during his time in France.",
              "One of his last commissioned works was a mechanical lion that could walk and open its chest to reveal a bouquet of lilies.",
              "Da Vinci died of a probable stroke on May 2, 1519, at the age of 67.",
              "He continued work on his scientific studies until his death;",
              "his assistant, Melzi, became the principal heir and executor of his estate.",
              "The \u201cMona Lisa\u201d was bequeathed to Salai.",
              "For centuries after his death, thousands of pages from his private journals with notes, drawings, observations and scientific theories have surfaced and provided a fuller measure of the true \"Renaissance man.\"",
              "Although much has been written about da Vinci over the years, Walter Isaacson explored new territory with an acclaimed 2017 biography, Leonardo da Vinci, which offers up details on what drove the artist's creations and inventions.",
              "The buzz surrounding the book carried into 2018, with the announcement that it had been optioned for a big-screen adaptation starring Leonardo DiCaprio.",
              "In 2017, the art world was sent buzzing with the news that the da Vinci painting \"Salvator Mundi\" had been sold at a Christie's auction to an undisclosed buyer for a whopping $450.",
              "3 million.",
              "That amount dwarfed the previous record for an art work sold at an auction, the $179.",
              "4 million paid for \u201cWomen of Algiers\" by Pablo Picasso in 2015.",
              "The sales figure was stunning in part because of the damaged condition of the oil-on-panel, which features Jesus Christ with his right hand raised in blessing and his left holding a crystal orb, and because not all experts believe it was rendered by da Vinci.",
              "However, Christie's had launched what one dealer called a \"brilliant marketing campaign,\" which promoted the work as \"the holy grail of our business\" and \"the last da Vinci.\"",

              "\u201d Today he remains best known for two of his paintings, \"Mona Lisa\" and \"The Last Supper.\"",
              "Largely self-educated, he filled dozens of secret notebooks with inventions, observations and theories about pursuits from aeronautics to human anatomy.",
              "His combination of intellect and imagination allowed him to create, at least on paper, such inventions as the bicycle, the helicopter and an airplane based on the physiology and flying ability of a bat.",
              "Da Vinci was born in Anchiano, Tuscany (now Italy), in 1452, close to the town of Vinci that provided the surname we associate with him today.",
              "In his own time he was known just as Leonardo or as \u201cIl Florentine,\u201d since he lived near Florence\u2014and was famed as an artist, inventor and thinker.",
              "Did you know?",
              "Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s father, an attorney and notary, and his peasant mother were never married to one another, and Leonardo was the only child they had together.",
              "With other partners, they had a total of 17 other children, da Vinci\u2019s half-siblings.",
              "Da Vinci\u2019s parents weren\u2019t married, and his mother, Caterina, a peasant, wed another man while da Vinci was very young and began a new family.",
              "Beginning around age 5, he lived on the estate in Vinci that belonged to the family of his father, Ser Peiro, an attorney and notary.",
              "Da Vinci\u2019s uncle, who had a particular appreciation for nature that da Vinci grew to share, also helped raise him.",
              "Da Vinci received no formal education beyond basic reading, writing and math, but his father appreciated his artistic talent and apprenticed him at around age 15 to the noted sculptor and painter Andrea del Verrocchio of Florence.",
              "For about a decade, da Vinci refined his painting and sculpting techniques and trained in mechanical arts.",
              "When he was 20, in 1472, the painters\u2019 guild of Florence offered da Vinci membership, but he remained with Verrocchio until he became an independent master in 1478.",
              "Around 1482, he began to paint his first commissioned work, The Adoration of the Magi, for Florence\u2019s San Donato, a Scopeto monastery.",
              "However, da Vinci never completed that piece, because shortly thereafter he relocated to Milan to work for the ruling Sforza clan, serving as an engineer, painter, architect, designer of court festivals and, most notably, a sculptor.",
              "The family asked da Vinci to create a magnificent 16-foot-tall equestrian statue, in bronze, to honor dynasty founder Francesco Sforza.",
              "Da Vinci worked on the project on and off for 12 years, and in 1493 a clay model was ready to display.",
              "Imminent war, however, meant repurposing the bronze earmarked for the sculpture into cannons, and the clay model was destroyed in the conflict after the ruling Sforza duke fell from power in 1499.",
              "Although relatively few of da Vinci\u2019s paintings and sculptures survive\u2014in part because his total output was quite small\u2014two of his extant works are among the world\u2019s most well-known and admired paintings.",

              "When Milan was invaded by the French in 1499 and the Sforza family fled, da Vinci escaped as well, possibly first to Venice and then to Florence.",
              "There, he painted a series of portraits that included \u201cLa Gioconda,\u201d a 21-by-31-inch work that\u2019s best known today as \u201cMona Lisa.",
              "\u201d Painted between approximately 1503 and 1506, the woman depicted\u2014especially because of her mysterious slight smile\u2014has been the subject of speculation for centuries.",
              "In the past she was often thought to be Mona Lisa Gherardini, a courtesan, but current scholarship indicates that she was Lisa del Giocondo, wife of Florentine merchant Francisco del Giocondo.",
              "Today, the portrait\u2014the only da Vinci portrait from this period that survives\u2014is housed at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, where it attracts millions of visitors each year.",
              "Around 1506, da Vinci returned to Milan, along with a group of his students and disciples, including young aristocrat Francesco Melzi, who would be Leonardo\u2019s closest companion until the artist\u2019s death.",
              "Ironically, the victor over the Duke Ludovico Sforza, Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, commissioned da Vinci to sculpt his grand equestrian-statue tomb.",
              "It, too, was never completed (this time because Trivulzio scaled back his plan).",
              "Da Vinci spent seven years in Milan, followed by three more in Rome after Milan once again became inhospitable because of political strife.",
              "Da Vinci\u2019s interests ranged far beyond fine art.",
              "He studied nature, mechanics, anatomy, physics, architecture, weaponry and more, often creating accurate, workable designs for machines like the bicycle, helicopter, submarine and military tank that would not come to fruition for centuries.",
              "He was, wrote Sigmund Freud, \u201clike a man who awoke too early in the darkness, while the others were all still asleep.",
              "\u201d Several themes could be said to unite da Vinci\u2019s eclectic interests.",
              "Most notably, he believed that sight was mankind\u2019s most important sense and that \u201csaper vedere\u201d (\u201cknowing how to see\u201d) was crucial to living all aspects of life fully.",
              "He saw science and art as complementary rather than distinct disciplines, and thought that ideas formulated in one realm could\u2014and should\u2014inform the other.",
              "Probably because of his abundance of diverse interests, da Vinci failed to complete a significant number of his paintings and projects.",
              "He spent a great deal of time immersing himself in nature, testing scientific laws, dissecting bodies (human and animal) and thinking and writing about his observations.",
              "At some point in the early 1490s, da Vinci began filling notebooks related to four broad themes\u2014painting, architecture, mechanics and human anatomy\u2014creating thousands of pages of neatly drawn illustrations and densely penned commentary, some of which (thanks to left-handed \u201cmirror script\u201d) was indecipherable to others.",
              "The notebooks\u2014often referred to as da Vinci\u2019s manuscripts and \u201ccodices\u201d\u2014are housed today in museum collections after having been scattered after his death.",
              "The Codex Atlanticus, for instance, includes a plan for a 65-foot mechanical bat, essentially a flying machine based on the physiology of the bat and on the principles of aeronautics and physics.",
              "Other notebooks contained da Vinci\u2019s anatomical studies of the human skeleton, muscles, brain, and digestive and reproductive systems, which brought new understanding of the human body to a wider audience.",
              "However, because they weren\u2019t published in the 1500s, da Vinci\u2019s notebooks had little influence on scientific advancement in the Renaissance period.",
              "Da Vinci left Italy for good in 1516, when French ruler Francis I generously offered him the title of \u201cPremier Painter and Engineer and Architect to the King,\u201d which afforded him the opportunity to paint and draw at his leisure while living in a country manor house, the Cha\u0302teau of Cloux, near Amboise in France.",
              "Although accompanied by Melzi, to whom he would leave his estate, the bitter tone in drafts of some of his correspondence from this period indicate that da Vinci\u2019s final years may not have been very happy ones.",
              "(Melzi would go on to marry and have a son, whose heirs, upon his death, sold da Vinci\u2019s estate.)",
              "Da Vinci died at Cloux (now Clos-Luce\u0301) in 1519 at age 67.",
              "He was buried nearby in the palace church of Saint-Florentin.",
              "The French Revolution nearly obliterated the church, and its remains were completely demolished in the early 1800s, making it impossible to identify da Vinci\u2019s exact gravesite.",
