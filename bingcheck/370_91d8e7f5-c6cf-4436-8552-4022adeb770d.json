    "response": "That's a great question. Building and maintaining a successful startup is not easy, but it can be rewarding if you follow some key principles and strategies, and avoid some common pitfalls.\n\nSome of the key principles and strategies for building and maintaining a successful startup are[^1^] [^2^] [^4^] [^5^]:\n\n- **Know your value proposition**: You should be able to explain how your startup is uniquely qualified to meet or exceed customers\u2019 expectations, and what problem you are solving for them.\n- **Articulate a value framework oriented toward societal impact**: You should have a clear vision of the role you play in society and how you create value for others, beyond just financial achievement.\n- **Build-Measure-Learn loop**: You should adopt an iterative cycle of building a product or feature, measuring its impact on customers, and learning from the feedback to improve the product.\n- **Adaptable long-term strategy**: You should have a flexible plan that guides your decisions regarding customers, technologies, identity, and competitive space, and that can adjust to changing market conditions and customer needs.\n- **Scalable leadership**: You should develop your own skill set and hire talented people who share your vision and values, and empower them to make decisions and take ownership of their work.\n\nSome of the common pitfalls that entrepreneurs should avoid are[^6^] [^7^] [^8^] [^9^] [^10^]:\n\n- **Setting up a business without a foundation**: You should not rush into launching your business without doing proper research, planning, testing, and validation of your idea and market.\n- **Making complicated products or services**: You should not overcomplicate your offering with too many features or options that confuse or overwhelm your customers. Instead, focus on delivering a simple and effective solution that solves their pain points.\n- **Not having any idea of your industry**: You should not enter a market without knowing who your competitors are, what they offer, how they operate, and what their strengths and weaknesses are. You should also keep up with the latest trends and developments in your industry.\n- **Hiring employees in a hurry**: You should not hire people just to fill positions or based on credentials alone. You should look for people who have the right skills, attitude, fit, and potential to grow with your business.\n- **Not concentrating on business growth**: You should not get complacent or distracted by other things once you have launched your business. You should always look for ways to improve your product or service, reach new customers, increase revenue, and reduce costs.\n\nI hope this helps you with your startup journey. \ud83d\ude0a",

              "Disruption and the breadth of the value creation ecosystem are, in fact, connected.",
              "In recent months, as supply chains have faltered, channels to market have evolved, and companies\u2019 roles in caring for their customers and employees have been magnified, it\u2019s become clear that the pursuit of financial productivity and profitable growth, long the core of traditional value creation models, is inadequate on its own.",
              "Companies must do more.",
              "Those looking to create enterprise value \u2014 a term we\u2019ve chosen intentionally over shareholder value \u2014 must also cultivate resilience and contribute to the well-being of society, both now and in the future.",

              "For many years, creating and protecting enterprise value has meant managing a diverse ecosystem of financial, societal, environmental, and other factors.",
              "That reality hasn\u2019t changed.",
              "What has changed is that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragility of relationships throughout the ecosystem and the dynamism of change within it.",
              "It\u2019s also amplified and accelerated the connections among financial productivity, resilience, and society.",
              "And it\u2019s accentuated the danger of ignoring any of these parts of the value creation ecosystem.",
              "The pandemic has exposed leaders\u2019 blind spots and put many companies on the defensive.",
              "In all these ways, COVID-19\u2019s impact has been acute.",
              "But other long-brewing disruptions \u2014 including the quickening pace of technological development and growing concerns among investors and consumers about issues such as climate change, racial inequality, income disparities, and political polarization \u2014 have the same implications.",
              "As these forces escalate, some will have a substantial and rapid effect on enterprise value.",
              "Now is the time for leaders to analyze these varying impacts and turn disruption into an offensive weapon by reinventing their planning processes, reframing their strategies, and revising their ways of working.",
              "And in taking these steps \u2014 which might include creating new supply chains, new products, new people policies, or even new standards of transparency in decision-making \u2014 organizations need to recognize that disruption and value creation are inextricably linked, and although disruption is continually posing risks to corporate value, it\u2019s also presenting new opportunities.",
              "Some of the levers businesses can pull will help them win in their industry, and others will help them win in society.",

              "In this article, we\u2019ll describe what we think are the most important actions for creating long-term enterprise value in today\u2019s value creation ecosystem.",
              "Companies setting out to create and grow enterprise value in today\u2019s value creation ecosystem first need to fully understand its topography \u2014 and the trade-offs, tensions, and balancing acts that are inherent within it.",
              "The ecosystem consists of three interrelated components: \u2022 Financial productivity.",
              "Capital markets have long rewarded companies for investing to drive growth while also improving efficiency to make that growth more profitable.",
              "As a result, companies have always had to carefully balance spending money and saving money, with the added consideration that investing for growth is a long-term enabler in building resilient assets.",
              "Organizations have responded to the capital markets\u2019 focus on financial outcomes by becoming very good at measuring and communicating their financial productivity, focusing much more on that than on nonfinancial aspects of their performance and impacts.",
              "\u2022 Resilience.",
              "A truly resilient organization can both respond to and adjust effectively to external shocks (that is, it has defensive adaptability) and flex and stretch to seize new opportunities (offensive agility).",
              "COVID-19 has amplified the value of being resilient in areas such as supply chain and digital platforms. And the increased need for resilience in these areas has captured the attention of capital markets \u2014 in turn creating new imperatives for leaders seeking to build enterprise value.",
              "\u2022 Society.",
              "An organization also creates enterprise value by addressing broad societal challenges and by considering in its decision-making a wider range of stakeholders beyond shareholders.",
              "This approach can, for instance, avoid the value destruction that can result from climate risk or boost value by attracting and retaining more talented, engaged, and productive employees via diversity and inclusion programs. And actually, the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders are, in many cases, converging.",
              "Shareholders\u2019 perspective on value is becoming more long-term and more holistic.",
              "In recent months, the interdependencies and widening inequalities highlighted by COVID-19 have further intensified the pressure on companies to deliver, measure, and report on longer-term value creation for society.",
              "For some years, the balance among these three sources of enterprise value has been shifting.",
              "Long before COVID-19, companies whose strategies and assets were over-indexed on efficiency were struggling.",
              "For these businesses, a focus on near-term returns often has meant trading off the long term \u2014 an imbalance that the digital era has made more obvious.",
              "Reconfiguring to compete successfully in the 21st century requires a business to flex and upgrade critical capabilities such as strategic direction-setting, resource allocation processes, and governance, which together enable the deployment and recalibration of operating assets.",
              "Stretching these same capabilities is also crucial for leaders if they are to make their companies more resilient and more purposeful contributors to society, thereby creating, or at least avoiding the destruction of, enterprise value.",
              "The pandemic has thrown the trade-offs among financial productivity, resilience, and society into sharp relief.",
              "Those on the right side of the trade-offs include the companies that responded quickly to the disruption of business as usual \u2014 perhaps by repurposing their production facilities and supply chains to maintain some level of activity while also generating societal value.",
              "Organizations need to recognize that disruption and value creation are inextricably linked, and although disruption is continually posing risks to corporate value, it\u2019s also presenting opportunities.",
              "Consider the France-based luxury goods maker LVMH.",

              "In fact, any attempt could end up blocking innovation and, ultimately, value.",
              "Instead, leaders should look to achieve a \u201cvisionary valuation\u201d by clarifying the forms of value they\u2019re trying to create, understanding how commitment to those types of value will drive enterprise value, and developing a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) to track value creation across this broader ecosystem.",
              "Then, while executing the strategy, the business should measure the outcomes continually, using the results to recalibrate, course-correct, or even replace the strategy, and to report, listen, and respond to stakeholders in a feedback loop.",
              "Get the strategy+business newsletter delivered to your inbox (sample) EmailEmail address: (sample) Organizations need to do these things against a global backdrop in which both the destruction and the creation of value, including value-associated issues such as climate change and social upheaval, are accelerating.",
              "In such an environment, the only way to communicate effectively with stakeholders is by translating critical corporate priorities through a value lens and representing the effects of strategic decisions and subsequent actions in a unified value framework.",
              "Such a framework will reinforce linkages between a company\u2019s purpose and its strategy;",
              "between its strategic priorities and transparent reporting of all its results, including nonfinancial ones;",
              "and between its agenda for corporate transformation and societal renewal.",
              "It also will help communicate interconnections within the value creation ecosystem and clarify enterprise value drivers that historically might not have made their way into a calculation of net present value.",
              "Unilever puts sustainability at the heart of its strategy.",
              "An instance of a business making these linkages explicit arose in December 2020, when global consumer products giant Unilever announced it would put its climate transition action plan before shareholders for approval, reportedly becoming the first major global company to take such a step.",
              "The move strongly underlined the convergence of the shareholder and wider stakeholder agendas.",
              "Unilever CEO Alan Jope commented, \u201cWe have a wide-ranging and ambitious set of climate commitments \u2014 but we know they are only as good as our delivery against them.",

              "For Unilever, the assessment confirmed the importance of understanding the critical business dependencies of climate change and having plans in place to mitigate risks and prepare for the operating environment of the future.",
              "To rethink strategy in the face of disruption, businesses in any industry can ask: If we were coming into this marketplace today as a new entrant, unburdened by legacy infrastructure and assets, what strategy would we adopt?",
              "This blank-slate mindset enables leaders to anticipate new competitive threats and opportunities and potentially formulate, evaluate, and fine-tune a strategy that could turn them into actual, not hypothetical, disruptors.",
              "Organizations that have fully deployed and executed a blank-slate strategy are few and far between.",
              "But among those that have, several have succeeded in creating sustainable new operating models that have significantly boosted enterprise value \u2014 and some are extending that value creation far across their ecosystem.",
              "We\u2019d suggest, in fact, that the gathering force of the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) imperative will create enormous opportunities for disruption and self-disruption, just as the digital revolution did.",
              "Netflix and Qantas self-disrupt.",
              "Take Netflix, which has disrupted its industry twice and itself once: first by launching a DVD mail service against incumbents such as Blockbuster and then by switching to streaming in 2007 and production of in-home entertainment in 2012.",
              "The second strategy, in particular, delivered.",
              "In the third quarter of 2010, Netflix\u2019s market value was $8.",
              "75 billion.",
              "A decade later, it was $233 billion.",
              "Another prominent example of blank-slate self-disruption was the launch of the low-cost airline Jetstar in 2003 by the Australian incumbent Qantas, which faced fierce competition in the early 2000s from an Australia-based low-cost carrier.",
              "A review of previous low-cost carrier launches by other incumbents that had failed quickly revealed the underlying problem: The legacy carriers were trying to avoid disturbing their core.",
              "Qantas\u2019s board decided not to make the same mistake.",
              "It set about building Jetstar as a completely new low-cost carrier that would be as separate and independent as possible from Qantas\u2019s core business and even compete with it in some ways.",
              "This meant recruiting Jetstar\u2019s management externally;",
              "basing the company in Melbourne rather than Sydney;",
              "having no direct check-through of baggage between airlines, no shared terminals, and no access to the Qantas loyalty or reservation systems;",
              "and often using different \u2014 lower-cost \u2014 airports.",
              "Crucially, Qantas accepted that the parent business would lose some revenues to its new offspring.",
              "Point-to-point routes that were less profitable for Qantas were reallocated to Jetstar.",
              "The Sydney to Melbourne trip \u2014 one of the world\u2019s busiest domestic routes \u2014 was shared, with Jetstar\u2019s flights timed to suit cost-sensitive leisure travelers and Qantas\u2019s scheduled for the less cost-conscious business market.",
              "The outcome?",
              "Over 18 years, Jetstar has proven to be a highly successful airline that has taken market share profitably from Qantas and the competition.",
              "Qantas itself flies fewer routes than before Jetstar came along, but those routes are more profitable.",
              "By thinking like a disruptor, Qantas tapped into a massive low-cost market that might otherwise have gone elsewhere.",
              "It was a brave decision by Qantas\u2019s leaders \u2014 and a smart, value-adding one for the group\u2019s future.",

              "For example, it was aware of changes to the regulation of advice, but its internal controls were not strong enough to adequately monitor compliance with the regulation, triggering a series of private litigations.",
              "Then, its group executive and board misread the sentiment of leadership and a shift in community expectations, and this issue bubbled up into the public domain, affecting the company\u2019s reputation.",
              "The resulting slide in the company\u2019s valuation attracted the attention of private equity investors, one of whom tabled a takeover offer with a control premium effectively funded by removing the overhang of anticipated future regulatory actions.",

              "In constructing a reference class, the first step is to review which of these factors are most relevant.",
              "Say a small, technologically adroit company that lacks complementary assets enters a new industry at the same time as large, diversified companies that do have them enter it.",
              "In this case, the small company should create a reference class of similar entrants in other industries, not this one.",

              "Besides developing a reference class, companies should remove any bias from their analysis of the entry decision.",
              "Start by targeting five core issues: the value proposition and capabilities, the market's size, the competition, market share and revenue, and costs (Exhibit 3).",
              "Of course, other analyses (of regulatory issues, for example) are occasionally necessary and sometimes of paramount importance.",

              "All of these biases undermine the analysis.",
              "A memorable example of a company that underestimated the difficulty of developing new skills dates back to the 1970s, when the music producer EMI entered the CAT scanner business on the back of an innovation developed primarily by Godfrey N.",

              "(Hounsfield, however, won a Nobel Prize in 1979.)",
              "To avoid such mistakes, companies should use the reference class to identify the key determinants of successful entries into similar markets.",

              "Did they have outstanding distribution systems?",
              "If new capabilities seem to be needed for success, companies should exercise caution and consider contractual approaches, such as joint ventures and licensing, that can help them secure the missing assets.",
              "It's frequently valuable to have people who are not directly involved in making the decision help determine what's needed for a successful entry.",
              "After all, the analysis of managers from different divisions will be less biased by ingrained knowledge of the organization's current value proposition and skills.",
              "Estimating a market's potential size typically involves categorizing customers into a number of segments and then using pricing and elasticity assumptions to estimate the percentage of buyers in each category the company might capture.",
              "Two biases typically distort such estimates.",

              "Each then visited it, plus others in the neighborhood.",
              "The agents didn't know that the listing prices they had been given for the house in question were all different and had been randomly manipulated within a range of plus or minus 11 percent of the actual listing price.",
              "Those spurious listing prices significantly affected the evaluations of the agents.",
              "Yet even when they were told about the results, they maintained that the listing-price anchor had had no effect on them.",
              "To avoid anchoring estimates on a target market's current growth rate, companies should always try to determine the life cycle stage of the business they wish to enter.",
              "At some point, most industries experience shakeouts, which can be particularly severe in fast-growing sectors.",
              "Although it is difficult to predict the exact timing, efforts to think through the possibility of a shakeouta\u0302\u0080\u0094and how many companies are likely to survive ita\u0302\u0080\u0094often highlight the unsustainability of current growth rates.",
              "A second useful way of improving estimates of market size is to use the reference class of other entrants as a benchmark.",
              "Consider the fate of the Segway, a new type of two-wheeled vehicle unveiled in December 2001.",
              "Although we don't know for sure what the inventor, Dean Kamen, did to estimate the size of the market, we do know how many Segways he thought could be sold after a year: 10,000 a week.",
              "A typical approach for arriving at such a figure would have involved combining an analysis of the number of consumers who could both afford the Segway and realistically use it for commuting or recreation, on the one hand, with penetration rates in this demographic for similar products, such as scooters and bicycles, on the other.",
              "But the Segway's usefulness depended on changes to infrastructure.",
              "How many cities would allow people to drive the vehicle on sidewalks?",
              "If roads were the only alternative, how many potential purchasers would still be willing to use it?",

              "A broader reference class that included conventional automobiles, fuel cell cars, hydrogen cars, and infrastructure-dependent technologies such as high-definition television and telephones might have shown that securing the right to ride the Segway in cities was of paramount importance.",
              "After all, it took years to create the roads, power grids, standards, and networks necessary for cars, electric lighting, HDTV, and telephone service to become ubiquitous.",
              "Other market entries fail because companies underestimate the competition.",
              "Many decision makers, for example, don't grasp the likelihood that their rivals may enter the same market they have targeted;",
              "they suffer from competitive blind spots when thinking about what could go wrong.",

              "Although discretion is sometimes the better part of valor, this analysis is meant to help companies react to the competition's moves before they happen, not to scare entrants away from a fight.",
              "The benefits of recognizing and countering potential entrants can be large.",
              "Consider the case of Softsoap, the first liquid-soap manufacturer.",
