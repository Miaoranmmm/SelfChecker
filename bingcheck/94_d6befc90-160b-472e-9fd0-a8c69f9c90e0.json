              "Poised on a promontory on the strait between Denmark and Sweden, this Renaissance castle would provide a natural point of reference in imagining Bennelong Point on the other side of the world.",
              "Unique among the entries, Utzon\u2019s entry placed the concert halls side by side, their shell-shaped roofs cantilevering out over the end of Bennelong Point, evoking Sydney\u2019s cliffs and the sails on its harbour.",
              "It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location, and was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbourside location.",
              "Inspired by the judges\u2019 confidence in his winning design, Utzon held fast to his ideals for a \u201cperfect building\u201d, delivering extraordinary and beautiful designs and solutions for both the external and internal spaces.",

              "Such modernist buildings typically resembled glass boxes, as did many of the entrants to the Sydney Opera House competition.",
              "In contrast, Utzon\u2019s design was more sculptural and embraced expressionism.",

              "Like many architects, J\u00f8rn Utzon had initially entered the competition to design Sydney\u2019s opera house to exercise his ideas.",
              "He was surprised to learn he had won.",
              "Born in 1918 in Copenhagen, Utzon grew up in the immediate aftermath of the First World War.",
              "Despite the enormous disruption wrought by the conflict, modernity was already beginning to remodel the landscape of 20th century Europe.",
              "By 1956, the year of his opera house competition entry, Utzon had inherited broadly from the artistic, cultural and scientific revolutions that arose out of this immense period of change.",

              "\u201d Both Aalto and Asplund combined the traditions of Nordic classicism with emerging modernist principles, a fusion that proved important to Utzon.",

              "It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location, and was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbourside location.",
