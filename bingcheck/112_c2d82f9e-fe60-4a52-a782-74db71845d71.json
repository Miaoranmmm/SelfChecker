              "Upon returning to Denmark, where he is a professor at the University of Copenhagen, he pored through the scientific literature.",
              "He came across a study tracking size of the sharks over decades, and size and age are tightly correlated in fish.",
              "The study showed that one of the sharks grew something like three inches in 16 years.",
              "\u201cIf the sharks grew half a centimeter per year and they can grow up to five meters [15 feet] or more, it doesn\u2019t take a lot of math to calculate that they probably are very old.",
              "\u201d At the time, he estimated they could be up to 200 years old.",
              "That was the first step in what has turned into some remarkable scientific detective work that resulted in a study that posited that Greenland sharks could be the longest-living vertebrate species in the world, surpassing the bowhead whale, koi fish, and Galapagos tortoise.",
              "It also sparked a constellation of research around our current understanding of longevity, as well as about the ongoing survival of this enigmatic\u2014and downright weird\u2014species.",
              "At first glance, Greenland sharks are strange, but perhaps unremarkable.",
              "They\u2019re sluggish, awkwardly proportioned, and often have long, pinkish parasites dangling from their eyes.",
              "They engage in cannibalistic behavior and dive more than a mile deep and can roam from the icy North Atlantic Ocean to the balmy Gulf of Mexico.",
              "In the first half of the 20th century, Greenland sharks were commercially hunted for their oil-rich livers, to the tune of hundreds of thousands of animals a year.",

              "In 1984 alone, around 5,000 were collected, for about $50 each.",
              "Today they only fetch a fifth of this price, but the hostility is not discounted.",
              "This was why Steffensen\u2019s fishing captain was so baffled, but that didn\u2019t dull Steffensen\u2019s interest, especially in the rumors of extreme longevity.",
              "But how could find out for sure?",

              "What about eye lenses?",
              "Unlike most tissues, which grow new cells, eye lenses are produced at birth and remain exceptionally stable, so crystalline proteins in the lens could be subjected to carbon dating.",
              "In fact, Heinemeier had used that exact approach in the investigation of a child murder case in Germany in 2008.",
              "Julius Nielsen, then a doctoral student and now a scientist with the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, helped lead the study and gained access to the remains of 28 female Greenland sharks caught by local fishermen, between three and 15 feet in length.",
              "Following Heinemeier\u2019s technique, they extracted the eyes, peeled their outer layers, and scraped the lenses.",
              "\u201cTheir eyeballs are about the size of oranges,\u201d says Steffensen, adding that at that moment he had some in his own freezer.",
              "\u201cAnd your eye lens is built up nearly like an onion: it\u2019s layered on the outside, but in the middle you have the nucleus, and the nucleus has the original carbon.",
              "\u201d The results were astounding, indicating that Greenland sharks could live anywhere between 272 and 512 years.",
              "There could be Greenland sharks alive today, the results suggest, that were born during the Renaissance.",
              "\u201cI think our first response was: \u2018What did we do wrong?",
              "\u2019 No, I mean, seriously, you come up with this number, and you think, \u2018Holy crap, we\u2019ve done something wrong,\u2019\u201d says Peter Bushnell, a biologist at Indiana University South Bend who worked closely with Steffensen and led the analysis.",
              "Among the subtleties they observed was that larger, older sharks grow at an exponentially slower rate than young ones.",
              "So among the largest sharks, a difference of just four inches could represent several decades of life.",
              "The largest shark in the study was more than 16 feet long.",
              "Steffensen knew from personal experience that Greenland sharks could reach 18 feet.",
              "That couple of feet could represent a couple more centuries.",
              "To be fair, Bushnell and Steffensen are sure to say, this kind of extrapolation comes with a high degree of uncertainty.",
              "But if these sharks do indeed live for centuries, it \u201craises all kinds of different questions about cells and cardiovascular function and heart tissue and blood vessels, and, you know, everything,\u201d Bushnell says.",
              "\u201cHow does something live that long?",
              "\u201d After Steffensen and his colleagues published their findings in Science in 2016, this spooky, cadaverous shark became something of a sensation.",

              "\u201cI just think it\u2019s logical.",
              "\u201d Bushnell finds this work interesting but inherently misleading.",
              "Genetics certainly play a role, he says, but the most important factors are lifestyle and environment.",
              "Greenland sharks are large, deep-sea creatures that evolved to live in icy-cold temperatures, all of which dials down their metabolism.",
              "Their languid movements and ascetic ability to live off a single seal for nearly a year shows that they are highly energy efficient.",
              "And, importantly, Greenland sharks have no predators\u2014except, occasionally, one another.",
              "\u201cTo live so long, we would have to live like a Greenland shark, and that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he says.",
              "But there is a dark side to longevity: a prolonged period of sexual maturation.",
              "Animals that live slowly reproduce slowly.",
              "It may take around 150 years for them to become sexually mature, so all the bycatch in the fishing industry means that a lot of sharks are dying before they give birth.",
              "A recent study led by Nielsen estimated that Greenland sharks may produce more than 200 pups per pregnancy, up to 20 times more than previously thought.",
              "So while they may offset the difficulty of delayed sexual maturity by having hundreds of pups at a time, it also suggests that survival of the species may rest on a limited population of centuries-old, exceptionally fertile females, says Nielsen.",
              "If they go, the entire species could at risk.",
              "\u201cThe loss of a sexually mature Greenland shark is particularly disturbing,\u201d he says.",

              "It rivals the Pacific sleeper shark (possibly up to 7 m or 23 ft long) as the largest species in the family Somniosidae.",
              "The Greenland shark is a thickset species, with a short, rounded snout, small eyes, and very small dorsal and pectoral fins.",
              "The gill openings are very small for the species' great size.",
              "Coloration can range from pale creamy-gray to blackish-brown and the body is typically uniform in color, though whitish spots or faint dark streaks are occasionally seen on the back.",
              "[10] When feeding on large carcasses, the shark employs a rolling motion of its jaw.",
              "The 48 to 52 teeth of the upper jaw are very thin and pointed, lacking serrations.",
              "These upper jaw teeth act as an anchor while the lower jaw proceeds to cut massive chunks out of the prey.",
              "The 48 to 52 lower teeth are interlocking, broad and square in shape, containing short, smooth cusps that point outward.",
              "[10] Teeth in the two halves of the lower jaw are strongly pitched in opposite directions.",

              "[4] The prey found in the stomachs of Greenland sharks is an indicator of the active hunting patterns of these predators.",
              "[13] Recorded fish prey have included smaller sharks, skates, eels, herring, capelin, Arctic char, cod, rosefish, sculpins, lumpfish, wolffish, and flounder.",

              "[14] Greenland sharks, because of their slow speeds, often hunt prey that are asleep.",
              "Using their cryptic coloration, they can approach prey undetected before closing the remaining distance by opening their large buccal cavity to create a suction that draws in the prey.",
              "This is the likely explanation for why the gut contents of Greenland sharks are often whole prey specimens.",
              "[13] Greenland sharks have also been found with remains of seals, moose,[15] and reindeer (in one case an entire reindeer body) in their stomachs.",

              "No cases of predation on humans have been verified.",
              "[10] As an ectotherm living in a just-above-freezing environment, the Greenland shark has the lowest swim speed and tail-beat frequency for its size across all fish species, which most likely correlates with its very slow metabolism and extreme longevity.",

              "[28] It was speculated that the copepod may display bioluminescence and thus attract prey for the shark in a mutualistic relationship, but this hypothesis has not been verified.",
              "[29] These parasites also damage the eyeball in several ways, leading to almost complete blindness.",
              "This does not seem to reduce the life expectancy or predatory ability of Greenland sharks, due to their strong reliance on smell and hearing.",

              "[32][34][35] Efforts to conserve Greenland sharks are particularly important due to their extreme longevity, long maturation periods, and the heightened sensitivity of large shark populations.",
              "[36] As recently as 1957, females were found not to deposit eggs in the bottom mud, but retain the developing embryos within their bodies so they are born alive (a process known as ovoviviparity) after an estimated gestation period of 8\u201318 years.",
              "[18] About ten pups per litter is normal, each initially measuring some 38\u201342 cm (15\u201316+1\u20442 in) in length.",
              "[34][37][self-published source?]",
              "Within a Greenland shark's uterus, villi serve a key function in supplying oxygen to embryos.",
              "It is speculated that due to embryonic metabolism dealing with reproduction, this only allows for a limited litter size of around 10 pups.",
              "[38] It has been estimated that due to their extreme longevity, Greenland sharks can have 200 to 700 pups during their lifetime.",
              "[18] Like other elasmobranchii, Greenland sharks have high concentrations of the two nitrogenous compounds urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their tissues, which increase their buoyancy[39] and function as osmoprotectants.",
              "TMAO also counteracts the protein-destabilizing tendencies of urea[40][41] and deep-water pressure.",
              "[5][41] Its presence in the tissues of both elasmobranch and teleost fish has been found to increase with depth.",
              "[5][42] The blood of Greenland sharks contains three major types of hemoglobin, made up of two copies of \u03b1 globin combined with two copies of three very similar \u03b2 subunits.",
              "These three types show very similar oxygenation and carbonylation properties, which are unaffected by urea, an important compound in marine elasmobranch physiology.",
              "They display identical electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectra, indicating that their heme-pocket structures are identical or highly similar.",
              "The hemoglobins also have a lower affinity for O2 compared to temperate sharks.",
              "These characteristics are interpreted as adaptations to living at great water depths.",
              "[43] The flesh of the Greenland shark is toxic because of the presence of high concentrations of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO).",
              "If the meat is eaten without pretreatment, the ingested TMAO is metabolized into trimethylamine, which may be a uremic toxin.",
              "Occasionally, sled dogs that eat the flesh are unable to stand up because of this effect.",
              "Similar toxic effects occur with the related Pacific sleeper shark, but not in most other shark species.",
              "[44][45] The meat can be treated for safe consumption by boiling in several changes of water, drying, or fermenting for several months to produce k\u00e6stur ha\u0301karl.",
              "Traditionally, this is done by burying the meat in boreal ground for 6\u20138 weeks, which presses the TMAO out of the meat and also results in partial fermentation.",
              "The meat is then excavated and hung in strips to dry for several more months.",
              "[46] It is considered a delicacy in Iceland.",
              "[47][self-published source?]",
              "[48][49] The Greenland shark's poisonous flesh has a high urea content, which gave rise to the Inuit legend of Skalugsuak, the first Greenland shark.",
              "[50] The legend says that an old woman washed her hair in urine (a common practice to kill head lice) and dried it with a cloth.",
              "The cloth blew into the ocean to become Skalugsuak.",
              "[51] Another legend tells of Sedna whose father cut off her fingers while drowning her, with each finger turning into a sea creature, including Skalugsuak.",
              "[52] The Greenland shark plays a role in cosmologies of the Inuit from the Canadian Eastern Arctic and Greenland.",
              "Igloolik Inuit believe that the shark lives within the urine pot of Sedna, goddess of the sea, and consequently, its flesh has a urine-like smell and acts as a helping spirit to shamans.",
              "[53] As both scavengers and active predators, Greenland sharks have established themselves as apex predators in Arctic ecosystems. They eat a wide variety of fish, seals, and other prey within these ecosystems and have an important role in the intricate food web.",
              "[13][14] Greenland sharks are recognized as the longest-lived vertebrates on earth.",
              "They have a slow growth rate, late maturity period, and low fecundity, making the management and conservation of this species very important.",
              "As a result of their low productivity and extreme longevity, this species is particularly susceptible to overfishing.",
              "Therefore, Greenland sharks' longevity and conservative life history traits, in tandem with their vulnerability to accidental catching and commercial fishing, promotes a growing concern for the sustainability of this species.",
              "[54] The shark has historically been hunted for its liver oil up until the development of synthetic oils and cessation of export of liver oil and skin from Greenland in the 1960s.",
              "[55][full citation needed] In the 1970s, the species was perceived as a problem for other fisheries in western Norway and the government subsidized a fishery to reduce the stock of the species.",

              "[57][1] The shark is likely affected by quantity, dynamics, and distribution of Arctic sea ice.",
              "[54] The rate of projected loss of sea ice will continue to negatively influence the abundance, distribution and availability of prey, while, at the same time, providing greater access for fishing fleets.",

              "The Greenland shark is a thickset species, with a short, rounded snout, small eyes, and very small dorsal and pectoral fins.",
              "The gill openings are very small for the species' great size.",
              "Coloration can range from pale creamy-gray to blackish-brown and the body is typically uniform in color, though whitish spots or faint dark streaks are occasionally seen on the back.",
              "[10] When feeding on large carcasses, the shark employs a rolling motion of its jaw.",
              "The 48 to 52 teeth of the upper jaw are very thin and pointed, lacking serrations.",
              "These upper jaw teeth act as an anchor while the lower jaw proceeds to cut massive chunks out of the prey.",
              "The 48 to 52 lower teeth are interlocking, broad and square in shape, containing short, smooth cusps that point outward.",
              "[10] Teeth in the two halves of the lower jaw are strongly pitched in opposite directions.",

              "[14] Greenland sharks, because of their slow speeds, often hunt prey that are asleep.",
              "Using their cryptic coloration, they can approach prey undetected before closing the remaining distance by opening their large buccal cavity to create a suction that draws in the prey.",
              "This is the likely explanation for why the gut contents of Greenland sharks are often whole prey specimens.",
              "[13] Greenland sharks have also been found with remains of seals, moose,[15] and reindeer (in one case an entire reindeer body) in their stomachs.",

              "No cases of predation on humans have been verified.",
              "[10] As an ectotherm living in a just-above-freezing environment, the Greenland shark has the lowest swim speed and tail-beat frequency for its size across all fish species, which most likely correlates with its very slow metabolism and extreme longevity.",

              "[28] It was speculated that the copepod may display bioluminescence and thus attract prey for the shark in a mutualistic relationship, but this hypothesis has not been verified.",
              "[29] These parasites also damage the eyeball in several ways, leading to almost complete blindness.",
              "This does not seem to reduce the life expectancy or predatory ability of Greenland sharks, due to their strong reliance on smell and hearing.",

              "[38] It has been estimated that due to their extreme longevity, Greenland sharks can have 200 to 700 pups during their lifetime.",
              "[18] Like other elasmobranchii, Greenland sharks have high concentrations of the two nitrogenous compounds urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their tissues, which increase their buoyancy[39] and function as osmoprotectants.",
              "TMAO also counteracts the protein-destabilizing tendencies of urea[40][41] and deep-water pressure.",

              "Igloolik Inuit believe that the shark lives within the urine pot of Sedna, goddess of the sea, and consequently, its flesh has a urine-like smell and acts as a helping spirit to shamans.",
              "[53] As both scavengers and active predators, Greenland sharks have established themselves as apex predators in Arctic ecosystems. They eat a wide variety of fish, seals, and other prey within these ecosystems and have an important role in the intricate food web.",

              "Researchers used radiocarbon dating to determine the ages of 28 of the animals, and estimated that one female was about 400 years old.",
              "The team found that the sharks grow at just 1cm a year, and reach sexual maturity at about the age of 150.",
              "The research is published in the journal Science.",
              "Lead author Julius Nielsen, a marine biologist from the University of Copenhagen, said: \"We had our expectations that we were dealing with an unusual animal, but I think everyone doing this research was very surprised to learn the sharks were as old as they were.\"",
              "The former vertebrate record-holder was a bowhead whale estimated to be 211 years old.",
              "But if invertebrates are brought into the longevity competition, a 507-year-old clam called Ming holds the title of most aged animal.",
              "Greenland sharks are huge beasts, that can grow up to 5m in length.",
              "They can be found, swimming slowly, throughout the cold, deep waters of the North Atlantic.",
              "With this leisurely pace of life and sluggish growth rate, the sharks were thought to live for a long time.",
              "But until now, determining any ages was difficult.",
              "This video can not be played Julius Neilsen explains how they used carbon dating on a shark's eye lens to discover the age For some fish, scientists are able to examine ear bones called otoliths, which when sectioned, show a pattern of concentric rings that scientists can count as they would the rings in a tree.",
              "Sharks are harder, but some species, such as the Great White, have calcified tissue that grows in layers on their back bones, that can also be used to age the animals.",
              "\"But the Greenland shark is a very, very soft shark - it has no hard body parts where growth layers are deposited.",
              "So it was believed that the age could not be investigated,\" Mr Nielsen told the BBC.",
              "However the team found a clever way of working out the age.",
              "\"The Greenland shark's eye lens is composed of a specialised material - and it contains proteins that are metabolically inert,\" explained Mr Neilson.",
              "\"Which means after the proteins have been synthesised in the body, they are not renewed any more.",
              "So we can isolate the tissue that formed when the shark was a pup, and do radiocarbon dating.\"",
              "The team looked at 28 sharks, most of which had died after being caught in fishing nets as by-catch.",
              "Using this technique, they established that the largest shark - a 5m-long female - was extremely ancient.",
              "Because radiocarbon dating does not produce exact dates, they believe that she could have been as \"young\" as 272 or as old as 512.",
              "But she was most likely somewhere in the middle, so about 400 years old.",
              "It means she was born between the years of 1501 and 1744, but her most likely date of birth was in the 17th century.",
              "\"Even with the lowest part of this uncertainty, 272 years, even if that is the maximum age, it should still be considered the longest-living vertebrate,\" said Mr Nielsen.",
              "Conversely, if her age is at the upper end of the scale, she will have out-lived Ming the clam - although her age has a greater probability of lying in the middle.",
              "The team believes the animals only reach sexual maturity when they are 4m-long.",
              "And with this new, very lengthy age-range, it suggests this does not occur until the animals are about 150 years old.",
              "The researchers say this has consequences for future conservation of the animals.",
              "Because of their extreme longevity, Greenland sharks may still be recovering from being over-fished before WW2.",
              "The sharks' livers were once used for machine oil, and they were killed in great numbers before a synthetic alternative was found and the demand fell.",
              "\"When you evaluate the size distribution all over the North Atlantic, it is quite rare that you see sexually mature females, and quite rare that you find newborn pups or juveniles,\" Mr Nielsen explained.",
              "\"It seems most are sub-adults.",
              "That makes sense: if you have had this very high fishing pressure, all the old animals - they are not there any more.",
              "And there are not that many to give birth to new ones.",
              "\"There is, though, still a very large amount of 'teenagers', but it will take another 100 years for them to become sexually active.\"",
              "Another author of the study, Prof Christopher Ramsey, director of Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit at the University of Oxford, said that radiocarbon dating could be used to determine the ages of other animals, but was not likely to be chosen as the primary method.",
              "\"For many animals we have other methods to determine age,\" he said.",
              "\"Also, the radiocarbon method is not very precise, and so is only really relevant for very long-lived species.\"",
              "He added that the statistical method used to determine the sharks' ages was Bayesian statistics.",
              "\"Bayesian statistics were first worked out by the Rev Bayes in the 18th Century.",
