              "[12] In Angry Birds, the player controls a flock of multi-colored birds that are attempting to save their eggs from green-colored pigs.",
              "[13] In each stage of the gameplay, the pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass,[14] and stone resembling children's toy building blocks.",
              "The objective of the game is to eliminate all the pigs on the level.",
              "Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and pop the pigs.",
              "[15] The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions).",
              "The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released.",
              "In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach pigs.",
              "Also hidden in the levels, players can unlock bonus levels by collecting golden eggs.",
              "There are several different types of birds used in the game, distinguished by their color and shape.",

              "Each level starts with the quantity, types, and firing order of birds predetermined.",
              "[13][15] If all of the pigs are eliminated after the last bird is launched, the level is cleared and the next level is unlocked.",
              "[13] If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not defeated, the level is failed and must be repeated.",
              "Points are scored for each pig defeated as well as for damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds.",

              "[17] While the picture gave no clue as to what type of game was being played, the staff liked the characters,[17] and the team elected to design a game around them.",
              "[18] In early 2009, physics games, such as Crush the Castle, were popular flash-based web games, so the Rovio team was inspired by these games.",

              "If that name sounds familiar, it's because that's the studio that developed the massive mobile hit Angry Birds.",
              "Since striking it very rich with the original Angry Birds game in 2009, Rovio has been churning out sequels and spin-offs for the franchise, while also using the license for two feature films and a TV series.",
              "However, it sounds like Sega has even bigger plans for the studio, especially when it comes to exploring new IP.",

              "Fun gameplay, simple controls, realistic physics, and playful graphics combined with little competition on the App Store, tons of luck, and a string of solid business decisions turned Angry Birds into a household name that kids and adults recognize instantly.",

              "By 2009, however, the company was struggling to remain afloat.",
              "To fix this situation, they took matters into their own hands and decided to produce a game all for themselves.",
              "With the iPhone being the hot new device, the company opted for a calculated approach, aiming to produce a game that was so simple it wouldn\u2019t need a tutorial and have simple controls that are easy to get started with but take a while to really master to get users engaged faster and for a longer period.",
              "When Angry Birds hit the US App Store in December of 2009, it was flop, albeit a very pretty one.",
              "The game didn\u2019t chart well and had little traction, but giving up isn\u2019t how you build a franchise.",
              "Rovio realized the big markets were hard to break into, so they focused their efforts on smaller markets such as Sweden, Denmark, and Greece, where they were able to climb the charts quickly.",
              "In February of 2010, Apple first featured Angry Birds in the UK (after months of pressure from Rovio) and that\u2019s when things started to take off.",
              "Over the next five years, the team at Rovio went on to do some amazing work both on and off the app store.",

              "Succeeding with one app is hard, but once Rovio built up momentum they realized that their users wanted more.",
              "They wanted constant updates.",
              "The problem was that in the App Store, every time a new update is released, the game would lose its ranks and ratings.",

              "Although it charted well and had great reviews, the bundle was pulled just under two months later.",
              "Since there\u2019s no other explanation available, it\u2019s likely that the reason for the bundle being pulled is that the new revenue it generated didn\u2019t make up for the loss it created by cannibalizing the individual apps\u2019 downloads at full price.",
              "We can theorize that this means demand for Angry Birds is fairly inelastic, making a price drop result in reduced revenue, but that\u2019s a topic worthy of a separate post in the future.",
              "By 2012, the birds had started to lose their ranks.",
              "Two years is a long time to dominate the Games charts.",
              "Rovio anticipated that, and took an interesting approach, producing a game that used the birds everyone fell in love with but in a slightly different way.",
              "They sent them to space with a slightly different gameplay that got new and also existing users excited again.",
              "The game opened well and held a top 10 position for quite some time.",
              "Changing gameplay is a technique Rovio adopted after the success of Angry Birds Space.",
              "The company then went on to make additional bold changes: Let\u2019s see how users reacted to the new releases: Of all reviews received by Angry Birds games over the years, only ~10% are critical The chart above shows the count of star ratings for all of the apps we\u2019ve been mentioning, combined, broken down by their sentiment.",

              "Examining the chart we can see that with few exceptions, the overall sentiment is decidedly positive.",

              "received in the first few months were negative You can see the first few days received almost as many negative reviews as it did positive ones.",
              "A combination of crashes and lack of support for older devices (iPods) caused a ruckus, but the real problem with Go!",
              "was that it wasn\u2019t unique.",
              "Where Angry Birds created a category of flinging games, Go!",
              "simply competed with every other racing game out on the app store.",

              "We attribute the negative ratings to a combination of the app adding very little value and also to users thinking that downloading Countdown meant they were downloading Go!",
              ",though that was not the case.",
              "By 2011 the Angry Birds franchise was already in full swing, dominating all major markets and being mentioned on and offline nonstop.",
              "It was so well known that to promote 20th Century Fox\u2019s new movie Rio, the studio partnered with Rovio to clone the successful title and theme it around the new movie.",
              "In January of 2011, Angry Birds Rio went live and climbed the games charts very quickly, a rare occurrence for paid games at that time.",
              "Rio eventually turned free once it lost its ranks in 2012.",
              "The price drop gave Rio a short-term surge, only to see a sharp decline out of the top 50.",
              "Having built Angry Birds Space, the franchise was now ready for its next partnership.",
              "A different game mechanism meant the franchise could clone Space without hurting the original title or Rio.",
              "Released in July of 2012, Angry Birds Star Wars also climbed the Games charts quickly, and like the original partnership, the title claimed a spot in the top 50 for more than a year, a commendable period of time.",
              "We can see a clear pattern here, new gameplay \u2192 new partnership.",
              "The third installment, and the last partnership so far, is Angry Birds Transformers, a side-scrolling game released in the summer of 2013.",
              "Maybe it\u2019s the common gameplay or that unlike with Angry Birds Star Wars, here Rovio introduced both new gameplay and a sponsored theme at the same time, but as you can see from its ranks, Angry Birds Transformers just wasn\u2019t well received, opening in the top 10 but dropping below top 50 within the first few days.",
              "With all three partnerships we can see a similar trend: every time a new app was released, the original Angry Birds gained a rank boost.",
              "We believe developers and marketers can learn a great deal from Rovio\u2019s success.",

              "[1][2] By October 2010, 12 million copies of the game had been purchased from the iOS App Store,[6] which prompted the developer to design versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, most notably Android, Symbian, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry 10 devices.",
              "The series has since expanded to include titles for dedicated video game consoles and PCs.",
              "A sequel, Angry Birds 2, was released in July 2015 for iOS and Android.",
              "Around April 2019, the original game was removed from the App Store.",
              "[7] A paid recreation of the game's content from 2012 was released as Rovio Classics: Angry Birds on March 31, 2022,[8] but later on, Rovio mentioned that they were removing it from the Google Play Store on February 23, 2023, and retitling it as Red's First Flight on the IOS App Store.",
              "The gameplay revolves around players using a slingshot to launch the birds at green Pigs stationed in or around various structures, with the intent of destroying all the Pigs on the playing field.",
              "As players advance through the game, new types of birds become available (some with special abilities that can be activated by the player).",
              "Rovio Mobile has supported Angry Birds with numerous free updates that add additional game content, and the company has also released stand-alone holiday and promotional versions of the game.",
              "Angry Birds was eventually praised by critics for its success at leveraging a combination of addictive gameplay, comical style, and low price into a viable franchise with long-term potential for profit.",
              "The game's popularity has led to the release of Angry Birds games for personal computers and gaming consoles, created a market for merchandise featuring the Angry Birds characters, a 2016 feature-length animated film, a 2019 sequel to said film, and several seasons of television cartoons.",
              "The Angry Birds series had a combined tally of over five billion downloads across all platforms, as of April 2022, including special editions.",
              "[9] After its release, the original game was called \"one of the most mainstream games out in 2010\",[10] \"one of the great runaway hits of 2010\",[11] and \"the largest mobile app success the world has seen as of 2011\".",
              "[12] In Angry Birds, the player controls a flock of multi-colored birds that are attempting to save their eggs from green-colored pigs.",
              "[13] In each stage of the gameplay, the pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass,[14] and stone resembling children's toy building blocks.",
              "The objective of the game is to eliminate all the pigs on the level.",
              "Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and pop the pigs.",
              "[15] The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions).",
              "The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released.",
              "In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach pigs.",
              "Also hidden in the levels, players can unlock bonus levels by collecting golden eggs.",
              "There are several different types of birds used in the game, distinguished by their color and shape.",
              "In the earliest levels only the basic red cardinal whose name is Red is available.",
              "[13] As the player advances through the game additional types of birds become available.",
              "Some birds are effective against particular materials, and some have special abilities that may be activated by the player while the bird is airborne.",
              "[15] For example, Chuck, a canary speeds up;",
              "Bomb, a loon explodes, hence the name;",
              "a bluebird named Jay fragments from his siblings, Jake and Jim;",
              "a Leghorn hen called Matilda can drop an explosive egg-shaped projectile;",
              "a galah named Stella can trap objects in bubbles;",
              "Hal, an emerald toucanet boomerangs back;",
              "a giant cardinal named Terence, appears and functions similarly to Red, but deals more damage than his smaller counterpart;",
              "and a Jamaican oriole named Bubbles expands and inflates.",
              "[13] The pigs also vary, with hardiness relative to their size.",
              "Small pigs are weaker and are easily vanquished by direct hits or by debris from the damaged structures, while larger pigs are able to withstand more damage before succumbing to defeat.",
              "In addition, some pigs wear hats or armor, making them even more resistant to damage.",
              "Each level starts with the quantity, types, and firing order of birds predetermined.",
              "[13][15] If all of the pigs are eliminated after the last bird is launched, the level is cleared and the next level is unlocked.",
              "[13] If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not defeated, the level is failed and must be repeated.",
              "Points are scored for each pig defeated as well as for damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds.",
              "Upon completing each level, players can receive up to three stars depending on the score received.",
              "Players are encouraged to repeat any previously beaten levels in which the full three stars weren't awarded in order to fully master them and earn the full three star rating.",
              "In early 2009, Rovio was in a state of bankruptcy;",
              "the staff began viewing proposals for potential games.",
              "One such proposal came from senior game designer Jaakko Iisalo[16] in the form of a simulated screenshot featuring some angry-looking birds with no visible legs or wings.",
              "[17] While the picture gave no clue as to what type of game was being played, the staff liked the characters,[17] and the team elected to design a game around them.",
              "[18] In early 2009, physics games, such as Crush the Castle, were popular flash-based web games, so the Rovio team was inspired by these games.",
              "[19][20] During the development of Angry Birds, the staff realized the birds needed an enemy.",
              "At the time, the \"swine flu\" epidemic was in the news, so the staff made the birds' enemies pigs.",
              "[16] Angry Birds was the studio's 52nd produced game and on its initial release, the game did not sell many copies.",
              "After Angry Birds was a featured app on the UK App Store in February 2010 and quickly reached No.",
              "1 there, it reached the No.",
              "1 spot on the paid apps chart in the US App Store in the middle of 2010, staying in that milestone for 275 days.",
              "[21][22] The initial cost to develop Angry Birds was estimated to exceed \u20ac100,000, not including costs for the subsequent updates.",
              "[17] In terms of publishing for the iOS version, Rovio partnered with distributor Chillingo to publish the game to the App Store.",
              "[23] Chillingo claimed to have participated in final game polishing, such as adding visible trajectory lines, pinch to zoom, pigs' grunts, birds somersaulting onto the slingshot.",
              "[24] Since then Rovio has self-published almost all of the later ports of the game, with the exception of the PSP version, which was produced under license by Abstraction Games.",
              "When Rovio began writing new versions of the game for other devices, new issues came to light.",
              "As the team began working on a version for Android systems, they observed a large number of configurations of device types and versions of the Android software.",
              "[16] The number of combinations of software version, processor speed and even user interfaces was significantly larger than that for the iOS version.",
              "[25] Ultimately, the team settled on a minimum set of requirements,[16] even though that left nearly 30 types of Android phones unable to run the game, including some newly released phones.",
              "[25] It was released on October 15, 2010.",
              "One month after the initial release on Android, Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of the game for these other devices.",
              "[25] In early 2010, Rovio began developing a version of Angry Birds for Facebook.",
              "[26] The project became one of the company's largest, with development taking over a year.",
              "[26] The company understood the challenges of transplanting a game concept between social platforms and mobile/gaming systems. In a March 2011 interview, Rovio's Peter Vesterbacka said, \"You can\u2019t take an experience that works in one environment and one ecosystem and force-feed it onto another.",
              "It's like Zynga.",
              "They can\u2019t just take FarmVille and throw it on mobile and see what sticks.",
              "The titles that have been successful for them on mobile are the ones they\u2019ve built from the ground up for the platform.\"",
              "[26] The Facebook version incorporate social-gaming concepts and in-game purchases and entered beta-testing in April 2011;",
              "[26] the game became officially available on Facebook in February 2012 as Angry Birds Facebook (later Angry Birds Friends).",
              "[27] Improvements for the game include the ability to synchronize the player's progress across multiple devices;",
              "for example, a player who completes a level on an Android phone can log into their copy of the game on an Android tablet and see the same statistics and level of progress.",
              "[28] The initial iOS version of the game, which soft launched in Finland on December 1, 2009, and released internationally 10 days later, included a single episode entitled \"Poached Eggs\" which contained three themed chapters, each with 21 levels.",
              "From time to time, Rovio has released free upgrades that include additional content, such as new levels, new in-game objects and even new birds.",
              "As updates have been released, they have been incorporated into the game's full version offered for download from each platform's application store.",
              "[29] The first update released on February 11, 2010, added a new episode called \"Mighty Hoax\", containing two new chapters with 21 levels each.",
              "Updates released on April 6, 2010, added the \"Golden Eggs\" feature, which placed hidden golden eggs throughout the game that would unlock bonus content when found, and a new episode called \"Danger Above\", which initially contained a single chapter of 15 levels, released on April 23 under version 1.",
              "3.",
              "0.",

              "3.",

              "[30][33] A fifth episode, called \"Ham 'Em High\", launched on December 23, 2010, in celebration of the game's first year in the iOS App Store.",
              "[29][34] \"Ham 'Em High\" contained 15 American Old West-themed levels in a single chapter;",
              "[35] updates on February 4, 2011[36][37] and March 17, 2011[38][39] each added one new 15-level chapter.",
              "\"Ham 'Em High\" also introduced the Mighty Eagle, a new bird that may be used once per hour to clear any uncompleted levels.",
              "[35] The Mighty Eagle can also be used in previously completed levels, without the once-per-hour limit, to play a mini-game called \"Total Destruction\" in which the player attempts to destroy as much of the scenery as possible, both with the standard birds and the Mighty Eagle, achieving 100% destruction earns the player a Mighty Eagle feather for the level.",
              "[35] The Mighty Eagle is offered as a one-time, in-game purchase,[29] and was initially only available for iOS, as its App Store customers have iTunes accounts with pre-linked credit cards.",
              "[40] In late 2011, Rovio also added the Mighty Eagle to the Chrome App version of the game.",
              "Rovio has begun testing an Android update called the \"Bad Piggy Bank\" with the Elisa wireless service in Finland and T-Mobile, which allows users to charge in-app purchases, such as the Mighty Eagle, to their mobile phone bills.",

              "This version also added the powerups from the Facebook version and added an option to pay to remove ads, allowing Android players to enjoy the game ad-free as iOS players do.",
              "The sixth episode, \"Mine and Dine\", was released on June 16, 2011, with 15 new mining-themed levels and a new Golden Egg.",
              "[41] A July 25, 2011, update would release 15 further levels,[42] and an August 25, 2011, update concluded \"Mine and Dine\" with the final 15 levels.",
              "[43] The seventh update, \"Birdday Party\", was released on December 11, 2011, to commemorate the second anniversary of the first release of the iOS version into the iTunes App Store.",
              "[44][45] It included 15 new birthday cake-themed levels, as well as updated graphics and the addition of elements from the spin-off games, such as the scoring graphic seen in Angry Birds Rio and the introduction of \"Bubbles\", the Orange Bird that first appeared in Angry Birds Seasons.",
              "[46] The update was later released for Android and Microsoft Windows.",

              "[52] The second set of 15 levels in \"Birdday Party\" introduced \"Stella\", the Pink Bird to the game.",
              "15 final levels were later released for the \"Bad Piggies\" episode on March 7, 2013.",
              "[53] On the same day these final 15 levels were released, Angry Birds became \"Free App of the Week\" on the Apple App Store until March 14, 2013, and became an instant hit on the Top Free App charts on the App Store until March 18, 2013, when the app returned to the normal price of $0.",

              "On June 26, 2013, Rovio released a YouTube video, uncovering three new facts: the episode would be called Red's Mighty Feathers, the update would come in July, and the Angry Birds app icon would receive a new design.",
              "[55] On July 3, 2013, the update was released, with fifteen levels of all-new game play.",
              "Instead of knocking over the pigs' castles, the player's goal is to keep the pigs from stealing the egg and leaving the playing field with it.",
              "[56] The pigs arrive in waves of complicated vehicles, and the only available bird is Red, whose new ability is to target the nearest pig.",
              "There is no score, and the three stars are awarded by completing three objectives in one try.",
              "The first objective is to finish the level without getting the egg stolen.",
              "The second is to pop all the pigs in the level.",
              "The third is to use fewer than or equal to a certain number of birds to clear the level.",
              "Because some people were skeptical about the new gameplay, Rovio later announced that they would add levels to the episode based on the original level style.",
              "On September 16, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to the episode using the original style and these levels include manual targeting for Red Bird.",
              "[57] On November 26, 2013, Rovio added a 30-level episode called Short Fuse that transforms the Bomb's explosions into highly-destructive electrical pulses, adds a powerup that transforms any Bird into a Bomb Bird and 3 different potions that can change the pigs.",

              "[65] On November 10, 2016, 21 levels were released as singular episode called \"Bird Island\" that promoted the Angry Birds Movie, though the levels didn't unlock for players until November 17.",
              "[66][67] On December 10, 2016, in honor of Angry Birds' seventh birthday 15 more levels were released as an addition to Birdday Party (though the levels didn't unlock until December 17).",

The next subsequent update, which released the first 15 levels of the last chapter \"Jurassic Pork\" and served to conclude the unresolved plot in \"Piggy Farm\", arrived on August 23, 2017, followed by an update of 15 more \"Jurassic Pork\" levels on September 15, 2017.",
              "[70][71] The final levels of \"Jurassic Pork\" and the most recent levels of the game would release as a set of 16 levels on November 20, 2017.",
              "[72] In spite of the upcoming 8th anniversary of the game, no new 'Birdday Party' levels would be released and all subsequent updates until the game's 2019 removal would solely feature bug fixes.",
              "Since its initial release for the Nokia N900 multimedia Internet device, and Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch mobile digital devices, Rovio has released versions of Angry Birds for additional devices.",

              "[80] Rovio officials noted that GetJar had a more global reach than Android Market, and GetJar's availability on other smartphone platforms (including Symbian) would make cross-platform promotion of the game easier.",
              "[79] Unlike the previous versions, Angry Birds for Android is a free, ad-supported application, as paid applications aren't available on Android in some nations.",

              "Rovio would ask Microsoft to revise its site to remove references to the game,[79][82] a Windows Phone version was ultimately released in June 2011.",
              "[83] A port of Angry Birds was planned to be launched on the Nintendo DSi along the Wii as a DSiWare game on the former and as a WiiWare game on the latter, but was cancelled most likely due to the Nintendo 3DS's release in 2011 with its \"glasses free 3D\".",

              "During this time, Levoranta recalls that the company \"grew very, very fast\" -- evidently, too fast.",
              "In 2014, Rovio began a series of restructures that saw hundreds of employees laid off at a time.",
              "The leadership changed as CEO Mikael Hed stepped aside to become chairman of the movies and animation division, and his replacement Pekka Rantala stepped down just one year later, paving the way for Levoranta.",
