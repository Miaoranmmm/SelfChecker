    "response": "Sure, I can tell you about the history and significance of the song \"Amazing Grace\". It is one of the most recorded and recognized hymns throughout Christian churches around the world. It carries the message of hope and redemption through God's mercies[^1^].\n\nThe song was written by John Newton, an English slave trader-turned-minister, who wrote it from his personal experience with God. He had a spiritual conversion in 1748, when he was caught in a violent storm off the coast of Ireland and prayed for God to save him and his crew[^2^] [^3^]. He later renounced his involvement in the slave trade and became an Anglican priest and a hymn writer[^2^] [^3^]. He wrote \"Amazing Grace\" for his sermon on New Year's Day 1773, and it was published in 1779 in a collection of hymns he co-authored with William Cowper[^2^] [^3^] [^4^].\n\nThe song became popular in the United States, especially in the South, during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century. It was used by Baptist and Methodist preachers as part of their evangelizing[^3^]. It was also associated with the abolitionist movement and the civil rights movement in the 20th century. It was sung by Mahalia Jackson at many Martin Luther King Jr. rallies[^3^]. It has been recorded by many artists, such as Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley, Judy Collins, and Willie Nelson[^3^].\n\nThe song is considered a powerful expression of faith and gratitude for God's grace. It has been used in many occasions, such as funerals, weddings, inaugurations, and memorial services. It has also been adapted into different languages and musical styles[^3^].",

              "Having lived through a rather unfortunate and troubled childhood (his mother passed away when he was just six years old), Newton spent years fighting against authority, going so far as trying to desert the Royal Navy in his twenties.",
              "Later, abandoned by his crew in West Africa, he was forced to be a servant to a slave trader but was eventually rescued.",
              "On the return voyage to England, a violent storm hit and almost sank the ship, prompting Newton to begin his spiritual conversion as he cried out to God to save them from the storm.",

              "Bringing slaves from Africa to England over multiple trips, he admitted to sometimes treating the slaves abhorrently.",
              "In 1754, after becoming violently ill on a sea voyage, Newton abandoned his life as a slave trader, the slave trade, and seafaring, altogether, wholeheartedly devoting his life to God's service.",
              "He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1764 and became quite popular as a preacher and hymn writer, penning some 280 hymns, among them the great \"Amazing Grace,\" which first appeared in the Olney Hymns, printed by Newton and poet/fellow writer William Cowper.",

              "And many of us would then be without these lovely words that so aptly describe our own relationship with Christ and our reliance on God's grace in our lives: 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, And grace my fears relieved;",
              "How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed.",
              "Those who have read Harriet Beecher Stowe's classic African American novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin, may remember that Tom sings three verses of \"Amazing Grace,\" including one verse not written by Newton, which is now traditionally sung as the final verse: When we've been there ten thousand years, Bright shining as the sun, We've no less days to sing God's praise, Than when we first begun.",
              "A movie named for the song was made in 2006 that tells the story of William Wilberforce's fight for abolition, with Albert Finney playing the repentant former slave trader John Newton, alongside an ensemble cast that includes Ioan Gruffudd, Michael Gambon and Benedict Cumberbatch.",
              "A Broadway musical of the same name launched in late 2015 that focused on Newton's journey and its influence on the song.",
              "The song was used at marches during the civil rights movement and gained popularity among those protesting the Vietnam War.",

              "[94] Due to its immense popularity and iconic nature, the meaning behind the words of \"Amazing Grace\" has become as individual as the singer or listener.",
              "[95] Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of \"Amazing Grace\" is due to the absence of any mention of God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins \"When we've been there ten thousand years\"), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God.",
              "\"Grace\", however, had a clearer meaning to John Newton, as he used the word to represent God or the power of God.",
              "[96] The transformative power of the song was investigated by journalist Bill Moyers in a documentary released in 1990.",
              "Moyers was inspired to focus on the song's power after watching a performance at Lincoln Center, where the audience consisted of Christians and non-Christians, and he noticed that it had an equal impact on everybody in attendance, unifying them.",

              "Collins, Cash, and Norman were unable to discern if the power of the song came from the music or the lyrics.",

              "A prisoner interviewed by Moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse: \"'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved\" by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realised he may never get his life in order, compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison.",

              "It is an immensely popular hymn, particularly in the United States, where it is used for both religious and secular purposes.",
              "Newton wrote the words from personal experience;",
              "he grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by others' reactions to what they took as his recalcitrant insubordination.",
              "He was pressed into service with the Royal Navy, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade.",
              "In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to God for mercy.",
              "While this moment marked his spiritual conversion, he continued slave trading until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether.",
              "Newton began studying Christian theology and later became an abolitionist.",
              "Ordained in the Church of England in 1764, Newton became the curate of Olney, Buckinghamshire, where he began to write hymns with poet William Cowper.",
              "\"Amazing Grace\" was written to illustrate a sermon on New Year's Day of 1773.",
              "It is unknown if there was any music accompanying the verses;",
              "it may have been chanted by the congregation.",
              "It debuted in print in 1779 in Newton's and Cowper's Olney Hymns, but settled into relative obscurity in England.",
              "In the United States, \"Amazing Grace\" became a popular song used by Baptist and Methodist preachers as part of their evangelizing, especially in the American South, during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century.",
              "It has been associated with more than 20 melodies.",
              "In 1835, American composer William Walker set it to the tune known as \"New Britain\" in a shape note format;",
              "this is the version most frequently sung today.",
              "With the message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of sins committed and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of God, \"Amazing Grace\" is one of the most recognisable songs in the English-speaking world.",
              "American historian Gilbert Chase writes that it is \"without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns\"[1] and Jonathan Aitken, a Newton biographer, estimates that the song is performed about 10 million times annually.",
              "[2] It has had particular influence in folk music, and has become an emblematic black spiritual.",
              "Its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music.",
              "\"Amazing Grace\" became newly popular during the 1960s revival of American folk music, and it has been recorded thousands of times during and since the 20th century.",
              "How industrious is Satan served.",
              "I was formerly one of his active undertemptors and had my influence been equal to my wishes I would have carried all the human race with me.",
              "A common drunkard or profligate is a petty sinner to what I was.",
              "John Newton, 1778[3] According to the Dictionary of American Hymnology, \"Amazing Grace\" is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.",
              "[4] In 1725, Newton was born in Wapping, a district in London near the Thames.",
              "His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent, unaffiliated with the Anglican Church.",
              "She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old.",
              "[5] For the next few years, while his father was at sea Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother.",
              "He was also sent to boarding school, where he was mistreated.",
              "[6] At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice;",
              "his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.",
              "As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits.",
              "As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed with him Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury.",
              "In a series of letters Newton later wrote, \"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\"",
              "[7] His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave.",
              "He deserted the navy to visit Mary \"Polly\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.",
              "[8] After enduring humiliation for deserting,[a] he was traded as crew to a slave ship.",
              "He began a career in slave trading.",
              "[b] Newton often openly mocked the captain by creating obscene poems and songs about him, which became so popular that the crew began to join in.",
              "[9] His disagreements with several colleagues resulted in his being starved almost to death, imprisoned while at sea, and chained like the slaves they carried.",
              "He was himself enslaved by the Sherbro and forced to work on a plantation in Sierra Leone near the Sherbro River.",
              "After several months he came to think of Sierra Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and crew from another ship happened to find him.",
              "[c] Newton claimed the only reason he left Sierra Leone was because of Polly.",
              "[10] While aboard the ship Greyhound, Newton gained notoriety as being one of the most profane men the captain had ever met.",
              "In a culture where sailors habitually swore, Newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard, but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery.",
              "[11] In March 1748, while the Greyhound was in the North Atlantic, a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where Newton had been moments before.",
              "[d] After hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized, Newton and another mate tied themselves to the ship's pump to keep from being washed overboard, working for several hours.",
              "[12] After proposing the measure to the captain, Newton had turned and said, \"If this will not do, then Lord have mercy upon us!\"",
              "[13][14] Newton rested briefly before returning to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours.",
              "During his time at the wheel, he pondered his divine challenge.",
              "[12] About two weeks later, the battered ship and starving crew landed in Lough Swilly, Ireland.",
              "For several weeks before the storm, Newton had been reading The Christian's Pattern, a summary of the 15th-century The Imitation of Christ by Thomas a\u0300 Kempis.",
              "The memory of his own \"Lord have mercy upon us!\"",
              "uttered during a moment of desperation in the storm did not leave him;",
              "he began to ask if he was worthy of God's mercy or in any way redeemable.",
              "Not only had he neglected his faith but directly opposed it, mocking others who showed theirs, deriding and denouncing God as a myth.",
              "He came to believe that God had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him.",
              "[15] Newton's conversion was not immediate, but he contacted Polly's family and announced his intention to marry her.",
              "Her parents were hesitant as he was known to be unreliable and impetuous.",
              "They knew he was profane too but allowed him to write to Polly, and he set to begin to submit to authority for her sake.",
              "[16] He sought a place on a slave ship bound for Africa, and Newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before;",
              "the only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity.",
              "After a severe illness his resolve was renewed, yet he retained the same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries.",
              "[e] Newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed the coasts of Africa, now as a captain, and procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports, transporting them to North America.",
              "In between voyages, he married Polly in 1750, and he found it more difficult to leave her at the beginning of each trip.",
              "After three shipping voyages in the slave trade, Newton was promised a position as ship's captain with cargo unrelated to slavery.",
              "But at the age of thirty, he collapsed and never sailed again.",
              "[17][f] Working as a customs agent in Liverpool starting in 1756, Newton began to teach himself Latin, Greek, and theology.",
              "He and Polly immersed themselves in the church community, and Newton's passion was so impressive that his friends suggested he become a priest in the Church of England.",
              "He was turned down by John Gilbert, Archbishop of York, in 1758, ostensibly for having no university degree,[18] although the more likely reasons were his leanings toward evangelism and tendency to socialise with Methodists.",
              "[19] Newton continued his devotions, and after being encouraged by a friend, he wrote about his experiences in the slave trade and his conversion.",
              "William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, impressed with his story, sponsored Newton for ordination by John Green, Bishop of Lincoln, and offered him the curacy of Olney, Buckinghamshire, in 1764.",
              "[20] Amazing grace!",
              "(how sweet the sound) That sav'd a wretch like me!",
              "I once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now I see.",

              "John Newton, Olney Hymns, 1779 Olney was a village of about 2,500 residents whose main industry was making lace by hand.",
              "The people were mostly illiterate and many of them were poor.",
              "[2] Newton's preaching was unique in that he shared many of his own experiences from the pulpit;",
              "many clergy preached from a distance, not admitting any intimacy with temptation or sin.",
              "He was involved in his parishioners' lives and was much loved, although his writing and delivery were sometimes unpolished.",
              "[21] But his devotion and conviction were apparent and forceful, and he often said his mission was to \"break a hard heart and to heal a broken heart\".",
              "[22] He struck a friendship with William Cowper, a gifted writer who had failed at a career in law and suffered bouts of insanity, attempting suicide several times.",
              "Cowper enjoyed Olney \u2013 and Newton's company;",
              "he was also new to Olney and had gone through a spiritual conversion similar to Newton's.",
              "Together, their effect on the local congregation was impressive.",
              "In 1768, they found it necessary to start a weekly prayer meeting to meet the needs of an increasing number of parishioners.",
              "They also began writing lessons for children.",
              "[23] Partly from Cowper's literary influence, and partly because learned vicars were expected to write verses, Newton began to try his hand at hymns, which had become popular through the language, made plain for common people to understand.",
              "Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including Isaac Watts \u2013 whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing[24] \u2013 and Charles Wesley, with whom Newton was familiar.",
              "Wesley's brother John, the eventual founder of the Methodist Church, had encouraged Newton to go into the clergy.",
              "[g] Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his work after the Psalms. The most prevalent hymns by Watts and others were written in the common meter in 8.",

              "8.",
              "6: the first line is eight syllables and the second is six.",
              "[25] Newton and Cowper attempted to present a poem or hymn for each prayer meeting.",
              "The lyrics to \"Amazing Grace\" were written in late 1772 and probably used in a prayer meeting for the first time on 1 January 1773.",
              "[25] A collection of the poems Newton and Cowper had written for use in services at Olney was bound and published anonymously in 1779 under the title Olney Hymns.",
              "Newton contributed 280 of the 348 texts in Olney Hymns;",
              "\"1 Chronicles 17:16\u201317, Faith's Review and Expectation\" was the title of the poem with the first line \"Amazing grace!",

              "Scholars appreciated Cowper's poetry somewhat more than Newton's plaintive and plain language, expressing his forceful personality.",
              "The most prevalent themes in the verses written by Newton in Olney Hymns are faith in salvation, wonder at God's grace, his love for Jesus, and his cheerful exclamations of the joy he found in his faith.",
              "[26] As a reflection of Newton's connection to his parishioners, he wrote many of the hymns in first person, admitting his own experience with sin.",
              "Bruce Hindmarsh in Sing Them Over Again To Me: Hymns and Hymnbooks in America considers \"Amazing Grace\" an excellent example of Newton's testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective.",
              "[27] Several of Newton's hymns were recognised as great work (\"Amazing Grace\" was not among them), while others seem to have been included to fill in when Cowper was unable to write.",
              "[28] Jonathan Aitken calls Newton, specifically referring to \"Amazing Grace\", an \"unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation\", noting that only twenty-one of the nearly 150 words used in all six verses have more than one syllable.",
              "[29] William Phipps in the Anglican Theological Review and author James Basker have interpreted the first stanza of \"Amazing Grace\" as evidence of Newton's realisation that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness, perhaps representing a wider common understanding of Newton's motivations.",
              "[30][31] Newton joined forces with William Wilberforce, the British Member of Parliament who led the Parliamentarian campaign to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire, culminating in the Slave Trade Act 1807.",
              "But Newton did not become an ardent and outspoken abolitionist until after he left Olney in the 1780s;",
              "he is not known to have connected writing the hymn known as \"Amazing Grace\" to anti-slavery sentiments.",
              "[32] The lyrics in Olney Hymns were arranged by their association to the Biblical verses that would be used by Newton and Cowper in their prayer meetings, and did not address any political objective.",
              "For Newton, the beginning of the year was a time to reflect on one's spiritual progress.",
              "At the same time he completed a diary \u2013 which has since been lost \u2013 that he had begun 17 years before, two years after he quit sailing.",
              "The last entry of 1772 was a recounting of how much he had changed since then.",
              "[33] And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?",
              "And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God;",
              "for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.",
              "1 Chronicles 17:16\u201317, King James Version The title ascribed to the hymn, \"1 Chronicles 17:16\u201317\", refers to David's reaction to the prophet Nathan telling him that God intends to maintain his family line forever.",
              "Some Christians interpret this as a prediction that Jesus Christ, as a descendant of David, was promised by God as the salvation for all people.",
              "[34] Newton's sermon on that January day in 1773 focused on the necessity to express one's gratitude for God's guidance, that God is involved in the daily lives of Christians though they may not be aware of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await.",
              "[35] Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly,[36] and was humbled by it.",
              "According to Newton, unconverted sinners were \"blinded by the god of this world\" until \"mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired .",

              "[33] The New Testament served as the basis for many of the lyrics of \"Amazing Grace\".",
              "The first verse, for example, can be traced to the story of the Prodigal Son.",
              "In the Gospel of Luke the father says, \"For this son of mine was dead and is alive again;",
              "he was lost, and is found\".",
              "The story of Jesus healing a blind man who tells the Pharisees that he can now see is told in the Gospel of John.",
              "Newton used the words \"I was blind but now I see\" and declared \"Oh to grace how great a debtor!\"",
              "in his letters and diary entries as early as 1752.",
              "[37] The effect of the lyrical arrangement, according to Bruce Hindmarsh, allows an instant release of energy in the exclamation \"Amazing grace!\"",
              ", to be followed by a qualifying reply in \"how sweet the sound\".",
              "In An Annotated Anthology of Hymns, Newton's use of an exclamation at the beginning of his verse is called \"crude but effective\" in an overall composition that \"suggest(s) a forceful, if simple, statement of faith\".",
              "[36] Grace is recalled three times in the following verse, culminating in Newton's most personal story of his conversion, underscoring the use of his personal testimony with his parishioners.",
              "[27] The sermon preached by Newton was his last of those that William Cowper heard in Olney, since Cowper's mental instability returned shortly thereafter.",
              "One author suggests Newton may have had his friend in mind, employing the themes of assurance and deliverance from despair for Cowper's benefit.",
              "[38] More than 60 of Newton and Cowper's hymns were republished in other British hymnals and magazines, but \"Amazing Grace\" was not, appearing only once in a 1780 hymnal sponsored by the Countess of Huntingdon.",
              "Scholar John Julian commented in his 1892 A Dictionary of Hymnology that outside of the United States, the song was unknown and it was \"far from being a good example of Newton's finest work\".",

              "[34] by 1830 Presbyterians and Methodists also included Newton's verses in their hymnals.",
              "[40][41] Although it had its roots in England, \"Amazing Grace\" became an integral part of the Christian tapestry in the United States.",
              "The greatest influences in the 19th century that propelled \"Amazing Grace\" to spread across the US and become a staple of religious services in many denominations and regions were the Second Great Awakening and the development of shape note singing communities.",
              "A tremendous religious movement swept the US in the early 19th century, marked by the growth and popularity of churches and religious revivals that got their start on the frontier in Kentucky and Tennessee.",
              "Unprecedented gatherings of thousands of people attended camp meetings where they came to experience salvation;",
              "preaching was fiery and focused on saving the sinner from temptation and backsliding.",

              "Witnessing and testifying became an integral component to these meetings, where a congregation member or stranger would rise and recount his turn from a sinful life to one of piety and peace.",
              "[40] \"Amazing Grace\" was one of many hymns that punctuated fervent sermons, although the contemporary style used a refrain, borrowed from other hymns, that employed simplicity and repetition such as: Amazing grace!",

              "Preachers used shape note hymns to teach people on the frontier and to raise the emotion of camp meetings.",
              "Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual.",
              "Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.",
              "[43] When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton.",
              "Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry.",
              "The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \"Hephzibah\" by English composer John Jenkins Husband.",

              "[95] Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of \"Amazing Grace\" is due to the absence of any mention of God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins \"When we've been there ten thousand years\"), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God.",

              "Thus are born tales of wild storms and pacts with God, as are stories about religious awakenings that prompted a slaver to set his cargo free.",
              "But the truth is far less poetic: 'Amazing Grace' is a song about salvation, but it wasn't composed until long after its writer had left his seafaring days behind him and become a minister.",
              "John Newton (1725-1807) first worked as a slave buyer in Africa and later moved on to the position of captain on slave ships.",
              "He continued to make his living in the slave trade after becoming a Christian at the age of 23 in 1748.",
              "A violent storm at sea brought about his commitment to Christianity, but it was escaping with his own life that inspired him to get religion, not guilt over enslaving others.",
              "(Though this event is often pointed to as \"the\" conversion, it really was only the first of many such pacts with the Almighty struck by Newton, each one brought about by his close shaves with death.)",

              "Though he might have become a Christian, he did not yet allow it to interfere with his making a living.",
              "In 1754 or 1755, he became a Tides Surveyor in Liverpool (a form of Customs Officer charged with searching for contraband and paid with half the swag taken from others).",
              "It was at this point Newton first began to express an interest in the ministry, but at the time was unable to decide between the Methodist and Anglican faiths.",
              "He was ultimately ordained as a priest in the Church of England in 1764.",
              "Newton most likely composed 'Amazing Grace' in 1772, although there is no clear agreement on the date.",
              "According to one biographer, the hymn was penned along with a great many others during an informal hymn-writing competition he was having with William Cowper, another noted hymn writer.",
              "If so, that casts doubt upon this particular composition's being solely a cathartic outpouring of wonder over the Lord's mercy \u2014 there are, after all, only so many themes that can be expounded upon in a hymn, and personal salvation is one of them.",
              "Newton began to express regrets about his part in the slave trade only in 1780, thirty-two years after his conversion, and eight years after he wrote 'Amazing Grace.'",
              "In 1785 he began to fight against slavery by speaking out against it, and he continued to do so until his death in 1807.",
              "Thus, the bare bones of the story are true: a former slave trader did compose one of the most moving hymns of our times.",
              "But the meat of the claim \u2014 that a horrific event spurred a sinner to immediately repent his evil ways, penning 'Amazing Grace' as an expression of his repentance \u2014 fails on the facts.",
              "Newton's storm-driven adoption of Christianity didn't change him all that much;",
              "he continued to make his living from the slave trade for many years afterward and only left the trade when his wife insisted upon their living a settled life in England.",
              "(Indeed, less than a year after his storm-driven conversion, Newton was back in Africa, brokering the purchase of newly-captured blacks and taking yet another \"African wife\" while there.",
              "He was hardly the poster boy for the truly penitent, at least at that point in his life.)",
              "Newton did eventually grow into his conversion so that by the end of his days he actually was the godly man one would expect to have penned 'Amazing Grace.'",
              "But it was a slow process affected over the passage of decades, not something that happened with a clap of thunder and a flash of lightning.",
              "In Newton's case, the \"amazing grace\" he wrote of might well have referred to God's unending patience with him.",

              "This term, however, was not used by contemporaries in the first half of the nineteenth century, as it originates from Charles Grandison Finney's Autobiography of Charles G Finney (1876), in which he writes, \"I found that region of country what, in the western phrase, would be called, a 'burnt district.'",
              "There had been, a few years previously, a wild excitement passing through that region, which they called a revival of religion, but which turned out to be spurious.\"",

              "Most of the Scotch-Irish immigrants before the American Revolutionary War settled in the backcountry of Pennsylvania and down the spine of the Appalachian Mountains in present-day Maryland and Virginia, where Presbyterian emigrants and Baptists held large outdoor gatherings in the years prior to the war.",
              "The Presbyterians and Methodists sponsored similar gatherings on a regular basis after the Revolution.",
              "[15] The denominations that encouraged the revivals were based on an interpretation of man's spiritual equality before God, which led them to recruit members and preachers from a wide range of classes and all races.",

              "These often provided the first encounter for some settlers with organized religion, and they were important as social venues.",

              "The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing, shouting, and singing associated with these events.",
              "The revivals also followed an arc of great emotional power, with an emphasis on the individual's sins and need to turn to Christ, and a sense of restoring personal salvation.",
              "This differed from the Calvinists' belief in predestination as outlined in the Westminster Confession of Faith, which emphasized the inability of men to save themselves and decreed that the only way to be saved was by God's electing grace.",
              "[17] Upon their return home, most converts joined or created small local churches, which grew rapidly.",
              "[18] The Revival of 1800 in Logan County, Kentucky, began as a traditional Presbyterian sacramental occasion.",

              "Due to the efforts of such leaders as Stone and Alexander Campbell (1788\u20131866), the camp meeting revival spread religious enthusiasm and became a major mode of church expansion, especially for the Methodists and Baptists.",
              "[19][20] Presbyterians and Methodists initially worked together to host the early camp meetings, but the Presbyterians eventually became less involved because of the noise and often raucous activities that occurred during the protracted sessions.",
