    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. The origin of the hot dog in New York is not very clear, but there are some popular theories and stories. According to one source[^1^], it is believed that the first hot dogs, called \u201cdachshund sausages\u201d, were sold by a German immigrant out of a food cart in New York in the 1860s \u2013 perhaps explaining how they acquired their canine name. Another source[^4^] claims that a German immigrant named Charles Feltman opened the first hot dog stand on Coney Island, a beach and amusement park in Brooklyn, New York, in 1871. He sold 3,684 sausages that year and became very successful. A former employee of Feltman, Nathan Handwerker, started his own hot dog stand in 1916 and sold them for a nickel instead of a dime. His business, Nathan\u2019s Famous Hot Dogs, became a landmark of Coney Island and an American icon[^2^] [^5^]. The hot dog has since become a staple of American cuisine and culture, especially at ballparks and cookouts.",

              "What gives Michael Quinn, a Coney Island tour guide and owner of the trademark, the right to revive the name?",
              "And how can his hot dog\u2019s resemblance to the original Feltman\u2019s be vouched for?",
              "Quinn claims to have found the original recipe, which Gothamist says contains, \u201csea salt, a garlicky seasoning blend, and a marvelously snappy skin,\u201d but remains \u201cuncured, nitrate-free, with no artificial ingredients.",
              "\u201d The uncured and sea-salt parts sound a little modern-virtuous, but who cares what\u2019s in it if it tastes better?",

              "Marks, and wasn\u2019t impressed, partly because it was delivered still cold in the middle.",
              "But the only fair comparison to be made between Nathan\u2019s and Feltman\u2019s is on Coney Island terroir.",
              "Thus I visited over the Memorial Day weekend, as the boardwalk swelled with visitors \u2014 though few were putting their toes in the water.",
              "Nathan\u2019s has recently undergone a renovation that has opened up the front of the building, so now there are 20 or so fidgety lines for hot dogs.",

              "They\u2019d been griddle-cooked so they were char-dappled, but still glowed deep red, and sported a pinkish interior with a semi-coarse texture that popped when you bit into it, and oozed afterwards.",
              "The taste was notably salty, but not smoky.",
              "The mustard was thick and grainy.",

              "The flavor of Feltman\u2019s is subtler and not so forceful, like a wiener you might buy at some grass-fed boutique butcher.",
              "At $4.",
              "25 with no tax charged, it\u2019s less pricey than Nathan\u2019s (which charges tax in addition to the listed price), though not enough for the savings to sway your choice.",
              "Said to be made with apple cider vinegar, the mustard is too runny and smooth, though the chopped onions that come along with the kraut are a boon.",
              "Overall, Nathan\u2019s beats Feltman\u2019s, gainsaying all the critics and commentators (Steve Cuozzo among them) who have come down on the side of Feltman\u2019s.",

              "The $4 hot dog there is superb, snappy and deep pink, arcing a little in the bun.",

          "Its origins can be traced back as early as 700 BCE, with its appearance in Homer\u2019s Odyssey,but some historians believe the first sausage was not created until the 1st century CE.",

          "Around 1870, a German immigrant by the name of Charles Feltman opened the first hot dog stand on Coney Island.",
          "In 1871, Charles Feltman purportedly opened the first Coney Island hot dog stand and sold over 3,000 dachshund sausages in a milk roll during his first year in operation."

          "Feltman died in 1910 (he is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York) after which his family ran the business.",
