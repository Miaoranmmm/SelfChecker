    "response": "That's a great question. The process and criteria for selecting the official Olympic mascots vary depending on the host country and the edition of the Games. However, some common elements are:\n\n- The mascots are usually designed by professional or amateur artists who submit their proposals to a national or international contest.\n- The mascots are then evaluated by a selection committee composed of experts, representatives of the host country's culture and sports, and members of the Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (OCOG).\n- The mascots are chosen based on their originality, creativity, appeal, relevance to the host country's culture and values, and alignment with the Olympic spirit and values.\n- The mascots are also expected to reflect the theme and vision of the Games, as well as to promote the Olympic and Paralympic movements.\n- The mascots are then approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and officially unveiled to the public.\n\nFor example, for the Tokyo 2020 Games, the mascot selection process involved:\n\n- A national contest open to anyone aged 18 or over resident in Japan, which received 2,042 designs[^1^].\n- A selection process in several stages that reduced the number of proposals to three finalists[^1^].\n- A voting period from 11 December 2017 to 22 February 2018, in which primary schools in Japan participated and each class had one vote[^1^] [^2^].\n- The announcement of the winning project by Ryo Taniguchi on 28 February 2018[^1^] [^2^].\n- The naming of the Olympic mascot Miraitowa and the Paralympic mascot Someity on 22 July 2018[^1^].\n\nThe Tokyo 2020 mascots are meant to embody both the old and the new, echoing the concept of \"innovation from harmony\". They have a traditional and futuristic style, with a chequered blue motif inspired by the Tokyo 2020 Games emblem. Their names are derived from the Japanese words \"mirai\" (future) and \"towa\" (eternity) for Miraitowa, and \"somei-yoshino\" (a type of cherry blossom) and \"y\u016bki\" (courage) for Someity[^1^].\n\nThe Olympic mascots are not only symbols of the Games, but also ambassadors of the host country's culture and values. They help to create a festive atmosphere, engage with fans and spectators, inspire young people, and spread the messages of peace, friendship, diversity, and excellence.\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f",

              "[12] Miraitowa, the Olympic mascot, is a figure with blue-checkered patterns inspired by the Games' official logo, which uses a similar checkered pattern called ichimatsu moyo that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867.",

              "The character can fly using its checkered cape and send telepathic messages using its cherry blossom-shaped antennae.",

              "[12] Although the two mascots have conflicting personalities, they nonetheless have a strong friendship and respect for each other.",
              "[8] According to their fictional backgrounds, Miraitowa and Someity \"live in the digital world\", and through the Internet, they can transport themselves between the digital world and the real world.",
              "[16] According to Sadashige Aoki, an advertising theory professor at Hosei University, the mascots follow a Japanese tradition of \"creating personalized characters out of nature \u2014 mountains, rivers, animals and plants\", as well as a \"tradition of animism, a belief that every natural thing has a soul\".",
              "[17] The mascots were designed by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, who lives in the Fukuoka Prefecture in southern Japan.",
              "Taniguchi was persuaded by his father, who is also an illustrator, to study art at Cabrillo College in California.",

              "[13][18] Taniguchi discovered the Tokyo 2020 mascot competition on Facebook in February 2017 and came up with the idea of creating a character whose head resembled a samurai war helmet with the ichimatsu moyo pattern of the official Tokyo 2020 logo.",
              "After making a rough sketch, Taniguchi reworked the design after the competition's official application requirements were announced in May 2017.",
              "In designing the mascots, Taniguchi focused on the mascots' eyes to make his proposal stand out.",
              "[13] Taniguchi was uninvolved in the naming of the mascots, though he did attend a screening at which various naming proposals were introduced.",
              "[13] As part of the agreement to use the mascots, Taniguchi transferred intellectual property rights to the mascots to the Olympic and Paralympic committees, and as a result, he will not receive any royalty payments from mascot-related licensing.",
              "[19] The mascots are expected to generate revenue to help finance the Tokyo Games.",
              "[17] An Olympic official expected the mascots to generate $130 million (\u00a514.",
              "4 billion) in revenue from licensing and merchandising.",
              "[13] The organizers of Tokyo 2020 had been criticized for its budget management.",
              "[18][20] According to Reuters, a 2016 study found that overall expenses for the Olympics could be \"four times the initial estimate made in the bid process\".",
              "[20] Tokyo 2020 must transfer intellectual property rights to the mascots to the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee after the Games are concluded, which would prevent Tokyo from licensing and developing the mascots after the Games are over.",
              "[17] From late July to early September 2018, a \"Mascot House\" was located on the first floor of the Tokyo Midtown Hibiya building, where visitors could take photos with the mascots and purchase licensed merchandise featuring the mascots.",
              "[21] On 11 July 2019, the Tokyo 2020 organizers unveiled new merchandise, some of it featuring the mascots.",
              "As of July 2019,[update] merchandise can be purchased either online or through authorized vendors throughout Japan.",
              "[22] Plush dolls of Miraitowa and Someity were attached to the bouquets given to Olympic and Paralympic medalists at Tokyo 2020, with their \"armor\" in the color of the athlete's medal, as part of their design by the Nippon Flower Council.",
              "[23][24] On 22 July 2019, the organizers of the 2020 Summer Olympics announced that robotic automatons of Miraitowa and Someity, among other robots, were expected to be included during the Games.",
              "According to the Los Angeles Times, the robots are \"programmed to show facial expressions as they wave at and shake hands with athletes and fans\".",
              "[25] The Tokyo 2020 organizing committee plans to use the mascots primarily to promote the Games and greet visitors and athletes, attempting to increase engagement with children.",
              "[26] The robots were also featured as part of a \"1 Year to Go\" press event on 22 July 2019 at an Olympic venue in Tokyo.",
              "[27] The robots were included as part of another press event on 18 November 2019 at a Japanese elementary school.",
              "The robots' eyes can change to display hearts, along with other emotions, and their multiple joints and arms can be remotely controlled.",
              "Cameras allow the robots to recognize and respond to facial expressions.",
              "The robots were developed in collaboration with Toyota.",
              "[28] On 22 July 2019, the official Japanese Twitter account of Tokyo 2020 posted an animated short depicting Miraitowa participating in all the sports to be contested at the Games.",
              "[29][30][31] On 25 August 2019, the same Twitter account posted a similar animated video featuring Someity participating in the Paralympic Games.",
              "[32] The public reaction to the mascot selection was \"generally positive\", according to an article published on Forbes' website in March 2018 by contributor Jake Adelstein.",
              "Adelstein described the mascots as \"cute\", though he commented that \"there was some criticism of the futuristic blue and pink characters falling clearly into traditional gender roles\".",
              "Adelstein speculated that the mascots would support the Olympics in Tokyo financially.",
              "[18] Multiple observers compared the design of the mascots to that of the Poke\u0301mon and Digimon franchises.",
              "[18][33][34] An article by Agence France-Presse described the social media reaction to the mascot selection on as \"mixed\".",
              "Some users commented that the mascots were \"very Japanese and very cute\", while others commented that the mascots should have been \"more round\" or \"more huggable\".",
              "Other commentators said that the selected design \"appealed more to children whereas adults preferred the softer and more traditional options\".",
              "[35] Dan McQuade wrote in an article in sports news website Deadspin that it will be difficult for Miraitowa and Someity to match the popularity of Soohorang and Bandabi, the mascots of the 2018 Winter Olympics, citing statements from the BBC, which wrote that the 2020 mascots \"have a tough act to follow\", and The Japan Times, which wrote in a headline that the success of Soohorang and Bandabi \"leaves Japan in a bind\".",
              "[34][36][37] James Dator, in a blog entry published on the sports news website SB Nation, wrote that there is \"nothing functionally wrong\" with the mascot design, but felt that Sanae Akimoto's pair C was a superior candidate and should have been chosen instead.",
              "Dator also argued that children should not have been the ones to make the final decision.",
              "[38] On the other hand, Naoki Ogi, a Japanese pedagogy expert, emphasized the importance of the role of children in selecting the mascots, as opposed to adults.",
              "[18] Japanese author Rurika Suzuki said that the mascots have a \"a very Japanese anime-like quality\", describing them as \"brilliant and sporty and perfect for the Olympics\".",
              "[18] In an article published in The New York Times on 27 July 2021, Mike Ives and Hikari Hida commented that, despite the typical importance of mascots in Japanese advertising, the mascots have had a \"subdued\" presence at the Tokyo Olympics, commenting that \"the Japanese public is not swooning over them either, according to fans and experts who study the country\u2019s mascot industry\".",
              "[39] Ives and Hida described a common complaint being that the names of the mascots, Miraitowa and Someity, are difficult to remember.",
              "[39] The article quoted a mother named Yuki Fuka, who commented, \"Within the whirlwind of all the Olympic controversy, I think the mascots were forgotten somewhere along the way [.",

              "[16] According to Sadashige Aoki, an advertising theory professor at Hosei University, the mascots follow a Japanese tradition of \"creating personalized characters out of nature \u2014 mountains, rivers, animals and plants\", as well as a \"tradition of animism, a belief that every natural thing has a soul\".",

              "[13] As part of the agreement to use the mascots, Taniguchi transferred intellectual property rights to the mascots to the Olympic and Paralympic committees, and as a result, he will not receive any royalty payments from mascot-related licensing.",
              "[19] The mascots are expected to generate revenue to help finance the Tokyo Games.",
              "[17] An Olympic official expected the mascots to generate $130 million (\u00a514.",

              "[20] Tokyo 2020 must transfer intellectual property rights to the mascots to the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee after the Games are concluded, which would prevent Tokyo from licensing and developing the mascots after the Games are over.",
              "[17] From late July to early September 2018, a \"Mascot House\" was located on the first floor of the Tokyo Midtown Hibiya building, where visitors could take photos with the mascots and purchase licensed merchandise featuring the mascots.",
              "[21] On 11 July 2019, the Tokyo 2020 organizers unveiled new merchandise, some of it featuring the mascots.",

              "[23][24] On 22 July 2019, the organizers of the 2020 Summer Olympics announced that robotic automatons of Miraitowa and Someity, among other robots, were expected to be included during the Games.",
              "According to the Los Angeles Times, the robots are \"programmed to show facial expressions as they wave at and shake hands with athletes and fans\".",
              "[25] The Tokyo 2020 organizing committee plans to use the mascots primarily to promote the Games and greet visitors and athletes, attempting to increase engagement with children.",
              "[26] The robots were also featured as part of a \"1 Year to Go\" press event on 22 July 2019 at an Olympic venue in Tokyo.",
              "[27] The robots were included as part of another press event on 18 November 2019 at a Japanese elementary school.",
              "The robots' eyes can change to display hearts, along with other emotions, and their multiple joints and arms can be remotely controlled.",
              "Cameras allow the robots to recognize and respond to facial expressions.",
              "The robots were developed in collaboration with Toyota.",
              "[28] On 22 July 2019, the official Japanese Twitter account of Tokyo 2020 posted an animated short depicting Miraitowa participating in all the sports to be contested at the Games.",
              "[29][30][31] On 25 August 2019, the same Twitter account posted a similar animated video featuring Someity participating in the Paralympic Games.",
              "[32] The public reaction to the mascot selection was \"generally positive\", according to an article published on Forbes' website in March 2018 by contributor Jake Adelstein.",
              "Adelstein described the mascots as \"cute\", though he commented that \"there was some criticism of the futuristic blue and pink characters falling clearly into traditional gender roles\".",
              "Adelstein speculated that the mascots would support the Olympics in Tokyo financially.",
              "[18] Multiple observers compared the design of the mascots to that of the Poke\u0301mon and Digimon franchises.",
              "[18][33][34] An article by Agence France-Presse described the social media reaction to the mascot selection on as \"mixed\".",
              "Some users commented that the mascots were \"very Japanese and very cute\", while others commented that the mascots should have been \"more round\" or \"more huggable\".",
              "Other commentators said that the selected design \"appealed more to children whereas adults preferred the softer and more traditional options\".",
              "[35] Dan McQuade wrote in an article in sports news website Deadspin that it will be difficult for Miraitowa and Someity to match the popularity of Soohorang and Bandabi, the mascots of the 2018 Winter Olympics, citing statements from the BBC, which wrote that the 2020 mascots \"have a tough act to follow\", and The Japan Times, which wrote in a headline that the success of Soohorang and Bandabi \"leaves Japan in a bind\".",
              "[34][36][37] James Dator, in a blog entry published on the sports news website SB Nation, wrote that there is \"nothing functionally wrong\" with the mascot design, but felt that Sanae Akimoto's pair C was a superior candidate and should have been chosen instead.",
              "Dator also argued that children should not have been the ones to make the final decision.",
              "[38] On the other hand, Naoki Ogi, a Japanese pedagogy expert, emphasized the importance of the role of children in selecting the mascots, as opposed to adults.",
              "[18] Japanese author Rurika Suzuki said that the mascots have a \"a very Japanese anime-like quality\", describing them as \"brilliant and sporty and perfect for the Olympics\".",
              "[18] In an article published in The New York Times on 27 July 2021, Mike Ives and Hikari Hida commented that, despite the typical importance of mascots in Japanese advertising, the mascots have had a \"subdued\" presence at the Tokyo Olympics, commenting that \"the Japanese public is not swooning over them either, according to fans and experts who study the country\u2019s mascot industry\".",
              "[39] Ives and Hida described a common complaint being that the names of the mascots, Miraitowa and Someity, are difficult to remember.",
