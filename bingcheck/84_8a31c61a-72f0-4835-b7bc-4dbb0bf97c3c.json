              "5 min read A global ocean lies beneath the icy crust of Saturn\u2019s geologically active moon Enceladus, according to new research using data from NASA\u2019s Cassini mission.",
              "Researchers found the magnitude of the moon\u2019s very slight wobble, as it orbits Saturn, can only be accounted for if its outer ice shell is not frozen solid to its interior, meaning a global ocean must be present.",
              "The finding implies the fine spray of water vapor, icy particles and simple organic molecules Cassini has observed coming from fractures near the moon\u2019s south pole is being fed by this vast liquid water reservoir.",
              "The research is presented in a paper published online this week in the journal Icarus.",
              "Previous analysis of Cassini data suggested the presence of a lens-shaped body of water, or sea, underlying the moon\u2019s south polar region.",
              "However, gravity data collected during the spacecraft\u2019s several close passes over the south polar region lent support to the possibility the sea might be global.",
              "The new results \u2014 derived using an independent line of evidence based on Cassini\u2019s images \u2014 confirm this to be the case.",
              "\u201cThis was a hard problem that required years of observations, and calculations involving a diverse collection of disciplines, but we are confident we finally got it right,\u201d said Peter Thomas, a Cassini imaging team member at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, and lead author of the paper.",
              "Cassini scientists analyzed more than seven years\u2019 worth of images of Enceladus taken by the spacecraft, which has been orbiting Saturn since mid-2004.",
              "They carefully mapped the positions of features on Enceladus \u2014 mostly craters \u2014 across hundreds of images, in order to measure changes in the moon\u2019s rotation with extreme precision.",
              "As a result, they found Enceladus has a tiny, but measurable wobble as it orbits Saturn.",
              "Because the icy moon is not perfectly spherical \u2014 and because it goes slightly faster and slower during different portions of its orbit around Saturn \u2014 the giant planet subtly rocks Enceladus back and forth as it rotates.",
              "The team plugged their measurement of the wobble, called a libration, into different models for how Enceladus might be arranged on the inside, including ones in which the moon was frozen from surface to core.",
              "\u201cIf the surface and core were rigidly connected, the core would provide so much dead weight the wobble would be far smaller than we observe it to be,\u201d said Matthew Tiscareno, a Cassini participating scientist at the SETI Institute, Mountain View, California, and a co-author of the paper.",
              "\u201cThis proves that there must be a global layer of liquid separating the surface from the core,\u201d he said.",
              "The mechanisms that might have prevented Enceladus\u2019 ocean from freezing remain a mystery.",
              "Thomas and his colleagues suggest a few ideas for future study that might help resolve the question, including the surprising possibility that tidal forces due to Saturn\u2019s gravity could be generating much more heat within Enceladus than previously thought.",
              "\u201cThis is a major step beyond what we understood about this moon before, and it demonstrates the kind of deep-dive discoveries we can make with long-lived orbiter missions to other planets,\u201d said co-author Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging team lead at Space Science Institute (SSI), Boulder, Colorado, and visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley.",
              "\u201cCassini has been exemplary in this regard.",
              "\u201d The unfolding story of Enceladus has been one of the great triumphs of Cassini\u2019s long mission at Saturn.",
              "Scientists first detected signs of the moon\u2019s icy plume in early 2005, and followed up with a series of discoveries about the material gushing from warm fractures near its south pole.",
              "They announced strong evidence for a regional sea in 2014, and more recently, in 2015, they shared results that suggest hydrothermal activity is taking place on the ocean floor.",

              "On Earth, it's possible that the organic ingredients of the soup were produced from existing materials on the early Earth.",
              "Another theory is that the right soup mix ingredients arrived as incoming comet material and interplanetary dust.",
              "Organic chemicals were part of the raw material from which Enceladus and Saturn's other moons formed.",
              "The origin of Enceladus' heat is less clear, but there are several possibilities that could have given Enceladus a layer of liquid water that persists today.",
              "Early on, it could have been heated by decay of short-lived radioactivity in rocks, with the heating prolonged by tidal influences.",
              "Or perhaps an earlier oblong orbit could have brought more tidal heating than exists there today.",
              "A past tidal relationship with another moon could have caused the heat.",
              "Another theory says the heat could have been produced from a process called serpentization, where chemical binding of water and silicate rock could occur at the upper layer of the moon's core.",
              "This increases the volume of the rock and creates energy in the form of heat.",
              "Any of these heating mechanisms might have created a liquid subsurface aquifer solution rich in organics, allowing Enceladus to serve up a suitable prebiotic soup.",
              "The Deep Sea Vent TheoryThe deep sea vent theory for the origin of life on Earth might apply to Enceladus as well.",
              "In this scenario, life on Earth began at the interface where chemically rich fluids, heated by tidal or other mechanisms, emerge from below the sea floor.",

              "So maybe it was possible that on Enceladus, life started in a \"warm little pond\" below the icy surface occurring over the last few tens of millions of years.",
              "For life to persist once it has been established requires an environment of liquid water, the essential elements and nutrients, and an energy source.",

              "Yet there, in the darkness that reigns nearly a kilometer below the sunlit surface, nature has built an undersea metropolis, a complex of limestone towers as tall as skyscrapers that is home to masses of snails, crabs and mussels.",
              "The towers form as minerals precipitate out of warm, alkaline water jetting from hydrothermal vents along the ocean floor.",
              "Biologists using submersibles and remote cameras found this exotic \u201cLost City\u201d in the early 2000s and have been studying it ever since to learn how hydrothermal vents can sustain thriving ecosystems so far from the life-giving light of the sun.",
              "In the meantime, planetary scientists using the Cassini space probe have made a revolutionary series of related discoveries in the outer solar system, finding strong evidence that hydrothermal vents much like those of Lost City exist not only on Earth but also in the mysterious subsurface ocean of a small, icy Saturnian moon called Enceladus.",
              "Could life exist there, too?",
              "Naturally, the possibility of extraterrestrial life tantalizes scientists, but they would have been excited about otherworldly hydrothermal vents even without aliens dangling in front of their eyes.",
              "The same evidence that suggests hydrothermal activity on this faraway moon is also providing critical information about the composition and longevity of Enceladus's ocean.",
              "Those secrets might otherwise be forever hidden underneath a frozen crust, as they might be for other ocean-bearing moons currently lacking strong evidence for hydrothermal activity, such as Jupiter's Europa.",
              "More fundamentally, the very existence of Enceladus's hydrothermal vents poses an irresistible puzzle.",
              "Other than water, the most important ingredient for hydrothermal activity is obviously heat, but this icy moon's sizzling innards are not easily explained.",
              "Enceladus is roughly the diameter of England\u2014relatively runty for a moon and far too small to hold onto the primordial heat left over from its formation.",
              "Some other source of warmth must be at work deep within.",
              "Learning how Enceladus generates and sustains its toasty interior could revolutionize our understanding of icy moons\u2014and their prospects for life.",
              "Scientists began to suspect an ocean within Enceladus in 2005, about a year after Cassini's arrival in the Saturnian system, when the spacecraft observed a huge plume of water vapor and ice grains rising hundreds of kilometers into space from tectonically active terrain around the moon's south pole.",
              "In a series of subsequent flybys, Cassini traced the plume to multiple jets emanating from four linear fissures so much warmer than their frigid surroundings that they glowed in infrared.",
              "Mission scientists called the fissures \u201ctiger stripes\u201d and pinpointed their jets as the source of the tenuous, sprawling ring of icy particles\u2014known as the E ring\u2014that encloses Saturn's classical ring system.",
              "Most of the jets' ice grains, however, travel too slowly to reach this ring and instead fall back to Enceladus as a fine-powdered snow.",
              "Based on the 100-meter-high snowdrifts that cover parts of its southern hemisphere, researchers estimate that Enceladus has been venting water into space for 10 million years or more.",
              "Although the \u201cocean hypothesis\u201d for Enceladus's jets was initially controversial, an extended series of studies by Cassini has now irrefutably confirmed that a global deep sea hides inside the moon.",
              "Most recently, an analysis of Enceladus's gravitational field, surface topography and slight rotational wobble by Ondrej Cadek of Charles University in Prague and his collaborators, including one of us (Tobie), placed the best limits yet on the ocean's size and extent.",
              "Their work suggests that the crust must be about 35 kilometers thick near Enceladus's equator but less than five kilometers thick in and around the south pole.",
              "Indeed, Alice Le Gall of the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin in France and her collaborators recently detected unusually large thermal microwave emissions at the south polar terrain, indicating an ice shell thickness of only a few kilometers.",
              "The ocean floor would lie about 60 to 65 kilometers under the surface, which would mean Enceladus's sea holds about a tenth as much water as the Indian Ocean.",
              "And based on data gathered by Cassini in 2009 and 2011, one of us (Postberg) has shown that the water is alkaline and salty, containing sodium chloride\u2014standard table salt\u2014in its ejected plume.",
              "This means the ocean most likely lies atop (and leaches minerals from) the moon's rocky core.",
              "The crucial evidence for the presence of hydrothermal vents was gathered beginning in 2004 by Cassini's Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA), before the spacecraft even arrived at Saturn and discovered Enceladus's plume.",
              "As Cassini approached Saturn from interplanetary space, unexpected showers of microscopic, fast-moving nanoparticles struck the CDA like buckshot.",
              "Years later, after the discovery of the plume, Postberg examined the distribution of the nanoparticle sizes and frequency in the CDA data, finding none of them to be larger than 20 nanometers and all of them to have a composition most consistent with that of essentially pure silicon dioxide\u2014silica, the main constituent of quartz rock and beach sand.",
              "Using numerical simulations to trace the most probable trajectories for the silica nanoparticles, Hsiang-Wen Hsu of the University of Colorado Boulder surmised that they had originated in the outer reaches of the E ring.",
              "Because we knew that Enceladus produces the E ring, this finding strongly suggested that the nanoparticles had come from the icy moon.",
              "Their composition proved to be the smoking gun for discovering Enceladus's hydrothermal activity.",
              "Pure silica jetting from Enceladus was a surprise because its only plausible source would be deep underneath the ice and the ocean, in the moon's rocky core, where silicon mostly exists in minerals chemically bound with other elements such as iron and magnesium.",
              "Collisional grinding of those minerals\u2014the rough-and-tumble shattering of rock to make ever smaller pieces\u2014might conceivably create silica nanoparticles.",
              "Yet such particles would come in a wide range of sizes, not the very narrow range Cassini observed.",
              "Only one other natural explanation remained: the nanoparticles could have crystallized from a supersaturated, silica-rich solution of hot, alkaline water flowing through rock\u2014that is, from hydrothermal vents of exactly the kind found at Lost City on Earth.",
              "At Lost City, and presumably on the seafloor of Enceladus, hot water absorbs silica as it flows up through silicate rocks.",
              "As the water vents out into the surrounding sea and cools, its capacity to carry absorbed minerals diminishes, and silica nanoparticles form.",
              "At this stage, other molecules could glom onto the nanoparticles, making them larger and heavier and thus causing them to eventually precipitate to the bottom\u2014unless, that is, the water were alkaline and not too salty.",
              "This relation between the size and longevity of nanoparticles and the temperature and chemistry of their aqueous birthplaces offers researchers an unprecedented window into the environmental conditions of Enceladus's ocean.",
              "Following on Cassini's initial detection of the nanoparticles, a team led by Yasuhito Sekine of the University of Tokyo conducted laboratory experiments to confirm how the nanoparticles formed and to reveal the conditions deep within Enceladus.",
              "The scientists found that water at or above 90 degrees Celsius with alkalinity above and salinity slightly below the value of Earth's sea is ideal for creating small, long-lived silica nanoparticles.",
              "According to their experiments, the alkalinity of Enceladus's ocean must be between that of terrestrial seawater and ammonia-based household cleaning products.",
              "If it were more alkaline than aqueous ammonia, the water's high silica solubility would not allow nanoparticles to form.",
              "If the water were less alkaline than seawater on Earth, it would have to be inconceivably hot to dissolve sufficient amounts of silicon dioxide to form silica nanoparticles.",
              "Altogether Hsu's, Postberg's and Sekine's respective work raises the possibility that the rich ecosystems of Lost City and other terrestrial hydrothermal vents could conceivably survive and thrive if relocated to the depths of Enceladus.",
              "In other words, the ocean of this distant icy moon looks like it could be habitable.",
              "Of course, it could be that Enceladus is currently inhospitable for life and that the silica nanoparticles detected by Cassini are simply relics of ancient hydrothermal activity that ceased long ago.",
              "But the work of Sekine and other collaborators suggests this is not the case.",
              "In lab experiments and numerical models, freshly formed silica particles average about four nanometers wide, only growing larger over time spans of at least a few months and, at most, a few years.",
              "The CDA data show that the typical nanoparticle from Enceladus is between four and 16 nanometers wide, with none wider than 20.",
              "Hence, the nanoparticles collected by Cassini must have been created only a short time before being measured.",
              "Otherwise, they would have been larger than observed.",
              "We can now trace a typical nanoparticle's journey from the bottom of Enceladus's buried sea out to the wider solar system.",
              "After forming at the cooling edges of hot, silica-rich fluids gushing into the cold surrounding ocean, a nanoparticle will spend as much as a few years drifting up through about 60 kilometers of open water.",
              "When it reaches the top of the ocean, the nanoparticle ascends into water-filled fractures that crisscross through the few-kilometer-thick overlying frozen crust of the south polar terrain.",
              "Because the seawater is denser than the surrounding ice, its progress upward should halt less than a kilometer underneath Enceladus's surface.",
              "But here the so-called champagne effect provides a further boost: as the water, which contains dissolved carbon dioxide and other gases, rises, and the pressure on it decreases, it becomes fizzy with bubbles.",
              "The bubbles help to lift the seawater within perhaps 100 meters of Enceladus's surface.",
              "Tidal forces may also help the process by repeatedly opening and closing the cracks.",
              "There, we suspect, temporary pools of gas-saturated liquids loaded with suspended particles throw off clouds of ocean mist from bursting bubbles.",
              "In such close proximity to the harsh vacuum of space, water evaporates efficiently, although it is near its freezing point.",
              "The vapor is dragged into the vacuum and, as if through a chimney, rises up through cracks in the near-surface ice into space.",
              "Along with the vapor, the ocean spray from the effervescing pools is carried upward and quickly freezes into micron-sized ice grains, which incorporate the silica nanoparticles like raisins in a bun.",
              "Some of the vapor freezes on the walls of ice, releasing latent heat that we see as the infrared glow of Enceladus's surface tiger stripes.",
              "The vapor that does not freeze carries the nanoparticle-laden grains up to the surface, hurling them into space as icy fountains.",
              "Most of the grains in the plume fall back to the surface as snow, but those with the highest speeds escape Enceladus to accumulate in the E ring.",
              "In the E ring, ionized gas erodes the ice grains and frees the embedded nanoparticles.",
              "The liberated nanoparticles then accumulate an electric charge from the ionized gas and free electrons and become the playthings of Saturn's immense electromagnetic fields.",
              "Finally, boosted by solar winds, some of the nanoparticles reach velocities up to a million kilometers per hour\u2014about 1 percent of light speed\u2014and zip off into the solar system.",
              "A small fraction of the escapees may even reach interstellar space, to surf the voids between the stars.",
              "As elaborate, beautiful and, we believe, true as this narrative is, it does not address what has become the central conundrum of Enceladus: What is the source of the internal heat required to maintain its dynamic ocean?",
              "That heat, which is essential for liquid water and life, obviously cannot come from sunlight.",
              "The sun's rays are about 99 percent weaker at Enceladus than in Earth's vicinity, giving the icy moon a surface temperature about that of liquid nitrogen.",
              "About half of Earth's internal warmth comes from the slow decay of radioactive isotopes of uranium, thorium and potassium.",
              "This radiogenic heating has sustained temperatures exceeding several thousands of degrees C in Earth's interior for billions of years.",
              "Although Enceladus probably contains comparable concentrations of radiogenic elements, at only 500 kilometers wide, the diminutive moon loses its internal heat much more efficiently than Earth does.",
              "In the absence of an additional heat source, Enceladus's interior should be frozen solid.",
              "The moon's small size and weak gravity also make its internal dynamics very different from bulky planets like Earth: lower pressures and more moderate temperatures within Enceladus limit the compaction and consolidation of material in its core, allowing water to circulate down through porous rock to create hydrothermal processes in the moon's very center.",
              "Contrast this with Earth, where the rapid subterranean increases in pressure and temperature limit water circulation to the top few kilometers of crust.",
              "One might expect the flushing of Enceladus's core to hasten its cooling, sweeping away any radiogenic heat and precluding the high temperatures required to make silica nanoparticles.",
              "Yet there is another possible energy source beyond standard radiogenic heating that could explain the moon's present-day hydrothermal activity: tidal heating.",
              "Similar to how Earth's ocean tides arise from our moon and the sun pulling on our planet, tidal heating occurs when a planet's or moon's interior periodically flexes as it moves through a noncircular, eccentric orbit.",
              "The flexure from shifting gravitational forces creates friction in a planet's or moon's inner layers, which in turn creates heat.",
              "Tidal heating would be particularly powerful within the porous, water-suffused core of a world such as Enceladus.",
              "And indeed, data from Cassini clearly show that Saturn's tidal pull profoundly influences the tiny moon\u2014the brightness of its erupted jets and therefore the amount of material ejected vary periodically as the moon whirls around the ringed planet.",
              "Evidently, the chimneylike cracks that serve as conduits for mist and water vapor through the ice are at turns squeezed together and pulled apart by tidal tugs that also generate significant amounts of heat.",
              "What we do not know is whether the ocean we observe today is a transient phenomenon persisting for only tens of millions of years or a sustained feature of the moon that has endured for hundreds of millions or even billions of years.",
              "The answer depends on how long the action of tides has heated up Enceladus's interior, which in turn depends on how the moon influences Saturn, as well as its lunar neighbor Dione.",
              "To understand these tidal interactions, we can consider the familiar system of our Earth and moon, which bears some similarities to that of Saturn and Enceladus.",
              "Our moon raises tides on Earth, and Enceladus does the same to Saturn.",
              "In Earth's ocean, these tidal flows gradually dissipate because of friction against coastlines and the seafloor\u2014an effect that measurably slows Earth's rotation.",
              "One hundred years from now, the day will be two milliseconds longer than it currently is, and Earth will have sapped enough of lunar tidal energy to push the moon's orbit out by nearly four meters.",
              "Similarly, tidal friction in Saturn's interior infinitesimally affects the giant planet's rotation while increasing Enceladus's distance from Saturn and orbital eccentricity.",
              "Higher eccentricities translate into larger tidal effects\u2014and thus more heating\u2014within Enceladus.",
              "Early theoretical estimates suggested that Enceladus would generate only weak tidal friction within Saturn, leading to the moon's orbit losing its eccentricity and thus limiting the lifetime of any tidal-heated ocean to no more than one million years.",
              "Recently Vale\u0301ry Lainey of the Paris Observatory and his collaborators (including Tobie) performed detailed analyses of the motions of Saturn's large moons to place more accurate constraints on the magnitude of tidal friction in the giant planet's interior.",
              "They found that the tidal friction within Saturn is at least 10 times larger than predicted by previous models.",
              "If true, this larger figure would mean that Enceladus's orbital eccentricity is stable and long-lived, allowing strong tides that can sustain an ocean for at least tens of millions of years and potentially much, much longer.",
              "The longer Enceladus's ocean can persist, it would seem, the greater the likelihood of life's emergence and flourishing there.",
              "In the meantime, there is a second possible heat source to consider beyond tidal heating.",
              "When water percolates through silicate rock, it can hydrate and change the crystalline structure of certain minerals, releasing substantial amounts of heat in a process called serpentinization.",
              "Bolstered by the ready circulation of water through the moon's porous, silicate-rich rocky core, serpentinization could generate several gigawatts of power and be a crucial part of Enceladus's internal heat budget.",
              "As long as fresh, unaltered minerals are in contact with circulating water, this heat supply will persist.",
              "But as the rock becomes fully serpentinized over millions of years, it will cease producing heat and should cool down in the absence of other influences, such as tidal friction.",
              "So it seems that serpentinization alone can hardly sustain a global ocean long enough to allow prebiotic chemistry to evolve.",
              "Even so, serpentinization could still contribute to possible biospheres within Enceladus's depths.",
              "On Earth, scientists have observed serpentinization processes powering the hydrothermal vents at Lost City and other undersea sites.",
              "Besides making heat, these reactions also produce hydrogen, methane and other organic compounds that sustain the microbes that form the base of the food chain for their isolated, sun-starved ecosystems. Studying such organisms, some researchers have wondered whether life really needs the sun at all.",
              "The idea that similar scenarios are occurring within Enceladus's water-filled core recently got a substantial boost: during the last close flyby on October 28, 2015, Cassini dove deeper into the plume than ever before to allow its ion and neutral mass spectrometer (INMS) to look for hydrogen.",
              "In April 2017 the INMS team reported that it indeed detected hydrogen, which makes up about 1 percent of the plume vapor, supporting the idea that serpentinization happens deep in the moon's interior.",
              "Serpentinization likely does not contribute substantially to the total heat budget, but the measured ratio of hydrogen and methane in the plume indicated that the so-called methanogenesis reaction could provide a source of chemical energy at hydrothermal sites.",
              "In the late 1980s Michael Russell, then at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, and his collaborators hypothesized that alkaline hydrothermal vents might have been the birthplace of the first living organisms on the early Earth.",
              "Although none were yet known on Earth, Russell argued that such sites would offer a relatively benign yet energy-rich environment in which prebiotic chemistry could brew to form the precursors of modern membranes, metabolisms and self-replicating molecules.",
              "Few people took the idea seriously enough to discuss or debate it outside of rarefied academic circles.",
              "The discovery of Lost City catalyzed new interest in Russell's hypothesis, catapulting it to the forefront of contemporary discussions of life's origins.",
              "Now the discovery of similar environments within Enceladus\u2014and the potential for their existence in other icy moons such as Jupiter's Europa\u2014is catalyzing another shift in how we think about the possibilities for life elsewhere in the solar system.",
              "Biology need not be confined to the warm, wet surfaces of sunlit rocky planets but could perhaps proliferate in a much wider range of environments, sustained in whole or in part by heat from radioisotopes, serpentinization or tidal forces.",
              "Enceladus and Europa may be proverbial tips of the iceberg\u2014telltale hints that subsurface oceans also exist in Jupiter's moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as Saturn's moons Titan and Mimas and even the dwarf planet Pluto.",
              "Researchers who, like us, are interested in life beyond Earth are only beginning to grapple with these speculative possibilities and their implications, but it appears increasingly likely that until now, we have drastically underestimated the universe's biological fecundity.",
              "For the time being, we must remain in the dark about whether the interiors of icy moons really do supply all the necessary ingredients for extraterrestrial habitability.",
              "The duration and intensity of hydrothermal activity within Enceladus remain an open issue, and discussion of possible hydrothermal activity inside Europa is scarcely more than speculation.",
              "Both NASA and its counterpart the European Space Agency are eagerly pursuing answers to these questions and are planning missions to Jupiter's icy moons that could seek Enceladus-style plumes in the late 2020s or early 2030s.",
              "In September 2017 Cassini completed its mission\u2014crashing into Saturn to preclude any possibility of contaminating Enceladus or another icy moon with earthly biology.",
              "Eventually a new generation of spacecraft could be sent there to undertake in situ investigations, landing on the moon and even gathering samples for return to Earth.",
              "At present, such missions exist only in the hopes and dreams of astrobiologists\u2014but perhaps not for long.",

              "Saturn&#39;s Ocean Moon Enceladus Has All The Building Blocks For Life ...",
              "Saturn's ocean moon, Enceladus, is attracting increasing attention in the search for life in our Solar System.",
              "Most of what we know about Enceladus and its ice-covered ocean comes from the Cassini mission.",
              "Cassini ended its exploration of the Saturn system in 2017, but scientists are still working through its data.",
              "New research based on Cassini data strengthens the idea that Enceladus has the chemicals necessary for life.",
              "During its mission, Cassini discovered geyser-like plumes of water erupting through Enceladus' icy shell.",
              "In 2008, Cassini performed a close-proximity flyby and analyzed the plumes with its Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA).",
              "The CDA showed that the water in the plumes contained a surprising mix of volatiles, including carbon dioxide, water vapour, and carbon monoxide.",
              "It also found trace amounts of molecular nitrogen, simple hydrocarbons, and complex organic chemicals.",
              "But Cassini's data is still being analyzed, even six years after it completed its mission and was sent to its destruction in Saturn's atmosphere.",
              "A new paper titled \"Observations of Elemental Composition of Enceladus Consistent with Generalized Models of Theoretical Ecosystems\" presents some new findings.",
              "The lead author is Daniel Muratore, a post-doc at the Santa Fe Institute.",
              "The work centers on the discovery of ammonia and inorganic phosphorous in Enceladus' ocean.",
              "The researchers used ecological and metabolic theory and modelling to understand how these chemicals could make Enceladus amenable to life.",
              "\"Apart from speculating about threshold concentrations of bioactive compounds to support ecosystems, metabolic and ecological theory can provide a powerful interpretative lens to assess whether extraterrestrial environments are compatible with living ecosystems,\" the authors explain.",
              "A critical component of ecological theory is the Redfield ratio.",
              "It's named after the American oceanographer Alfred Redfield.",
              "In 1934, Redfield published results showing that the ratio of carbon to nitrogen to phosphorous (C:N:P) was remarkably consistent across ocean biomass at 106:16:1.",
              "Other researchers found that the ratio shifted slightly depending on the area and the phytoplankton species present.",
              "More recent work refined the ratio to 166:22:1.",
              "The exact numbers aren't necessarily the critical point.",
              "Redfield's conclusion is the vital part.",
              "The Redfield ratio shows a remarkable unity between the chemistry of living things in the deep ocean and the ocean itself.",
              "He proposed that there's an equilibrium between ocean water and plankton nutrients that's based on biotic feedback.",
              "He described a chemical framework for nutrients and simple life.",
              "\"Whatever its explanation, the correspondence between the quantities of biologically available nitrogen and phosphorus in the sea and the proportions in which they are utilized by the plankton is a phenomenon of the greatest interest,\" Redfield said in the conclusion of his paper.",
              "So, how does the discovery of ammonia and phosphorous in Enceladus' ocean relate to the Redfield ratio and Enceladus' biological potential?",
              "The Redfield ratio is widespread all across the Tree of Life on Earth.",
              "\"Because of this seeming ubiquity, the Redfield ratio has been considered a target signature for astrobiological life detection, especially on ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus,\" the authors of the new paper write.",
              "When it comes to life, all we have to go on is Earth.",
              "So it's sensible to use foundational aspects of life's chemistry here on Earth as a lens through which to examine other potential life-supporting worlds.",
              "Analysis of Cassini's data from Enceladus' plumes shows a high level of inorganic phosphate in the ocean.",
              "Other geochemical simulations based on Cassini's findings indicate the same.",
              "\"These reports of phosphorus follow on the tails of previous work identifying numerous elemental constituents of terrestrial life (C, N, H, O) from the Enceladus plume,\" the authors explain.",
              "Even more analysis suggests that the ocean contains many of the chemicals common in living organisms, like amino acid precursors, ammonium, and hydrocarbons.",
              "So Enceladus' ocean has a rich chemistry, and many chemicals reflect life's chemical makeup.",
              "In particular, there's an emerging hypothesis that Enceladus could support methanogenesis.",
              "Earth's Archaea perform methanogenesis across a wide swath of different environmental conditions on Earth and have done so for over three billion years, proving their survivability.",
              "Biochemical modelling suggests that Earth's methanogens are compatible with Enceladus' ocean.",
              "The researchers developed a new, more detailed model for methanogens on Enceladus to see if they could survive and thrive there.",
              "Their model leaned heavily on the Redfield ratio.",
              "They found that though phosphorous is present in high levels in the moon's ocean, the overall ratio \"may be limiting to Earth-like cells.\"",
              "\"High standing stocks of these nutrients could be consistent with incomplete drawdown due to a small or metabolically slow biosphere, a biosphere with a recent origin of life,\" or other reasons that could cause an imbalance.",
              "So where does that leave the prospects for life on Enceladus?",
              "We're only at the beginning of biosignature science.",
              "We can identify individual chemicals, but from this great distance away, we can't accurately measure Enceladus' overall chemistry.",
              "Newer biosignature research, including this paper, aims to identify how biological processes reorganize chemical elements in telltale ways.",
              "By looking at entire ecosystems, as Redfield did, scientists may discover new biosignatures that are less ambiguous.",
              "If we can do that, we may discover that non-Earthly lifeforms reorganize chemicals in entirely different ways.",
              "This research is part of a new effort to detect more than individual chemical biosignatures, some of which can be false positives.",
              "Methane, for example, can be a biosignature but can also be produced abiotically.",
              "There are others, like the recently discovered phosphine on Venus.",
              "Understanding ecosystems as a whole is the next step.",
              "There's a bewildering number of factors to consider.",
              "Cell size, nutrient availability, radiation, salinity, temperature.",
              "On and on.",
              "But to understand the overall chemical environment at Enceladus, Europa, or anywhere else, we need more detailed data.",
              "Luckily, instrument science keeps improving, and upcoming missions to Europa will start to paint a fuller picture.",
              "According to the authors, the next step requires more fulsome data and a more generalized approach.",
              "\"We suggest two priorities for further astrobiological research to better understand the implications of these conclusions,\" they write.",
              "\"First, we echo previous calls in the astrobiology literature to explore more generalized notions of metabolism and physiology.\"",
              "They also suggest that looking for direct parallels to terrestrial life in the form of biochemistry may not be the best strategy for looking for life on Enceladus.",
              "\"Second, we recommend broadening the scope of Earth analogue environments to include those with extreme resource supply ratios mirroring that suggested for Enceladus,\" they explain.",
              "Our understanding of habitability grows incrementally, as this study clearly shows.",
              "There'll likely be no revelatory moments where we suddenly understand it.",
              "Nature has created a vast variety of worlds, each with its own chemistry.",
              "While using tools like the Redfield ratio as a lens is one way of looking at these worlds in all their unique glory, we can't get tunnel vision.",
              "While most of what our imaginations dream up about life on other worlds is fanciful and unlikely, life could've found another way on Enceladus.",
              "There could be different ways that life exists in and reorganizes chemical environments.",

              "Here we will compare the properties of two proposed sites for the origin of life on Earth\u2014hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor and hydrothermal volcanic fields at the surface\u2014and ask whether similar conditions could have fostered the origin of life on Enceladus.",
              "The answer depends on which of the two sites would be more conducive for the chemical evolution leading to life's origin.",
              "A hydrothermal vent origin would allow life to begin in the Enceladus ocean, but if the origin of life requires freshwater hydrothermal pools undergoing wet-dry cycles, the Enceladus ocean could be habitable but lifeless.",

              "To introduce our argument and guide the discussion, it is essential to make explicit a set of assumptions.",
              "We will begin by noting that microorganisms on Earth can survive in the deep, cold ocean in the absence of light energy.",
              "For these life-forms, the reducing power of hydrogen sulfide or dissolved hydrogen gas is used as a source of electrons.",
              "An electron transport chain allows the electrons to fall through the redox potential to an acceptor, thereby releasing chemical energy that drives metabolism.",
              "The acceptor is usually molecular oxygen, a product of photosynthesis, but can also be any of a variety of other acceptors such as ferric iron, nitrate, sulfate, and in the case of methanogens, carbon dioxide.",
              "Given an energy source, together with sources of carbon and nitrogen, it seems possible that microorganisms could survive in the oceans of Enceladus and Europa.",
              "But could microbial life originate on an ice-covered ocean world?",
              "To gauge the probability, we will describe two conditions that have been proposed as plausible sites for the origin of life on Earth, then consider whether life could emerge if similar conditions exist on Enceladus and Europa.",
              "Our argument has a foundation of five observations and assumptions about the physical nature of Enceladus, as follows: To further constrain our argument, we will assume seven conditions that must be met for life to begin: Hydrothermal sites are the only environments that can provide this suite of conditions.",
              "Other proposed environments such as a global ice sheet (Bada et al.",
              ", 1994), clay minerals (Ferris, 2002), and iron-sulfur minerals (Wa\u0308chtersha\u0308user, 1992) lack one or more of the above properties.",
              "Soon after submarine hydrothermal vents (\u201cblack smokers\u201d) were discovered, it was proposed that not only do they harbor an ecosystem based on microbial populations using hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen as energy sources, but they may also have been sites conducive for the origin of life (Corliss et al.",

              "Black smokers are associated with volcanism in which heat from an underlying magma plume brings circulating seawater to temperatures exceeding 400\u00b0C.",
              "When the heated water emerges from the vent, the dissolved minerals precipitate as a black cloud of iron sulfide and form chimneys.",
              "A second version of hydrothermal vents is driven by serpentinization rather than volcanic heat (Kelley et al.",
              "2005).",
              "When olivine is exposed to seawater, mineral components in the olivine (forsterite and fayalite) undergo an exothermic reaction that produces hydrogen gas and heat.",
              "The water becomes very alkaline (pH 10\u201311), and when it emerges from the vent the dissolved carbonate and hydroxide content precipitates as long-lived mineral chimneys.",
              "Because the Cassini mission detected plumes of ice particles erupting hundreds of kilometers into space through the ice cover of Enceladus, it has been proposed that Enceladus, and perhaps Europa, may have environments resembling oceanic hydrothermal vents (Hsu et al.",
              ", 2015).",
              "Furthermore, given the assumption that life can begin in hydrothermal vent conditions, a reasonable speculation is that life could also originate on these ocean worlds and may still exist.",
              "For this reason, missions are being planned to send spacecraft through the Enceladus plumes to collect microgram amounts of plume components and then use ultrasensitive biosensors to analyze the sample for biosignatures.",
              "How plausible is it that life can begin in hydrothermal conditions?",
              "A good way to sharpen the argument is to compare hydrothermal vents with an alternative site, the \u201cwarm little pond\u201d first envisaged by Charles Darwin (1871).",

              "Gravitational waves are waves of the intensity of gravity that are generated by the accelerated masses of binary stars and other motions of gravitating masses, and propagate as waves outward from their source at the speed of light.",
              "They were first proposed by Oliver Heaviside in 1893 and then later by Henri Poincare\u0301 in 1905 as the gravitational equivalent of electromagnetic waves.",
              "[1] Gravitational waves were later predicted in 1916[2][3] by Albert Einstein on the basis of his general theory of relativity as ripples in spacetime.",
              "[4][5] Later he refused to accept gravitational waves.",
              "[6] Gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation, a form of radiant energy similar to electromagnetic radiation.",
              "[7] Newton's law of universal gravitation, part of classical mechanics, does not provide for their existence, since that law is predicated on the assumption that physical interactions propagate instantaneously (at infinite speed) \u2013 showing one of the ways the methods of Newtonian physics are unable to explain phenomena associated with relativity.",
              "The first indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational waves came in 1974 from the observed orbital decay of the Hulse\u2013Taylor binary pulsar, which matched the decay predicted by general relativity as energy is lost to gravitational radiation.",
              "In 1993, Russell A.",
              "Hulse and Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr.",
              "received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.",
              "The first direct observation of gravitational waves was made in 2015, when a signal generated by the merger of two black holes was received by the LIGO gravitational wave detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and in Hanford, Washington.",
              "The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics was subsequently awarded to Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish for their role in the direct detection of gravitational waves.",
              "In gravitational-wave astronomy, observations of gravitational waves are used to infer data about the sources of gravitational waves.",
              "Sources that can be studied this way include binary star systems composed of white dwarfs, neutron stars,[8][9] and black holes;",
              "events such as supernovae;",
              "and the formation of the early universe shortly after the Big Bang.",
              "In Einstein's general theory of relativity, gravity is treated as a phenomenon resulting from the curvature of spacetime.",
              "This curvature is caused by the presence of mass.",
              "Generally, the more mass that is contained within a given volume of space, the greater the curvature of spacetime will be at the boundary of its volume.",
              "[10] As objects with mass move around in spacetime, the curvature changes to reflect the changed locations of those objects.",
              "In certain circumstances, accelerating objects generate changes in this curvature which propagate outwards at the speed of light in a wave-like manner.",
              "These propagating phenomena are known as gravitational waves.",
              "As a gravitational wave passes an observer, that observer will find spacetime distorted by the effects of strain.",
              "Distances between objects increase and decrease rhythmically as the wave passes, at a frequency equal to that of the wave.",
              "The magnitude of this effect is inversely proportional to the distance from the source.",
              "[11]: 227 Inspiraling binary neutron stars are predicted to be a powerful source of gravitational waves as they coalesce, due to the very large acceleration of their masses as they orbit close to one another.",
              "However, due to the astronomical distances to these sources, the effects when measured on Earth are predicted to be very small, having strains of less than 1 part in 1020.",
              "Where General Relativity is accepted, gravitational waves as detected are attributed to ripples in spacetime;",
              "otherwise the gravitational waves can be thought of simply as a product of the orbit of binary systems. (A binary orbit causes the binary system's geometry to change through 180 degrees and also causes the distance between each body of the binary system and the observer to change through 180 degrees causing a gravitational wave frequency of two times the orbital frequency).",
              "Scientists continue to demonstrate the existence of these waves with continuously upgraded, highly-sensitive detectors used in joint observation runs.",
              "The most sensitive detector accomplished the task possessing a sensitivity measurement of about one part in 5\u00d71022 (as of 2012[update]) provided by the LIGO and VIRGO observatories.",
              "[12] In 2019, the Japanese detector KAGRA was completed and made its first joint detection with LIGO and VIRGO in 2021.",

              "Gravitational waves can penetrate regions of space that electromagnetic waves cannot.",
              "They allow the observation of the merger of black holes and possibly other exotic objects in the distant Universe.",
              "Such systems cannot be observed with more traditional means such as optical telescopes or radio telescopes, and so gravitational wave astronomy gives new insights into the working of the Universe.",
              "In particular, gravitational waves could be of interest to cosmologists as they offer a possible way of observing the very early Universe.",
              "This is not possible with conventional astronomy, since before recombination the Universe was opaque to electromagnetic radiation.",
              "[14] Precise measurements of gravitational waves will also allow scientists to test more thoroughly the general theory of relativity.",
              "In principle, gravitational waves could exist at any frequency.",
              "Very low frequency waves are detected using pulsar timing arrays.",
              "Astronomers monitor the timing of approximately 100 pulsars spread widely across our galaxy over the course of years.",
              "Pulsars are the most accurate time clocks imaginable and subtle changes in the arrival of their signals caused by passing gravity waves generated by merging Super Massive Black Holes with wavelengths measured in lightyears and then using serious computing power to decipher the source.",
              "Using this technique they have discovered the \u2018hum\u2019 of various SMBH mergers occurring in the universe.",
              "Stephen Hawking and Werner Israel list different frequency bands for gravitational waves that could plausibly be detected, ranging from 10\u22127 Hz up to 1011 Hz.",
              "[15] The speed of gravitational waves in the general theory of relativity is equal to the speed of light in vacuum, c.",
              "[16] Within the theory of special relativity, the constant c is not only about light;",
              "instead it is the highest possible speed for any interaction in nature.",
              "Formally, c is a conversion factor for changing the unit of time to the unit of space.",
              "[17] This makes it the only speed which does not depend either on the motion of an observer or a source of light and/or gravity.",
              "Thus, the speed of \"light\" is also the speed of gravitational waves, and further the speed of any massless particle.",
              "Such particles include the gluon (carrier of the strong force), the photons that make up light (hence carrier of electromagnetic force), and the hypothetical gravitons (which are the presumptive field particles associated with gravity;",
              "however, an understanding of the graviton, if any exist, requires an as-yet unavailable theory of quantum gravity).",
              "In August 2017, the LIGO and Virgo detectors received gravitational wave signals within 2 seconds of gamma ray satellites and optical telescopes seeing signals from the same direction.",
              "This confirmed that the speed of gravitational waves was the same as the speed of light.",
              "[18] The possibility of gravitational waves was discussed in 1893 by Oliver Heaviside, using the analogy between the inverse-square law of gravitation and the electrostatic force.",
              "[22] In 1905, Henri Poincare\u0301 proposed gravitational waves, emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light, as being required by the Lorentz transformations[23] and suggested that, in analogy to an accelerating electrical charge producing electromagnetic waves, accelerated masses in a relativistic field theory of gravity should produce gravitational waves.",
              "[24][25] When Einstein published his general theory of relativity in 1915, he was skeptical of Poincare\u0301's idea since the theory implied there were no \"gravitational dipoles\".",
              "Nonetheless, he still pursued the idea and based on various approximations came to the conclusion there must, in fact, be three types of gravitational waves (dubbed longitudinal\u2013longitudinal, transverse\u2013longitudinal, and transverse\u2013transverse by Hermann Weyl).",
              "[25] However, the nature of Einstein's approximations led many (including Einstein himself) to doubt the result.",
              "In 1922, Arthur Eddington showed that two of Einstein's types of waves were artifacts of the coordinate system he used, and could be made to propagate at any speed by choosing appropriate coordinates, leading Eddington to jest that they \"propagate at the speed of thought\".",
              "[26]: 72 This also cast doubt on the physicality of the third (transverse\u2013transverse) type that Eddington showed always propagate at the speed of light regardless of coordinate system.",
              "In 1936, Einstein and Nathan Rosen submitted a paper to Physical Review in which they claimed gravitational waves could not exist in the full general theory of relativity because any such solution of the field equations would have a singularity.",
              "The journal sent their manuscript to be reviewed by Howard P.",
              "Robertson, who anonymously reported that the singularities in question were simply the harmless coordinate singularities of the employed cylindrical coordinates.",
              "Einstein, who was unfamiliar with the concept of peer review, angrily withdrew the manuscript, never to publish in Physical Review again.",
              "Nonetheless, his assistant Leopold Infeld, who had been in contact with Robertson, convinced Einstein that the criticism was correct, and the paper was rewritten with the opposite conclusion and published elsewhere.",
              "[25][26]: 79ff In 1956, Felix Pirani remedied the confusion caused by the use of various coordinate systems by rephrasing the gravitational waves in terms of the manifestly observable Riemann curvature tensor.",
              "[27] At the time, Pirani's work was overshadowed by the community's focus on a different question: whether gravitational waves could transmit energy.",
              "This matter was settled by a thought experiment proposed by Richard Feynman during the first \"GR\" conference at Chapel Hill in 1957.",
              "In short, his argument known as the \"sticky bead argument\" notes that if one takes a rod with beads then the effect of a passing gravitational wave would be to move the beads along the rod;",
              "friction would then produce heat, implying that the passing wave had done work.",
              "Shortly after, Hermann Bondi, published a detailed version of the \"sticky bead argument\".",
              "[25] This later lead to a series of articles (1959 to 1989) by Bondi and Pirani that established the existence of plane wave solutions for gravitational waves.",
              "[28] Paul Dirac further postulated the existence of gravitational waves, declaring them to have \"physical significance\" in his 1959 lecture at the Lindau Meetings.",
              "[29] Further, it was Dirac who predicted gravitational waves with a well defined energy density in 1964.",
              "[30] After the Chapel Hill conference, Joseph Weber started designing and building the first gravitational wave detectors now known as Weber bars.",
              "In 1969, Weber claimed to have detected the first gravitational waves, and by 1970 he was \"detecting\" signals regularly from the Galactic Center;",
              "however, the frequency of detection soon raised doubts on the validity of his observations as the implied rate of energy loss of the Milky Way would drain our galaxy of energy on a timescale much shorter than its inferred age.",
              "These doubts were strengthened when, by the mid-1970s, repeated experiments from other groups building their own Weber bars across the globe failed to find any signals, and by the late 1970s consensus was that Weber's results were spurious.",
              "[25] In the same period, the first indirect evidence of gravitational waves was discovered.",
              "In 1974, Russell Alan Hulse and Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.",
              "discovered the first binary pulsar, which earned them the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics.",
              "[31] Pulsar timing observations over the next decade showed a gradual decay of the orbital period of the Hulse\u2013Taylor pulsar that matched the loss of energy and angular momentum in gravitational radiation predicted by general relativity.",
              "[32][33][25] This indirect detection of gravitational waves motivated further searches, despite Weber's discredited result.",

              "This would involve scrutinizing the gravitational waves for clues about how black holes rotate: those that pair up after forming independently should have randomly oriented spins, whereas those with a common origin should have spin axes that are parallel to each other and roughly perpendicular to the plane in which they orbit.",

              "This type of signal has been dubbed a standard siren, in a nod to a common method of gauging distances in cosmology: stars called standard candles have a well-known brightness, which allows researchers to work out their distance from Earth.",
              "By coupling the distance measurement of GW170817 with an estimate of how fast the galaxies in that region are receding from Earth, Schutz and his collaborators made a new and completely independent estimate of the Hubble constant \u2014 the Universe\u2019s current rate of expansion (see \u2018Cosmic signposts\u2019).",

              "This first standard-siren measurement does not resolve the tension: the expansion rate it predicts falls somewhere in the middle of the range and, because it is based on just one merger event, has a large error bar.",
              "But in the future, researchers expect standard sirens to nail down the Hubble constant with an error of less than 1%.",
              "So far, standard candles have done it with precisions of 2\u20133%.",
              "Standard sirens could become even more powerful tools with space-based interferometers such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a trio of probes that the European Space Agency, which is leading the mission, plans to launch in the 2030s.",

              "Fundamentally different from and complementary to other astrophysical \u2018messengers\u2019 such as photons, neutrinos or cosmic rays, GWs provide unique information about the most energetic astrophysical processes in the Universe by carrying information about the dynamics of massive objects such as black holes and neutron stars moving at relativistic speeds.",

              "Current ground-based observatories probe the high-frequency portion of the GW spectrum from ~10 Hz to ~10 kHz dominated by stellar-mass compact sources, such as coalescing BBH and neutron star systems, and (as yet to be observed) supernovae and isolated neutron stars.",

Typical strains from astrophysical sources are on the order of 10\u221221 or less, thus, displacement sensitivities \u03b4L of less than ~10\u221218 m are required to detect GWs with sufficient signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio.",
