    "response": "That's a very interesting question. There have been many groundbreaking discoveries in the field of medicine that have saved countless lives, but it's hard to rank them objectively. However, based on some web sources[^2^] [^4^], here are some possible candidates:\n\n- **Vaccination**: The first successful vaccine was the smallpox vaccine, introduced in 1796 by Edward Jenner. Vaccines have since prevented millions of deaths from diseases such as polio, measles, tetanus, and most recently COVID-19[^2^].\n- **Germ Theory**: The idea that microorganisms cause diseases was proposed by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch in the 19th century. This led to the development of hygiene practices, sterilization techniques, and antibiotics that have reduced infections and improved public health[^4^].\n- **Antibiotics**: The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 was a serendipitous event that revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections. Antibiotics have saved millions of lives from diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and sepsis[^4^].\n- **Organ Transplantation**: The first successful organ transplant was a kidney transplant performed in 1954 by Joseph Murray and John Merrill. Since then, organ transplantation has become a lifesaving procedure for patients with organ failure or damage. Transplantation has also advanced the fields of immunology, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine[^4^].\n- **Artificial Intelligence**: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is a relatively recent but rapidly growing field. AI can help diagnose diseases, analyze images, predict outcomes, and personalize treatments. For example, an AI model developed by an international team of investigators, including those from Northwestern Medicine, predicted breast cancer in mammograms more accurately than radiologists[^3^].\n\nThese are just some examples of the many medical breakthroughs that have changed the world.

              "However, inoculation was not without its attendant risks.",
              "There were concerns that recipients might develop disseminated smallpox and spread it to others.",
              "Transmission of other diseases, such as syphilis, via the bloodborne route was also of concern.",
              "Inoculation, hereafter referred to as variolation, was likely practiced in Africa, India, and China long before the 18th century, when it was introduced to Europe (9).",

              "Finally, on April 17, 1722, Maitland successfully treated the two daughters of the Princess of Wales.",
              "Not surprisingly, the procedure gained general acceptance after this last success.",
              "In Europe, where the medical profession was relatively organized, the new methods of variolation became known quickly among physicians.",
              "Since there was also a demand for protection against smallpox, physicians soon began the variolation procedure on a massive scale.",

              "For many years, he had heard the tales that dairymaids were protected from smallpox naturally after having suffered from cowpox.",
              "Pondering this, Jenner concluded that cowpox not only protected against smallpox but also could be transmitted from one person to another as a deliberate mechanism of protection.",

              "Fleming\u2019s serendipitous discovery of penicillin changed the course of medicine and earned him a Nobel Prize.",
              "In 1928 Alexander Fleming (1881\u20131955) discovered penicillin, though he did not realize the full significance of his discovery for at least another decade.",
              "He eventually received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945.",
              "As far back as the 19th century, antagonism between certain bacteria and molds had been observed, and a name was given to this phenomenon\u2014antibiosis\u2014but little was made of these observations.",
              "A folk tradition using molds in medicine was similarly neglected.",
              "In 1928 Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, made from the Penicillium notatum mold, but he did not receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery until 1945.",
              "Fleming himself did not realize how important his discovery was;",
              "for a decade after, he focused instead on penicillin\u2019s potential use as a topical antiseptic for wounds and surface infections and as a means of isolating certain bacteria in laboratory cultures.",
              "It was left to his fellow Nobelists, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, to demonstrate in 1940 that penicillin could be used as a therapeutic agent to fight a large number of bacterial diseases.",
              "Born in Lochfield, Ayrshire, Scotland, Fleming was the seventh of eight surviving children in a farm family.",
              "His father died when he was seven years old, leaving his mother to manage the farm with her eldest stepson.",
              "Fleming, having acquired a good basic education in local schools, followed a stepbrother, already a practicing physician, to London when he was 13.",
              "He spent his teenaged years attending classes at Regent Street Polytechnic, working as a shipping clerk, and serving briefly in the army during the Boer War (1899\u20131902), although he did not see combat.",
              "Then in 1901 he won a scholarship to St.",
              "Mary\u2019s Hospital Medical School in Paddington, London, which remained his professional home for the rest of his life.",
              "Fleming accepted a post as a medical bacteriologist at St.",
              "Mary\u2019s after completing his studies, and in 1906 he joined the staff of the Inoculation Department under the direction of Sir Almroth Wright.",
              "Wright strongly believed in strengthening the body\u2019s own immune system through vaccine therapy, not by chemotherapy\u2014the introduction of external chemical agents (see Paul Ehrlich).",
              "Nonetheless, he turned over to Fleming samples of a new drug, Salvarsan, synthesized by Paul Ehrlich and colleagues for treating syphilis.",
              "Fleming\u2019s experience administering the drug to patients was positive, and thereafter he maintained a small but lucrative practice administering Salvarsan to wealthy patients suffering from syphilis.",
              "During World War I, Fleming worked at a special wound-research laboratory in Boulogne, France, headed by Wright.",
              "There he began research that produced results more in keeping with Wright\u2019s thinking.",
              "He was able to demonstrate that then commonly used chemical antiseptics like carbolic acid do not sterilize jagged wounds;",
              "rather, pus has its own antibacterial powers.",
              "Using cells on a slide, he was able to show that chemical antiseptics in dilutions harmless to bacteria actually damage white blood corpuscles (leukocytes)\u2014the body\u2019s first line of defense.",
              "After World War I, Fleming continued to work on leukocytes and antisepsis.",
              "In 1921 he discovered a substance in nasal mucus that causes bacteria to disintegrate.",
              "Fleming and a colleague subsequently detected this substance, which he named lysozyme, in human blood serum, tears, saliva, milk, and a wide variety of other fluids.",
              "In its natural state lysozyme seemed to be more effective against harmless airborne bacteria than against disease-causing bacteria.",
              "And attempts to concentrate it, thereby strengthening its antiseptic properties, proved unsuccessful.",
              "Fleming\u2019s legendary discovery of penicillin occurred in 1928, while he was investigating staphylococcus, a common type of bacteria that causes boils and can also cause disastrous infections in patients with weakened immune systems. Before Fleming left for a two-week vacation, a petri dish containing a staphylococcus culture was left on a lab bench and never placed in the incubator as intended.",
              "Somehow, in preparing the culture, a Penicillium mold spore had been accidentally introduced into the medium\u2014perhaps coming in through a window, or more likely floating up a stairwell from the lab below where various molds were being cultured.",
              "The temperature conditions that prevailed during Fleming\u2019s absence permitted both the bacteria and the mold spores to grow;",
              "had the incubator been used, only the bacteria could have grown.",
              "Fleming\u2019s laboratory notebooks are sketchy, and his subsequent accounts of the discovery are contradictory.",
              "The evidence of the first culture, which he photographed, indicated that he observed lysis, the weakening and destruction of bacteria\u2014as in his lysozyme studies.",
              "But sometimes he described the key observation as an instance of inhibition or prevention of bacterial growth in areas affected by the mold \u201cjuice,\u201d evidenced by a clear zone surrounding the mold.",
              "Although these two effects occur under quite different conditions, Fleming probably forgot which observation came first, for in the months subsequent to the original observation he conducted many experiments while varying conditions systematically.",
              "He discovered that the antibacterial substance was not produced by all molds, only by certain strains of Penicillium, namely, Penicillium notatum.",
              "Although he could not isolate it, he named the active substance \u201cpenicillin.",
              "\u201d He studied methods of producing the impure product and determined its stability at different temperatures and over various lengths of time.",
              "He investigated its effect on many microbes, curiously omitting the familiar spirochete that causes syphilis (which Salvarsan controlled but did not eliminate).",
              "He tested its toxicity on a laboratory mouse and a rabbit.",
              "Forever after, it has been a puzzle why he did not inject these or other laboratory animals with staphylococcus or other disease-causing bacteria before injecting them with the fluid containing penicillin.",
              "Perhaps the explanation lay in his belief that cures come from within the body itself, rather than from an external agent.",
              "So he was not looking for a curative agent but rather focused on his new find as a topical antiseptic.",
              "In later years he claimed that the difficulties he had experienced in isolating and stabilizing penicillin, let alone the problems of producing sufficient quantities for clinical trials, had prevented him from realizing the full fruits of his research.",
              "In fact, in the 1930s, little notice was taken by the scientific community of his paper published in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology (June 1929).",
              "Those few scientists who sent for samples and tried to gain more understanding of the properties of penicillin did not or could not capitalize on Fleming\u2019s discovery.",

              "Fleming published his findings in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology in June 1929, with only a passing reference to penicillin's potential therapeutic benefits.",
              "At this stage it looked as if its main application would be in isolating penicillin-insensitive bacteria from penicillin-sensitive bacteria in a mixed culture.",
              "This at least was of practical benefit to bacteriologists, and kept interest in penicillin going.",
              "Others, including Harold Raistrick, Professor of Biochemistry at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, tried to purify penicillin but failed.",
              "Back to top It was Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and their colleagues at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at Oxford University who turned penicillin from a laboratory curiosity into a life-saving drug.",
              "Their work on the purification and chemistry of penicillin began in earnest in 1939, just when wartime conditions were beginning to make research especially difficult.",
              "To carry out a program of animal experiments and clinical trials the team needed to process up to 500 liters a week of mold filtrate.",
              "They began growing it in a strange array of culture vessels such as baths, bedpans, milk churns and food tins.",
              "Later, a customized fermentation vessel was designed for ease of removing and, to save space, renewing the broth beneath the surface of the mold.",
              "A team of \"penicillin girls\" was employed, at \u00a32 a week, to inoculate and generally look after the fermentation.",
              "In effect, the Oxford laboratory was being turned into a penicillin factory.",
              "Meanwhile, biochemist Norman Heatley extracted penicillin from huge volumes of filtrate coming off the production line by extracting it into amyl acetate and then back into water, using a countercurrent system.",
              "Edward Abraham, another biochemist who was employed to help step up production, then used the newly discovered technique of alumina column chromatography to remove impurities from the penicillin prior to clinical trials.",
              "In 1940, Florey carried out vital experiments, showing that penicillin could protect mice against infection from deadly Streptococci.",
              "Then, on February 12, 1941, a 43-year old policeman, Albert Alexander, became the first recipient of the Oxford penicillin.",
              "He had scratched the side of his mouth while pruning roses, and had developed a life-threatening infection with huge abscesses affecting his eyes, face, and lungs.",
              "Penicillin was injected and within days he made a remarkable recovery.",
              "But supplies of the drug ran out and he died a few days later.",
              "Better results followed with other patients though and soon there were plans to make penicillin available for British troops on the battlefield.",
              "War-time conditions made industrial production of penicillin difficult.",
              "A number of British companies, including Glaxo (now GlaxoSmithKline) and Kemball Bishop, a London firm later bought by Pfizer, took up the challenge.",
              "Back to top Substantial amounts of penicillin would be needed for the extensive clinical trials required to confirm the promise of the early results and to provide adequate supplies of the drug for therapeutic use if it did live up to its potential.",
              "Florey recognized that large-scale production of penicillin was probably out of the question in Britain, where the chemical industry was fully absorbed in the war effort.",
              "With the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, Florey and his colleague Norman Heatley traveled to the United States in the summer of 1941 to see if they could interest the American pharmaceutical industry in the effort to produce penicillin on a large scale.",
              "Yale physiologist John Fulton helped to put his British colleagues in touch with individuals who might be able to assist them in their goal.",
              "They were referred to Robert Thom of the Department of Agriculture, a foremost mycologist and authority on the Penicillium mold, and eventually to the Department's Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL) in Peoria, Illinois, because of the expertise of its Fermentation Division.",
              "This contact proved to be crucial to the success of the project, as the NRRL was a key contributor of innovations that made large-scale production of penicillin possible.",
              "Back to top Orville May, Director of the NRRL, agreed to have the Laboratory undertake a vigorous program to increase penicillin yields under the direction of Robert Coghill, Chief of the Fermentation Division.",
              "It was agreed that Heatley would remain in Peoria to share his expertise with his American colleagues.",
              "Within a few weeks, Andrew Moyer found that he could significantly increase the yield of penicillin by substituting lactose for the sucrose used by the Oxford team in their culture medium.",
              "Shortly thereafter, Moyer made the even more important discovery that the addition of corn-steep liquor to the fermentation medium produced a ten-fold increase in yield.",
              "Corn-steep liquor was a by-product of the corn wetmilling process, and the NRRL, in an attempt to find a use for it, tried it in essentially all of its fermentation work.",
              "Later, the Peoria laboratory increased the yield of penicillin still further by the addition of penicillin precursors, such as phenylacetic acid, to the fermentation medium.",
              "It was recognized that the Oxford group's method of growing the mold on the surface of a nutrient medium was inefficient, and that growth in submerged culture would be a superior process.",
              "In submerged culture fermentation, the mold is grown in large tanks in a constantly agitated and aerated mixture, rather than just on the surface of the medium.",
              "Florey's Penicillium culture, however, produced only traces of penicillin when grown in submerged culture.",
              "Under the direction of Kenneth Raper, staff at the NRRL screened various Penicillium strains and found one that produced acceptable yields of penicillin in submerged culture.",
              "Soon a global search was underway for better penicillin producing strains, with soil samples being sent to the NRRL from around the world.",
              "Ironically, the most productive strain came from a moldy cantaloupe from a Peoria fruit market.",
              "A more productive mutant of the so-called cantaloupe strain was produced with the use of X-rays at the Carnegie Institution.",
              "When this strain was exposed to ultraviolet radiation at the University of Wisconsin, its productivity was increased still further.",
              "Back to top While Norman Heatley remained in Peoria helping the NRRL staff to get the penicillin work started, Howard Florey visited various pharmaceutical companies to try to interest them in the drug.",
              "Although Florey was disappointed in the immediate results of his trip, three of the companies (Merck, Squibb and Lilly) had actually conducted some penicillin research before Florey's arrival and Pfizer seemed on the verge of investigating the drug as well.",
              "At this time, however, the promise of penicillin was still based on only limited clinical trials.",
              "Florey next visited his old friend Alfred Newton Richards, then vice president for medical affairs at the University of Pennsylvania.",
              "More importantly, Richards was chair of the Committee on Medical Research (CMR) of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD).",
              "The OSRD had been created in June, 1941, to assure that adequate attention was given to research on scientific and medical problems relating to national defense.",
              "Richards had great respect for Florey and trusted his judgment about the potential value of penicillin.",
              "He approached the four drug firms that Florey indicated had shown some interest in the drug (Merck, Squibb, Lilly and Pfizer) and informed them that they would be serving the national interest if they undertook penicillin production and that there might be support from the federal government.",

              "Additional studies specifically targeting patients with clinical indicators of sepsis are needed to guide measures to safely reduce antimicrobial exposure in this high-risk population while preserving clinical effectiveness.",
              "Sepsis mortality has declined significantly over the past 30 years, driven largely by improvements in early recognition and standardized management approaches [1, 2].",
              "While the nuances of some management strategies in sepsis such as fluid resuscitation [3], serial laboratory monitoring [4\u20136], and corticosteroids [7, 8] are still being debated, the timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy remains an uncontested hallmark of successful sepsis treatment.",
              "Myriad studies have highlighted the value of appropriate (in vitro-active) empiric antibiotic choices in sepsis [9\u201311] and their early initiation, especially in septic shock [12\u201315], and have even led to inclusion of early antibiotic administration in national quality metrics to compare hospital performance [16, 17].",
              "However, guidance is surprisingly limited regarding the optimal duration of therapy for patients with sepsis.",
              "The current Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guideline makes a general recommendation that 7 to 10 days of antibiotic coverage is likely sufficient for most serious infections associated with sepsis and septic shock, although this course may be lengthened in some scenarios (eg, undrained foci of infection, Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and neutropenia) or shortened in others (eg, pyelonephritis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) [18].",
              "The recommendation is graded as weak, with low-quality evidence, supported specifically by data from treatment trials (predominantly in pneumonia [19\u201321], and intraabdominal [22] and urinary tract infections [23]) with limited representation of patients with sepsis and septic shock.",
              "In principle, the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy in sepsis would be one that maximizes clinical effectiveness while minimizing the antibiotic-associated risks such as toxicities, Clostridioides difficile-associated disease, and emergence of resistance, as well as health care costs.",
              "There are many host- and pathogen-specific determinants impacting the required duration of antibiotic therapy in sepsis, and extrapolation from healthier populations may be overly simplistic.",
              "Conspicuously few studies have investigated the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy in critically ill populations.",
              "Indeed, even the landmark sepsis trials which have shaped sepsis management over the last 2 decades [4\u20136, 24\u201326] did not report any specific antibiotic regimens, durations, or evidence of microbiologic cure in populations with culture-positive sepsis.",
              "As such, it is not surprising that usual care durations of antibiotic therapy for sepsis and serious infections remain highly variable [27].",
              "A survey of health care professional users of a sepsis crowdsourcing application recently revealed an average reported duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for sepsis of more than 10 days for 17%, 7\u201310 days for 40%, 5\u20137 days for 27%, and 3\u20135 days for 13% of respondents [28].",
              "The mortality risk in sepsis is substantial and the margin for error small.",
              "Bedside providers have until recently been relatively complacent with longer courses of therapy, potentially due to the false sense of security it may offer for sicker patients.",
              "However, a paradigm change has occurred in recent years [29] and the importance and need for antibiotic stewardship is well recognized across the spectrum of providers and disciplines.",
              "In a retrospective cohort study of 7118 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, Teshome et al [30] reported a 4% increased risk of de novo antibiotic resistance for each additional day of antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactam exposure, highlighting the importance of striving to determine and implement the minimum necessary duration of therapy, even in sepsis.",
              "Furthermore, recent data from Rhee et al demonstrated that among patients with culture-proven sepsis treated with adequate empiric antibiotics, treatment with overly broad-spectrum antibiotics was associated with a 20% increase in the odds of death, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of treatment of 4 (2\u20136) days for both antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactams and carbapenems [31].",
              "Given that the evidence base is currently insufficient to perform a systematic review in search of the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in sepsis, we instead provide a narrative review of the existing literature, which can be leveraged to inform the current practice of antibiotic therapy in sepsis, focusing specifically on the optimal duration rather than choice of antimicrobial therapy.",
              "The first step to determining the optimal duration of therapy in sepsis and serious infections is to understand the origins of our usual care standard.",
              "Much of our modern antibiotic prescribing practice has been based largely on expert opinion and influenced to an extent by historical lessons learned from the treatment of tuberculosis.",
              "For the latter, success was directly linked to duration and resistance could occur in setting of inappropriate dosing or monotherapy [32].",
              "Early studies in patients with cystitis noted that single-dose therapy was suboptimal compared to multiday therapy [33], establishing that most serious infection would presumably at least require multiple days of antibiotics.",
              "Regimens for acute bacterial infections evolved to prolonged courses with the rationale of reducing relapses and emergence of resistance from undertreated infections [34].",
              "However, this evolution was based on a weak evidence base (small studies, heterogenous populations, and subjective metrics for clinical response) and was often arbitrary with a peculiar penchant for 7-day increments [35].",
              "This led to many previous iterations of practice guidelines recommending iterative courses such as 1\u20132 weeks for community-acquired pneumonia [36], 2 weeks for pyelonephritis [33], and 3\u20134 weeks for bacteremia [34].",
              "Recent years have seen a consistent trend toward shorter antibiotic treatment durations for many infectious syndromes including pneumonia (community-acquired and nosocomial), cystitis, complicated urinary tract infections, intraabdominal infection, acute bacterial sinusitis, cellulitis and soft tissue infection, septic arthritis, and chronic osteomyelitis [29, 35].",

              "While a noninferiority trial design may be a reasonable means for investigating new antibiotic durations in select circumstances, it has important limitations [54, 55].",
              "Historical trial data used to establish the magnitude of the effect of standard therapy or active control (vs placebo) relies on the \u201cconstancy\u201d assumption.",
              "However, historical data may not reflect the current landscape of patient complexity and patient care practices [56].",
              "Furthermore, noninferiority of a new therapy to an active control does not necessarily confirm superiority of the new therapy over placebo, and the sample size for noninferiority trials is unfortunately often influenced by arbitrary thresholds of clinical importance and trial sponsor budget.",
              "Importantly, the majority of the antibiotic treatment duration studies either specifically excluded patients with sepsis or intensive care unit (ICU) admission or did not provide demographic information such as the frequency of sepsis diagnosis, vasopressor or ventilatory support, or severity of illness scores.",
              "Therefore, by limiting the inclusion criteria to a patient population with a lower severity of illness, the event rates for mortality or serious complications are decreased, and the trial may be biased toward noninferiority, particularly if the prespecified margin is large.",
              "Additional common exclusion criteria limiting applicability of these data include renal dysfunction, immunocompromising conditions, and recent antibiotic use, which are all relatively common in real-world critically ill populations.",
              "There is a notable lack of trials on the duration of antibiotic therapy in sepsis.",
              "As previously mentioned, none of the landmark sepsis trials which have shaped current sepsis management [4\u20136, 24\u201326] reported any specific antibiotic regimens, durations, or microbiologic data.",
              "The PROWESS [24] and PROWESS-SHOCK [25] protocol did not call for any standardized approach to critical care management, including antibiotics, and no data were provided on the frequency, classes, or duration of prescribed antibiotics.",
              "Later, the ACCESS [26] and ProCESS [4] trials only reported high rates of \u201cappropriate antibiotic administration,\u201d and ARISE [6] reported a median time to antibiotic administration of 70 and 67 minutes in their experimental and control groups, respectively.",
              "Furthermore, critically ill patients are underrepresented in trials evaluating the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in organ-specific infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections.",
              "In the absence of truly representative data, we must ask ourselves 2 questions: Do sicker patients in fact warrant longer courses of antibiotics?",
              "And is it reasonable to extend the findings of studies in patients with infection to those with sepsis?",
              "Infection is necessary but not sufficient for the definition of sepsis.",
              "Due to the complexity of organ dysfunction in sepsis, observed morbidity does not bear a linear relationship with microbial burden, and the risk of mortality is not entirely mitigated by optimal antimicrobial management.",
              "Unfortunately, relatively few trials have been conducted specifically in the critically ill or in serious infections with a high likelihood of systemic manifestations.",
              "One example is the aforementioned Chastre et al study of antibiotic duration in VAP [19].",
              "Inclusion criteria required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours, and approximately one-third of the patients received vasopressor support.",
              "The authors found 8 days of antibiotics to be noninferior to 15 days with regard to all-cause mortality and infection recurrence, which greatly changed treatment guidelines [21, 57, 58].",
              "Although it should be noted that here, too, exclusion criteria included a simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II) greater than 65 (which correlates to approximately 75% mortality), and immunocompromising conditions such as neutropenia, AIDS, and immunosuppressant or long-term corticosteroid therapy.",
              "Yahav et al [44] conducted an open-label noninferiority study of hospitalized patients with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia receiving 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy.",
              "The noninferiority margin was met;",
              "however, the mean baseline sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was lower than would be expected in gram-negative BSI in both groups.",
              "Additionally, in order to be randomized at day 7, the patients in this study had to be clinically stable, thus there were no patients in shock or mechanical ventilation at that time, and these frequencies were not reported at presentation.",
              "More specific to the critically ill population, Daneman et al [43] have published a pilot study of bacteremic ICU patients with high median APACHE II scores (22;",
              "IQR, 18\u201326) and vasopressor support (52%), in which they demonstrated feasibility and good adherence to the study protocol.",
              "We anxiously await the results of their complete randomized controlled trial appropriately powered to examine the 7 vs 14 day treatment duration in bacteremic shock for noninferiority in the primary outcome of 90-day mortality and several relevant secondary outcomes.",
              "Logically, it seems safer to discontinue antibiotics earlier in septic patients who demonstrate clinical stability by the time culture results are available compared to those who remain unstable.",
              "However, given the limited data in critically ill patients on this topic to date, there are several important factors to be considered before routinely accepting shorter antibiotic courses, even for clinically stable septic patients.",
              "Some of these will be examined below.",
              "In multiple treatment guidelines, severity of illness is used as a tool to guide the choice and timing of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen whereas recommendations on ultimate duration are based on the organism cultured and the primary organ-system involved [21, 48, 59].",
              "However, in clinical practice, allowance is often given for the patient to demonstrate signs of clinical improvement before an ultimate duration is chosen, which itself predisposes to longer treatment durations associated with greater severity of illness [60].",
              "The 2019 CAP guidelines\u2019 recommendation on duration states that most patients should be treated for a minimum of 5 days, with discontinuation at that point considered only if the patient has been achieved clinical stability [48].",
              "However, the authors endorse longer courses for pneumonia complicated by deep-seated infections as well as less common organisms not covered by the guideline (eg, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and endemic fungi).",
              "Interestingly, Aliberti et al [61] evaluated whether the 2005 recommendations (similar to those above) were utilized by treating physicians to tailor duration of therapy based upon disease severity or clinical response.",

              "Significantly, time to clinical stability was not associated with total length of therapy, but it was associated with the duration of intravenous therapy.",
              "This is likely related to sicker patients spending longer in the hospital, during which time the default route of administration is generally intravenous.",
              "Interestingly, while severity of illness scores were not associated with length of therapy, surrogate markers including admission to the ICU, hypotension, and acidemia were associated with significantly longer durations.",
              "Earlier transition to oral step-down therapy was also found to be safe in a recent observational study of patients with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia who attained clinical stability by day 5 [62].",
              "As such, there is not a clear-cut association between severity of illness and required length of therapy, but providers appear to have more confidence in transitioning to oral therapy earlier in less severely ill patients.",
              "Source control of septic foci has long been recognized as a key intervention in the nonantimicrobial management of sepsis [63\u201365], and typically refers to procedures such as draining infected fluid collections, debriding infected tissues, removing infected devices or foreign materials, and correction of anatomic abnormalities which either predispose to microbial contamination or reduce antimicrobial exposure.",
              "On a macroscopic level, these procedures reduce microbial burden and facilitate antibiotic penetration into sequestered sites, which could otherwise serve as reservoirs of persistent infection and acquisition of drug resistance.",
              "The importance of source control is weighted in the SSC guidelines as a best practice statement, with emphasis on early implementation as soon as medically and logistically feasible [18].",
              "Inability to achieve control of a known source is an accepted indication for extending duration of therapy, and indeed nearly all trials of shortened treatment durations have explicitly excluded patients with an uncontrolled source or those requiring active drainage.",
              "Expanding on the traditional concept of source control, there is now evidence that the immunologic milieu of sepsis results in an immune dysregulated state characterized by an inability to clear septic foci, as well as widespread lymphocyte apoptosis, reduced inflammatory cytokine production, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections [66, 67].",
              "An autopsy study of 235 ICU patients with sepsis or septic shock demonstrated an unresolved septic focus in nearly 80% of subjects [68].",
              "This suggests that even in patients lacking an overt uncontrolled source of infection, there may yet be occult foci.",
              "The precise clinical impact of this finding is not known, but may be most significant in patients with prolonged critical illness, increased age, and comorbidities associated with increased infection risk such as diabetes mellitus, and further question our ability to extrapolate what is optimal antibiotic duration from studies on healthier patients [69, 70].",
              "Additional evidence of this sepsis-induced immunosuppression includes the high rate of reactivation of cytomegalovirus in otherwise immune competent patients [71] as well as documented secondary infections with relatively lower-virulence organisms [72, 73].",
              "Numerous observational studies of detailed immunophenotyping in septic patients have been published in the last decade [74\u201377], but these have not yet been correlated to treatment outcomes.",
              "Due to the paucity of clinical data in this arena, it is not clear whether the relative immunosuppression of sepsis could limit the efficacy of shortened antibiotic treatment durations, but it is a host factor worth considering while deciding when to discontinue antibiotics until additional evidence is available.",

              ", notably P.",
              "aeruginosa, have been long recognized as a difficult-to-treat pathogen.",
              "This is largely due to many intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms as well as a predilection for high-risk hosts, which can make eradication very difficult.",
              "Indeed, P.",
              "aeruginosa infections are associated with substantial mortality risk [78], and clinical decision making often changes when faced with these infections compared with other organisms. For example, following the landmark trial by Chastre et al, which has been previously discussed, standard treatment duration for VAP was reduced from 2 weeks to just 8 days for most patients [19].",
              "However, due to a high rate of relapse from nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (predominantly P.",

              "Indeed the potential recurrence of infection must be weighed against the probable development of resistance with additional antibiotic exposure, leading some providers to adhere to the short course recommendation for sensitive organisms and lean toward longer courses when multidrug resistance is present [79].",

              ", Stenotrophomonas spp.",
              ", Enterobacteriaceae, and even the yeast Candida present a clinical challenge due to their propensity to form biofilm and seeding of secondary infection sites, which can induce antimicrobial tolerance and impair eradication.",
              "Treatment of sepsis due to gram-negative pathogens harboring difficult-to-treat resistance (ie, resistance to all first-line high-efficacy, low-toxicity antibiotics, namely \u03b2-lactams [including carbapenems] and fluoroquinolones) [82], necessitates use of second- and third-line agents such as polymyxins, aminoglycosides, and tigecycline or newer agents yet to be studied specifically in sepsis such as ceftazidime/avibactam.",
              "Guidance is limited for optimal duration of therapy for such infections and difficult-to-treat resistance is a poor prognostic marker.",
              "Consequently, most providers currently err on the side of longer courses for these infections.",
              "Furthermore, given the complexity of the patients who contract highly resistant pathogens, a detailed consideration of all host, pathogen, source, clinical response trajectories, and treatment-related factors are needed to define an adequate course for these complicated infections.",
              "The success of a defined antimicrobial course in sepsis is contingent not only on the in vitro activity of the designated agent against the pathogen and the adequacy of source control, but also on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties such as the ability to provide an appropriate and reliable dose of the antibiotic that yields therapeutic drug levels in the blood and other affected infection sites.",
              "Unfortunately, in the critically ill population, there are numerous competing factors that may impact effective dosing, including increased or decreased renal blood flow, organ dysfunction (particularly renal and hepatic), changing volume of distribution, and initiation of mechanical support devices such as continuous renal replacement therapy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.",
              "Although the bactericidal property of the antibiotic has been traditionally considered an important factor in treatment success against serious infections, a recent meta-analysis of 56 trials suggest there may be no intrinsic advantage of bactericidal over bacteriostatic agents and that drug dosing and other pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties may be more important drivers of efficacy [83].",
              "For these reasons and many others, critical care pharmacists are a crucial resource when designing an effective antimicrobial regimen for septic patients [84, 85].",
              "Please refer to the article by Tam et al in this Supplement for additional information on the topic [86].",
              "The prevalence and phenotypes of immunocompromising conditions have increased over the last several decades and may increase susceptibility to sepsis from a variety of typical or opportunistic infections, which may warrant specific management strategies.",
              "However, neutropenia particularly increases vulnerability to serious acute infections and sepsis, and notably increases morbidity and mortality risk.",
              "Roughly half of neutropenic fever episodes may be complicated by sepsis or septic shock, with an attendant mortality of 35% to 50% [87].",
              "According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America neutropenic fever guidelines, for patients with a clinically or microbiologically documented infection, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be given at least until resolution of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count > 500 cells/mm3) or longer if clinically necessary.",
              "In some instances, if an appropriate treatment course has been completed prior to resolution of neutropenia, patients may resume oral prophylaxis until marrow recovery [88].",
              "They make no specific recommendations for duration of antimicrobial regimens based upon disease severity.",
              "Interestingly, the 2017 study by Aguilar-Guisado et al [42] challenged the dogma of continuing antimicrobials in neutropenic fever until neutrophil recovery.",
              "In patients with neutropenic fever without a microbiologic diagnosis of infection, discontinuation of empiric antibiotics after 72 hours without fever resulted in no difference in mean fever days or all-cause mortality.",

              "Culture-negative sepsis poses a number of its own unique issues with regard to antimicrobial management.",
              "First, we emphasize that a large proportion of patients (17% in 1 study) admitted with an initial clinical diagnosis of sepsis in whom a pathogen is not ultimately identified are subsequently found to have a sepsis \u201cmimic\u201d (another noninfectious etiology for their illness) and do not require antibiotic therapy [89].",
              "Restricting our discussion to those patients with true culture-negative sepsis (due to antecedent antibiotics, low culture sensitivity, fastidious organisms, lack of molecular diagnostic testing available, etc.)",
              ", multiple studies have documented approximately a third of sepsis cases as culture negative [24, 90, 91].",
              "Based on recent estimates of national sepsis incidence [2], this could account for over 500 000 cases annually, meaning that earlier discontinuation of antibiotics in culture-negative sepsis is likely to have a tremendous reduction in patient and population-level antibiotic pressure.",
              "However, determining appropriate antimicrobial management in these patients is a challenge.",
              "Without an organism against which to direct therapy, treatment courses tend to remain broad and there is no clear guidance for discontinuation.",
              "A large multicenter retrospective cohort study by Kethireddy et al [91] recently reported that culture-positive vs negative sepsis have similar survival, which is contingent on timely administration of appropriate antibiotics.",
              "However, the authors did not report on mean duration of antibiotic therapy prescribed or frequency of de-escalation from empiric regimen.",
              "In a separate single-center retrospective study, Lockhart et al investigated the duration of antibiotic treatment received by culture-negative sepsis survivors [60].",
              "Groups were stratified into less than or equal to 3 days, 4 to 7 days, and greater than 7 days.",
              "Greater severity of illness (as measured by APACHE II scores, Charlson comorbidity index, and mechanical ventilatory support) was associated with increasing duration of treatment.",

              "These data support an organ systems-based approach to antibiotic duration in culture-negative sepsis.",
              "The SSC guidelines do not provide a specific recommendation of a defined duration for treatment of culture-negative sepsis.",
              "However, close scrutiny of host and disease characteristics and trajectories of fever, vasopressor dependence, biomarkers, etc.",
              "may guide whether a patient may be a reasonable candidate for a duration of therapy shorter than the standard, albeit not evidence-based, 7- to 10-day recommendation for all patients with sepsis [18].",
              "If the data regarding shortened duration of therapy inadequately address critically ill populations, antimicrobial de-escalation may be another tactic to reduce the adverse effects associated with prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic use.",
              "The SSC guidelines endorse de-escalation for patients initially prescribed multiple agents (ie, combination therapy) once the patient\u2019s condition has improved and/or cultures become available, and recommend for all septic patients that potential for de-escalation be assessed daily [18].",
              "In order to evaluate the evidence behind this practice, Tabah et al published a systematic review and meta-analysis of antimicrobial de-escalation specifically in septic ICU patients [92].",
              "While the definition of de-escalation varied over the 14 included studies, all studies described a narrowing of the spectrum of coverage.",
              "Thirteen studies de-escalated by decreasing the number of prescribed antimicrobials and 4 included a shortening of the duration of therapy.",

              "Pertinently, infection with a multidrug-resistant organism significantly reduced the likelihood of de-escalation in several studies, as did polymicrobial infection and infections with a risk of undiagnosed pathogens (eg, IAI).",
              "Similarly, a prospective cohort study by Salahuddin and colleagues [93] found that failure to de-escalate was predicted by SAPS II score, hematologic malignancy, and isolation of multidrug-resistant organisms. None of the 14 studies reported worsened survival with de-escalation, and in the pooled mortality analysis provided there was a protective effect of de-escalation (relative risk, 0.",

              "Interestingly, de-escalation was not associated with decreased duration of therapy, although 1 study did report fewer days of antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactam and broad-spectrum gram-positive antibiotics associated with de-escalation [94].",
              "Indeed, a recently published European position statement discussed the conflicting data regarding de-escalation and duration of therapy [95].",
              "Much of the difficulty in interpretation comes from the preponderance of observational study designs (that bias de-escalation towards better outcome as it tends to occur in patients who are already doing better) and the variable definitions of de-escalation used by investigators.",
              "Based upon the current data it seems that de-escalation and duration should be assessed separately, as they may have overlapping but unique roles in antimicrobial stewardship efforts.",
              "Procalcitonin has been the most extensively studied biomarker for use in the diagnosis of bacterial infections and guidance of antibiotic therapy.",
              "Procalcitonin is a short-lived hormone (precursor to calcitonin) that is rapidly induced by the inflammatory cytokines associated with bacterial infection.",
              "The short half-life of procalcitonin and the correlation of its kinetics with the intensity of stimulus are desirable properties for any candidate biomarker to guide both the initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy in septic patients [96].",
              "A comprehensive discussion on this topic can be found in the article by Gilbert et al in this Supplement [97], but we will highlight a few salient points with regard to antimicrobial duration.",
              "Several large, multicenter trials have now been conducted in ICU populations: Procalcitonin to Reduce Antibiotic Treatments in Acutely Ill Patients (PRORATA) [98], Procalcitonin Guided Antibiotic Rational Decision Making in ICU Patients (ProGUARD) [99], and Stop Antibiotics on Procalcitonin Guidance Study (SAPS) [100].",
              "In a meta-analysis of these 3 trials and 7 others, procalcitonin-guided patients had shorter antibiotic courses compared to controls, with no adverse impact on mortality or ICU length of stay [101].",
              "However, a recent meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials reported that decreased antibiotic utilization associated with procalcitonin-guided antibiotic discontinuation in critically ill patients represented low-certainty evidence with a high risk of bias and was primarily observed in studies without high protocol adherence and in those with algorithms combining procalcitonin and C-reactive protein [102].",
              "The SSC guidelines [18] rank procalcitonin use to decrease antibiotic duration in sepsis as a weak recommendation with uncertain risk-benefit profile limiting its universal adoption for antibiotic discontinuation in sepsis across US hospitals and providers today.",
              "The evidence regarding optimal antimicrobial treatment strategies for sepsis is conspicuously lacking and thus guideline recommendations remain necessarily vague despite universal acceptance of the importance of antibiotics.",
              "Unfortunately, retrospective and observational studies are significantly limited in their capacity to accurately capture the full treatment course of antimicrobials prescribed for sepsis (eg, outpatient administration of intravenous antibiotics, transfer to subacute rehabilitation centers to complete courses of therapy, and de-escalation to oral regimens), contributing to the incomplete data on this topic.",
              "There are a handful of on-going trials investigating treatment duration for some of the clinical syndromes associated with sepsis that are addressed here, but high-quality studies in this clinically heterogenous syndrome will remain difficult to conduct.",

              "This feat, along with other transplants and his research on the use of irradiation and then drugs to prevent the rejection of introduced organs, ushered in a new era in medicine and won him a share of a Nobel prize in 1990.",
              "Murray died on 26 November at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.",
              "He was born in 1919 in Milford, also in Massachusetts.",
              "After leaving high school, he went to the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1940, and then on to Harvard Medical School in Boston.",
              "He joined the army after a brief internship at the Peter Bent Brigham hospital (later called the Brigham and Women's Hospital), and was sent to Valley Forge Hospital in Pennsylvania.",
              "At the time, Valley Forge was dedicated to the care of injured soldiers returning from the Second World War.",
              "While at Valley Forge, Murray was involved in the treatment of burn victims. This often involved grafting skin \u2014 usually from the patients themselves, but sometimes from dead donors.",
              "Murray returned to Brigham to complete his general surgical residency after being discharged from the army in 1947.",
              "In 1954, he was appointed to the hospital staff as a general and plastic surgeon.",
              "In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Brigham was a hive of activity in kidney transplantation.",
              "Two surgeons there, David Hume and Charles Hufnagel, had been transplanting kidneys in dogs.",
              "Hume had done several transplants using kidneys from deceased donors, and one of the introduced kidneys had survived for six months.",
              "Murray had been fascinated with transplantation since his work at Valley Forge, and when Hume was drafted during the Korean War, Murray took over the surgical laboratories at Brigham.",
              "While Murray was exploring ways to suppress people's immune systems using treatments that involved irradiating their entire bodies, a 23-year-old patient called Richard Herrick was admitted to Brigham for dialysis, under the care of John Merrill.",
              "Richard was dying from chronic nephritis, a kidney disease.",
              "After Merrill learned that Richard had a twin, he, Murray and the hospital's chief of urology, Hartwell Harrison, discussed the possibility (and ethics) of transplanting a kidney from Richard's healthy brother, Ronald.",
              "Birth records confirmed that the twins had once been connected to the same placenta, and a skin graft from Ronald to Richard proved successful.",
              "Meanwhile, the Boston police department confirmed that the twins' fingerprints were identical.",
              "On 23 December 1954, Harrison and his team removed a kidney from Ronald.",
              "Murray then implanted it into Richard.",
              "The kidney functioned immediately.",
              "After Richard left the hospital, he married his nurse, fathered two children and lived in good health for eight years before dying from a recurrence of his original renal disease in the transplanted kidney.",
              "In the years that followed, Murray did more transplants in identical twins.",
              "He hoped to establish a way to transfer organs between non-identical individuals and also did some kidney transplants using deceased donors, irradiating the patients' bodies to suppress their immune system.",
              "With one exception, these early transplants failed, mainly because the irradiation slowed or stopped the bone marrow's production of white blood cells, which in turn led to infection.",
              "Then in 1959, Robert Schwartz and William Dameshek, haematologists at the New England Medical Center (now Tufts Medical Center) in Boston, showed that an anticancer drug called 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), produced by Gertrude Elion and George Hitchings at the Wellcome Research Laboratories in New York, could prevent rabbits from producing antibodies in response to a foreign protein.",
              "The drug also prolonged the survival of foreign skin grafts between rabbits.",
              "Soon after this, Roy Calne, a young surgical trainee at London's Royal Free Hospital, and Charles Zukoski and Hume, now chief of surgery at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, showed that 6-MP could prolong the survival of kidney transplants in dogs.",
              "In 1960, just as Murray was planning to switch the focus of his lab work from irradiation to 6-MP, Calne was awarded a Harkness Scholarship to join Murray's laboratory at Brigham.",
              "By then, Elion and Hitchings had produced a derivative of 6-MP, called azathioprine.",
              "They gave some to Calne, who had visited their lab on his way to Boston.",
              "Using azathioprine, Murray, Calne and other research fellows were able to dramatically improve the success of kidney transplants in dogs, and the field of organ transplantation exploded.",
              "The drug was first used in human kidney transplantation in 1963.",
              "Murray retired from the transplant programme in 1971.",
              "He remained chief of plastic surgery at the Brigham and Women's hospital until 1986, and was also chief of plastic surgery at the Boston Children's Hospital from 1972 to 1985.",
              "He corrected various craniofacial deformities in children, with some remarkably successful outcomes.",
              "In 1990, Murray was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (along with Donnall Thomas) for his transplantation work.",

              "Today, clinical applications of xenotransplantation primarily involve the use of xenogeneic extracellular matrix rather than intact xenogeneic cells or tissues, because intact material induces strong adaptive and innate immune responses as a result of xenogeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC), other membrane proteins, and glycans.",

              "5 In contrast to immune recognition of components of transplanted xenogeneic tissues and organs that result in failure of organ xenotransplantation, extracellular matrixes are now known to have strong immunomodulatory properties that favor constructive tissue and organ remodeling.",

              "20,21 These tissue mimics provide realistic models for the study of development and serve as in vitro screening systems, but direct clinical application of organoids for tissue repair is limited by their size (which is on the order of millimeters), their avascular nature, and difficulties in reliably controlling differentiation into specific tissues.",

              "38 Several such transgenes have been tested, although not systematically, over the past decade, and the proteins they encode fall into three categories: immune cloaking, whereby specific transgenic proteins interfere with killing by natural killer (NK) or T cells, and complement humanization and coagulation humanization, in which specific elements of the human complement or human coagulation pathways are used instead of or in addition to porcine counterparts.",

              "Sometimes, one can first use PCA to reduce the dimension of the data, and then use clustering to group the subjects.",
              "On the other hand, supervised learning considers the subjects\u2019 outcomes together with their traits, and goes through a certain training process to determine the best outputs associated with the inputs that are closest to the outcomes on average.",
              "Usually, the output formulations vary with the outcomes of interest.",

              "[59] Large, government-sponsored national initiatives are being pursued to identify patterns among individuals tracked for health care-related phenomena that might be useful in clinical and public health practices in the future, such as the UK Biobank initiative in the United Kingdom and the \u2018All-of-Us\u2019 study in the United States.",
              "[60, 61] These studies raise important questions about the ethics, legal and social implications of aggregating data on individual patients for the purposes of benefitting individuals who may need focused care going forward.",
              "[61] Implicit in the P0-P4 personalized medicine translational workflow that has common elements with the T0-T4 drug and health product development workflow (Figure 2), is the suggestion that what is important for these workflows to function properly is to make sure the transitions from each stage of the workflow are eased and enabled.",
              "This can be difficult since the expertise and technologies needed at each stage are very different, often leading to their independent pursuit.",
              "However, emerging strategies and concepts in the way personalized medicine is practiced, coupled with the use of AI techniques, could lead to more holistic and efficient ways of treating individual patients that run through the entire P0-P4 workflow.",
              "[6] Thus, the ideal setting for personalized medicine and health care is one in which the diagnoses, treatment and follow-up monitoring of individual patients is streamlined into a single process with very smooth and coordinated transitions from one relevant activity or sub-process to another.",
              "A good paradigm for this involves the creation of cell replacement therapies for a wide variety of conditions.",
              "[62, 63] Thus, for example, in certain immunotherapeutic-oriented cell replacement therapies for cancer, a patient\u2019s tumor is profiled for the existence of unique \u2018neo-antigens\u2019 or mutations that might attract the host\u2019s own immune system to attack cells harboring those mutations.",
              "If such neo-antigens are found, then cells from either a donor (allogeneic transplantation) or from the patient him or herself (autologous transplantation) are harvested and sensitized to recognize the neo-antigens.",
              "The basic idea is that these cells will attract the host\u2019s immune cells towards the tumor cells harboring the neo-antigens when introduced into the patient\u2019s body.",
              "[62, 63] Since the creation and manufacture of the cells cannot be pursued in advance of knowing what neo-antigens are present in the patient\u2019s tumor, they must be created in near real time.",
              "The production of treatments in real-time based on the patient\u2019s unique and immediate needs is termed the \u2018magistral\u2019 production of treatments, as opposed to the traditional or \u2018officinal\u2019 production of treatments.",
              "[29, 30] Magistral production of drugs is likely to be a reality for personalized medicine in many settings, even beyond cancer, since it would be too difficult to anticipate all the treatments (e.",
              "g., cells sensitive to every neo-antigen profile) and stockpile them for use in the future, as is assumed in the case with the officinal production of treatments.",
              "To advance and generalize this concept of the magistral production of personalized medicine treatments, one could imagine leveraging AI-powered robotics technologies to enable the efficient and precise manufacture of relevant treatments.",
              "[64] 3D printing of treatments also has the potential to facilitate the real-time production of treatments in near real time, as the first US FDA-approval for a 3D printed drug was made in 2015.",
              "[65] One could also envision the immediate conduct of N-of-1 trials involving AI-based pattern discovery with sophisticated treatment outcome monitoring devices after a treatment has been crafted to assess its impact on the patient.",
              "[33, 51, 66] Further, one could potentially exploit AI-based simulation studies to anticipate directions that a treatment strategy might take.",
              "[67] There are many limitations to the use of AI in the development of personalized medicines.",
              "We briefly discuss some of the more salient issues.",
              "First, there is an argument that many big data analyses that combine information on many individuals to identify patterns that reflect population-level relationships between data points do not get at important individual-level relationships.",
              "[68] This potential lack of \u2018ergodicity\u2019 could result in models that are not useful for making individual treatment decisions.",
              "For example, in terms of identifying trends in a target individual\u2019s health data that could indicate a health status change for that target individual based on data collected on a large number of individuals, as more data points are collected on each individual, any predictions of the target individual\u2019s heath trajectory should rely more on the legacy data points on that target individual and less on the population level data.",
              "[69] Sensitizing AI techniques to this fact is crucial for advancing personalized medicine.",
              "Second, there is a need to vet or test the utility of health care products rooted in AI.",
              "This is motivated by the inconsistent results observed with the use of some AI or big data based health care products, such as IBM\u2019s Watson treatment decision support system.",
              "[70, 71] Testing such systems via traditional randomized clinical trials has been discussed in the literature, and some AI-based decision support tools have in fact been shown to pass muster in bona fide clinical trials.",
              "[72] A potential need for vetting, for example, AI-based decision support products, like IBM\u2019s Watson, is that if the underlying system\u2019s decision making capability is trained on an incomplete or biased data set, then the recommendations or predictions it provides are likely to be unreliable.",
              "A rather infamous case of this involves Google\u2019s system for prediction flu outbreaks.",
              "[73] In addition, in the context of basket trials, in which the underlying scheme for matching drugs to patient profiles is being tested, if the scheme is shown not work better than standard of care or an alternative way of matching drugs to patient profiles, then a couple of questions could be raised.",
              "It could be that the drugs are ineffective, or some subset are ineffective, essentially negatively impacting the overall performance of the matching scheme.",
              "Alternatively, it could be that the drugs work, but simply are not matched properly to the patient profiles;",
              "i.",
              "e., the matching algorithm or scheme is simply wrong.",
              "These questions were raised in the context of the SHIVA trial \u2013 a bucket trail in which the drug matching scheme was shown not to benefit the patients any more than legacy ways of treating patients.",
              "[74] Third, it may be that the best way to vet at least decision support tools, is not to test them in randomized clinical trials, but rather to implement them in learning systems in which the decision support rules or algorithms are continuously updated.",
              "[66, 75\u201378] However, this would not only require a lack of bias in the initial data sets used to seed the learning system in order to ensure generalizable results, but could also take a lengthy time period for the system to evolve into a system with accurate and reliable decision making.",
              "Fourth, many AI-based decision support products leverage deep learning and neural network-based algorithms. Such algorithms can produce very reliable predictions if a large enough training set is used, but the connections between the inputs (i.",
              "e., data) and the outputs (predictions) can be very hard to understand.",
              "Thus, the \u2018Black Box\u2019 problem associated with many AI-based tools can be problematic and lead to a lack of confidence or sense of trepidation about relying on the predictions in the real world where real lives are at stake.",
              "[79] In addition, not all AI techniques are designed to identify causal relationships between various input and outputs, but rather mere associations or predictions (i.",
              "e., focus on correlation and not causation).",
              "[80] This may suffice if the goal is to develop accurate predictions, but if the goal is to, e.",
              "g., identify a drug target that, when modulated, leads to a desired effect, then identifying causal relationships is crucial.",
              "The future contributions of AI in advancing personalized medicine are likely to be very pronounced, as this chapter makes clear.",
              "Not only will there be greater adoption of AI-based health products but such products could be developed and exploit emerging computing capabilities such as quantum computing[81, 82] to achieve increased speed and an ability to handle larger and larger data sets.",
              "These larger data sets are likely to derive from better and more sophisticated monitoring health monitoring devices which can be used to gather data to seed and key off for the development of more reliable predictions.",
              "[83] In addition to exploiting greater speed and computational efficiency, AI-based health products and tools will likely incorporate greater understanding of biology in their formulations in the future.",
              "Thus, the discovery of simple input/output relationships among data points that has been focus of a great deal of AI, machine learning and statistical analysis research, could be pursued with constraints that are known to govern phenomena of relevance (e.",
              "g., known biophysical constraints involving the production of metabolites in a biochemical pathway, first principles having to do with Watson-Crick base pairing, etc.)",
              ".",
              "[84, 85] Finally, as a closing note, much of the use of AI in the development of personalized medicines is focused on the treatment of individuals with overt disease: identifying the underlying pathology, determining which interventions might make most sense to provide given what is known about that pathology and the mechanism of action of the intervention, and testing to see if the intervention works.",
              "Thus, the vast majority of AI-based products and tools used in advancing personalized medicine focus on the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of individuals.",
              "This makes sense as there is a great need for advances and efficiency gains in treating patients given the costs of current treatments, especially in the context of cancer.",
              "However, the application of AI to disease prevention is gaining a great deal of attention and traction.",
              "For example, AI and machine learning techniques have been shown to be useful in the development of \u2018polygenic risk scores\u2019 that can be used to identify individuals with an elevated genetic risk for disease that could be monitored more closely.",
              "[86\u201388] In addition, by combining insights into genetic predisposition to disease with continuous monitoring to identify early signs of disease, one could potentially stop diseases in their tracks before complicated treatments are needed for fulminant forms of the disease manifest.",
              "[89, 90] Such monitoring could be greatly enhanced by applying AI techniques to novel sensors.",
              "[91, 92] Ultimately, enthusiasm for leveraging AI techniques is not likely to slow down any time soon.",
              "AI is likely to impact virtually every industry, from manufacturing, to sales and marketing, to banking, to transportation.",
              "All of these industries can obviously be improved with AI playing an important role in the needed innovations.",
              "The health care industry is no less likely to benefit from AI, as this chapter has made clear, as long as appropriate integration and vetting occurs.",

              "Developing Custom AI Language Models to Interpret Chest X-Rays",
              "Northwestern Medicine scientists have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can interpret chest X-rays with accuracy rivaling that of a human radiologist for some conditions, according to findings published in JAMA Network Open.",
              "Jonathan Huang, a student in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP), was the first author of the study.",
              "While the recent boom in AI technology has seen attempts to apply generalist AI models to clinical settings, the lack of medical AI tools built from the ground up inspired Huang to help develop a generative AI model that could assist radiologists in busy emergency departments and provide guidance to physicians working in clinics lacking an on-call radiologist, he said.",
              "\u201cWe wanted to leverage our clinical expertise as well as our experience building clinically integrated AI tools to tackle this problem using our own institutional data,\u201d said Huang, who conducted the study in the laboratory of Mozziyar Etemadi, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Anesthesiology and of Biomedical Engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering.",
              "\u201cAnd we built a model that interprets X-rays and complements physician expertise in interpreting medical images by automatically generating text reports from images to help speed clinical workflows and improve efficiency.",
              "\u201d In the study, investigators used 900,000 chest X-rays and radiologist reports to train an AI model to generate a report for each image, describing relevant clinical findings and their significance in the exact same language and style as a radiologist.",
              "Then, investigators had the model interpret 500 chest X-rays taken from an emergency department at Northwestern Medicine and compared the AI reports to those from the radiologists and teleradiologists who originally interpreted the images.",
              "\u201cWe wanted to evaluate the AI model\u2019s efficacy in the emergency department setting, which often lacks onsite radiologists who can help advise emergency physicians as they\u2019re seeing patients,\u201d Huang said.",
              "\u201cThis is a very real clinical use-case where you could imagine an AI model complementing human decision-making.",
              "\u201d Then, five board-certified emergency medicine physicians rated the AI report of each X-ray on a scale of one to five, with five indicating that they agreed with the AI model\u2019s interpretation and no further changes to wording were necessary.",
              "The reviewing physicians found that the AI model was able to accurately flag X-rays with concerning clinical findings and generate a high-quality report on the image, according to the study.",
              "Moreover, the study found no difference in accuracy between AI and radiologist reports for all evaluated pathologies, including life-threatening conditions such as pneumothorax and pneumonia.",
              "The study found that the sensitivity and specificity of the AI reports for detecting any abnormality, relative to the on-site radiologists, was 84 and 98 percent, respectively.",
              "The original reports from teleradiologists had a sensitivity of 91 percent and specificity of 97 percent for the same task, according to the study.",
              "In a few cases, the AI model was able to identify findings that were missed by human radiologists.",
              "In one instance, the AI model identified a pulmonary infiltrate in an X-ray which had not been caught by human radiologists, according to the study.",
              "\u201cWhen we compared our AI-generated reports to reports that our own in-house radiologists documented, as well as reports that teleradiologists helped provide offsite, we found that our AI reports performed at the same level of clinical accuracy and quality as radiologist reports while providing quality benefits over the teleradiologist reports,\u201d Huang said.",
              "To his knowledge, Etemadi said, this is the first time an AI language model has been used to generate a qualitative report of chest X-rays.",
              "Previous studies have used limited AI models to classify image types, but never to holistically interpret medical imagery, he said.",
              "\u201cIf you look at AI tools in radiology, they\u2019ve usually been very single purpose, including ones that we\u2019ve previously developed,\u201d Etemadi said.",
              "\u201cFor example, an AI model that looks at a mammogram and can detect whether or not cancer is present.",
              "But in this case, our AI model is telling clinicians everything about an image and giving all the diagnoses, and it can outperform some doctors, basically.",
              "\u201d Building off the initial success with the X-ray AI model, Huang and Etemadi will now work to train the model to read MRIs, ultrasounds and CAT scans, Etemadi said.",
              "The AI tool may also be helpful for clinics in areas experiencing a shortage of healthcare professionals and radiologists, Etemadi said.",
              "\u201cWe want this to be the radiologist\u2019s best assistant, and hope it takes the drudgery out of their work,\u201d Etemadi said.",
              "\u201cWe already have started a small pilot study having radiologists evaluate what using this tool in real-time could look like.",

He took some pus from cowpox lesions on the hands of a young milkmaid, Sarah Nelms, and scratched it into the skin of eight-year old James Phipps. After a few days of mild illness, James recovered sufficiently for Jenner to inoculate the boy with matter from a smallpox blister. James did not develop smallpox, nor did any of the people he came into close contact with."
