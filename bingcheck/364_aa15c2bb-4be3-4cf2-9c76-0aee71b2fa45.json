    "response": "Braille is a system of writing and reading for blind people that uses raised dots to represent letters, numbers, punctuation marks and other symbols. Braille was invented by **Louis Braille**, a Frenchman who lost his sight as a result of a childhood accident[^4^]. He based his system on a code of 12 dots called **night writing**, which was developed by **Charles Barbier**, a French soldier who served in Napoleon's army[^1^] [^2^] [^5^]. Braille simplified the code by reducing the number of dots to six and arranging them in a cell that could be felt by one fingertip[^2^] [^4^]. He published his system in 1829 and later added symbols for music, mathematics and other fields[^4^].\n\nBraille is significant because it allows blind people to access written information and express themselves in writing. Braille also helps blind people learn spelling, grammar, punctuation and other aspects of language that are not easily conveyed by speech or audio[^3^]. Braille has impacted the lives of visually impaired individuals around the world by enabling them to pursue education, employment, hobbies and cultural enrichment[^3^]. Braille is widely used in books, magazines, signs, labels, menus, maps and many other formats. Braille is also compatible with modern technology such as computers, smartphones and braille displays[^4^].",

              "The braille equivalent of paper and pencil is the slate and stylus.",
              "This consists of a slate or template with evenly spaced depressions for the dots of braille cells, and a stylus for creating the individual braille dots.",
              "With paper placed in the slate, tactile dots are made by pushing the pointed end of the stylus into the paper over the depressions.",
              "The paper bulges on its reverse side forming dots.",
              "Because of they are inexpensive and portable, the slate and stylus are especially helpful for carrying to jot quick notes and for labeling such things as file folders.",

              "The original military code was called night writing and was used by soldiers to communicate after dark.",
              "It was based on a twelve-dot cell, two-dots wide by six-dots high.",
              "Each dot or combination of dots within the cell stood for a phonetic sound.",
              "The problem with the military code was that a single fingertip could not feel all the dots with one touch.",
              "Braille created a reading method based on a cell of six dots.",
              "This crucial improvement meant that a fingertip could encompass the entire cell unit with one impression and move rapidly from one cell to the next.",

              "Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and stabbed him in one of his eyes.",
              "A local physician bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ.",
              "In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected.",
              "He eventually lost sight in the other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.",
              "[5]a Braille survived the torment of the infection, but by the age of five he was completely blind in both eyes.",
              "[6] Due to his young age, he did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark.",
              "[7] His parents made many efforts \u2013 quite uncommon for the era \u2013 to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care.",
              "He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability.",
              "[5] Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.",
              "[4][8] Braille studied in Coupvray until the age of ten.",
              "Because of his intelligence and diligence, Braille was permitted to attend one of the first schools for blind children in the world, the Royal Institute for Blind Youth,[9] since renamed to the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris.",
              "[10] The last of his family's children to leave the household, Braille departed for the school in February 1819.",
              "[11] At that time the Royal Institute was an underfunded, ramshackle affair, but it provided a relatively stable environment for blind children to learn and associate together.",
              "[12][13] The children were taught to read using a system devised by the school's founder, Valentin Hau\u0308y.",
              "Not blind himself, Hau\u0308y was a philanthropist who devoted his life to helping the blind.",
              "He designed and manufactured a small library of books for the children by embossing heavy paper with the raised imprints of Latin letters.",
              "Readers would trace their fingers over the text, comprehending slowly but in a traditional fashion which Hau\u0308y could appreciate.",
              "[14] Braille was helped by Hau\u0308y's books, but he also despaired over their lack of depth: the amount of information retained in such books was necessarily minor.",
              "Because the raised letters were made in a complex artisanal process using wet paper pressed against copper wire, the children could not hope to \"write\" by themselves.",
              "So that the young Louis could send letters back home, Simon-Rene\u0301 provided him with an alphabet made from bits of thick leather.",
              "It was a slow and cumbersome process, but the boy could at least trace the letters' outlines and write his first sentences.",
              "[15] The handcrafted Hau\u0308y books all came in uncomfortable sizes and weights for children.",
              "They were laboriously constructed, very fragile, and expensive to obtain: when Hau\u0308y's school first opened, it had a total of three books.",
              "[14] Nonetheless, Hau\u0308y promoted their use with zeal.",
              "To him, the books presented a system which would be readily approved by educators and indeed they seemed \u2013 to the sighted \u2013 to offer the best achievable results.",
              "Braille and his schoolmates, however, could detect all too well the books' crushing limitations.",
              "[14] Nonetheless, Hau\u0308y's efforts still provided a breakthrough achievement \u2013 the recognition of the sense of touch as a workable strategy for sightless reading.",
              "The Hau\u0308y system's main drawback was that it was \"talking to the fingers with the language of the eye\".",
              "[16] Braille read Hau\u0308y's books repeatedly, and he was equally attentive to the oral instruction offered by the school.",
              "He proved to be a highly proficient student and, after he had exhausted the school's curriculum, he was immediately asked to remain as a teacher's aide.",
              "By 1833, he was elevated to a full professorship.",
              "For much of the rest of his life, Braille stayed at the Institute where he taught history, geometry, and algebra.",
              "[10][17] Braille's ear for music enabled him to become an accomplished cellist and organist in classes taught by Jean-Nicolas Marrigues.",
              "Later in life, his musical talents led him to play the organ for churches all over France.",
              "A devout Catholic,[18] Braille held the position of organist in Paris at the Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs[19] from 1834 to 1839, and later at the Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul.",
              "[20] In 1821, Braille learned of a communication system devised by Charles Barbier.",
              "Barbier, aware of its potential for helping the blind to read and write, wrote to the school to introduce his method.",
              "[6][21] Barbier's invention was a code of up to twelve dots in two columns, impressed into thick paper.",
              "These impressions could be interpreted entirely by the fingers.",
              "Barbier's code of raised dots inspired Braille to develop a system of his own.",
              "[22][23] Braille was determined to invent a system of reading and writing that could bridge the gap in communication between the sighted and the blind.",
              "In his own words: \"Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us if we [the blind] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people.",
              "We do not need pity, nor do we need to be reminded we are vulnerable.",
              "We must be treated as equals \u2013 and communication is the way this can be brought about.\"",
              "[17] Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and his system was largely completed by 1824, when he was fifteen years old.",
              "[10][17] He innovated on Barbier's system by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency.",
              "He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six.",
              "His first version used both dots and dashes.",
              "He published this version in 1829, but by the second edition in 1837 discarded the dashes because they were too difficult to read.",
              "Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.",
              "[10] Braille created his own raised-dot system using Barbier's slate and stylus tools.",
              "Barbier had donated many sets of these tools to the school.",
              "By soldering two metal strips across the slate, he created a secure area for the stylus which would keep the lines straight and readable.",

              "His system had only six dots \u2014 three dots lined up in each of two columns.",

              "As a boy in military school, Charles Barbier de La Serre (1767-1841) was taught that war was a noble profession in which victories are won by intelligence and valour.",
              "As a man, he would come to learn how savage the war could be.",
              "Barbier served as an artillery officer in his one-time classmate Napole\u0301on Bonaparte\u2019s army.",
              "Stationed on the front line, he witnessed firsthand war\u2019s capacity to kill and maim.",
              "Besides those who were slain on the battlefield by day, many soldiers \u2013 including his fellow officers \u2013 were killed in the dead of night when the light they used to read maps or orders fatally illuminated them for waiting enemy snipers.",
              "Yet years earlier, Barbier had attended a lecture on the Greek historian Polybius and the system \u2013 known as the Polybius\u2019 Square \u2013 of transmitting messages across great distances with the aid of torches.",
              "The invention relied on a grid pattern with five vertical columns and five horizontal rows.",
              "A different letter of the 24-letter Greek alphabet was inscribed in each of the 25 squares (with the last square left blank).",
              "Each letter could therefore be identified by the column and row where its square was located.",
              "If two individuals possessed copies of the same grid, they could communicate with each other by spelling out their messages one letter at a time through the use of numerical coordinates.",
              "The system Polybius described involved the use of two separate sets of torches.",
              "The sender would first raise the number of his torches that represented the horizontal row (from one to five).",
              "Next, he would raise the number of torches (again from one to five) that signified the number of the vertical column.",
              "Thus, if the letter \u2018B\u2019 was in first row, second column, the sender would raise one torch, followed by two torches.",
              "With appropriate pauses, the sender could spell out their message.",
              "For security, multiple versions of the same grid could be employed with different arrangements of letters, with the sender first signaling the number of the grid that should be used.",
              "The issue for Barbier was how such a system could be adapted to conditions of total darkness.",
              "His solution was to transmit messages that could be read by touch.",
              "Both sender and receiver would memorise an alphabetic grid and then send messages to each other on pieces of paper that were impressed with patterns of raised dots, with each tactile pattern signifying a letter.",
              "Because the French language contains many frequently used letter combinations, Barbier designed his basic grid with six horizontal rows and six vertical columns, totaling 36 rectangular cells.",
              "The message would be decoded by a system Barbier called sonography.",
              "The sharp point of a pocketknife could be used to cut rough markings into paper, in accordance with two columns, indicating the placement of the letter in the grid.",
              "Because of the large number of cells in his system, the letters located in the cells with the highest coordinates (six by six, for example) could contain as many as twelve dots.",
              "Due to the complexity of the system, Barbier\u2019s superiors regarded his invention as too impractical for use by soldiers in the field.",
              "After being rebuffed, Barbier does not seem to have considered adapting his system of night-writing to non-military use by the blind, but its value could not have escaped him.",
              "Whether from the explosion of gunpowder or the traumatic impact of projectiles and shrapnel, blindness was a common consequence of battle, especially with Napoleon\u2019s emphasis on artillery.",
              "Though we do not have statistics from the Napoleonic Wars in which Barbier fought, statistics from the American Civil War suggest how devastatingly common eye injuries were.",
              "According to records published in 1870 by the Surgeon General of the US Army, 10.",
              "77% of gunshot wounds suffered by Union soldiers were to the head and neck.",
              "Of these injuries, 51% resulted in blindness to one or both eyes.",
              "An even more prevalent cause of blindness was trachoma.",
              "Tens of thousands of British and French soldiers contracted this then-incurable disease while fighting in Egypt between 1798 and 1801, and it spread rapidly upon their return to Europe because of crowding and lack of sanitation in their barracks.",
              "In Paris, the Ho\u0302tel des Invalides had originally been built in the late 17th century to house 5,000 veterans, but the number of blind could not have been that great since only two or three dining-hall tables were specifically reserved for their use, sadly to prevent sighted soldiers from stealing their rations.",
              "Far more blinded veterans were compelled to struggle for existence in cities and villages with or without the help of their families.",
              "Barbier must have concluded that, if his system of night-writing could not help the army in the field, perhaps it could help civilians.",
              "Training large numbers of people in its use, however, would require a school-like setting to facilitate instruction and encourage regular practice.",
              "For that reason he turned, in 1821, to the Royal Institute for Blind Youths in Paris, the first school of its kind for blind children in the world.",
              "By this time, Barbier had perfected his system: no longer using a pocket knife to cut rough markings into paper as he had first done in the field, he now employed the blunt-tip of a stylus to punch out regular dots and later, with the help of a machinist, designed a metal guide-plate to make printing easier.",
              "Until that time, the only system employed to teach blind young people to read was one developed by Valentin Hauy (1745-1822), the founder of the Royal Institute.",
              "Hauy\u2019s system impressed the shapes of typographic characters onto wet paper, producing letters embossed in high relief that could be felt with the fingers and identified.",
              "Because of the large size of the letters, the books that contained the pages were cumbersome and heavy and could only hold a limited number of words.",
              "Nor could students reproduce the letters themselves if they wanted to write.",
              "Barbier\u2019s system, too, had limitations.",
              "Because the grid was purely phonetic, it omitted a letters and thus prevented the precise spelling of words.",
              "It also lacked punctuation, or symbols that could represent mathematical or musical notation.",
              "Most importantly, the size of the cells and the multiplicity of internal dots that had to be identified made reading a laborious process.",
              "Fortunately, a 12-year-old blind student who attended Barbier\u2019s introductory lecture was able to simplify Barbier\u2019s system by radically reducing the number of dots to a tiny cell measuring just three dots high by two across, creatively arranged in such a way that every letter of the alphabet and every necessary symbol could be faithfully reproduced by hand and speedily identified by touch.",
              "The young student\u2019s name was Louis Braille, and though his name would forever be linked to the tactile writing system for the blind, throughout his life he would always express his indebtedness to the inventive soldier known as the night-writer.",

              "Some common print method books have a version in braille so both books can be used alongside each other.",

              "half notes match 32nd notes;",

              "Beginners first learn the most common rhythmic value (8th, quarter, half, and whole notes).",
              "[8] For advanced users no rhythmic ambiguity arises as the context, including time signature and bar lines, makes the intended rhythmic value clear.",
              "For instance, in a measure of 4/4 time that includes only the symbol with dots 1,3,4 (whole or 16th rest), those facts clarify that the symbol is a whole rest.",
              "[8] An octave mark is included before the first note to specify its octave and when it changes unexpectedly.",
              "For instance, the 4th Octave is the octave starting with middle C and going up to the B above middle C.",
              "A melody clearly proceeding upward from the first octave can, if moving by step, proceed to the second, third, and fourth octaves without requiring additional octave signs.",
              "The rule is that, save for an octave mark specifying otherwise, notes move by a unison/no change, 2nd, or 3rd rather than a 6th, 7th, or octave.",
              "[10] For instance, the following moves upward continuously, ending in octave 5: The rule for 4ths and 5ths is more conservative.",
              "Save for an octave sign specifying otherwise, any melodic leap of a 4th or 5th stays in the same octave as the previous note.",
              "[11] For instance, this always stays within Octave 2: Because of the use of octave marks, clef symbols are not required in braille music.",
              "On occasion, clef symbols (bass clef, treble clef, or other) will be given so the visually impaired musician will be aware of every detail of the print score.",
              "Musical indications like diminuendo, crescendo, or ritardando are inserted inline with the note and rhythm notation and, to differentiate them from note, octave, and other musical signs, always preceded by the \"word sign\" (dots 3,4,5).",
              "See the table below for some examples: Slurs may be indicated by a slur sign between two notes or bracket slur surrounding a group of notes to be slurred.",
              "Musical signs such as staccato or tenuto are generally placed before the note or chord they affect.",
              "The musical signs in the table below are shown modifying a quarter note C (dots 1,4,5,6): \"Music hyphen\" states that a measure will be continued on the next line (this happens somewhat more often in braille music than in print music).",
              "A \"word apostrophe\" indicates that the word will be continued on the following line.",
              "[12] Fingering marks are shown in the table below: Braille music tends to be rather bulky.",
              "Because of this, a system of repetition symbols\u2014much more extensive than that in print music\u2014exists to reduce page turns, size of scores, and expense of printing.",
              "The repetition symbol (dots 2,3,5,6) is used like the printed intra-bar symbol to indicate that a beat, half measure, or full measure is to be repeated.",
              "In addition, braille music often includes instructions such as \"repeat measure 2 here\" or \"repeat measures 5\u20137 here\".",
              "Such are in addition to the commonly used repeat marks and first and second endings.",
              "[13] Unlike print music notation, braille music is a linear format.",
              "Therefore, certain conventions must be used to indicate contrapuntal lines and chords (where more than one note is played simultaneously within a staff).",
              "[14] Independent contrapuntal lines within a staff are indicated via whole- or part-measure in-accords.",
              "The first of the contrapuntal lines is given, then the second, enclosed by the in-accord symbols.",
              "The in-accord symbols indicate that the two lines are to be played simultaneously.",
              "[15] Homophonic chordal sections are written using interval notation.",
              "For instance, the notation \"quarter-note-C, 3rd, 5th\" would indicate playing a C along with the notes a 3rd and 5th higher than C, making a chord C-E-G a quarter note in length.",
              "Reading the interval notation is somewhat complicated by the fact that some staves use bottom-up notation (the bottom note of each chord is specified and intervals are read upwards from the given note) and some use top-down notation (the top note of each chord is specified and intervals are read downwards from the given note).",
              "The modern convention is to specify the main note (either the bass line or melody line) and let the intervals go up or down from there as appropriate.",
              "For instance, in most piano music the left hand specifies the bottom note and intervals go bottom-up while the right hand specifies the top note and intervals go top-down.",
              "Many older scores have all staves reading bottom-up or all reading top-down.",
              "Most scores have a note indicating the direction of the interval notation.",
              "However, in some older scores the direction must be established from the context.",
              "By convention, in-accords are given in the same direction as the interval notation.",
              "Thus, examining the in-accords is a key to unlock which reading applies.",
              "[16] Printed music is often written on simultaneous staves.",
              "For instance, piano music is typically written on two which compose the grand staff: one for treble clef (which soprano singers use) and one for bass clef.",
              "Standard choral work uses this mainly where they do not cross or four where they do, as for string quartet music (the most common added clefs are alto and/or tenor).",
              "The notes in different staves that play simultaneously are aligned vertically.",
              "Because of the linear nature of braille music and the fact that the blind musician can typically read only one staff at a time, multiple staves are handled in several ways depending on the complexity of the music and other considerations.",
              "Bar over bar format is most similar to print music with right-hand notation on the top line and left-hand notation on the bottom line.",
              "Some degree of vertical alignment between the right and left hands is maintained.",
              "Other ways of dealing with multiple-staff music are: line over line format, section by section format;",
              "paragraph style;",
              "and bar by bar format.",
              "As a rule these take up less space on the page but require more of the musician in working out how to fit the staves together.",
              "For instance, in a piano score notated in section by section format, the right-hand part may be written out for the first 8 measures, followed by the left-hand part.",
              "No attempt is made to align the parts.",
              "The same procedure is followed for measures 9\u201316, and so on, section by section, throughout the score.",
              "The blind musician learns and memorizes one section right hand alone, then left hand alone, then works out the hands together by memory and referencing various spots in the braille score to work out how the sections fit together.",
              "A note from the transcriber often clarifies the format used.",
              "However, with many older and more complex scores the format must be determined by examination of the music and context.",
              "[17] Over the years and in the many different countries, a variety of minor differences in braille music practice have arisen.",
              "Some have preferred a different standard for interval or staff notation or used different codes for various less common musical notations.",
              "An international effort to standardize the braille music code culminated in updates summarized in the Music Braille Code 1997[18] and detailed in New International Manual of Braille Music Notation (1997)[19] However, users should be aware that they will encounter divergences when ordering scores from printing houses and libraries because these are often older and from various countries."

              "Top of page April 14, 2022 Posted by: Lindsay Conway The NLS Music Section is honored to hold the world\u2019s largest collection of braille music.",
              "Many people are familiar with Louis Braille (1809-52) as inventor of the literary braille code, but relatively few know that, being a musician, Braille intended his system of raised-point writing to be used for musical notation as well.",
              "Indeed, the 1829 publication in which he explained his system includes a description of music notation using raised dots.",
              "When it comes to Louis Braille\u2019s development of his six-dot system, however, recent research has shed new light on certain aspects of the familiar narrative which has been by and large accepted for more than 60 years and which I myself learned.",
              "Recently Judy Dixon, my colleague here at NLS and current President of the International Council on English Braille (ICEB), drew attention to this new research, which was done by Philippa Campsie, an independent scholar and adjunct professor in the Department of Geography and Planning at the University of Toronto.",
              "Campsie published her research in the article \u201cCharles Barbier: A Hidden Story,\u201d which appeared in Disability Studies Quarterly\u2019s spring 2021 issue.",
              "In an article for the American Council of the Blind\u2019s ACB E-Forum titled \u201cHave We Had It Wrong All These Years?",
              ",\u201d Dixon wrote, \u201cFor those of us who have closely studied the history of braille, these revelations are shocking.",
              "\u201d Today I\u2019d like to summarize and share Philippa Campsie\u2019s research with you here on the NLS Music Notes Blog, for our understanding of history is constantly evolving, and it appears that we can learn some new lessons in the history of braille.",
              "For her research, Campsie analyzed primary source documents in the archives of the Association Valentin Hau\u0308y, the Institut National de Jeunes Aveugles (INJA), and the Muse\u0301e Louis Braille, among other institutions, in order to reexamine events associated with the inception of the braille code.",
              "It is often recounted that Charles Barbier (1767-1841) developed a twelve-dot system of \u201cnight writing\u201d for use in military operations, which he then demonstrated to students at the Institut Royal des Jeunes Aveugles (IRJA), including Louis Braille himself, who adapted it into a reading and writing system for people with visual impairments.",
              "Campsie identified the likely origins of this narrative in a biographical essay written in 1859 by Dr.",
              "Alexandre-Rene\u0301 Pignier, director of IRJA in the 1820s and 1830s, and a 1952 book by Paul Henri titled La Vie et l\u2019Oeuvre de Louis Braille.",
              "According to Campsie\u2019s research, primary source evidence does not support several aspects of the traditional narrative.",
              "First, although Charles Barbier had a career in the French military for about 7 years (1785-1792), he did not originally develop his system as covert \u201cnight writing\u201d intended for the military, but rather he aspired to design alternative reading and writing systems for people who were illiterate due to a variety of circumstances, including blindness.",
              "In an 1815 publication in which he proposed a system of raised-point writing, he explicitly stated that he believed those who would derive the greatest benefit from such a system were people who were blind or partially sighted.",
              "Next, many published resources have reported that the teen-aged Louis Braille met Charles Barbier at IRJA, but this appears to be based on Pignier\u2019s faulty account.",
              "Campsie found no evidence to support that such an early meeting took place, nor that Barbier visited IRJA to demonstrate his system.",
              "What did happen, according to primary sources in Campsie\u2019s study, is that in 1821 Barbier wrote to Dr.",
              "Pignier, who had recently become director of IRJA, to promote his twelve-dot system of raised-point writing.",
              "Pignier decided to give the system a trial at IRJA, and it was well received by both administrators and students, who were now able to take notes and re-read them, which they had not been able to do with the raised-type cursive that the school had taught them to read.",
              "Also, Barbier donated many sets of equipment which he had invented (akin to a slate and stylus) so that the students could produce this new point writing.",
              "Louis Braille began his studies at IRJA in 1819 and so would have learned Barbier\u2019s system when it was introduced to the school in 1821.",
              "However, according to Campsie\u2019s review of primary source documents, Barbier and Braille did not get to know one another until 1833, which is when Barbier apparently first learned of Louis Braille\u2019s 1829 publication proposing a six-dot system of raised-point writing for words and music.",
              "In 1833, Barbier wrote to Dr.",
              "Pignier to request a copy of Braille\u2019s method and in that letter indicated that he did not know who Louis Braille was, which again undermines the familiar narrative of a meeting between Barbier and Braille in the 1820s.",
              "After Barbier read Braille\u2019s publication in 1833, the two began corresponding and subsequently met in person later that year.",
              "From her research, Campsie concludes that Charles Barbier appears to be the first person to propose a coded writing system for people who are blind or partially sighted (as opposed to raised type in the shape of the conventional alphabet).",
              "Barbier can also be credited with providing the first tools for creating raised-point writing.",
              "But, as we know, Louis Braille made numerous innovations on Barbier\u2019s system that are of crucial importance and ultimately led to braille\u2019s worldwide adoption.",
              "And, of course, Louis Braille\u2019s code extended to encompass musical notation, which was immensely important to him as an organist, pianist, cellist, and teacher of music.",
              "Future blog posts will continue to examine various facets of the fascinating history of braille music.",

              "He attended the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris, France, as a student.",
              "At that time, books were created using raised print which was laborious to produce, hard to read, and difficult for individuals to write.",
              "While attending the Institute, Braille yearned for more books to read.",
              "He experimented with ways to create an alphabet that was easy to read with the fingertips.",
              "The writing system he invented, at age fifteen, evolved from the tactile \"Ecriture Nocturne\" (night writing) code invented by Charles Barbier for sending military messages that could be read on the battlefield at night, without light.",

              "It would look like this: you like him If written in contracted braille, this same phrase would take only six cell spaces to write.",
              "This is because the letters y and l are also used for the whole words you and like respectively.",
              "Likewise, the word him is formed by combining the letters h and m.",

              "Just as printed matter can be produced with a paper and pencil, typewriter, or printer, braille can also be written in several ways.",
              "The braille equivalent of paper and pencil is the slate and stylus.",
              "This consists of a slate or template with evenly spaced depressions for the dots of braille cells, and a stylus for creating the individual braille dots.",
              "With paper placed in the slate, tactile dots are made by pushing the pointed end of the stylus into the paper over the depressions.",
              "The paper bulges on its reverse side forming dots.",
              "Because of they are inexpensive and portable, the slate and stylus are especially helpful for carrying to jot quick notes and for labeling such things as file folders.",

              "Unlike a typewriter which has more than fifty keys, the braillewriter has only six keys, a space bar, a line spacer, and a backspace.",
              "The six main keys are numbered to correspond with the six dots of a braille cell.",
              "Because most braille symbols contain more than a single dot, combinations of the braillewriter keys can be pushed at the same time.",

              "Soon afterward, he began the development of the embossed code.",
              "In 1829 he published the code in Proce\u0301de\u0301 pour Ecrire les Paroles, la Musique et le Plain-Chant au Moyen de Points, which also contained a braille music code based on the same six-dot cell.",
              "After he developed his system for reading and writing, Braille remained at the institute as an instructor.",
              "Eventually an incessant cough made it impossible for him to lecture.",

              "The letter \u201cw\u201d is an exception because the French alphabet did not contain a \u201cw\u201d when the code was created;",

              "With the development of Braille, literacy acquired an evolved meaning across cultures and contexts.",
              "Beginning with its early period of acceptance to now becoming a widespread yet unique mode of reading, writing and typing among blind and visually impaired people, the script has had a significant impact on the social inclusion of the communities too.",
              "Education in and about Braille has been inherently tied to the script\u2019s growing use from the start.",
              "Tracing this history is also tracing the history of the visually impaired community, their challenges in obtaining their rights and the broader sociopolitical moments that marked this journey.",
              "The Braille script\u2019s invention in the 1820s set off a slow and steady growth in its acceptance, led by Louis Braille\u2019s pursuits as an educator himself.",
              "While Braille\u2019s home country of France adopted the script as its official system of written communication for blind persons only in 1854 - a year after his death - the Missouri School for the Blind became the first institute in the United States to use Braille in 1860 , while the first day school for the blind was established in England in 1898.",
              "In these later decades of the 19th century, educational institutions were slow to adopt the script, even as technical improvements for Braille, such as the Braillewriter - the first mechanical device for writing Braille - and the Braille shorthand system, were developed.",
              "It was in the early to mid-20th century that Braille\u2019s usefulness came to be widely recognized, and educational avenues for the script flourished.",
              "Britain had adopted the uniform Braille code in 1905, and in the United States, by 1900 public schools were improving and teacher training had adequately progressed so that integration of blind children into these schools had begun.",
              "Many special and local schools were able to provide Braille classes supported by government and philanthropic funds for special equipment and programs. In 1902, a library and reading room for people who were blind opened in San Francisco.",
              "Inclusive schools played an important role of integration with sighted pupils, helping those children appreciate the abilities of blind and visually impaired children so that they would have better attitudes towards them in adult life and work.",
              "Public efforts - both by the visually impaired and sighted communities - continued to support education.",
              "Helen Keller, who became the first deaf-blind person to earn a college degree Radcliffe College in 1904, was an avid proponent of Braille, and wrote about her experiences - including her difficulties and victories in obtaining an education - in her 1903 memoir, The Story of My Life.",
              "Schools across the United States began organizing Braille reading classes, with Standard English Braille being adopted as uniform type by the American and British Uniform Type Committees in 1932.",
              "India adopted the Uniform Braille codes for various languages in 1951, with the government setting up its first school that taught Braille - still operational - called the Model School for Blind Children in 1959 at Dehradun.",
              "The 1960s witnessed widespread efforts to improve educational conditions for the visually impaired, including efforts to train more teachers in standardised modes of inclusive education, including the teaching of communication skills and orientation, mobility, and daily living skills.",
              "At least in the US, the retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) epidemic caused blindness in many children from birth, a large number of whom belonged to middle- and upper-class families.",
              "These families pressurized their local governments to open more schools in their vicinities, hiring more teachers and adopting new approaches, such as modifying existing general curricula for sighted students to educate visually impaired students and sighted teachers and students receiving help from specialized teachers who were trained to instruct students with visual impairments.",
              "It also began to be recognized that many early efforts at inclusion would probably have failed were the classroom teacher, the parents, and other instructors of students with visual impairments not equally important partners on an educational team.",
              "Along with systemic and technical improvements in the means and form of education, such attitudinal changes in society at large also helped bring about the implementation of a range of legislative and policy instruments.",
              "The latter half of the 20th century saw many of the social shifts around the education of visually impaired children that occurred in the first half of the 20th century being solidified through legislation - this often included the establishment of Braille day-school classes.",
              "This move was concentrated in the 1970s with the passage of laws such as the Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC) scheme in 1974 to be implemented through government schools in India, and the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975 in the US - later renamed and strengthened as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).",
              "Perhaps the most important changes that came about in education for the visually impaired along with the societal changes were the rapid technological changes - beginning, perhaps, with computers being adapted to produce Braille outputs in 1963.",
              "This increased the accessibility of educational materials in Braille for an increasing number of students.",
              "It also opened up new avenues of education and community for the visually impaired community.",
              "The dynamism of technological means of education has also allowed for people across the spectrum of visual impairment to access tools and resources such as refreshable Braille displays and magnification devices tailored to their specific needs.",
              "These can range from adaptive tools and materials in tactile or enlarged form for blind children in standard classrooms to a completely individualized curriculum which may focus on developmental goals alongside academic ones.",
              "Still, students who use Braille are generally better equipped to keep pace in a regular classroom than their peers who do not.",
              "This is because Braille remains an effective reading medium;",
              "it allows access to virtually all print materials and enables students to read quickly and without fatigue.",
              "This is a key reason that we at Thinkerbell Labs have blended the strengths of technological devices and software tools to provide visually impaired students with a comprehensive Braille learning experience on Annie.",
              "Adopting learning materials from Braille pioneers such as the RNIB, such technology-enabled learning is on the leading edge of Braille education.",
              "Today, even though some challenges remain in extending Braille education to all those children who would benefit from it, we\u2019ve come a long way.",
              "Learning materials are more accessible, there\u2019s more schools tailored to the needs of the community, and governmental and philanthropic efforts continue to provide the impetus to better the learning and social conditions of the visually impaired.",
              "While there\u2019s much work to be done and more history to be made, it\u2019s been a long and rewarding road for Braille and education for the visually impaired.",

              "The braille system has succeeded because it is based on a rational sequence of signs devised for the fingertips, rather than imitating signs devised for the eyes.",
              "In addition, braille can be written by blind people and used for any notation that follows an accepted sequence, such as numerals, musical notes, or chemical tables.",
              "Braille has undergone many modifications, particularly the addition of contractions representing groups of letters or whole words that appear frequently in a language.",

              "The original military code was called night writing and was used by soldiers to communicate after dark.",
              "It was based on a twelve-dot cell, two-dots wide by six-dots high.",
              "Each dot or combination of dots within the cell stood for a phonetic sound.",
              "The problem with the military code was that a single fingertip could not feel all the dots with one touch.",
              "Braille created a reading method based on a cell of six dots.",
              "This crucial improvement meant that a fingertip could encompass the entire cell unit with one impression and move rapidly from one cell to the next.",
              "Braille himself was blind from the age of three.",
              "He was born in the village of Coupvray near Paris on January 4, 1809.",
              "One day he was playing with a sharp tool belonging to his father, a harness maker.",
              "The child accidently injured one eye with the tool and developed an infection that later caused total blindness.",
              "Until 1819, Braille attended the local village school, where his superior mental abilities put him at the head of his class.",
              "He received a scholarship to the National Institute of the Blind, where he was the youngest student.",
              "Soon afterward, he began the development of the embossed code.",
              "In 1829 he published the code in Proce\u0301de\u0301 pour Ecrire les Paroles, la Musique et le Plain-Chant au Moyen de Points, which also contained a braille music code based on the same six-dot cell.",
              "After he developed his system for reading and writing, Braille remained at the institute as an instructor.",
              "Eventually an incessant cough made it impossible for him to lecture.",
              "He died at the age of forty-three, and was buried in the family plot in the village cemetery in Coupvray.",

              "The next ten letters of the alphabet (k\u2013t) are formed by adding dot 3 to each of the first ten letters.",
              "The remaining letters, except for w, are formed by adding dots 3 and 6 to each of the first five letters.",
              "The letter \u201cw\u201d is an exception because the French alphabet did not contain a \u201cw\u201d when the code was created;",

Braille embossers can take output from a computer and produce single- or double-sided braille materials in a fraction of the time it took to create braille by hand.",

The National Braille Association (NBA), a professional organization for transcribers, provides transcribers with guidance and professional development opportunities.",
