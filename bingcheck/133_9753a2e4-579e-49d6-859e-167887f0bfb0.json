    "response": "That's a very interesting question. A business strategy is a plan for reaching specific objectives that a company or entrepreneur sets[^6^]. It involves understanding what the business does, needs, and wants to achieve, and how to allocate resources and set priorities accordingly[^6^]. A business strategy is different from a mission, which is what the business wants to accomplish, or a vision, which is the desired destination for the business[^6^].\n\nThere are many possible business strategies that have been implemented in the last decade, but one of the most common themes is creating value for customers, employees, suppliers, and shareholders[^7^]. Value creation is the difference between what a stakeholder is willing to pay for a good or service and its cost[^7^]. A successful business strategy should aim to maximize this difference for all stakeholders involved[^7^].\n\nOne example of a company that has achieved a high-impact business transformation in the last decade by creating value is \u00d8rsted[^1^], formerly known as Danish Oil and Natural Gas. The company decided to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, in response to the global challenge of climate change[^1^]. By doing so, \u00d8rsted created value for its customers by offering clean and affordable energy solutions[^1^], for its employees by providing a meaningful and inspiring purpose[^1^], for its suppliers by collaborating on innovative technologies and projects[^1^], and for its shareholders by increasing its profitability and market share[^1^]. \u00d8rsted was ranked as the most sustainable company in the world by Corporate Knights in 2020[^1^].\n\nAnother example of a company that has adopted a successful business strategy in the last decade is Netflix[^4^], the online streaming service. Netflix started as a DVD rental company, but realized that the future of entertainment was in digital content delivery[^4^]. Netflix invested heavily in developing its own original content, such as movies and series, that appealed to a global audience and differentiated it from its competitors[^4^]. Netflix also leveraged data analytics and artificial intelligence to understand its customers' preferences and tailor its recommendations accordingly[^4^]. By doing so, Netflix created value for its customers by offering them personalized and diverse entertainment options[^4^], for its employees by fostering a culture of creativity and innovation[^4^], for its suppliers by partnering with talented content creators and distributors[^4^], and for its shareholders by growing its subscriber base and revenue[^4^]. Netflix was ranked as one of the most innovative companies in the world by Fast Company in 2020[^4^].\n\nThese are just two examples of companies that have implemented successful business strategies in the last decade. There are many other factors that can influence the effectiveness of a business strategy, such as industry dynamics, customer behavior, competitive advantage, resource allocation, organizational structure, leadership style, etc. However, creating value for all stakeholders is a key element that can help any business achieve its goals and gain a competitive edge in the market.",

              "It became clear that one was wind power, which three of the six companies that merged to become DONG Energy in 2006 had already pursued.",
              "Onshore wind was well established.",
              "We had a sizeable portfolio of projects in Poland and Sweden, and we had been involved in projects in Spain and Greece.",
              "As for offshore wind, we had early-stage operating projects in Denmark and the United Kingdom and large-scale development projects.",
              "That gave us critical mass in wind when we formulated our vision.",

              "Martin Neubert:A\u0302 At the time, no offshore-wind projects bigger than 160 megawatts had been built.",
              "So we had to ask how we could build large-scale offshore-wind projects in a different way.",
              "Could we move from building one highly customized offshore-wind project every two or three years to building one or two more standardized projects every year?",
              "What would it take to go from handcrafting to serial production?",
              "Answering that question involved a 360-degree review: the supply chain, our competencies, the financing models.",
              "We concluded that we could not do it alone.",
              "One challenge was installation.",
              "The installation companies in the market were small.",
              "We found a considerable risk that they could go bankrupt during a project.",
              "That led us to acquire A2SEA as an installation supplier.",
              "We would also need strong partnerships with suppliers of turbines, foundations, and cables.",
              "Turbines were a particular issue.",
              "Since no purpose-built installation vessels existed, we reasoned that we would benefit from working with a manufacturer on the design, layout, and funding of second-generation installation vessels.",
              "Siemens quickly realized that offshore wind could develop into a large industry.",
              "We entered a partnership with them, which included the delivery of 500 3.",
              "6-megawatt turbines.",

              "McKinsey: How did executives and staff react to the decision to take the company in a new direction?",
              "Martin Neubert: There was internal pressure to keep DONG Energy the same.",
              "It wasna\u0302\u0080\u0099t unexpected, because we had spent three decades turning the company into a traditional fossil-fuel company.",
              "Fossil fuels were our core competence and the focus of our growth strategy.",
              "Our employees also perceived that we were the worlda\u0302\u0080\u0099s best at running coal-fired power plants, and a benchmark for the industry.",
              "The skepticism was broad and profound.",
              "Ultimately, though, internal skepticism receded.",
              "In 2012, when Henrik Poulsen had just joined as CEO, our portfolio of assets and activities had high exposure to gas and gas-fired power plants.",
              "As gas prices dropped in the United States, vast amounts of surplus American coal ended up in Europe, where it replaced gas as the preferred fuel for power generation.",
              "That caused us financial difficulties, which made it easier for people to accept the new focus on offshore wind and on the exploration and production of oil and gas, and the moves to divest noncore businesses.",
              "We began implementing the new strategy by establishing a wind-power business unit.",
              "I think those of us who were asked to join this business unit saw it as the beginning of an interesting journey.",
              "A group of strong European utilities was active in UK offshore wind at the time.",
              "We all thought that something big was going on and that the UK would be the right place to pursue offshore-wind projects at industrial scale.",
              "That proved to be the case when the UK government strengthened its support for offshore wind to help make these projects financially viable.",
              "If that hadna\u0302\u0080\u0099t happened, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m not sure that we would have progressed as fast as we did.",
              "McKinsey: Getting into offshore wind required a multiyear effort to sell holdings and build up new assets.",
              "How did management secure the necessary capital even as the company was exiting businesses that were reliable sources of cash?",
              "Martin Neubert: We had multiple new projects in the UK that needed funding.",
              "One model would have involved financing them with external debt and then divesting once the projects were operational.",
              "But raising debt for each project would not have worked well with our group-level funding strategy.",
              "Another approach, partnering with electric utilities, would have been too complicated, because these companies had their own asset portfolios and strategies.",
              "We needed financial partners that could deliver capital and manage their investments while relying upon our experience constructing and operating offshore-wind projects.",
              "One structural issue, however, was that we did not want to use project financing, whereas many of our financial investors preferred or were even required to leverage their investment via project financing.",
              "This led us to develop the a\u0302\u0080\u009cfarm downa\u0302\u0080\u009d model, in which we could fund our half of a project on our balance sheet and partners could use project financing to fund the rest.",
              "With farm-downs happening before commissioning, we provided investors with turnkey project offerings, which would protect them from risks we can manage best, including development, construction, and operating risks.",
              "That model resonated with the Danish pension funds, and later with Dutch and Canadian pension funds and other investors.",
              "Had we not developed the farm-down model, we couldna\u0302\u0080\u0099t have funded all these projects in Europe.",

              "But it was still working like a start-up.",
              "To support new projects, we added whatever resources were needed, which led to inefficiencies.",
              "We lacked a proper organizational structure and operating model.",
              "Correcting that was one of the key accomplishments of my predecessor, Samuel Leupold.",

              "The first step was divesting our oil and gas business, which concentrated our business almost entirely on renewables.",
              "We also invested in the conversion of our domestic heat and power plants, enabling them to move away from coal toward biomass.",
              "As a result, we will exit coal in 2023, and our power generation will be carbon neutral in 2025.",
              "In 2016, we completed our IPO, and DONG Energy, which we were still called at the time, became a publicly listed company.",
              "The IPO provided us with the flexibility and access to equity that we need to fund growth.",

              "So the expectation was that such a turnaround would have to be completed within one generation, or the equivalent of 30 years.",
              "McKinsey: Back then, the technology landscape for offshore wind looked very different from what it looks like now.",
              "How did that factor into your thinking?",
              "Martin Neubert:A\u0302 At the time, no offshore-wind projects bigger than 160 megawatts had been built.",
              "So we had to ask how we could build large-scale offshore-wind projects in a different way.",
              "Could we move from building one highly customized offshore-wind project every two or three years to building one or two more standardized projects every year?",
              "What would it take to go from handcrafting to serial production?",
              "Answering that question involved a 360-degree review: the supply chain, our competencies, the financing models.",
              "We concluded that we could not do it alone.",
              "One challenge was installation.",
              "The installation companies in the market were small.",
              "We found a considerable risk that they could go bankrupt during a project.",
              "That led us to acquire A2SEA as an installation supplier.",
              "We would also need strong partnerships with suppliers of turbines, foundations, and cables.",
              "Turbines were a particular issue.",
              "Since no purpose-built installation vessels existed, we reasoned that we would benefit from working with a manufacturer on the design, layout, and funding of second-generation installation vessels.",
              "Siemens quickly realized that offshore wind could develop into a large industry.",
              "We entered a partnership with them, which included the delivery of 500 3.",
              "6-megawatt turbines.",
              "At the time, it was one of the largest energy agreements Siemens had ever made.",
              "McKinsey: How did executives and staff react to the decision to take the company in a new direction?",
              "Martin Neubert: There was internal pressure to keep DONG Energy the same.",
              "It wasna\u0302\u0080\u0099t unexpected, because we had spent three decades turning the company into a traditional fossil-fuel company.",
              "Fossil fuels were our core competence and the focus of our growth strategy.",
              "Our employees also perceived that we were the worlda\u0302\u0080\u0099s best at running coal-fired power plants, and a benchmark for the industry.",
              "The skepticism was broad and profound.",
              "Ultimately, though, internal skepticism receded.",
              "In 2012, when Henrik Poulsen had just joined as CEO, our portfolio of assets and activities had high exposure to gas and gas-fired power plants.",
              "As gas prices dropped in the United States, vast amounts of surplus American coal ended up in Europe, where it replaced gas as the preferred fuel for power generation.",
              "That caused us financial difficulties, which made it easier for people to accept the new focus on offshore wind and on the exploration and production of oil and gas, and the moves to divest noncore businesses.",
              "We began implementing the new strategy by establishing a wind-power business unit.",
              "I think those of us who were asked to join this business unit saw it as the beginning of an interesting journey.",
              "A group of strong European utilities was active in UK offshore wind at the time.",
              "We all thought that something big was going on and that the UK would be the right place to pursue offshore-wind projects at industrial scale.",
              "That proved to be the case when the UK government strengthened its support for offshore wind to help make these projects financially viable.",
              "If that hadna\u0302\u0080\u0099t happened, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m not sure that we would have progressed as fast as we did.",
              "McKinsey: Getting into offshore wind required a multiyear effort to sell holdings and build up new assets.",
              "How did management secure the necessary capital even as the company was exiting businesses that were reliable sources of cash?",
              "Martin Neubert: We had multiple new projects in the UK that needed funding.",
              "One model would have involved financing them with external debt and then divesting once the projects were operational.",
              "But raising debt for each project would not have worked well with our group-level funding strategy.",
              "Another approach, partnering with electric utilities, would have been too complicated, because these companies had their own asset portfolios and strategies.",
              "We needed financial partners that could deliver capital and manage their investments while relying upon our experience constructing and operating offshore-wind projects.",
              "One structural issue, however, was that we did not want to use project financing, whereas many of our financial investors preferred or were even required to leverage their investment via project financing.",
              "This led us to develop the a\u0302\u0080\u009cfarm downa\u0302\u0080\u009d model, in which we could fund our half of a project on our balance sheet and partners could use project financing to fund the rest.",
              "With farm-downs happening before commissioning, we provided investors with turnkey project offerings, which would protect them from risks we can manage best, including development, construction, and operating risks.",
              "That model resonated with the Danish pension funds, and later with Dutch and Canadian pension funds and other investors.",
              "Had we not developed the farm-down model, we couldna\u0302\u0080\u0099t have funded all these projects in Europe.",
              "And the structure that we innovated became widely used in the industry.",
              "McKinsey: What organizational changes took place as A\u0303\u0098rsteda\u0302\u0080\u0099s portfolio shifted toward renewables?",
              "Martin Neubert: By 2012, our wind-power business unit had grown to hundreds of employees.",
              "But it was still working like a start-up.",
              "To support new projects, we added whatever resources were needed, which led to inefficiencies.",
              "We lacked a proper organizational structure and operating model.",
              "Correcting that was one of the key accomplishments of my predecessor, Samuel Leupold.",
              "He introduced our first real operating model, establishing global functions, clear project governance, and a product-line organization that systematically reduced the cost of offshore-wind electricity by eliminating ad hoc or project-specific sourcing and procurement.",

              "That forum facilitates open discussions to break silos, align our approach, and build a strong network among senior leaders.",
              "In addition, we have reestablished our leadership-forum meetings for our top 400 leaders.",
              "McKinsey: A\u0303\u0098rsted has made significant moves in recent years.",
              "Can you talk about those, and the rationale for them?",
              "Martin Neubert: The strategic steps wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve taken during the past three to five years have focused on turning A\u0303\u0098rsted into a global renewable-energy major.",
              "The first step was divesting our oil and gas business, which concentrated our business almost entirely on renewables.",
              "We also invested in the conversion of our domestic heat and power plants, enabling them to move away from coal toward biomass.",
              "As a result, we will exit coal in 2023, and our power generation will be carbon neutral in 2025.",
              "In 2016, we completed our IPO, and DONG Energy, which we were still called at the time, became a publicly listed company.",
              "The IPO provided us with the flexibility and access to equity that we need to fund growth.",
              "The IPO also gave institutional and retail investors an opportunity to take part in our green transition, while sharpening our profile as a renewable pure-play.",
              "Within the past couple of years, we have reentered the onshore-wind market and moved into solar PV [photovoltaic] and storage solutions.",

              "If the studios changed their terms and conditions or were no longer willing or able to license content, Netflix's ability to stream content to subscribers would have been adversely affected The studios were monopolistic - a particular type of TV program or movie was available with just one studio - and could demand higher margins.",
              "A classic example of how Porter's \"Bargaining power of suppliers\"4 and John Malone's \"Wholesale transfer pricing power\"5 manifests itself The studios licensed the same content to multiple subscription-based services and did so on different terms and conditions.",
              "So, Netflix and its competitors offered consumers the same content titles but licensed them at different rates.",
              "This affected margins due to price matching The licenses were valid for a particular duration and applicable within a specific geography.",
              "Once the term expired, Netflix would have to repurchase the license.",
              "This represented a recurring cost.",
              "Moreover, Netflix would have to license content in advance of entering into a new geographical market.",
              "Acquisition and retention were impacted if consumers in that territory did not favorably receive the content, and given the long-term nature of the commitment, adjustment of the content offering wasn't possible The licenses required advance payments, i.",
              "e., Netflix had to pay for next year's content against this year's revenue.",
              "If next year's subscriber and revenue growth didn't match up to expectations, liquidity was affected Payment terms of the licenses were tied to theatrical exhibition receipts, that is, the ticket price in movie theatres.",
              "Netflix would buy these licenses before the ticket price would be decided to get access to the content before the competition.",
              "As a result, they would get into licensing agreements without knowing what the ultimate cost per title would be The cost of licenses began to increase due to bidding wars with other streaming sites for exclusivity In short, Netflix's cost wasn't fixed.",
              "The solution?",
              "Simple: take the studios out of the equation.",
              "The synergy between content creators and Netflix led to the birth of Netflix Originals.",
              "This eliminated the licensing situation and put Netflix in control.",
              "Netflix now pays a flat fee (\"fixed cost\") to produce the content and then doesn't pay another cent once the content is made.",
              "Thus, by integrating supply and distribution, Netflix created a competitive moat by way of making their cost base fixed.",
              "What's the competitive moat, you ask?",
              "Economies of Scale.",
              "The fixed cost of content production can be spread across Netflix\u2019s subscriber base.",
              "And as the subscriber base increases, the fixed cost/subscriber declines.",
              "Here's some quick math to prove this point: Netflix's subscribers = 210M Hulu's subscribers = 40M Marginal cost/subscriber = $0 Cost of producing \"The Crown\": $520M That's $2.",
              "5/subscriber for Netflix & $13/subscriber for Hulu.",
              "The unit costs for Hulu are 5 times that of Netflix!",
              "Thus, not only does Netflix benefit by way of reduced costs, it also set up a barrier of entry for the competition.",
              "If Hulu wants to compete with Netflix's original content, not only do they have to make the high up-front investment to produce the content, but they also have a smaller subscriber base to spread the cost across.",
              "This provides Netflix a superior cost advantage and allows them to spend more on marketing, content production, and product.",
