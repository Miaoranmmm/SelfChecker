    "response": "That's a great question. The first computer game is generally considered to be **Spacewar!**, a space combat game developed by Steve Russell at MIT in 1962[^2^] [^3^]. It was played on a PDP-1 computer and used a vector display to show two spaceships shooting at each other. Spacewar! inspired many other programmers to create their own games and influenced the development of the arcade and home console industry.\n\nThe video game industry has evolved into a multi-billion dollar entertainment industry over the decades, thanks to several factors such as technological innovations, creative designs, market competition, consumer demand and cultural trends. Some of the major milestones in the history of video games include:\n\n- The release of the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey, in 1972[^1^] [^2^], which used cartridges to play different games on a TV screen.\n- The success of Pong, the first arcade video game, in 1972[^1^] [^2^], which popularized video games as a form of entertainment and spawned many clones and competitors.\n- The emergence of genres such as platformers, shooters, role-playing games, fighting games and simulation games in the late 1970s and early 1980s[^1^] [^2^], which expanded the variety and appeal of video games to different audiences.\n- The video game crash of 1983[^1^] [^2^], which was caused by an oversaturation of low-quality and unoriginal games in the market, leading to a decline in consumer confidence and sales.\n- The revival of the industry by Nintendo's NES in 1985[^1^] [^2^], which introduced iconic characters such as Mario and Zelda, improved graphics and sound, and strict quality control standards.\n- The rise of 3D graphics and optical media in the early 1990s[^1^] [^2^], which enabled more realistic and immersive games such as Doom, Myst and Final Fantasy VII.\n- The popularity of handheld consoles such as the Game Boy in the 1990s[^1^] [^2^], which allowed gamers to play anywhere and anytime.\n- The emergence of online gaming in the late 1990s and early 2000s[^1^] [^2^], which enabled multiplayer modes, social interactions, digital distribution and user-generated content.\n- The entry of Microsoft into the console market with the Xbox in 2001[^1^] [^2^], which challenged Sony's PlayStation dominance and introduced features such as Xbox Live and Kinect.\n- The innovation of motion controls and casual games by Nintendo's Wii in 2006[^1^] [^2^], which attracted new demographics such as women, children and seniors to video games.\n- The rise of mobile gaming in the 2010s[^1^] [^2^], which made video games accessible to billions of people through smartphones and tablets.\n- The development of virtual reality and cloud gaming in the 2010s and 2020s[^1^] [^2^], which offered new ways of experiencing and delivering video games.\n\nThese are just some of the highlights of the history of video games.

              "[2][4] The ships fire torpedoes, which are not affected by the gravitational pull of the star.",
              "The ships have a limited number of torpedoes and supply of fuel, which is used when the player fires the ship's thrusters.",
              "[6] Torpedoes are fired one at a time by flipping a toggle switch on the computer or pressing a button on the control pad, and there is a cooldown period between launches.",
              "The ships remain in motion even when the player is not accelerating, and rotating the ships does not change the direction of their motion, though the ships can rotate at a constant rate without inertia.",

              "A hyperspace feature, or \"panic button\", can be used as a last-ditch means to evade enemy torpedoes by moving the player's ship to another location on the screen after it disappears for a few seconds, but the reentry from hyperspace occurs at a random location, and in some versions there is an increasing probability of the ship exploding with each use.",
              "[6] Player controls include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace.",
              "[6] Initially, these were controlled using the front-panel test switches on the PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches.",
              "The location of the switches also left one player off to one side of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage.",

              "[9] For the first few months after its installation, the PDP-1 programming community at MIT focused on simpler programs to work out how to create software for the computer.",
              "[2] During this period, Russell visited his old friends in the community frequently and described the Spacewar!",
              "concept to them.",
              "Russell hoped someone would implement the game, but had no plans to do so himself.",
              "Other members of the community felt he was the logical choice to create the game, however, and began pressuring him to program it.",
              "[4] In response, Russell began providing various excuses as to why he could not do so.",
              "[2] One of these was the lack of a trigonometric function routine needed to calculate the trajectories of the spacecraft.",
              "This prompted Alan Kotok of the TMRC to call DEC, who informed him that they had such a routine already written.",
              "Kotok drove to DEC to pick up a tape containing the code, slammed it down in front of Russell, and asked what other excuses he had.",
              "[2][4] Russell, later explaining that \"I looked around and I didn't find an excuse, so I had to settle down and do some figuring\",[2] started writing the code around the time that the PDP-1's display was installed at the end of December 1961.",
              "[2][4][10] The game was developed to meet three precepts Russell, Graetz, and Wiitanen had developed for creating a program that functioned equally well as an entertainment experience for the players and as a demonstration for spectators: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game.",
              "[2][11] It took Russell, with assistance from the other programmers\u2014including Bob Saunders and Steve Piner (but not Wiitanen, who had been called up by the United States Army Reserve)\u2014about 200 total hours to write the first version of Spacewar!",
              ", or around six weeks to develop the basic game.",
              "[2][12][13] It was written in the PDP-1's assembly language.",
              "[14] Russell had a program with a movable dot before the end of January 1962, and an early operational game with rotatable spaceships by February.",
              "[2] The two spaceships were designed to evoke the curvy spaceship from Buck Rogers stories and the PGM-11 Redstone rocket.",
              "[4] That early version also contained a randomly generated background star field, initially added by Russell because a blank background made it difficult to tell the relative motion of the two spaceships at slow speeds.",
              "[2] The programming community in the area, including the Hingham Institute and the TMRC, had developed what was later termed the \"hacker ethic\", whereby all programs were freely shared and modified by other programmers in a collaborative environment without concern for ownership or copyright, which led to a group effort to elaborate on Russell's initial Spacewar!",
              "game.",
              "[4][13] Consequently, since the inaccuracy and lack of realism in the starfield annoyed TMRC member Peter Samson, he wrote a program based on real star charts that scrolled slowly through the night sky, including every star in a band between 22.",
              "5\u00b0 N and 22.",
              "5\u00b0 S down to the fifth magnitude, displayed at their relative brightness.",
              "The program was called \"Expensive Planetarium\"\u2014referring to the high price of the PDP-1 computer compared to an analog planetarium, as part of the series of \"expensive\" programs like Piner's Expensive Typewriter\u2014and was quickly incorporated into the game in March by Russell, who served as the collator of the primary version of the game.",
              "[2][4][7] The initial version of the game also did not include the central star gravity well or the hyperspace feature;",
              "they were written by MIT graduate student and TMRC member Dan Edwards and Graetz respectively to add elements of a strategy to what initially was a shooter game of pure reflexes.",
              "[2][4] Russell had previously wanted to add gravity, but was unable to get the program to perform the calculations fast enough;",
              "Edwards optimized the drawing functions to free up processing time to calculate the effects of gravity.",
              "[15] The initial version of the hyperspace function was limited to three jumps, but carried no risk save possibly re-entering the game in a dangerous position;",
              "later versions removed the limit but added the increasing risk of destroying the ship instead of moving it.",
              "Additionally, in March 1962, Saunders created gamepads for the game, to counter \"Space War Elbow\" from sitting hunched over the mainframe toggles.",
              "[2][4] The game was a multiplayer-only game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship.",
              "[7][16] Similarly, other proposed additions to the game such as a more refined explosion display upon the destruction of a spaceship and having the torpedoes also be affected by gravity had to be abandoned as there were not enough computer resources to handle them while smoothly running the game.",
              "[2] One feature, having the speed and direction of torpedoes differ slightly with each shot, was added and then removed by Russell after player complaints.",
              "[15] With the added features and changes in place, Russell and the other programmers shifted focus from developing the game to preparing to show it off to others such as at the MIT Science Open House at the end of April 1962.",
              "[2][10][17][18] The group added a time limit, the hyperspace function, and a larger, second screen for viewers at the demonstration, and in May Graetz presented a paper about the game, \"SPACEWAR!",
              "Real-Time Capability of the PDP-1\", at the first meeting of the Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society.",
              "[2][19] The demonstration was a success, and the game proved very popular at MIT;",
              "the laboratory that hosted the PDP-1 soon banned play except during lunch and after working hours.",
              "[2][20] Visitors such as Frederik Pohl, the editor of Galaxy Science Fiction, enjoyed playing the \"lovely game\" and wrote that MIT was \"borrowing from the science-fiction magazines\", with players able to pretend to be Skylark characters.",
              "[21] Beginning in mid-1962 and continuing over the next few years, members of the PDP-1 programming community at MIT, including Russell and the other Hingham Institute members, began to spread out to other schools and employers such as Stanford University and DEC, and as they did they spread the game to other universities and institutions with a PDP-1 computer.",
              "[2][7][19] As a result, Spacewar!",
              "was perhaps the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.",
              "[22] Over the next decade, programmers at these other institutions began coding their own variants, including features such as allowing more ships and players at once, replacing the hyperspace feature with a cloaking device, space mines, and even a first-person perspective version played on two screens that simulates each pilot's view out of the cockpit.",
              "[5][6] Some of these Spacewar!",
              "installations also replicated Saunders' gamepad.",
              "[23] DEC learned about the game soon after its creation, and gave demonstrations of it running on their PDP-1, as well as publishing a brochure about the game and the computer in 1963.",
              "[19] According to a second-hand account heard by Russell while working at DEC, Spacewar!",
              "was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping because it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware.",
              "[13][23] Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: while less expensive than most mainframe computers, the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 (equivalent to about $1,161,000 in 2022) and only 53 were ever sold, most without a monitor and many of the remainder to secure military locations or research labs with no free computer time, which prevented the original Spacewar!",
              "from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience.",
              "[7][19][23] Though some later DEC models, such as the PDP-6, came with Spacewar!",
              "pre-loaded, the audience for the game remained very limited;",
              "the PDP-6, for example, sold only 23 units.",
              "[8][24] Spacewar!",
              "was extremely popular in the small programming community in the 1960s and was widely recreated on other minicomputer and mainframe computers of the time before migrating to early microcomputer systems in the 1970s.",
              "Just as it was during development, the game was in the public domain and the code was available to anyone with access to it or who contacted Russell;",
              "no attempt was made to sell it commercially, as the programming community was too small to support any commercial industry.",
              "[19][25] It spread initially both by people bringing copies of the code to other installations as well as by programmers recreating the game with their own code.",
              "[23] Early installations included the PDP-1 at Bolt, Beranek, & Newman, which also recreated the gamepads;",
              "an installation by Russell on a PDP-1 at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of Stanford University in 1963;",
              "and the University of Minnesota, where MIT graduate Albert Kuhfield in 1967\u201368 recreated the game for the CDC 3100, and submitted a description to Analog Science Fiction and Fact, published in 1971.",
              "The Stanford installation was so popular that in 1966 the researchers created a special \"Spacewar mode\" for time-sharing computer resources on their PDP-6 so that games could be played on it while research programs were also being run.",
              "[19] Early computer scientist Alan Kay noted in 1972 that \"the game of Spacewar!",
              "blossoms spontaneously wherever there is a graphics display connected to a computer\", and Graetz recalled in 1981 that as the game initially spread it could be found on \"just about any research computer that had a programmable CRT\".",
              "[2][5] The majority of this spread took place several years after the initial development of the game;",
              "while there are early anecdotes of players and game variants at a handful of locations, primarily near MIT and Stanford, it was only after 1967 that computers hooked up to monitors or terminals capable of playing Spacewar!",
              "began to proliferate, allowing the game to reach a wider audience and influence later video game designers\u2014by 1971, it is estimated that there were over 1000 computers with monitors, rather than a few dozen.",
              "[23] It is around this time that the majority of the game variants were created for various computer systems, such as later PDP systems, and in 1972 the game was well known enough in the programming community that Rolling Stone sponsored the \"Intergalactic Spacewar!",
              "Olympics\".",
              "[5][23] The event was held on October 19, 1972, at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory using a variant of Spacewar!",

              "[2] One feature, having the speed and direction of torpedoes differ slightly with each shot, was added and then removed by Russell after player complaints.",
              "[15] With the added features and changes in place, Russell and the other programmers shifted focus from developing the game to preparing to show it off to others such as at the MIT Science Open House at the end of April 1962.",
              "[2][10][17][18] The group added a time limit, the hyperspace function, and a larger, second screen for viewers at the demonstration, and in May Graetz presented a paper about the game, \"SPACEWAR!",
              "Real-Time Capability of the PDP-1\", at the first meeting of the Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society.",
              "[2][19] The demonstration was a success, and the game proved very popular at MIT;",
              "the laboratory that hosted the PDP-1 soon banned play except during lunch and after working hours.",
              "[2][20] Visitors such as Frederik Pohl, the editor of Galaxy Science Fiction, enjoyed playing the \"lovely game\" and wrote that MIT was \"borrowing from the science-fiction magazines\", with players able to pretend to be Skylark characters.",
              "[21] Beginning in mid-1962 and continuing over the next few years, members of the PDP-1 programming community at MIT, including Russell and the other Hingham Institute members, began to spread out to other schools and employers such as Stanford University and DEC, and as they did they spread the game to other universities and institutions with a PDP-1 computer.",
              "[2][7][19] As a result, Spacewar!",
              "was perhaps the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.",
              "[22] Over the next decade, programmers at these other institutions began coding their own variants, including features such as allowing more ships and players at once, replacing the hyperspace feature with a cloaking device, space mines, and even a first-person perspective version played on two screens that simulates each pilot's view out of the cockpit.",
              "[5][6] Some of these Spacewar!",
              "installations also replicated Saunders' gamepad.",
              "[23] DEC learned about the game soon after its creation, and gave demonstrations of it running on their PDP-1, as well as publishing a brochure about the game and the computer in 1963.",
              "[19] According to a second-hand account heard by Russell while working at DEC, Spacewar!",
              "was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping because it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware.",
              "[13][23] Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: while less expensive than most mainframe computers, the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 (equivalent to about $1,161,000 in 2022) and only 53 were ever sold, most without a monitor and many of the remainder to secure military locations or research labs with no free computer time, which prevented the original Spacewar!",
              "from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience.",
              "[7][19][23] Though some later DEC models, such as the PDP-6, came with Spacewar!",
              "pre-loaded, the audience for the game remained very limited;",
              "the PDP-6, for example, sold only 23 units.",
              "[8][24] Spacewar!",
              "was extremely popular in the small programming community in the 1960s and was widely recreated on other minicomputer and mainframe computers of the time before migrating to early microcomputer systems in the 1970s.",
              "Just as it was during development, the game was in the public domain and the code was available to anyone with access to it or who contacted Russell;",
              "no attempt was made to sell it commercially, as the programming community was too small to support any commercial industry.",
              "[19][25] It spread initially both by people bringing copies of the code to other installations as well as by programmers recreating the game with their own code.",
              "[23] Early installations included the PDP-1 at Bolt, Beranek, & Newman, which also recreated the gamepads;",
              "an installation by Russell on a PDP-1 at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of Stanford University in 1963;",
              "and the University of Minnesota, where MIT graduate Albert Kuhfield in 1967\u201368 recreated the game for the CDC 3100, and submitted a description to Analog Science Fiction and Fact, published in 1971.",
              "The Stanford installation was so popular that in 1966 the researchers created a special \"Spacewar mode\" for time-sharing computer resources on their PDP-6 so that games could be played on it while research programs were also being run.",
              "[19] Early computer scientist Alan Kay noted in 1972 that \"the game of Spacewar!",
              "blossoms spontaneously wherever there is a graphics display connected to a computer\", and Graetz recalled in 1981 that as the game initially spread it could be found on \"just about any research computer that had a programmable CRT\".",
              "[2][5] The majority of this spread took place several years after the initial development of the game;",
              "while there are early anecdotes of players and game variants at a handful of locations, primarily near MIT and Stanford, it was only after 1967 that computers hooked up to monitors or terminals capable of playing Spacewar!",

              "[23] It is around this time that the majority of the game variants were created for various computer systems, such as later PDP systems, and in 1972 the game was well known enough in the programming community that Rolling Stone sponsored the \"Intergalactic Spacewar!",

              "While the high price of a minicomputer prevented such a game from being feasible then, in 1971 Tuck and Bill Pitts created a prototype coin-operated computer game, Galaxy Game, with a US$20,000 (equivalent to about $145,000 in 2022) PDP-11, though they never produced more than two prototypes exhibited at Stanford.",
              "[27] Around the same time, a second prototype coin-operated game based on Spacewar!",

              "[28] Though Tuck felt that Computer Space was a poor imitation of Spacewar!",
              "and his Galaxy Game a superior adaptation, many players believed both arcade games to be upgraded variants of Spacewar!",

              "[30] More modern recreations of the game for computers have been made as well.",

              "Each player controlled a ship via the mainframe's front-panel test switches or optional external control boxes, adjusting each respective craft's rotation, thrust, fire, and hyperspace (a random, evasive screen jump that could cause the user's ship to explode).",
              "Over the years, the game was improved many times and inspired many clones and spiritual successors, including the first commercially sold arcade video game in 1971, Computer Space, which was designed by Bushnell and Dabney for Nutting Associates.",

              "Bushnell, who can perhaps best be described as an entrepreneur with a vision and background in engineering, was able to identify the root cause of Computer Space's failure -- it was implicitly designed for the enjoyment of his engineering friends -- and banked on the simplicity of Pong, right down to its angular wooden cabinet and controls, to drive the success of his new company, Atari.",
              "Unfortunately for Bushnell's still undeniably impressive legacy, it has been proven that he took the idea for Pong from inventor Ralph Baer, who designed the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey.",
              "Baer conceived the basic ideas behind the Odyssey during the 1950s, but his concept for a television video game was so novel that he was unable to garner enough support to even build working prototypes until the mid 1960s.",

              "The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box that connects to a television set, and two rectangular controllers attached by wires.",
              "It is capable of displaying three square dots and one line of varying height on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played.",
              "Players place plastic overlays on the screen to display additional visual elements for each game, and one or two players for each game control their dots with the knobs and buttons on the controller by the rules given for the game.",
              "The console cannot generate audio or track scores.",
              "The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia to accompany the games, while a peripheral controller\u2014the first video game light gun\u2014was sold separately.",
              "The idea for a video game console was conceived by Baer in August 1966.",
              "Over the next three years he, along with Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch, created seven successive prototype consoles.",
              "The seventh, known as the Brown Box, was shown to several manufacturers before Magnavox agreed to produce it in January 1971.",
              "After releasing the console through their dealerships, Magnavox sold 69,000 units in its first calendar year and 350,000 by the time the console was discontinued in 1975.",
              "The console spawned the Odyssey series of dedicated consoles as well as the 1978 Magnavox Odyssey 2.",
              "One of the 28 games made for the system, a ping-pong game, was an inspiration for Atari's successful 1972 Pong arcade game, in turn driving sales of the Odyssey.",
              "Patents by Baer and the other developers for the system and the games, including what was termed by a judge as \"the pioneering patent of the video game art\", formed the basis of a series of lawsuits spanning 20 years, earning Sanders and Magnavox over US$100 million.",
              "The release of the Odyssey marked the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles and was an early part of the rise of the commercial video game industry.",
              "The Odyssey consists of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers.",
              "The console connects to the television set through an included switch box, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel on channel three or four, which thereafter became the standard for game consoles.",
              "[1] The controllers, designed to sit on a flat surface, contain one button marked Reset on the top of the controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other.",
              "The reset button resets individual elements depending on the game, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off.",
              "The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included;",
              "an optional AC power supply was sold separately.",
              "[2] The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.",
              "[3] Internally, the Odyssey architecture is composed of digital computing parts.",
              "The circuitry is implemented in diode\u2013transistor logic using discrete transistors and diodes.",
              "The games themselves do not use ROM cartridges like later consoles, but instead, use \"game cards\" composed of printed circuit boards that plug into the console.",
              "These cards modify the internal circuitry like a set of switches or jumpers, causing the Odyssey to display different components and react to inputs differently.",
              "Multiple games use the same cards, with different instructions given to the player to change the style of the game.",
              "[4] The Odyssey is capable of displaying three square dots and a vertical line on the screen.",
              "Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself.",
              "The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts the speed of the computer-controlled dot.",
              "Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, such as changing the center line of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game.",
              "The games include plastic overlays that stick to the television via static cling to create visuals.",
              "Games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.",
              "[4] In addition to the overlays, the Odyssey came with dice, poker chips, score sheets, play money, and card decks.",
              "[5] One peripheral controller was released for the Odyssey, the first video game light gun.",
              "Named the Shooting Gallery, the rifle-shaped device registered a hit when pointed at a light source such as a dot on the television screen.",
              "[3] Four shooting-based games were included with the light gun.",
              "[6] In 1951, while working for a military contractor Loral Electronics, engineer Ralph H.",
              "Baer was assigned to build a television set;",
              "Baer later claimed that while doing so he had the idea to build something into a television set that the owner could control in addition to its normal function of receiving signals from a remote television station.",
              "Loral did not pursue the idea, but it returned to Baer in August 1966 while waiting for a bus.",
              "[1] Baer, then the head of the Equipment Design Division at military contractor Sanders Associates, came up with the concept of using a television to play games, and the next morning wrote up a four-page proposal for a \"game box\" that would plug into a television screen, costing around US$25.",
              "[7][8] The proposed device would transmit a signal that the television set could tune into like a television channel, which Baer referred to as Channel LP, short for \"let's play\", and he described several games that could be played on it.",
              "[1][7] While electronic computer games had been developed since the start of the 1950s, they were typically only found in large academic or research institutions, and in 1966 no commercial games or video game industry existed, or any form of video games for consumer television sets.",
              "[7][9] As a \"game box\" had little to do with the typical military contracts Sanders worked on, Baer picked an empty room and assigned one of his technicians, Bob Tremblay, to work on it with him rather than bring the idea to his bosses.",
              "[1][8] By December 1966, they had completed an initial prototype later christened \"TV Game #1\", which could display and move a vertical line on a television screen.",
              "Baer demonstrated the prototype to the Sanders director of research and development, Herbert Campman, who hesitantly agreed to fund it for US$2,000 for labor and US$500 for materials, making it an official project.",
              "[1] Baer spent the next few months designing further prototypes, and in February 1967, assigned technician Bill Harrison to begin building the project.",
              "Harrison spent the next few months in between other projects building out successive modifications to the prototype.",
              "[1] Baer, meanwhile, brainstormed with engineer Bill Rusch on ideas for games for the console, resulting in a proposal for the basis of many games later created for the system.",
              "Harrison began developing some early games in May, beginning with a two-player game where the players repeatedly press a button in competition to fill or empty a bucket of water, and by June multiple games were completed for what was then a second prototype box.",
              "[10] These included a game where players controlled dots chasing each other and a light gun shooter game with a plastic rifle.",
              "Baer demonstrated the new prototype to Campman, who enjoyed the shooting game, increased funding, and recommended Baer demonstrate the project to senior management.",
              "[7][10] Baer demonstrated the console to the board, who were largely uninterested, though a couple of members were enthusiastic;",
              "nevertheless, CEO Royden Sanders authorized the project to be continued with the aim of selling or licensing the console as a commercial product.",
              "[7][8][10] By August 1967, Baer and Harrison completed a more focused prototype machine with fewer components, but found that to even come near to Baer's initial price target of US$25 (equivalent to about $219 in 2022) the console would require so much to be excluded that the resulting product would not be very enjoyable.",
              "Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system;",
              "to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project.",
              "[10] Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming up with a way to display a third, console-controlled spot on the screen in addition to the previous two player-controlled ones, and proposing the development of a ping-pong game.",
              "[7][10] By November, the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping-pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping-pong game.",
              "Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it;",
              "they had decided to sell the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.",
              "[10] The team first approached the cable television industry, and the prototype attracted the attention of TelePrompTer Corporation, who had seen it during a visit.",
              "After a few months of talks, cash-flow problems forced TelePrompter to back out in April 1968.",
              "[7] The same economic downturn that caused TelePrompter's problems caused financial difficulties at Sanders as well, which put the project on hold after the fifth prototype was developed while simultaneously undergoing large-scale layoffs.",
              "It was picked up again in September, this time without Rusch, and went through two more iterations resulting in January 1969 in the seventh prototype, known as the \"Brown Box\" due to the wood-grain stickers on the casing.",
              "[11] With the system now largely complete, as the team began filing for patents they were unsure whom to approach to sell it until a Sanders patent attorney recommended contacting television manufacturers.",
              "Baer demonstrated the system to several companies, who all expressed enthusiasm;",
              "only RCA wanted to purchase the device, however, and an agreement could not be reached.",
              "Soon afterwards, though, RCA executive Bill Enders left RCA for Magnavox and convinced them to look at the console again.",
              "The creators of the Brown Box again demonstrated the device to Magnavox in July 1969;",
              "they received a tepid reaction from most of the executives, but Vice President of Magnavox Console Products Planning Gerry Martin was in favor, and Magnavox agreed to produce the console.",
              "After a long period of negotiations the two companies finally signed an agreement in January 1971.",
              "[12][13] A team from Magnavox led by George Kent turned the prototype console into a final product.",
              "They designed the exterior of the machine and re-engineered some of the internals with consultation from Baer and Harrison;",
              "they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console.",
              "[11] At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations.",
              "[14] The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns, and although integrated circuits were becoming common by 1972 Magnavox did not redesign the circuitry to use them.",
              "[4] The games for the system were designed by Ron Bradford of Bradford/Cout Design and adman Steve Lehner, based largely on the ones developed by Baer, Harrison, and Rusch.",
              "[6] The product planning for the console was initially overseen by Bob Wiles of the color television division, but was turned over to product manager Bob Fritsche as its own category of product in September 1971.",
              "[11] Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey.",
              "[12] The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, to go along with the plastic overlays for the games designed by Bradford that enhanced the primitive visuals.",
              "[6] The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.",
              "95 (equivalent to about $699 in 2022).",
              "[11] Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players.",
              "[12][15] Magnavox performed market surveys and playtests in Los Angeles and Grand Rapids, Michigan, and demonstrated it to dealers in Las Vegas in May 1972.",
              "The console was publicly unveiled at a press event at the Tavern on the Green in New York City on May 22, 1972.",
              "Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, with availability restricted to dealers in 18 metropolitan areas, and demonstrated it for the next few months to Magnavox dealerships and media.",
              "[11] Magnavox began advertising the Odyssey in mid-September 1972, including an appearance on the game show What's My Line?",
              "on October 16, 1972.",
              "As the term \"video game\" was not yet in use, the company described the console as \"the new electronic game of the future\" and \"closed-circuit electronic playground\".",
              "[16][17] Magnavox initially ordered 50,000 units, but before release increased its production capabilities and built a larger inventory, as market testing found an enthusiastic response to the console.",
              "The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers, who handled their own advertising in their local markets;",
              "the company hoped that as the video game console was the first such product, consumers would visit its stores specifically for it.",
              "[6][17] There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972.",
              "Magnavox only sold 69,000 units.",
              "[6][18][19] Baer believed that the low initial sales were due to the high price, and because Magnavox restricted sales to its dealerships and implied that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions.",
              "[6][15][19] Other sources have stated that dealers may have misled customers to sell more televisions, though advertisements and in-store promotional videos explicitly stated that the Odyssey worked with \"any brand TV, black and white or color\".",
              "[17][20] Customers unfamiliar with the new device, seeing it was only sold at Magnavox dealerships, may have misunderstood its interoperability.",
              "[16][17][21] Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry said that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not the production run.",
              "[4] After the initial holiday season Magnavox considered discontinuing the console, but the modest continuing demand, along with high customer satisfaction reports in surveys, convinced it to continue stocking the console.",
              "[22] Magnavox published two catalogs each year, one before the Christmas season and another for its annual sale in January.",
              "The Odyssey did not appear in the pre-Christmas 1972 catalog, but the January 1973 catalog depicted the console in a two-page spread with pictures of bundled and optional games and the light gun.",
              "[17] Fritsche's team proposed the creation of alternate versions of the Odyssey, a \"lite\" version with five games and a version with four controllers and a dozen new or updated games.",
              "Baer proposed an add-on that would add sound to games, and a putting controller and associated golf game.",
              "[22][23] Magnavox rejected the proposals, instead releasing four games for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Emry.",
              "[4][22] Although still only available at Magnavox dealers, national marketing for Odyssey began in late 1973.",
              "[17] The company lowered the price to US$50 if purchased with a television.",
              "[16][17][22] The console was released that year with different games in 12 other countries: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Soviet Union, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela.",

              "[22] The result was the first of several dedicated consoles\u2014consoles that could only play games built into the system\u2014in the Magnavox Odyssey series, the Magnavox Odyssey 100 and Magnavox Odyssey 200, as part of the first generation of video game consoles;",

              "[4][23] While a few clone systems were produced in limited quantities, and multiple dedicated systems\u2014generally focused on ping-pong game variants\u2014were created by several companies, no other home video consoles capable of playing separately-produced games were released until the 1976 Fairchild Semiconductor Channel F.",
              "[4] Due to his work on the Odyssey, Baer has been referred to as the \"Father of Video Games\".",
              "[29] In 2004, Baer was awarded the National Medal of Technology for \"his groundbreaking and pioneering creation, development and commercialization of interactive video games, which spawned related uses, applications, and mega-industries in both the entertainment and education realms\".",

              "[12] Inspired, when he and Ted Dabney quit Nutting to found Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping-pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game.",
              "Alcorn soon developed Pong (1972), which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game.",
              "Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey;",
              "Baer noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card.",
              "In April 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors, including Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and arcade distributor Empire, for infringing on its patents for video games played on a television screen.",
              "[12][34] Two more lawsuits joined it by 1975, against Sears, Nutting, Williams Electronics, and others.",
              "[34] Baer later stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits.",
              "[23] The root of the conflict was a set of patents by Baer and the development team\u2014particularly a pair which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, with one patent by Baer and one by Rusch.",
              "[33][35] The judge, John Grady, ruled in early 1977 that Baer's patent for the Odyssey constituted \"the pioneering patent of the video game art\", held the defendants' games as infringing, and set a precedent that any video game where a machine-controlled visual element hit and bounced off a player-controlled element violated Rusch's patent.",
              "At the time of judgement, only Seeburg Corporation and Chicago Dynamic Industries\u2014though bankrupt\u2014remained out of the defendants of the initial three lawsuits, with all other companies having settled out of court.",

              "[12][18][36] Over the next twenty years, Sanders and Magnavox sued several other companies over the issue, focusing on \"paddle-and-ball\" type games like Pong and Table Tennis that more clearly violated the patent;",
              "the final lawsuits ended in the mid-1990s.",
              "[8][23] Defendants included Coleco, Mattel, Seeburg, and Activision;",
              "Sanders and Magnavox won or settled every lawsuit.",
              "[8][37][38] Many of the defendants unsuccessfully attempted to claim that the patents only applied to the specific hardware implementations that Baer had used, or that they were invalidated by prior computer or electronic games.",
              "[39] In 1985, Nintendo sued and tried to invalidate the patents, claiming as prior art the 1958 Tennis for Two game built by William Higinbotham.",
              "The court, however, ruled that the oscilloscope-based game did not use video signals and therefore did not qualify as a video game, and ruled again in favor of Magnavox and Sanders.",
              "[3] Magnavox won more than US$100 million in the various lawsuits and settlements involving the Odyssey related patents before they expired in the early 1990s.",

              "The crash was attributed to several factors, including market saturation in the number of video game consoles and available games, many of which were of poor quality.",
              "Waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers also played a role.",
              "Home video game revenue peaked at around $3.",
              "2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent).",
              "The crash abruptly ended what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America.",
              "To a lesser extent, the arcade video game market also weakened as the golden age of arcade video games came to an end.",
              "Lasting about two years, the crash shook a then-booming video game industry and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles.",
              "Analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of video game consoles and software.",
              "The North American video game console industry recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of Nintendo's Western branding for its Famicom console, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), released in October 1985.",
              "The NES was designed to avoid the missteps that caused the 1983 crash and the stigma associated with video games at that time.",
              "The Atari Video Computer System (renamed the Atari 2600 in late 1982) was not the first home system with swappable game cartridges.",
              "By the early 1980s, it was the most popular second-generation console by a wide margin.",
              "Launched in 1977 just ahead of the collapse of the market for home Pong console clones, the Atari VCS experienced modest sales for its first few years.",

              "Notably, Coleco sold an add-on allowing Atari VCS games to be played on its ColecoVision, as well as bundling the console with a licensed home version of Nintendo's arcade hit Donkey Kong.",
              "In 1982, the ColecoVision held roughly 17% of the hardware market, compared to Atari VCS' 58%.",
              "This was the first real threat to Atari's dominance of the home console market.",
              "[3] Each new console had its own library of games produced exclusively by the console maker, while the Atari VCS also had a large selection of titles produced by third-party developers.",
              "In 1982, analysts marked trends of saturation, mentioning that the amount of new software coming in would only allow a few big hits, that retailers had devoted too much floor space to systems, and that price drops for home computers could result in an industry shakeup.",
              "[4] In addition, the rapid growth of the videogame industry led to an increased demand, which the manufacturers over-projected.",

              "[5] Prior to 1979, there were no third-party developers, with console manufacturers like Atari publishing all the games for their respective platforms. This changed with the formation of Activision in 1979.",
              "Activision was founded by four former Atari video game programmers who left the company because they felt that Atari's developers should receive the same recognition and accolades (specifically in the form of sales-based royalties and public-facing credits) as the actors, directors, and musicians working for other subsidiaries of Warner Communications (Atari's parent company at the time).",
              "Already being quite familiar with the Atari VCS, the four programmers developed their own games and cartridge manufacturing processes.",

              "[13] Activision, Atari, and Mattel all had experienced programmers, but many of the new companies rushing to join the market did not have the expertise or talent to create quality games.",
              "Titles such as the Kaboom!",
              "-like Lost Luggage, rock band tie-in Journey Escape, and plate-spinning game Dishaster, were examples of games made in the hopes of taking advantage of the video-game boom, but later proved unsuccessful with retailers and potential customers.",
              "The flood of new games was released into a limited competitive space.",
              "According to Activision's Jim Levy, they had projected that the total cartridge market in 1982 would be around 60 million, anticipating Activision would be able to secure between 12% and 15% of that market for their production numbers.",
              "However, with at least 50 different companies in the new marketspace, and each having produced between one and two million cartridges, along with Atari's own estimated 60 million cartridges in 1982, there was over 200% production of the actual demand for cartridges in 1982, which contributed to the stockpiling of unsold inventory during the crash.",
              "[14] Prior to 1982, Atari was considered the dominant company in the home video game industry, but as described above, new players in the hardware market and the loss of publishing control caused the company to slip from its dominant position.",
              "[3] During 1982, Atari took several missteps in trying to regain its dominance that caused the market and consumers to lose confidence in the company and in turn the video game industry as a whole.",
              "[15] One factor was around certain games Atari chose to publish, as by this point, with the company owned by Warner Communication, it was more focused on business opportunities rather than innovation.",
              "Many of its executives were MBAs, and looked for any business opportunity that would give them an edge over other third-party game publishers.",
              "[15] Coleco's deal with Nintendo for Donkey Kong was a major threat to Atari.",
              "[3] Atari had had past success with its own licenses of arcade hits ported to the Atari VCS, but also had begun to look for other lucrative licensing opportunities that they could differentiate themselves from other companies.",
              "[9] Two games released in 1982, often cited retrospectively as major contributors to the crash, contributed to weakening Atari's consumer confidence: Pac-Man, and E.",

              "A second, highly visible result of the crash was the advancement of measures to control third-party development of software.",
              "Using secrecy to combat industrial espionage had failed to stop rival companies from reverse engineering the Mattel and Atari systems and hiring away their trained game programmers.",
              "While Mattel and Coleco implemented lockout measures to control third-party development (the ColecoVision BIOS checked for a copyright string on power-up), the Atari 2600 was completely unprotected and once information on its hardware became available, little prevented anyone from making games for the system.",
              "Nintendo thus instituted a strict licensing policy for the NES that included equipping the cartridge and console with lockout chips, which were region-specific, and had to match in order for a game to work.",
              "In addition to preventing the use of unlicensed games, it also was designed to combat software piracy, rarely a problem in North America or Western Europe, but rampant in East Asia.",
              "The concepts of such a control system remain in use on every major video game console produced today, even with fewer \"cartridge-based\" consoles on the market than in the 8/16-bit era.",
              "Replacing the security chips in most modern consoles are specially encoded optical discs that cannot be copied by most users and can only be read by a particular console under normal circumstances.",

              "Several publishers, notably Tengen (Atari Games), Color Dreams, and Camerica, challenged Nintendo's control system during the 8-bit era by producing unlicensed NES games.",
              "Initially, Nintendo was the only developer for the Famicom.",
              "Under pressure from Namco and Hudson Soft, it opened the Famicom to third-party development, but instituted a license fee of 30% per game cartridge for these third-parties to develop games, a system used by console manufactures to this day.",
              "[64] Nintendo maintained strict manufacturing control and requiring payment in full before manufacturing.",
              "Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the financial risk of selling all units ordered.",
              "Nintendo limited most third-party publishers to only five games per year on its systems (some companies tried to get around this by creating additional company labels like Konami's Ultra Games label).",
              "Nintendo ultimately dropped this rule by 1993, after the release of the successor Super Nintendo Entertainment System.",
              "[65] Nintendo's strong-armed oversight of Famicom cartridge manufacturing led to both legitimate and bootleg unlicensed cartridges to be made in the Asian regions.",
              "Nintendo placed its Nintendo Seal of Quality on all licensed games released for the system to try to promote authenticity and detract from bootleg sales, but failed to make significant traction to stalling these sales.",
              "[66] As Nintendo prepared to release the Famicom in the United States, it wanted to avoid both the bootleg problem it had in Asia as well as the mistakes that led up to the 1983 crash.",
              "The company created the proprietary 10NES system, a lockout chip which was designed to prevent cartridges made without the chip from being played on the NES.",
              "The 10NES lockout was not perfect, as later in the NES' lifecycle methods were found to bypass it, but it did sufficiently allow Nintendo to strengthen its publishing control to avoid the mistakes Atari had made and initially prevent bootleg cartridges in the Western markets.",
              "[67] These strict licensing measures backfired somewhat after Nintendo was accused of monopolistic behavior.",
              "[68] In the long run, this pushed many western third-party publishers such as Electronic Arts away from Nintendo consoles and supported competing consoles such as the Sega Genesis or Sony PlayStation.",
              "Most of the Nintendo platform-control measures were adopted by later console manufacturers such as Sega, Sony, and Microsoft, although not as stringently.",
              "With waning console interests in the United States, the computer game market was able to gain a strong foothold in 1983 and beyond.",
              "[60] Developers that had been primarily in the console games space, like Activision, turned their attention to developing computer game titles to stay viable.",
              "[60] Newer companies also were founded to capture the growing interest in the computer games space with novel elements that borrowed from console games, as well as taking advantage of low-cost dial-up modems that allowed for multiplayer capabilities.",
              "[60] The computer game market grew between 1983 and 1984, overtaking the console market, but overall video game revenue had declined significantly due to the considerable decline of the console market as well as the arcade market to an extent.",
              "[53] The home computer industry, however, experienced a downturn in mid-1984,[69] with global computer game sales declining in 1985 to a certain extent.",
              "[53] Microcomputers dominated the European market throughout the 1980s and with domestic production for those formats thriving over the same period, there was minimal trans-Atlantic ripple from American game production and trends.",
              "[16] Partly as a distant knock-on effect of the crash and partly due to the continuing quality of homegrown computer and microcomputer games, consoles did not achieve a dominant position in some European markets until the early 1990s.",
              "[70] In the United Kingdom, there was a short-lived home console market between 1980 and 1982, but the 1983 crash led to the decline of consoles in the UK, which was offset by the rise of LCD games in 1983 and then the rise of computer games in 1984.",
              "It was not until the late 1980s with the arrival of the Master System and NES that the home console market recovered in the UK.",
              "Computer games remained the dominant sector of the UK home video game market up until they were surpassed by Sega and Nintendo consoles in 1991.",

              "Nintendo The name brings certain images to mind: an undeniable behemoth in the gaming industry, colorful characters like Mario, Link, Pikachu, Kirby and more, and family fun.",
              "It could be argued that Nintendo, in a sense, is the messiah of the gaming industry.",
              "After the game market crashed in the days of Atari and E.",
              "T.",
              ", Nintendo brought forth the NES and saved the world of games.",
              "Despite the incredible success of the NES and its successor, the SNES, the years passed and Nintendo seemed to be losing traction.",
              "The Gamecube was successful, but after the almost exclusively family-friendly library of the Wii, the Wii U couldn\u2019t hold a candle to its competitors in terms of technical prowess or unit sales.",
              "For a while, many people were left asking one question.",
              "\u201cWhat happened to Nintendo?",
              "\u201d Nintendo has always had a philosophy that revolved around creating a great experience for its consumers.",
              "In the first days of 3D, Nintendo made the mistake of staying with cartridges as opposed to the newly emerging CDs, but the argument was that cartridges would load faster and were the only medium suitable for the complex 3D graphics that systems would have to load.",
              "It was a mistake done to try and improve the player experience.",
              "When they realized their choice was wrong, they fixed their issue with the Gamecube, moving over to mini-discs that still offered greater storage space but fast load times, while also helping to protect Nintendo games from piracy.",
              "Then the Wii came out.",
              "While systems like the Xbox 360 focused on hardware power, Nintendo looked to make an affordable game system with revolutionary motion technology.",
              "A system that the whole family could play on together, enjoy, and not break the bank.",
              "Everything up to this point had been great for Nintendo, but the Wii U proved to be the black sheep of the family.",
              "The system\u2019s core values became drowned in the gimmicks of the gamepad and poor marketing.",
              "People didn\u2019t even know what the Wii U was, with many believing it to be an incredibly expensive expansion to the Wii.",
              "With a high price that didn\u2019t match the power and steep competition from Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo seemed to be trying to break into more adult territory with the Wii U\u2019s slightly more diverse and mature library, yet didn\u2019t bring a system with the chops necessary to do so.",
              "The Wii U, while an excellent system in its own right, lost way of the Nintendo vision and was a commercial failure.",
              "Then, sometime in the last couple years, something incredible happened.",
              "Nintendo\u2019s secret project, \u201cNX\u201d had some details leaked.",
              "For the first time, we were introduced to the idea that Nintendo was making a system that could be both portable AND a home console.",
              "When I first saw the rumors, I thought this would be the end for Nintendo.",
              "They had already been failing because of high prices for weak, gimmicky hardware.",
              "Now they were going to make a system which was expected to perform as a home console, but using a platform limited to the power-saving nature of portable devices?",
              "I was prepared to mourn Nintendo as a hardware company, expecting them to go the way of Sega after their swan song, the Dreamcast, still wasn\u2019t enough to save them from failing hardware sales.",
              "However, Nintendo did the unthinkable.",
              "The Wii U was the martyr that made Nintendo realize they\u2019d lost their way, and the great new maverick that is the Nintendo Switch emerged, as if from nothing.",
              "Boasting a portable form factor, a focus on flexibility and multiplayer fun, an HD 720p display, and quite satisfying battery life, the Nintendo Switch is a true no-compromises system.",
              "For the first time ever, a player can bring graphically-intensive games on the go, play them at high resolution, and make it through a whole cross-country plane trip without running out of power.",
              "The Nintendo Switch is a shocking success story, delivering absolute grand-slams of video games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, BOTH of which are acclaimed as the best games in their series (and Game of the Year in terms of Zelda).",
              "The best part?",
              "When the day is over and you\u2019ve made it home, you can slide the switch into its dock and play games on your home television, in the beautiful FHD 1080p that your 50\u2032\u2032 screen deserves.",
              "The Switch is something special, evidently more so than even Nintendo thought.",
              "They couldn\u2019t keep them on shelves when they were released, and it\u2019s quickly become the most sought-after gaming console to hit the market in a long time.",
              "It isn\u2019t an iterative improvement like the PS3 to the PS4, it\u2019s a revolution in Nintendo and in the gaming industry altogether.",
              "Yet, amazingly, it does all of this while returning to the focus of the player.",
              "The Switch isn\u2019t gimmicky.",
              "It genuinely puts the \u201cfun\u201d in functional and it can only get better as time goes on, with more fun games coming out daily.",
              "Personally I can\u2019t wait for Metroid Prime 4 to blow me away.",
              "Nintendo could not have impressed me more with this system.",
              "The Switch truly is a return to form for Nintendo and, more than anything, is a love letter to video games and the many players who enjoy them.",

              "We're right on the cusp of another generation of game consoles, and whether you're an Xbox One fanperson or a PlayStation 4 zealot, you probably know what's coming if you've been through a few of these cycles.",
              "The systems will launch in time for the holidays, each will have one or two decent launch titles, there will be perhaps a year or two when the new console and the old console coexist on store shelves, and then the \"next generation\" becomes the current generation\u2014until we do it all again a few years from now.",
              "For gamers born in or after the 1980s, this cycle has remained familiar even as old console makers have bowed out (Sega, Atari) and new ones have taken their place (Sony, Microsoft).",
              "It wasn't always this way.",
              "The system that began this cycle, resuscitating the American video game industry and setting up the third-party game publisher system as we know it, was the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), launched in Japan on July 15, 1983, as the Family Computer (or Famicom).",
              "Today, in celebration of the original Famicom's 30th birthday, we'll be taking a look back at what the console accomplished, how it worked, and how people are (through means both legal and illegal) keeping its games alive today.",
              "The Famicom wasn't Nintendo's first home console\u2014that honor goes to the Japan-only \"Color TV Game\" consoles, which were inexpensive units designed to play a few different variations of a single, built-in game.",
              "It was, however, Nintendo's first console to use interchangeable game cartridges.",
              "The original Japanese Famicom looked like some sort of hovercar with controllers stuck to it.",
              "The top-loading system used a 60-pin connector to accept its 3-inch-high, 5.",
              "3-inch-wide cartridges and originally had two hardwired controllers that could be stored in cradles on the side of the device (unlike the NES' removable controllers, these were permanently wired to the Famicom).",
              "The second controller had an integrated microphone in place of its start and select buttons.",
              "A 15-pin port intended for hardware add-ons was integrated into the front of the system\u2014we'll talk more about the accessories that used this port in a bit.",
              "After an initial hardware recall related to a faulty circuit on the motherboard, the console became quite successful in Japan based on the strength of arcade ports like Donkey Kong Jr.",
              "and original titles like Super Mario Bros.",
              "The North American version of the console was beset by several false starts, to say nothing of unfavorable marketing conditions.",
              "A distribution agreement with then-giant Atari fell through at the last minute after Atari executives saw a version of Nintendo's Donkey Kong running on Coleco's Adam computer at the 1983 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).",
              "By the time Atari was ready to negotiate again, the 1983 video game crash had crippled the American market, killing what would have been the \"Nintendo Enhanced Video System\" before it had a chance to live.",
              "Nintendo decided to go its own way.",
              "By the time 1985's CES rolled around, the company was ready to show a prototype of what had become the Nintendo Advanced Video System (AVS).",
              "This system was impressive in its ambition and came with accessories, including controllers, a light gun, and a cassette drive that were all meant to interface with the console wirelessly, via infrared.",
              "The still-terrible market for video games made such a complex (and, likely, expensive) system a tough sell, though, and after a lukewarm reception, Nintendo went back to the drawing board to work on what would become the Nintendo Entertainment System we still know and love today.",

              "[1] Arcade games, although still relatively popular in the early 1990s,[1] began to decline as home consoles became more common.",

              "[5][6] This transition was largely driven by a technological arms race between two of the largest arcade game manufacturers, Sega and Namco, during the early-to-mid-1990s.",

              "[5] Sega responded with the Sega Model 1,[7] which further popularized 3D polygons with Sega AM2 games including Virtua Racing (1992) and the fighting game Virtua Fighter (1993),[8][6] especially popularizing 3D polygon human characters.",

              "The Virtual Boy Controller was a controller which utilized dual joypads similar to how analog sticks functioned in later \"dual control\" sixth-generation systems. The presence of two pads was an effort to control objects in a 3D environment (one pad controlling pitch and turning while the other controlling forward movement and strafing).",
              "An analog stick sometimes called a control stick or thumbstick, is an input device for a game controller that is used for two-dimensional input.",

              "Online gaming, which had been the exclusive domain of PC games, became prominent in video game consoles starting with Dreamcast online functionality in 1999 with its built in modem, internet browsing software, and ability to play certain games online.",
              "Nearly all consoles since released then have had support for online gaming.",
              "Many technically innovative and genre-defining games were developed during the 1990s, largely due to the impact of 3D graphics allowing three-dimensional environments as well as optical discs which allowed much greater storage capacity.",
              "The release of Street Fighter II in 1991 is often considered a revolutionary moment in the fighting game genre.",
              "Yoshiki Okamoto's team developed the most accurate joystick and button scanning routine in the genre thus far.",
              "This allowed players to reliably execute multi-button special moves, which had previously required an element of luck.",
              "The game was also highly successful because its graphics took advantage of Capcom's CPS arcade chipset, with highly detailed characters and stages.",
              "Whereas previous games allowed players to combat a variety of computer-controlled fighters, Street Fighter II allowed players to play against each other.",
              "The popularity of Street Fighter II surprised the gaming industry, as arcade owners bought more machines to keep up with demand.",

              "The history of video games began in the 1950s and 1960s as computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations on minicomputers and mainframes.",
              "Spacewar!",
              "was developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) student hobbyists in 1962 as one of the first such games on a video display.",
              "The first consumer video game hardware was released in the early 1970s.",
              "The first home video game console was the Magnavox Odyssey, and the first arcade video games were Computer Space and Pong.",
              "After its home console conversions, numerous companies sprang up to capture Pong's success in both the arcade and the home by cloning the game, causing a series of boom and bust cycles due to oversaturation and lack of innovation.",
              "By the mid-1970s, low-cost programmable microprocessors replaced the discrete transistor\u2013transistor logic circuitry of early hardware, and the first ROM cartridge-based home consoles arrived, including the Atari Video Computer System (VCS).",
              "Coupled with rapid growth in the golden age of arcade video games, including Space Invaders and Pac-Man, the home console market also flourished.",
              "The 1983 video game crash in the United States was characterized by a flood of too many games, often of poor or cloned qualities, and the sector saw competition from inexpensive personal computers and new types of games being developed for them.",
              "The crash prompted Japan's video game industry to take leadership of the market, which had only suffered minor impacts from the crash.",
              "Nintendo released its Nintendo Entertainment System in the United States in 1985, helping to rebound the failing video games sector.",
              "The latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s included video games driven by improvements and standardization in personal computers and the console war competition between Nintendo and Sega as they fought for market share in the United States.",
              "The first major handheld video game consoles appeared in the 1990s, led by Nintendo's Game Boy platform.",
              "In the early 1990s, advancements in microprocessor technology gave rise to real-time 3D polygonal graphic rendering in game consoles, as well as in PCs by way of graphics cards.",
              "Optical media via CD-ROMs began to be incorporated into personal computers and consoles, including Sony's fledgling PlayStation console line, pushing Sega out of the console hardware market while diminishing Nintendo's role.",
              "By the late 1990s, the Internet also gained widespread consumer use, and video games began incorporating online elements.",
              "Microsoft entered the console hardware market in the early 2000s with its Xbox line, fearing that Sony's PlayStation positioned as a game console and entertainment device, would displace personal computers.",
              "While Sony and Microsoft continued to develop hardware for comparable top-end console features, Nintendo opted to focus on innovative gameplay.",
              "Nintendo developed the Wii with motion-sensing controls, which helped to draw in non-traditional players and helped to resecure Nintendo's position in the industry;",
              "Nintendo followed this same model in the release of the Nintendo Switch.",
              "From the 2000s and into the 2010s, the industry has seen a shift of demographics as mobile gaming on smartphones and tablets displaced handheld consoles, and casual gaming became an increasingly larger sector of the market, as well as a growth in the number of players from China and other areas not traditionally tied to the industry.",
              "To take advantage of these shifts, traditional revenue models were supplanted with ongoing revenue stream models such as free-to-play, freemium, and subscription-based games.",
              "As triple-A video game production became more costly and risk-averse, opportunities for more experimental and innovative independent game development grew over the 2000s and 2010s, aided by the popularity of mobile and casual gaming and the ease of digital distribution.",
              "Hardware and software technology continues to drive improvement in video games, with support for high-definition video at high framerates and for virtual and augmented reality-based games.",
              "As early as 1950, computer scientists were using electronic machines to construct relatively simple game systems, such as Bertie the Brain in 1950 to play tic tac toe, or Nimrod in 1951 for playing Nim.",
              "These systems used either electronic light displays and mainly as demonstration systems at large exhibitions to showcase the power of computers at the time.",
              "[1][2] Another early demonstration was Tennis for Two, a game created by William Higinbotham at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1958 for three-day exhibition, using an analog computer and an oscilloscope for a display.",
              "[3] Spacewar!",
              "is considered one of the first recognized video games that enjoyed wider distribution behind a single exhibition system.",
              "Developed in 1961 for the PDP-1 mainframe computer at MIT, it allowed two players to simulate a space combat fight on the PDP-1's relatively simplistic monitor.",
              "The game's source code was shared with other institutions with a PDP-1 across the country as the MIT students themselves moved about, allowing the game to gain popularity.",
              "[4] In the 1960s, a number of computer games were created for mainframe and minicomputer systems, but these failed to achieve wide distribution due to the continuing scarcity of computer resources, a lack of sufficiently trained programmers interested in crafting entertainment products, and the difficulty in transferring programs between computers in different geographic areas.",
              "By the end of the 1970s, however, the situation had changed drastically.",
              "The BASIC and C high-level programming languages were widely adopted during the decade, which were more accessible than earlier more technical languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL, opening up computer game creation to a larger base of users.",
              "With the advent of time-sharing, which allowed the resources of a single mainframe to be parceled out among multiple users connected to the machine by terminals, computer access was no longer limited to a handful of individuals at an institution, creating more opportunities for students to create their own games.",
              "Furthermore, the widespread adoption of the PDP-10, released by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1966, and the portable UNIX operating system, developed at Bell Labs in 1971 and released generally in 1973, created common programming environments across the country that reduced the difficulty of sharing programs between institutions.",
              "Finally, the founding of the first magazines dedicated to computing like Creative Computing (1974), the publication of the earliest program compilation books like 101 BASIC Computer Games (1973), and the spread of wide-area networks such as the ARPANET allowed programs to be shared more easily across great distances.",
              "As a result, many of the mainframe games created by college students in the 1970s influenced subsequent developments in the video game industry in ways that, Spacewar!",
              "aside, the games of the 1960s did not.",
              "In the arcade and on home consoles, fast-paced action and real-time gameplay were the norm in genres like racing and target shooting.",
              "On the mainframe, however, such games were generally not possible due both to the lack of adequate displays (many computer terminals continued to rely on teletypes rather than monitors well into the 1970s and even most CRT terminals could only render character-based graphics) and insufficient processing power and memory to update game elements in real time.",
              "While 1970s mainframes were more powerful than arcade and console hardware of the period, the need to parcel out computing resources to dozens of simultaneous users via time-sharing significantly hampered their abilities.",
              "Thus, programmers of mainframe games focused on strategy and puzzle-solving mechanics over pure action.",
              "Notable games of the period include the tactical combat game Star Trek (1971) by Mike Mayfield, the hide-and-seek game Hunt the Wumpus (1972) by Gregory Yob, and the strategic war game Empire (1977) by Walter Bright.",
              "Perhaps the most significant game of the period was Colossal Cave Adventure (or simply Adventure), created in 1976 by Will Crowther by combining his passion for caving with concepts from the newly released tabletop role-playing game (RPG) Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).",
              "Expanded by Don Woods in 1977 with an emphasis on the high fantasy of J.",
              "R.",
              "R.",
              "Tolkien, Adventure established a new genre based around exploration and inventory-based puzzle solving that made the transition to personal computers in the late 1970s.",
              "While most games were created on hardware of limited graphic ability, one computer able to host more impressive games was the PLATO system developed at the University of Illinois.",
              "Intended as an educational computer, the system connected hundreds of users all over the United States via remote terminals that featured high-quality plasma displays and allowed users to interact with each other in real time.",
              "This allowed the system to host an impressive array of graphical and/or multiplayer games, including some of the earliest known computer RPGs, which were primarily derived, like Adventure, from D&D, but unlike that game placed a greater emphasis on combat and character progression than puzzle solving.",
              "Starting with top-down dungeon crawls like The Dungeon (1975) and The Game of Dungeons (1975), more commonly referred to today by their filenames, pedit5 and dnd, PLATO RPGs soon transitioned to a first-person perspective with games like Moria (1975), Oubliette (1977), and Avatar (1979), which often allowed multiple players to join forces to battle monsters and complete quests together.",
              "Like Adventure, these games ultimately inspired some of the earliest personal computer games.",
              "The modern video game industry grew out of the concurrent development of the first arcade video game and the first home video game console in the early 1970s in the United States.",
              "The arcade video game industry grew out of the pre-existing arcade game industry, which was previously dominated by electro-mechanical games (EM games).",
              "Following the arrival of Sega's EM game Periscope (1966), the arcade industry was experiencing a \"technological renaissance\" driven by \"audio-visual\" EM novelty games, establishing the arcades as a healthy environment for the introduction of commercial video games in the early 1970s.",
              "[5] In the late 1960s, a college student Nolan Bushnell had a part-time job at an arcade where he became familiar with EM games, watching customers play and helping to maintain the machinery while learning how it worked and developing his understanding of how the game business operates.",
              "[6] In 1966, while working at Sanders Associates, Ralph Baer came up with an idea for an entertainment device that could be hooked up to a television monitor.",
              "Presenting this to his superiors at Sanders and getting their approval, he, along with William Harrison and William Rusch, refined Baer's concept into the \"Brown Box\" prototype of a home video game console that could play a simple table tennis game.",
              "The three patented the technology, and Sanders, not in the commercialization business, sold licenses to the patents to Magnavox to commercialize.",
              "With Baer's help, Magnavox developed the Magnavox Odyssey, the first commercial home console, in 1972.",
              "Concurrently, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney had the idea of making a coin-operated system to run Spacewar!",
              "By 1971, the two had developed Computer Space with Nutting Associates, the first arcade video game.",
              "[7] Bushnell and Dabney struck out on their own and formed Atari.",
              "Bushnell, inspired by the table tennis game on the Odyssey, hired Allan Alcorn to develop an arcade version of the game, this time using discrete transistor\u2013transistor logic (TTL) electronic circuitry.",
              "Atari's Pong was released in late 1972 and is considered the first successful arcade video game.",
              "It ignited the growth of the arcade game industry in the United States from both established coin-operated game manufacturers like Williams, Chicago Coin, and the Midway subsidiary of Bally Manufacturing, and new startups such as Ramtek and Allied Leisure.",
              "Many of these were Pong clones using ball-and-paddle controls, and led to saturation of the market in 1974, forcing arcade game makers to try to innovate new games in 1975.",
              "Many of the newer companies created in the wake of Pong failed to innovate on their own and shut down, and by the end of 1975, the arcade market had fallen by about 50% based on new game sale revenues.",
              "[8] Further, Magnavox took Atari and several other of these arcade game makers to court over violations of Baer's patents.",
              "Bushnell settled the suit for Atari, gaining perpetual rights for the patents for Atari as part of the settlement.",
              "[9] Others failed to settle, and Magnavox won around $100 million in damages from these patent infringement suits before the patents expired in 1990.",
              "[10] Arcade video games caught on quickly in Japan due to partnerships between American and Japanese corporations that kept the Japan companies abreast of technology developments within the United States.",
              "The Nakamura Amusement Machine Manufacturing Company (Namco) partnered with Atari to import Pong into Japan in late 1973.",
              "Within the year, Taito and Sega released Pong clones in Japan by mid-1973.",
              "Japanese companies began developing novel games and exporting or licensing them through partners in 1974.",
              "[11] Among these included Taito's Gun Fight (originally Western Gun in its Japanese release), which was licensed to Midway.",
              "Midway's version, released in 1975, was the first arcade video game to use a microprocessor rather than discrete TLL components.",
              "[12] This innovation drastically reduced the complexity and time to design of arcade games and the number of physical components required to achieve more advanced gameplay.",
              "[13] The Magnavox Odyssey never caught on with the public, due largely to the limited functionality of its primitive discrete electronic component technology.",
              "[8] By mid-1975, large-scale integration (LSI) microchips had become inexpensive enough to be incorporated into a consumer product.",
              "[8] In 1975, Magnavox reduced the part count of the Odyssey using a three-chip set created by Texas Instruments and released two new systems that only played ball-and-paddle games, the Magnavox Odyssey 100 and Magnavox Odyssey 200.",
              "Atari, meanwhile, entered the consumer market that same year with the single-chip Home Pong system.",
              "The next year, General Instrument released a \"Pong-on-a-chip\" LSI and made it available at a low price to any interested company.",
              "Toy company Coleco Industries used this chip to create the million-selling Telstar console model series (1976\u201377).",
              "These initial home video game consoles were popular, leading to a large influx of companies releasing Pong and other video game clones to satisfy consumer demand.",
              "While there were only seven companies that were releasing home consoles in 1975, there were at least 82 by 1977, with more than 160 different models that year alone that were easily documented.",
              "A large number of these consoles were created in East Asia, and it is estimated that over 500 Pong-type home console models were made during this period.",
              "[8] As with the prior paddle-and-ball saturation in the arcade game field by 1975 due to consumer weariness, dedicated console sales dropped sharply in 1978, disrupted by the introduction of programmable systems and Handheld electronic games.",
              "[8] Just as dedicated consoles were waning in popularity in the West, they briefly surged in popularity in Japan.",
              "These TV geemu were often based on licensed designs from the American companies, manufactured by television manufacturers such as Toshiba and Sharp.",
              "Notably, Nintendo entered the video game market during this period alongside its current traditional and electronic toy product lines, producing the series of Color TV-Game consoles in partnership with Mitsubishi.",
              "[11] After the ball-and-paddle market saturation in 1975, game developers began looking for new ideas for games, buoyed by the ability to use programmable microprocessors rather than analog components.",
              "Taito designer Tomohiro Nishikado, who had developed Gun Fight previously, was inspired by Atari's Breakout to create a shooting-based game, Space Invaders, first released in Japan in 1978.",
              "[14] Space Invaders introduced or popularized several important concepts in arcade video games, including play regulated by lives instead of a timer or set score, gaining extra lives through accumulating points, and the tracking of the high score achieved on the machine.",
              "It was also the first game to confront the player with waves of targets that shot back at the player and the first to include background music during game play, albeit a simple four-note loop.",
              "[15] Space Invaders was an immediate success in Japan, with some arcades created solely for Space Invaders machines.",
              "[14] While not quite as popular in the United States, Space Invaders became a hit as Midway, serving as the North American manufacturer, moved over 60,000 cabinets in 1979.",
              "[16] Space Invaders led off what is considered to be the golden age of arcade games which lasted from 1978 to 1982.",
              "Several influential and best-selling arcade games were released during this period from Atari, Namco, Taito, Williams, and Nintendo, including Asteroids (1979), Galaxian (1979), Defender (1980), Missile Command (1980), Tempest (1981), and Galaga (1981).",
              "Pac-Man, released in 1980, became a popular culture icon, and a new wave of games appeared that focused on identifiable characters and alternate mechanics such as navigating a maze or traversing a series of platforms. Aside from Pac-Man and its sequel, Ms.",
              "Pac-Man (1982), the most popular games in this vein during the golden age were Donkey Kong (1981) and Q*bert (1982).",
              "[14] Games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Q*bert also introduced the concept of narratives and characters to video games, which led companies to adopt these later as mascots for marketing purposes.",
              "[17][18] According to trade publication Vending Times, revenues generated by coin-operated video games on location in the United States jumped from $308 million in 1978 to $968 million in 1979 to $2.",
              "8 billion in 1980.",
              "As Pac Man ignited an even larger video game craze and attracted more female players to arcades, revenues jumped again to $4.",
              "9 billion in 1981.",
              "According to trade publication Play Meter, by July 1982, total coin-op collections peaked at $8.",
              "9 billion, of which $7.",
              "7 billion came from video games.",
              "[19] Dedicated video game arcades grew during the golden age, with the number of arcades (locations with at least ten arcade games) more than doubling between July 1981 and July 1983 from over 10,000 to just over 25,000.",
              "[14][19] These figures made arcade games the most popular entertainment medium in the country, far surpassing both pop music (at $4 billion in sales per year) and Hollywood films ($3 billion).",
              "[19] Development costs of dedicated game hardware for arcade and home consoles based on discrete component circuitry and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) with only limited consumer lifespans drove engineers to find alternatives.",
              "Microprocessors had dropped far enough in price by 1975 to make these a viable option for developing programmable consoles that could load in game software from a form of swappable media.",
              "[20] The Fairchild Channel F by Fairchild Camera and Instrument was released in 1976.",
              "It is the first home console to use programmable ROM cartridges - allowing players to swap games - as well as being the first home console to use a microprocessor which reads instructions from the ROM cartridge.",
              "Atari and Magnavox followed suit in 1977 and 1978, respectively, with the release of the Atari Video Computer System (VCS, later known as the Atari 2600) and the Magnavox Odyssey 2, both systems also introducing the use of cartridges.",
              "As to complete the Atari VCS quickly, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications $28 million, providing the necessary cash infusion to complete the system's design by the end of 1977.",
              "[13] The initial market for these new consoles were initially modest as consumers were still wary after the saturation of dedicated home consoles.",
              "[21] However, there was still newfound interest in video games, and new players were drawn to the market, such as Mattel Electronics with the Intellivision.",
              "[8] In contrast to the dedicated home Pong consoles, programmable cartridge-based consoles had a higher barrier of entry with the costs of research & development and large-scale production, and fewer manufacturers entered the market during this period.",
              "[8] This new line of consoles had its breakthrough moment when Atari obtained a license from Taito to create the Atari VCS version of the arcade hit Space Invaders, which was released in 1980.",
              "Space Invaders quadrupled sales of the Atari VCS, making it the first \"killer app\" in the video game industry, and the first video game to sell over one million copies and eventually sold over 2.",
              "5 million by 1981.",
              "[22][23] Atari's consumer sales almost doubled from $119 million to nearly $204 million in 1980 and then exploded to over $841 million in 1981, while sales across the entire video game industry in the United States rose from $185.",
              "7 million in 1979 to just over $1 billion in 1981.",
              "Through a combination of conversions of its own arcade games like Missile Command and Asteroids and licensed conversions like Defender, Atari took a commanding lead in the industry, with an estimated 65% market share of the worldwide industry by dollar volume by 1981.",
              "Mattel settled into second place with roughly 15%-20% of the market, while Magnavox ran a distant third, and Fairchild exited the market entirely in 1979.",
              "[8] Another critical development during this period was the emergence of third-party developers.",
              "Atari management did not appreciate the special talent required to design and program a game and treated them like typical software engineers of the period, who were not generally credited for their work or given royalties;",
              "this led to Warren Robinett secretly programming his name in one of the earliest Easter eggs into his game Adventure.",
              "[24][25] Atari's policies drove four of the company's programmers, David Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller, and Bob Whitehead, to resign and form their own company Activision in 1979, using their knowledge of developing for the Atari VCS to make and publish their own games.",
              "Atari sued to stop Activision's activities, but the companies settled out of court, with Activision agreeing to pay a portion of their game sales as a license fee to Atari.",
              "[26] Another group of Atari and Mattel developers left and formed Imagic in 1981, following Activision's model.",
              "[27] Atari's dominance of the market was challenged by Coleco's ColecoVision in 1982.",
              "As Space Invaders had done for the Atari VCS, Coleco developed a licensed version of Nintendo's arcade hit Donkey Kong as a bundled game with the system.",
              "While the Colecovision only had 17% of the hardware market in 1982 compared to the Atari VCS' share of 58%, it outsold Atari's newer console, the Atari 5200.",
              "[28][8] A few games from this period have been considered milestones in the history of video games, and some of the earliest in popular genres.",
              "Robinett's Adventure was inspired from the text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure, and is considered the first graphic adventure game and the first action-adventure game,[29] and first console fantasy game.",
              "[30] Activision's Pitfall!",
              ", beside being one of the more successful third-party games, also established the foundation of side-scrolling platform games.",
              "[31] Utopia for the Intellivision was the first city-building game and considered one of the first real-time strategy games.",
              "[32][33] The fruit of retail development in early video games appeared mainly in video arcades and home consoles, but at the same time, there was a growing market in home computers.",

              "[76] SNK's Neo-Geo was the most costly console by a wide margin when released in 1990.",
              "The Neo-Geo used similar hardware as SNK's arcade machines, giving its games a quality better than other 16-bit consoles, but the system was commercially non-viable.",
              "The Neo-Geo was notably the first home console with support for memory cards, allowing players to save their progress in a game, not only at home but also shared with compatible Neo-Geo arcade games.",
              "[96] The 1990s were a decade of marked innovation in video games.",
              "It was a decade of transition from raster graphics to 3D graphics and gave rise to several genres of video games including first-person shooter, real-time strategy, and MMO.",
              "Handheld games become more popular throughout the decade, thanks in part to the release of the Game Boy in 1989.",
              "[97] Arcade games experienced a resurgence in the early-to-mid-1990s, followed by a decline in the late 1990s as home consoles became more common.",
              "As arcade games declined, however, the home video game industry matured into a more mainstream form of entertainment in the 1990s, but their video games also became more and more controversial because of their violent nature, especially in games of Mortal Kombat, Night Trap, and Doom, leading to the formation of the Interactive Digital Software Association and their rating games by signing them their ESRB ratings since 1994.",
              "[98] Major developments of the 1990s include the popularizing of 3D computer graphics using polygons (initially in arcades, followed by home consoles and computers), and the start of a larger consolidation of publishers, higher budget games, increased size of production teams, and collaborations with both the music and motion picture industries.",
              "Examples of this include Mark Hamill's involvement with Wing Commander III, the introduction of QSound with arcade system boards such as Capcom's CP System II, and the high production budgets of games such as Squaresoft's Final Fantasy VII and Sega's Shenmue.",
              "By end of the 1980s, console games were distributed on ROM cartridges, while PC games shipped on floppy disks, formats that had limitations in storage capacity.",
              "Optical media, and specifically the CD-ROM, had been first introduced in the mid-1980s for music distribution and by the early 1990s, both the media and CD drives had become inexpensive to be incorporated into consumer computing devices, including for both home consoles and computers.",
              "[99] Besides offering more capacity for gameplay content, optical media made it possible to include long video segments into games, such as full motion video, or animated or pre-rendered cutscenes, allowing for more narrative elements to be added to games.",
              "[100] Prior to the 1990s, some arcade games explored the use of laserdiscs, the most notable being Dragon's Lair in 1983.",
              "These games are considered as interactive movies and used full motion video from the laserdisc, prompting the player to respond via controls at the right time to continue the game.",
              "[100][101] While these games were popular in the early 1980s, the prohibitive cost of laserdisc technology at the time limited their success.",
              "When optical media technology matured and dropped in price by the 1990s, new laserdisc arcade games emerged, such as Mad Dog McCree in 1990.",
              "[100] Pioneer Corporation released the LaserActive game console in 1993 that used only laserdiscs, with expansion add-ons to play games from the Sega Genesis and NEC TurboGrafx-16 library, but with a base console price of $1,000 and add-ons at $600, the console did not perform well.",
              "[102] For consoles, optical media were cheaper to produce than ROM cartridges, and batches of CD-ROMs could be produced in a week while cartridges could take two to three months to assemble, in addition to the larger capacity.",
              "[103] Add-ons were made for the 16-bit consoles to use CD media, including the PC Engine and the Mega Drive.",
              "Other manufacturers made consoles with dual-media, such as NEC's TurboDuo.",
              "Philips launched the CD-i in 1990, a console using only optical media, but the unit had limited gaming capabilities and had a limited game library.",
              "[104] Nintendo had similarly worked with Sony to develop a CD-based SNES, known as the Super NES CD-ROM, but this deal fell through just prior to its public announcement, and as a result, Sony went on to develop to the PlayStation console released in 1994, that exclusively used optical media.",
              "[105] Sony was able to capitalize on how the Japanese market handled game sales in Japan for the PlayStation, by producing only limited numbers of any new CD-ROM game with the ability to rapidly produce new copies of a game should it prove successful, a factor that could not easily be realized with ROM cartridges where due to how fast consumers' tastes changed, required nearly all cartridges expected to sell to be produced upfront.",
              "This helped Sony overtake Nintendo and Sega in the 1990s.",
              "[106] A key PlayStation game that adapted to the CD format was Final Fantasy VII, released in 1997;",
              "Square's developers wanted to transition the series from the series' 2D presentation to using 3D models, and though the series had been exclusive to Nintendo consoles previously, Square determined it would be impractical to use cartridges for distribution while the PlayStation's CD-ROM gave them the space for all the desired content including pre-rendered cutscenes.",
              "[107] Final Fantasy VII became a key game, as it expanded the idea of console role-playing games to console game consumers.",
              "[100][108] Since the PlayStation, all home gaming consoles have relied on optical media for physical game distribution, outside the Nintendo 64 and Switch.",
              "[103] On the PC side, CD drives were initially available as peripherals for computers before becoming standard components within PCs.",
              "CD-ROM technology had been available as early as 1989, with Cyan Worlds' The Manhole being one of the first games distributed on the medium.",
              "[100] While CD-ROMs served as a better means to distribute larger games, the medium caught on with the 1993 releases of Cyan's Myst and Trilobyte's The 7th Guest, adventure games that incorporated full motion video segments among fixed pre-rendered scenes, incorporating the CD-ROM medium into the game itself.",
              "Both games were considered killer apps to help standardize the CD-ROM format for PCs.",
              "[109][110] In addition to the transition to optical media, the industry as a whole had a major shift toward real-time 3D computer graphics across games during the 1990s.",
              "There had been a number of arcade games that used simple wireframe vector graphics to simulate 3D, such as Battlezone, Tempest, and Star Wars.",
              "A unique challenge in 3D computer graphics is that real-time rendering typically requires floating-point calculations, which until the 1990s, most video game hardware was not well-suited for.",
              "Instead, many games simulated 3D effects such as by using parallax rendering of different background layers, scaling of sprites as they moved towards or away from the player's view, or other rendering methods such as the SNES's Mode 7.",
              "These tricks to simulate 3D-rendeder graphics through 2D systems are generally referred to as 2.",
              "5D graphics.",
              "True real-time 3D rendering using polygons were soon popularized by Yu Suzuki's Sega AM2 games Virtua Racing (1992) and Virtua Fighter (1993), both running on the Sega Model 1 arcade system board;",
              "[111] some of the Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) staff involved in the creation of the original PlayStation video game console credit Virtua Fighter as inspiration for the PlayStation's 3D graphics hardware.",
              "According to SCE's former producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, the PlayStation was originally being considered as a 2D-focused hardware, and it wasn't until the success of Virtua Fighter in the arcades that they decided to design the PlayStation as a 3D-focused hardware.",
              "[112] Texture mapping and texture filtering were soon popularized by 3D racing and fighting games.",
              "[113] Home video game consoles such as the PlayStation, the Sega Saturn, and Nintendo 64 also became able to produce texture-mapped 3D graphics.",
              "Nintendo had already released Star Fox in 1993 which included the Super FX graphics co-processor chip built into the game cartridge to support polygonal rendering for the SNES, and the Nintendo 64 included a graphics coprocessor on the console directly.",
              "On personal computers, John Carmack and John Romero of id Software had been experimenting with real-time rendering of 3D games through Hovertank 3D and Catacomb 3-D.",
              "These led to the release of Wolfenstein 3D in 1992, considered to be the original first-person shooter as it rendered the game's world fast enough to keep up with the player's movements.",
              "However, at this point, Wolfenstein 3D's maps were restricted to a single flat level.",
              "[114] Improvements would come with Ultima Underworld from Blue Sky Productions, which included floors of different heights and ramps, which took longer to render but was considered acceptable in the role-playing game, and id's Doom, adding lighting effects among other features, but still with limitations that maps were effectively two-dimensional and with most enemies and objects represented by sprites in-game.",
              "id had created one of the first game engines that separated the content from the gameplay and rendering layers, and licensed this engine to other developers, resulting in games such as Heretic and Hexen, while other game developers built their own engines based on the concepts of the Doom engine, such as Duke Nukem 3D and Marathon.",
              "[115] In 1996, id's Quake was the first computer game with a true 3D game engine with in-game character and object models, and as with the Doom engine, id licensed the Quake engine, leading to a further growth in first-person shooters.",
              "[114] By 1997, the first consumer dedicated 3D graphics cards were available on the market driven by the demand for first-person shooters, and numerous 3D game engines were created in the years that followed, including Unreal Engine, GoldSrc, and CryEngine, and establishing 3D as the new standard in most computer video games.",
              "[114] The 1991 release of Capcom's Street Fighter II popularized competitive one-on-one fighting games.",

              "Increasing numbers of players waited for popular arcade games to be ported to consoles rather than pumping coins into arcade kiosks.",
              "[117] This trend increased with the introduction of more realistic peripherals for computer and console game systems such as force feedback aircraft joysticks and racing wheel/pedal kits, which allowed home systems to approach some of the realism and immersion formerly limited to the arcades.",
              "[citation needed] To remain relevant, arcade manufacturers such as Sega and Namco continued pushing the boundaries of 3D graphics beyond what was possible in homes.",
              "Virtua Fighter 3 for the Sega Model 3, for instance, stood out for having real-time 3D graphics approaching the quality of CGI full motion video (FMV) at the time.",

              "In this blog we will delve into the major milestones in the development of 3D game graphics, which have evolved from very basic and primitive effects to the near-photorealistic visuals we enjoy today.",
              "We will discuss the advent of true 3D games and then delve into the evolution of how 3D games are rendered \u2013 or how developers kept pushing the envelope to make games look increasingly realistic, immersive and believable.",
              "Before the advent of true 3D, games such as Doom (1993) and its numerous clones had faked the illusion of 3D using 2D game objects.",
              "The enormous success and technical innovations of Doom soon led to full 3D games \u2013 developers were keenly aware that gamers wanted true 3D titles and worked ceaselessly to create such experiences by designing and using new game engines.",
              "3D gaming rose to prominence not only because developers were striving to create 3D-capable engines \u2013 hardware manufacturers were coming up with the first true graphics cards and the developers of games for the Nintendo 64 (1996) and the Sony PlayStation (1994) were trying to make true 3D games that would reach mainstream audiences.",
              "All these factors conspired to make 3D gaming prominent by the late 1990s.",
              "Hardware acceleration is a process by which certain workloads are offloaded to specialised hardware capable of parallel processing, which can execute these demanding tasks more efficiently than a software application running on the CPU.",
              "Early graphics cards were designed to support hardware acceleration for video game rendering and one of the first successful cards of this type was the Voodoo 1, made by the company 3dfx and launched in late 1996.",
              "By the end of 1997 it was the most popular card among developers and consumers, though 3dfx soon declined with the ascent of Nvidia, which would buy 3dfx Interactive in 2000.",
              "The first 3D games were the result of unceasing innovation by a handful of brilliant programmers at id Software and Epic Games.",
              "At id, John Carmack spearheaded the creation of the Quake engine in 1996, which featured real-time 3d rendering and support for 3D hardware acceleration.",
              "The engine used static light maps for stationary objects and environment, while moving bodies such as the player character and enemies had dynamic shaders.",
              "Tim Sweeney of Epic Games introduced 3D graphic effects way ahead of their time with his Unreal Engine, which used clever tricks to simulate soft shadows, volumetric fog, dynamic lighting and more.",

              "The Nintendo 64\u2019s hardware architecture powered true 3D games such as Super Mario 64 (1996) and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998), and the PlayStation also had great looking 3D games such as Gran Turismo (1997), a racing game that uses full 3D environments.",
              "Like the Nintendo 64, the PlayStation used custom hardware to make 3D graphics possible, and the enormous success of the PlayStation, the first console to sell more than a 100 million units, propelled 3D games into the mainstream.",
              "By the late 1990s, both PC hardware and consoles were capable of supporting 3D games and there had been a decisive shift toward 3D gaming.",
              "The next challenge was to make such games look as realistic as possible.",
              "Both Carmack and Sweeney had experimented with various rendering techniques to make their blocky 3D games look more realistic, but these titles are a far cry from what we see today.",
              "Since the late 1990s, developers have continued to push 3D game rendering toward photorealism, and this endeavour continues to this day.",
              "This blog is hence a history of advancements in 3D rendering \u2013 it ends with real-time ray-tracing, but only time will tell what new avenues game developers will explore.",

              "In the following sections, we discuss the key innovations in game graphics, and how each of them dramatically increased the realism of 3D game rendering.",
              "Every 3D model (or mesh) in a game is composed of triangles, and will have generally gone through several iterations of optimisation to reduce its \u2018polycount\u2019, i.",
              "e, the number of triangles (or polygons) it has.",
              "During the design stage, however, high-poly models, containing lots of details, are created using 3D design tools such as Max, Maya, ZBrush and others.",
              "Such high-res models can contain more than a million polygons and simply cannot be deployed in-game \u2013 the renderer would choke \u2013 but their details are required to make a scene believable.",
              "This is where normal mapping comes in \u2013 through a process known as baking, the detail of a high-res model is transferred to a \u2018map\u2019 (short for bitmap), or texture, which the game engine can use to give an optimised model the illusion of detail.",
              "Such normal maps can also convincingly mimic how the high-polygon model would respond to lighting, furthering the illusion that you are seeing a detailed in-game object, and not an optimised mesh linked to a normal map.",
              "The key benefit of a normal map is not just that it creates the impression of detail, but also that it creates this with highly-optimised, game-ready geometry.",
              "Nvidia\u2019s GeForce 3 was the first card to support textures such as normal maps and specular maps \u2013 the former gave models a detailed appearance, and the latter controlled how shiny or glossy the model would look.",
              "A custom-made version of this card was used in Microsoft\u2019s first Xbox, which used normal mapping extensively.",
              "The PS2 didn\u2019t include support for such texture-mapping, but by the seventh generation of consoles, normal mapping was the norm across PCs and consoles.",
              "Implementing normal mapping and other textures in games was a major breakthrough, and normal maps are used to this day in games and other graphics pipelines.",
              "Today\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) are capable of rendering far more polygons, but this capability is used in conjunction with normal mapping to make ultra-realistic scene assets.",
              "HD-TV is an advancement in digital display technology that became available to consumers in the early 2000s and became widespread within a few years.",
              "The resolution of digital TV sets and monitors are measured by the number of pixels on the display, and in the early years of HD-TV, display resolutions ranged from 720p (921,600 pixels) to 1080p (over 2 million pixels).",
              "Seventh-generation consoles such as Sony\u2019s PS3 (2006) and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360 (2005) supported both HD gaming and HD video playback.",
              "In 2005, Microsoft exec J Allard touted the Xbox 360 as the console that would usher in a new era of HD gaming, even though gaming in high resolutions had been possible on PCs for many years before these consoles, thanks to the power of dedicated PC graphics cards.",
              "However, it was the consoles, which could support gaming and double as home entertainment systems, that made HD gaming mainstream.",
              "Sony remastered many of its PS2 games to run on HD screens with the PS3.",
              "Many of these remasters, which now played at higher resolutions, had much sharper image quality and better-looking character models.",
              "Higher resolutions also decrease aliasing \u2013 the jagged edges that appear on rendered game models.",
              "This type of visual artefact can be quite distracting, and a HD display can help make for a more immersive experience by minimising aliasing artefacts.",
              "HD resolutions do not automatically imply photorealistic renders, but they can help bring out the detail in renders by achieving high image quality.",
              "A shader is essentially a piece of code that runs on the GPU and contains specific instructions on how to render a 3D scene in pixels, or how to manipulate a 2D image before it\u2019s shown on-screen.",
              "Shaders can tell the renderer how a 3D object should be lit, how it should be coloured, what it reflects and much, much more.",
              "Early graphics cards had fixed-function rendering pipelines, limiting the sort of effects that could be applied while rendering a scene.",
              "But the advent of cards with programmable shaders \u2013 the first of which was the GeForce 3 \u2013 utterly transformed 3D rendering.",
              "In fact, the use of normal and specular maps to texture an object requires a programmable shader pipeline.",
              "Within a few years, developers had written highly complex shaders.",
              "In 2007, a programmer working on the CryTek engine developed screen-space ambient occlusion, which darkens the creases, holes and dents of an object, and the areas where it is contact with other objects, resulting in a more realistic scene that looks like it is responding to indirect or \u2018ambient\u2019 light.",
              "The shader was first used in Crysis (2007), a game now legendary for its demands on computer hardware.",
              "Crysis in fact contains more than 85000 shaders, which all but melted the graphics hardware of the time \u2013 and contributed greatly to the realism of the game.",
              "Crysis 2 (2011) used a screen-space reflection shader to render reflections on glossy or glass-like surfaces and objects.",
              "The SSR shader contributes a lot to a rendered scene, but has its limitations, and is used in conjunction with other techniques such as cube mapping (also implemented via a shader) to create realistic in-game reflections.",
              "Deferred rendering was another major screen-space shading technique developed in the late 2000s.",
              "In essence, this technique allows a scene to be rendered with many more lights, by rendering the game geometry and the scene lighting in separate rendering passes.",
              "In traditional, \u2018forward\u2019 rendering, increasing the number of lights can rapidly increase rendering times but deferred rendering enables more lights and more realistic world lighting without impacting render times significantly.",
              "Games such as Dead Space (2008) and Killzone 2 (2009) were among the first to implement deferred rendering and it has now become an industry standard.",
              "The shaders described above improve lighting, shadows and reflections and thereby help make a scene look more realistic and believable.",
              "However, shaders are capable of many more effects, such as anti-aliasing, and contrast-adaptive sharpening, which allows games to be run at lower resolutions by intelligently sharpening the upscaled render.",
              "Such shaders can even be injected into games through custom programs like Reshade, which boasts an ever-growing library of shaders, and supports a huge variety of games The hunt for photorealism is punctuated with various paradigm shifts, and the advent of physically-based rendering (PBR) around the early 2010s is probably one of the most important.",
              "Graphics shaders had incrementally improved the look of games, striving for realism by improving how in-game scenes were rendered.",
              "Shaders could do everything from scene lighting to post-processing effects such as camera filters and depth of field.",
              "But these shaders were all working on models that were textured in what is now known as \u2018traditional\u2019 or \u2018non-PBR\u2019 workflows, where the diffuse and specular maps of game assets were painted by texture artists and did not generally reflect the real-world properties of such assets.",
              "PBR is crucial to photorealistic renders, because the associated texture sets and shaders accurately model how light interacts with in-game objects.",
              "In real life, a shiny gold crown or copper bracelet will look gold or orange \u2013 not because these metals are in any way \u2018pigmented\u2019, but because they absorb certain wavelengths of light.",
              "PBR shaders model this accurately, giving a clear grey sheen to most metals, but giving coloured metals or alloys their characteristic tint based on what they absorb.",
              "Even non-metallic objects are textured so that they will reflect a tiny bit of light, as they do in real life, and shiny non-metallics have a sheen based on their real-life properties.",
              "Reflective surfaces will accurately reflect in-game environments \u2013 physically-based textures even capture how reflective a body is based on the angle at which light hits it.",
              "PBR can hence improve the results from a screen-space reflection shader \u2013 if a smooth marble floor has a PBR-based texture, then it will be essentially opaque when you look directly down it, but will reflect scene objects if you look at it from an angle.",
              "In fact, texture artists can make use of detailed reference tables when they adopt the PBR workflow for the sake of physical accuracy \u2013 such charts provide base values for texturing various metals and non-metals.",
              "PBR texturing can make life easier for artists \u2013 earlier, they would expend a good deal of effort into making a golden crown look appropriately golden, and then add surface details like dirt, dull cavities, scratches and more \u2013 now, they can add such realistic details while letting the renderer take care of making the object look \u2018golden\u2019.",
              "Remember Me, a 2013 title published by Capcom, is credited as the first game to use physically-based rendering.",
              "Many studios soon transitioned to PBR, and held in-depth workshops to help texture artists adopt the new texturing pipeline.",
              "Both graphics shaders and physically-based rendering can work in synergy to enhance a scene by improving its lighting, shadows and reflections.",
              "The advent of high-dynamic range (HDR) TV in the mid-2010s utterly transformed this process by allowing games to output scenes with a greater dynamic luminance range, a wider colour range (known as the gamut), and more colour tones within this gamut (using higher bit depth).",
              "Skies and the sun could look tremendously bright.",
              "Shadows in dungeons could look very dark, and in horror games, these areas were that much scarier, because you could just make out a lurking shape in the shadow.",
              "Roses in a bouquet could each have a subtly different shade of red.",
              "The gradient of colours in the horizon during sunsets could look much smoother.",
              "Standard dynamic range (SDR) displays have a maximum luminance value of around 100 nits.",
              "Expensive HDR displays can get as bright as 4000 nits.",
              "This means that both the brightest and darkest parts of the render are displayed without losing detail \u2013 in an SDR display, these parts would fall above or below the screen\u2019s luminance range and will look either bright white or pitch black.",
              "SDR displays can only show 8-bit colour information, or 256 levels of luminance for each colour channel.",
              "HDR displays have a bit depth of 10 bits per channel, resulting in 1024 shades between the brightest white and the darkest black, and can support over a billion colour tones.",
              "This is why such displays (when showing HDR content) can make colours really pop, enhance the overall contrast of the scene, and smooth the gradient between light and dark colours during a sunset, eliminating banding artefacts with a wider range of colour tones.",
              "Ironically, game engines had become capable of high dynamic range rendering (HDRR) by the early 2000s, but had no displays capable of showing such renders.",
              "Half-Life 2: Lost Coast (2005) was one of the first games to use HDRR and many other games performed render calculations in high dynamic range, but then squeezed the result into standard dynamic range using a process called tone-mapping.",
              "Just as a normal map texture is used to capture the geometric details of a high-polygon model, tone-mapping is used to map a HDR rendered frame onto a lower dynamic range.",
              "The result is better than what would have been generated without using HDRR, but is not true HDR output.",
              "Horizon Zero Dawn (2017), Shadow of the Tomb Raider (2018) and Middle Earth: Shadow of War (2017) are among several games that were released soon after HDR displays became widespread, and such games support true HDR output, drastically improving image quality.",
              "Tone mapping still remains part of the workflow when creating HDR content, but the far wider luminance and colour range of a HDR display results in content whose dynamic range is not clamped, making for highly realistic lighting, colour and better overall image quality.",
              "In May 2020, the BBC published an article on real-time ray-tracing titled \u2018Get ready for the \u2018holy grail\u2019 of computer graphics,\u2019 and there is probably no better indication about the importance and primacy of this revolutionary technique in present-day game graphics.",
              "Ray-tracing had long been a part of CGI (computer generated imagery) pipelines in film and television, but was implemented via offline rendering, and was prohibitively expensive \u2013 Toy Story 3 (2010) took an average of seven hours per frame, and Monsters University (2013) is said to have taken 29 hours per frame.",
              "As ray-tracing actually models the interaction of light with in-game objects, it works best with physically-based textures, which provide accurate data to the ray-tracing algorithm.",
              "In fact, the first major book-length publication on PBR refers to ray-tracing, and contextualises PBR as a new method to improve such ray-traced scenes with physically-accurate materials \u2013 ray-tracing in films and TV predates PBR.",
              "The first challenge to implementing ray-tracing in games is that it has to be in real time and not offline, and Nvidia\u2019s first range of RTX cards, released in 2018, managed this feat.",
              "Real-time ray-tracing greatly enhances shadows, lights and reflections dynamically and it works thus \u2013 the GPU shoots rays from the camera and then calculates how these rays bounce off in-game objects, scene lights and other scene elements (like water bodies), to determine how the scene should look.",
              "A ray that bounces off an object and hits a scene light determines how that object is lit and where its shadow falls \u2013 if the object is close to another, then contact shadows are drawn on both.",
              "Objects that deflect rays onto glass-like surfaces will be reflected by such scene elements.",
              "Rays that move from a light source to coloured objects will take on the objects\u2019 hue and bathe nearby geometry with coloured light.",
              "Since the camera and the player character move constantly in games, such calculations have to be performed countless times.",
              "Ray tracing is even capable of recursive reflections, like infinite mirrors, though such reflections may not be feasible for complex scenes.",
              "Ray-tracing greatly improves upon previous lighting solutions, like screen-space reflections, and a simple example can illustrate why.",
              "Imagine a third-person perspective scene in which the player character is facing a reflective glass shop front, near which are two barrels.",
              "Since the SSR shader can see the barrels (in the 2D render), it will paint their reflection on the glass.",
              "But the shader cannot see the front side of the player character, and thus cannot draw the appropriate reflection.",
              "Ray-tracing creates an accurate reflection of the whole scene by accounting for rays that hit the glass and then hit the player character (and vice versa), and also adds other off-screen objects to the reflection based on their position in the game world.",
              "Nevertheless, real-time ray-tracing has high performance costs, and only one game \u2013 the indie title Stay in the Light (2020) \u2013 currently applies it across the board.",
              "Other games use it in specific contexts and combine existing methods along with ray-tracing to enhance a scene\u2019s graphical fidelity.",
              "Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition (2019) was hailed as \u2018the first AAA ray-tracing game,\u2019 and Control, released a few months later, achieved widespread acclaim for its implementation of ray-tracing.",
              "It is no coincidence that Nvidia, AMD and Intel have all come out with upscaling algorithms soon after the advent of real-time ray tracing.",
              "Even the beefiest graphics card will slow to a crawl if it tries to render a game in native 4K with high-quality ray-tracing settings, and that\u2019s where upscaling comes in \u2013 the GPU renders the image at a significantly lower resolution, which is then scaled up to (almost lossless) 4K.",
              "While Nvidia\u2019s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and Intel\u2019s Xe Super Sampling (XESS) use machine learning, AMD\u2019s Fidelity Super Resolution (FSR) does not, though it provides comparable results.",
              "Support for DLSS is available for both Control and Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition, and upscaling algorithms benefit games that lack ray-tracing as well, giving them a significant performance boost \u2013 God of War on PC supports both DLSS and FSR.",
              "3D game graphics have evolved over the course of two decades to create stunning visuals in present-day games.",
              "Developers have strived for realism and the best implementations of 3D techniques work synergistically to create near-photorealistic, or even hyper-realistic renders.",
              "HDR, which enhances colour, contrast and image quality, works best when PBR textures and ray-tracing accurately model how a scene interacts with light.",
              "Screen-space shaders are deployed alongside ray-tracing for performance gains, and normal mapping \u2013 by now a very old technique \u2013 is still critical in optimising scene geometry without losing detail.",
              "Some of these techniques represent paradigm shifts \u2013 PBR totally replaced traditional texturing workflows and real-time ray-tracing may well replace screen-space effects completely as graphics cards add muscle to their ray-tracing capabilities.",
              "So, have we reached photorealism in gaming yet?",
              "Not quite \u2013 even the latest games are near-photorealistic but are still not indistinguishable from a live-action video.",
              "Real time ray-tracing is itself a very clever approximation of real life, or \u2018ground truth\u2019, as technologists like to call scenes observable to the human eye.",
              "However, contemporary live-action content, such as the Jibaro episode from Netflix\u2019s Love, Death and Robots, show that modern offline renders can pass for real life \u2013 in fact, the best CGI in live-action content is often in places where you don\u2019t even expect it.",
              "This suggests that as computing capability increases and advanced ray-tracing methods such as path-tracing become feasible, we may edge closer to ground truth and true photorealism, even in gaming, where a life-like, interactive experience needs to be rendered at 60 frames per second.",

              "It was designed by the same team that developed the Game & Watch series of handheld electronic games and several Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games: Satoru Okada, Gunpei Yokoi, and Nintendo Research & Development 1.",
              "[14][15] It is Nintendo's second handheld game console and combines features from both the Game & Watch handheld and NES home system.",
              "The console features a dot-matrix screen with adjustable contrast dial, five game control buttons (a directional pad, two game buttons, and \"START\" and \"SELECT\"), a single speaker with adjustable volume dial and, like its rivals, uses cartridges as physical media for games.",
              "The color scheme is made from two tones of grey with accents of black, blue, and dark magenta.",
              "All the corners of the portrait-oriented rectangular unit are softly rounded, except for the bottom right, which is curved.",
              "At launch, it was sold either as a standalone unit, or bundled with one of several games, among them Super Mario Land and Tetris.",
              "Several accessories were also developed, including a carrying pouch, a camera, and a printer.",
              "The Game Boy received mixed reviews from critics and was deemed technologically inferior to its fourth-generation competitors (Sega's Game Gear, Atari's Lynx, and NEC's TurboExpress).",
              "Its lack of a backlight, graphics, bulky design and price were met with criticism, but it also received praise for its battery life, library of games and durability in its construction.",

              "The Xbox Universal Controller is expected to be available separately, with Microsoft's internal roadmap positioning the new controller with a May 2024 release window.",
              "Given that the leaked documentation is from back in May 2022, there is a chance that this may have changed, but it's good to know that this refreshed controller is on the near horizon \u2013 and will certainly be gunning for a position in our list of the best xbox Series X controllers.",

              "It's capable of outputting a 4K resolution at a buttery smooth 60fps (frames per second), and select games support 120fps, usually at a lower resolution to compensate.",
              "A 12 teraflops processor and 1TB SSD (solid state drive) also allow for lighting fast load times, plenty of storage, and much easier handling of intensive post-processing effects, such as particles or reflections.",
              "The Xbox Series S, meanwhile, is a decidedly less powerful console than its sibling.",
              "But it's a much sleeker model and the brand's smallest console to date, featuring a clean, matte white finish and a smaller rectangular build.",
