    "query": "What is the history and cultural significance of the traditional art of calligraphy, and how has it evolved over time to become a revered form of artistic expression and cultural identity in countries such as China, Japan, and the Middle East?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and broad question. Calligraphy is the art of writing beautifully and elegantly, using a brush or a pen. It has a long and rich history in many cultures, especially in China, Japan, and the Islamic world.\n\nIn China, calligraphy was considered the highest form of visual art, above painting and sculpture. It was closely associated with the scholar class and the Confucian values of moral cultivation and social order. Calligraphy was also a way of expressing one's personality, emotions, and inner spirit through the movement of the brush and the shape of the characters[^2^]. Chinese calligraphy influenced the development of painting and poetry, as well as other arts such as seal carving and embroidery.\n\nIn Japan, calligraphy was introduced from China along with Buddhism in the sixth century C.E. It became an important part of Japanese culture and aesthetics, especially among the aristocracy and the Zen monks. Japanese calligraphy adapted some of the Chinese styles and techniques, but also developed its own distinctive features, such as the use of cursive scripts, ink washes, and decorative motifs[^3^]. Japanese calligraphy was often combined with painting, literature, and flower arrangement to create harmonious compositions.\n\nIn the Islamic world, calligraphy was regarded as a sacred art form, since it was used to write the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam. The Qur'an was believed to be the direct word of God revealed to Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. Therefore, writing it in a beautiful and respectful manner was a way of honoring God and expressing one's faith[^1^]. Islamic calligraphy also adorned many forms of art and architecture, such as mosques, ceramics, textiles, coins, and metalwork. Islamic calligraphy developed various styles and scripts over time and across regions, reflecting the diversity and creativity of Islamic civilization.\n\nCalligraphy has evolved over time to become a revered form of artistic expression and cultural identity in countries such as China, Japan, and the Middle East. It is still practiced today by many artists and enthusiasts who appreciate its beauty, skill, and spiritual significance.",

              "Given the prominence of calligraphy in the traditional arts of both the Islamic world and China, it is only natural that Islamic calligraphy plays an important cultural role in Chinese Muslim communities.",
              "The art form\u2019s survival over the centuries in China, even during prolonged periods of isolation from the rest of the Islamic world, reflects the strength of Chinese Muslims\u2019 religious traditions, as well as the critical function of the written word within these traditions.",
              "The history of Islam in China remains among the most understudied topics within the fields of both Islamic and Chinese studies.",
              "[1] The development of Islamic art and architecture in China has been particularly neglected, and like the recent article on mosque architecture in China published as part of this same series,[2] this essay seeks to begin to address this deficiency.",
              "The following examples of Chinese Islamic calligraphy tell the stories of diverse Muslim communities in China, the challenges they have faced through the centuries, and the different ways they have adapted this traditional Islamic art form.",
              "It is important to note the obstacles that Chinese Muslims have faced in protecting and passing on their cultural inheritance.",
              "They have not only survived periods of enforced separation from the rest of the Muslim world but have also endured numerous periods of state-sponsored violence.",
              "Hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims have been killed during government campaigns to suppress resistance movements by Muslim communities in different regions of China.",
              "In the modern period, Muslim communities (together with all other religious communities, and much of the general population) suffered during the political campaign known as the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).",
              "Mosques throughout China were either damaged or destroyed, along with unknown quantities of religious materials and texts, especially works of calligraphy on paper or wood.",
              "During the first few centuries of the Islamic era, calligraphic styles emerged and were standardized in different regions of the expanding empire.",
              "Several of these styles were transmitted to China by the Muslim traders who had been traveling to China since the earliest days of Islam.",
              "The most common surviving examples of these styles can be seen engraved in the tombstones of Muslim traders from the Arab Middle East, Persia, and Central Asia who died and were buried in China.",
              "One of the earliest and most important communities of Muslim traders was established in Quanzhou, along China\u2019s southeastern coast, in present-day Fujian.",
              "Muslim traders first settled in this port city in (roughly) the tenth century, and a Muslim presence has continued there to this day.",
              "The city of Quanzhou became so well known in the Islamic world that it was commonly referred to as Zaytun (olive) in Arabic sources.",
              "The calligraphy of the earliest of the tombstones reflects the styles that were common in the Middle Eastern and Central Asian homelands of the traders.",
              "However, over the centuries, as links with the rest of the Muslim world died out, the style of the calligraphy began to change.",
              "The following four photographs show the surviving entryway to one of the earliest mosques in Quanzhou, the Ashab Mosque.",
              "It has been renovated to show the original structure but has not been rebuilt.",
              "Damaged tombstones from local Muslim cemeteries are now stored within for safekeeping.",
              "A close look at the calligraphy shows how it developed over time.",
              "Of the tombstones that survive, most marked the graves of Muslims from Persia and Central Asia who died in Quanzhou during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.",

              "Thompson II] This extraordinary mosque reflects in many ways the seamless integration of traditional Chinese and Islamic aesthetic traditions.",
              "Islamic calligraphy is incorporated throughout the mosque in various media, including stone carvings, wooden inscriptions, and paper and silk scroll writing.",
              "The largest migration of Muslims to China took place during the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1260-1368), when the Mongols, having conquered all of China, realized that they needed professionally trained men to carry out the governance of the empire.",
              "Officials, primarily Muslim, were recruited from the regions of Central Asia, Persia, and the Middle East that the Mongols had conquered.",
              "The recruits were assigned to every region of China, where many ended up settling permanently.",
              "Over the centuries, these Muslim men adopted many, if not most, of their new communities\u2019 cultural traditions while retaining their Muslim identity.",
              "At times, this mixing occurred voluntarily and naturally, as the foreign Muslim residents married local Chinese women over generations.",
              "At other times, the adoption of Chinese names, clothing, language, and customs was imperially commanded by the emperor.",
              "These Muslim communities later become known as the Hui and developed their own style of Chinese Islamic calligraphy.",
              "From the Yuan period to the beginning of the twentieth century, Hui communities in the different regions of China followed different trajectories.",
              "Some communities flourished, while others faded away, and others became embroiled in communal conflicts or armed resistance to the state.",
              "There were both mass migrations and state-sponsored massacres of hundreds of thousands of Muslims in northwest and southwest China.",
              "Due to their different histories, regions have developed different customs and traditions, and the patchwork of varied influences is apparent to this day.",
              "[3] However, the word Sini (Arabic for Chinese) began to refer to the wide range of Chinese Islamic art forms: calligraphic scrolls on paper and silk, wooden carvings, various ceramic and porcelain products, and bronze incense burners (similar to those used by Buddhists and Daoists).",
              "Beginning in the Ming (1368-1644) period and continuing into the Qing (1644-1912) period, Chinese Muslims began acquiring these works of art that reflected both their Chinese aesthetic and their religious sensibilities.",
              "Although over the years millions of these works were undoubtedly collected and displayed in homes, unfortunately very few remain.",

              "The art dates back about 3,700 years to the Yin Dynasty and has its origin in the cutting of oracle inscriptions on tortoise shells.",
              "It flourished in theQin Dynastyof 22 centuries ago, when people engraved their names on utensils and documents (of bamboo and wood) to show ownership or authorship.",
              "Out of this grew the cutting of personal names on small blocks of horn,jadeor wood, namely the seals as we know them today.",

              "Seals of this time were richer in both form and content, especially in the variety of private seals, bearing zhuanshu or curly script, which explains why the art of seal-cutting is still called zhuanke and also why the zhuanshu is also known in English as \"seal characters.\"",
              "As time went on, the other script styles appeared one after another on Chinese seals, which may now be cut in any style exceptcaoshu(cursive hand) at the option of the artist.",
              "The Han seals fell into two types: cast or chiseled.",
              "Most of the Western Han seals were cast while the Eastern Han seals were largely chiseled.",
              "This was because in the late years of that period, officials were constantly transferred or died due to the chaos caused by unceasing wars, and there was no time to cast new seals for newly appointed officials.",
              "Hence, contents were chiseled on the prepared seal bases.",

              "However, in many western art forms, you create a work by applying layers and touching up the work.",
              "Then there\u2019s the concept of \u2018empty space\u2019.",
              "In shodo, the space around the written characters is just as important and beautiful as the characters themselves.",
              "The eye should be drawn as powerfully to the untouched white space as the black.",
              "We also sometimes play on this space in the way we apply the ink, creating strokes where the ink appears to run out and allowing the white of the paper to show through.",
              "This is also regarded as part of a work\u2019s appeal, if naturally and artistically expressed.",
              "Shodo is so nuanced, and to become fully competent in it, a student needs to constantly practise over a number of years.",

              "And, in older times, particularly treasured works would be stamped by the owner as a form of certification as works were passed down through the ages.",

              "Japanese calligraphy in remmen-tai or in cho\u0304wa-tai has some resemblance to the Chinese grass style, but the two are easily distinguishable.",
              "In Chinese grass style, although the words are greatly simplified and several words can be joined together with trailing strokes, each separate word normally still retains its regular spacing within an imaginary square, big or small.",
              "But Japanese hiragana cannot be spaced so separately and evenly.",
              "Therefore, a whole piece of remmen-tai calligraphy looks like a big bundle of beautiful silk strings hanging down confusedly yet artistically, as if the calligrapher had let his hand move swiftly of its own accord.",
              "The separate strokes and dots have no distinctive shape but join other strokes and dots in the following hiragana.",
              "The strokes or lines in hiragana are not shaped like living things, nor are they of even thickness, but there must be good spacing between the strokes or lines and between one hiragana and another, so that there is no confusion or blur in the completed piece.",
              "This is a highly demanding art, and the whole piece has to be executed with speed and without hesitation.",

              "The poetry of the Arabs consisted in the beginning of praise and satirical poems thought to be full of magical qualities.",
              "The strict rules of the outward form of the poems (monorhyme, complicated metre) even in pre-Islamic times led to a certain formalism and encouraged imitation.",

              "For the most part, however, Goethe\u2019s statement that the stories of The Thousand and One Nights have no goal in themselves shows his understanding of the character of Arabic belles lettres, contrasting them with the Islamic religion, which aims at \u201ccollecting and uniting people in order to achieve one high goal.",
              "\u201d Poets, on the other hand, rove around without any ethical purpose, according to the Qur\u02bea\u0304n.",

              "The combination of music and poetry, as practiced in court circles and among the mystics, has always aroused the wrath of the lawyer divines who wield so much authority in Islamic communities.",
              "This opposition may partly explain why Islamic poetry and fine arts took refuge in a kind of unreal world, using fixed images that could be correctly interpreted only by those who were knowledgeable in the art.",
              "The ambiguity of Persian poetry, which oscillates between the worldly, the divine, and often the political level, is typical of Islamic writings.",
              "Especially in Iran and the countries under its cultural influence, this kind of poetry formed the most important part of literature.",

              "Western readers look in vain for an epical structure in such long poems (as in the case of the prose-romances of the Arabs) and find instead a rather aimless representation of facts and fictions.",
              "A similar characteristic even conditions innumerable historical works in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, which, especially in classical times, contain much valuable information, put together without being shaped into a real work of art;",
              "only rarely does the historian or philosopher reach a comprehensive view.",
              "The first attempt at a philosophy of history, Ibn Khaldu\u0304n\u2019s Muqaddimah, in the 14th century, was rarely studied by his Arab compatriots.",
              "The accumulation of large amounts of material, which is carefully organized up to the present, seems typical of all branches of Islamic scholarship, from theology to natural sciences.",
              "There are many minute observations and descriptions but rarely a full view of the whole process.",
              "Later, especially in the Persian, Turkish, and Indo-Muslim areas, a tendency to overstress the decorative elements of prose is evident, and the contents even of official chronicles are hidden behind a network of rhymed prose, which is often difficult to disentangle.",
              "This tendency is illustrated in all branches of Islamic art: the lack of \u201carchitectural\u201d formation.",
              "Instead, there is a kind of carpetlike pattern;",
              "the Arabic and Persian poem is, in general, judged not as a closed unity but rather according to the perfection of its individual verses.",
              "Its main object is not to convey a deep personal feeling but to perfect to the utmost the traditional rules and inherited metaphors, to which a new image may sometimes be added.",
              "Thus, the personality of the poet becomes visible only through the minimal changes of expression and rhythm and the application of certain preferred metaphors, just as the personality of the miniature painter can be detected by a careful observation of details, of his way of colouring a rock or deepening the shade of a turban.",
              "The same holds true for the arabesques, which were developed according to a strict ritual to a mathematical pattern and were refined until they reached a perfection of geometrically complicated figures, as in the dome of the Karatay Medrese in Konya (1251);",
              "it corresponds both to the most intricate lacelike Ku\u0304fic inscriptions around this dome and to the poetical style of Jala\u0304l al-Di\u0304n Ru\u0304mi\u0304, who wrote in that very place and during those years.",
              "His immortal mystical poems comprise thousands of variations on the central theme of love.",
              "Although such a perfect congruency of poetry and fine arts is not frequently found, the precept about Persian art that \u201cits wings are too heavy with beauty\u201d can also be applied to Persian poetry.",
              "Thus, the tile work of a Persian mosque, which combines different levels of arabesque work with different styles of writing, is reminiscent of the way Persian poetry combines at least two levels of reality.",
              "And a perfect harmony is reached in some of the miniature manuscripts of Iran, Muslim India, or Ottoman Turkey, which, in their lucid colours and fine details of execution, recall both the perfection of the calligraphy that surrounds them on delicate paper and the subtlety of the stories or poems that they accompany or illustrate.",
              "Those accustomed to the Western ideals of plasticity or form in the fine arts and literature or to the polyphonic interweaving of melodic lines in music have some difficulties in appreciating this art.",
              "The palaces seem to be without a fixed architectural plan;",
              "rooms and gardens are simply laid out according to daily needs.",
              "The historian offers an astounding amount of detailed reports and facts but with no unifying concept.",
              "The Muslim writer prefers this carpetlike form and adds colour to colour, motif to motif, so that the reader only understands the meaning and end of the whole web from a certain distance.",
              "Music, differentiated as it may be in the countries between Morocco and India, follows the same model: variations of highest subtlety on a comparatively simple given subject or theme.",
              "Drama and opera in the Western sense did not develop in the Islamic countries until the 19th century, and the art of the novel is also a comparatively recent development.",
              "There was no reason for drama: in the Muslim perception, God is the only actor who can do whatever he pleases, whose will is inscrutable.",
              "Humans are, at best, puppets on a string, behind whose movements those with insight detect the hand of the play master.",
              "Neither is the problem of personal guilt and absolution posed as it is in the West, nor is a catharsis, or purging of emotion, needed through drama.",
              "The atomist theory, widely accepted in Islam since the 10th century, leaves no room for a \u201cdramatic\u201d movement;",
              "it teaches that God creates everything anew in every moment, and what is called a \u201claw of nature\u201d is nothing but God\u2019s custom, which he can interrupt whenever he pleases.",
              "It is true that certain other forms are found in the more folkloristic arts of Islam.",
              "Every region has produced poetry, in regional languages, that is livelier and more realistic than the classical court poetry, but poetry limited to one region tends to become restricted to certain fixed forms that can be easily imitated.",
              "Attempts at drama in Islam come from these more popular spheres in Iran (and, rarely, in Lebanon and Iraq), where the tragic events of the murder of H\u0323usayn (680) at Karbala were dramatized in strange forms, using the vocabulary of traditional Persian poetry and theology.",
              "Thus, strangely hybrid forms emerge in the Islamic arts, highly interesting for the historian of religion and the student of literature but not typical of the classic Islamic ideals.",
              "Popular illustrations of tales and legends and those of some of the heroes of the Shi\u02bfah are similarly interesting but atypical.",
              "In modern times, of course, there have been imitations of all forms of Western literary and visual arts: paintings in the Impressionist or Cubist style;",
              "the use of free verse instead of the stern classical forms;",
              "and novels, dramas, motion pictures, and music combining Western and Eastern modes.",
              "Belief in the Qur\u02bea\u0304nic dictum \u201cWhatever is on earth will perish save His face\u201d discouraged artistic endeavour on a large scale, but the Prophetic tradition (Hadith) \u201cVerily God is beautiful and loves beauty\u201d has inspired numberless artists and artisans, writers and poets, musicians, and mystics to develop their arts and crafts as a reflection of that divine beauty.",
              "A theory of aesthetics comprising the various artistic expressions of the Muslim peoples has yet to be written.",
              "Although there have been a number of studies in literary criticism, the formal indebtedness of some of the best modern poets and painters to the Islamic heritage has yet to be fully articulated.",
              "It is notable that the arts of the Islamic peoples have had relatively little impact on other cultures, certainly far less than their artistic merit would appear to warrant.",
              "Europe has known art objects of Islamic origin since the early Middle Ages, when they were brought home by the Crusaders or manufactured by the Arabs in Sicily and Spain.",
              "Much admired and even imitated, they formed part of the material culture in those times, so much so that even the coronation robes of the German emperor were decorated with an Arabic inscription.",
              "At the same time, Islamic motives wandered into the belles lettres of Europe, and Islamic scientific books formed a basis for the development of Western science.",
              "Islamic culture as such, however, was rather an object of hatred than of admiration;",
              "a more objective appreciation of both the works of art and of literature did not start until the mid-17th century, when travelers told of the magnificent buildings in Iran and Mughal India and the first works from Persian literature were translated, influencing German classical literature.",
              "Indian miniatures inspired Rembrandt, just as European paintings were imitated by Islamic, especially Mughal, artists.",
              "Persian carpets were among the most-coveted gifts for princes and princesses.",
              "A bias against the cultures of the East persisted, however, until after the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment.",
              "The indefatigable work of the British scholars at Fort William at Calcutta (now Kolkata) brought new literary treasures to Europe, where they were studied carefully by specialists in the emerging field of Islamic studies.",
              "Poets such as Goethe in Germany in the early 19th century paved the way for a deeper understanding of Islamic poetry.",
              "Islamic literatures, however, continue to be known to the larger Western public almost exclusively by The Thousand and One Nights (translated first in the early 18th century), Omar Khayyam\u2019s roba\u0304\u02bfiyya\u0304t (\u201cquatrains\u201d), and the lyrics of H\u0323a\u0304fez\u0323.",
              "Even experts who were aware of the immense wealth of the literatures in the different Islamic languages (such as Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu) until the 20th century rarely appreciated the literatures from an aesthetic viewpoint;",
              "rather, they used them as a source for lexicography and for philological and historical research.",
              "The situation in Islamic fine arts and architecture was similar.",
              "Although the beauty of the Alhambra, for example, had already inspired European scholars and artists in the early 19th century, a thorough study of Islamic art as an independent field began only in the 20th century.",
              "Interest in the music of Islamic peoples, the arabesque-like uniformity of which seems strange to Western ideals of harmony, was also slow to develop."

              "In order to answer whether there is an aesthetic, iconographic, or stylistic unity to the visually perceptible arts of Islamic peoples, it is first essential to realize that no ethnic or geographical entity was Muslim from the beginning.",
              "There is no Islamic art, therefore, in the way there is a Chinese art or a French art.",
              "Nor is it simply a period art, like Gothic art or Baroque art, for once a land or an ethnic entity became Muslim, it remained Muslim, a small number of exceptions such as Spain or Sicily notwithstanding.",
              "Political and social events transformed a number of lands with a variety of earlier histories into Muslim lands.",
              "But because early Islam as such did not possess or propagate an art of its own, each area could continue, in fact often did continue, whatever modes of creativity it had acquired.",
              "It may then not be appropriate at all to talk about the visual arts of Islamic peoples, and one should instead consider separately each of the areas that became Muslim: Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Iran, Anatolia, and India.",
              "Such, in fact, has been the direction taken by some scholarship.",
              "Even though tainted at times with parochial nationalism, that approach has been useful in that it has focused attention on a number of permanent features in different regions of Islamic lands that are older than and independent from the faith itself and from the political entity created by it.",
              "Iranian art, in particular, exhibits a number of features (certain themes such as the representation of birds or an epic tradition in painting) that owe little to its Islamic character since the 7th century.",
              "Ottoman art shares a Mediterranean tradition of architectural conception with Italy rather than with the rest of the Muslim world.",
              "Such examples can easily be multiplied, but it is probably wrong to overstate their importance.",
              "For if one looks at the art of Islamic lands from a different perspective, a totally different picture emerges.",
              "The perspective is that of the lands that surround the Muslim world or of the times that preceded its formation.",
              "For even if there are ambiguous examples, most observers can recognize a flavour, a mood in Islamic visual arts that is distinguishable from what is known in East Asia (China, Korea, and Japan) or in the Christian West.",
              "This mood or flavour has been called decorative, for it seems at first glance to emphasize an immense complexity of surface effects without apparent meanings attached to the visible motifs.",
              "But it has other characteristics as well: it is often colourful, both in architecture and in objects;",

              "it gives much prominence to the work of artisans and counts among its masterpieces not merely works of architecture or of painting but also the creations of weavers, potters, and metalworkers.",
              "The problem is whether these uniquenesses of Islamic art, when compared with other artistic traditions, are the result of the nature of Islam or of some other factor or series of factors.",
              "These preliminary remarks suggest at the very outset the main epistemological peculiarity of Islamic art: it consists of a large number of quite disparate traditions that, when seen all together, appear distinguishable from what surrounded them and from what preceded them through a series of stylistic and thematic characteristics.",
              "The key question is how this was possible, but no answer can be given before the tradition itself has been properly defined.",
              "Such a definition can be provided only in history, through an examination of the formation and development of the arts through the centuries, for a static sudden phenomenon is not being dealt with, but rather a slow building up of a visual language of forms with many dialects and with many changes.",
              "Whether these complexities of growth and development subsumed a common structure is the challenging question facing the historian of this artistic tradition.",
              "What makes the question particularly difficult to answer is that the study of Islamic art is still so new.",
              "Many monuments are unpublished or at least insufficiently known, and only a handful of scientific excavations have investigated the physical setting of the culture and of its art.",
              "Much, therefore, remains tentative in the knowledge and appreciation of works of Islamic art, and what follows is primarily an outline of what is known, with a number of suggestions for further work into insufficiently investigated areas.",
              "Each artistic tradition has tended to develop its own favourite mediums and techniques.",
              "Some, of course, such as architecture, are automatic needs of every culture;",
              "and, for reasons to be developed later, it is in the medium of architecture that some of the most characteristically Islamic works of art are found.",
              "Other techniques, on the other hand, acquire varying forms and emphases.",
              "Sculpture in the round hardly existed as a major art form, and, although such was also the case of all Mediterranean arts at the time of Islam\u2019s growth, one does not encounter the astounding rebirth of sculpture that occurred in the West.",
              "Wall painting existed but has generally been poorly preserved;",
              "the great Islamic art of painting was limited to the illustration of books.",
              "The unique feature of Islamic techniques is the astounding development taken by the so-called decorative arts\u2014e.",
              "g., woodwork, glass, ceramics, metalwork, and textiles.",
              "New techniques were invented and spread throughout the Muslim world\u2014at times even beyond its frontiers.",
              "In dealing with Islam, therefore, it is quite incorrect to think of those techniques as the \u201cminor\u201d arts, for the amount and intensity of creative energies spent on the decorative arts transformed them into major artistic forms, and their significance in defining a profile of the aesthetic and visual language of Islamic peoples is far greater than in the instances of many other cultures.",
              "Furthermore, because, for a variety of reasons to be discussed later, the Muslim world did not develop until quite late the notion of \u201cnoble\u201d arts, the decorative arts have reflected far better the needs and ambitions of the culture as a whole.",
              "The kind of conclusion that can be reached about Islamic civilization through its visual arts thus extends far deeper than is usual in the study of an artistic tradition, and it requires a combination of archaeological, art-historical, and textual information.",
              "An example may suffice to demonstrate the point.",
              "Among all the techniques of Islamic visual arts, the most important one was the art of textiles.",
              "Textiles, of course, were used for daily wear at all social levels and for all occasions.",
              "But clothes were also the main indicators of rank, and they were given as rewards or as souvenirs by princes, high and low.",
              "They were a major status symbol, and their manufacture and distribution were carefully controlled through a complicated institution known as the t\u0323ira\u0304z.",
              "Major events were at times celebrated by being depicted on silks.",
              "Many texts have been identified that describe the hundreds of different kinds of textiles that existed.",
              "Because textiles could easily be moved, they became a vehicle for the transmission of artistic themes within the Muslim world and beyond its frontiers.",
              "In the case of this one technique, therefore, one is dealing not simply with a medium of the decorative arts but with a key medium in the definition of a given time\u2019s taste, of its practical functions, and of the ways in which its ideas were distributed.",
              "The more unfortunate point is that the thousands of fragments that have remained have not yet been studied in a sufficiently systematic way, and in only a handful of instances has it been possible to relate individual fragments to known texts.",
              "When more work has been completed, however, a study of this one medium should contribute significantly to the commercial, social, and aesthetic history of Islam, as well as explain much of the impact that Islamic art had beyond the frontiers of the Muslim world.",
              "The following survey of Islamic visual arts, therefore, will be primarily a historical one, for it is in development through time that the main achievements of Islamic art can best be understood.",
              "At the same time, other features peculiar to this tradition will be kept in mind: the varying importance of different lands, each of which had identifiable artistic features of its own, and the uniqueness of certain creative techniques.",
              "Islamic visual arts were created by the confluence of two entirely separate kinds of phenomena: a number of earlier artistic traditions and a new faith.",
              "The arts inherited by Islam were of extraordinary technical virtuosity and stylistic or iconographic variety.",
              "All the developments of arcuated and vaulted architecture that had taken place in Iran and in the Roman Empire were available in their countless local variants.",
              "Stone, baked brick, mud brick, and wood existed as mediums of construction, and all the complicated engineering systems developed particularly in the Roman Empire were still utilized from Spain to the Euphrates.",
              "All the major techniques of decoration were still used, except for monumental sculpture.",
              "In secular and in religious art, a more or less formally accepted equivalence between representation and represented subject had been established.",
              "Technically, therefore, as well as ideologically, the Muslim world took over an extremely sophisticated system of visual forms;",
              "and, because the Muslim conquest was accompanied by a minimum of destruction, all the monuments, and especially the attitudes attached to them, were passed on to the new culture.",
              "The second point about the pre-Islamic traditions is the almost total absence of anything from Arabia itself.",
              "While archaeological work in the peninsula may modify this conclusion in part, it does seem that Islamic art formed itself entirely in some sort of relationship to non-Arab traditions.",
              "Even the rather sophisticated art created in earlier times by the Palmyrenes or by the Nabataeans had almost no impact on Islamic art, and the h\u0323aram in Mecca, the only pre-Islamic sanctuary maintained by the new faith, remained as a unique monument that was almost never copied or imitated despite its immense religious significance.",
              "The pre-Islamic sources of Islamic art are thus entirely extraneous to the milieu in which the new faith was created.",
              "In this respect the visual arts differ considerably from most other aspects of Islamic culture.",
              "This is not to say that there was no impact of the new faith on the arts, but to a large extent it was an incidental impact, the result of the existence of a new social and political entity rather than of a doctrine.",
              "Earliest Islam as seen in the Qur\u02bea\u0304n or in the more verifiable accounts of the Prophet\u2019s life simply do not deal with the arts, either on the practical level of requiring or suggesting forms as expressions of the culture or on the ideological level of defining a Muslim attitude toward images.",
              "In all instances, concrete Qur\u02bea\u0304nic passages later used for the arts had their visual significance extrapolated.",
              "There is no prohibition against representations of living things, and not a single Qur\u02bea\u0304nic passage refers clearly to the mosque, eventually to become the most characteristically Muslim religious building.",
              "In the simple, practical, and puritanical milieu of early Islam, aesthetic or visual questions simply did not arise."

              "Indeed, the two arts are closely related.",
              "The early Chinese written words were simplified pictorial images, indicating meaning through suggestion or imagination.",
              "These simple images were flexible in composition, capable of developing with changing conditions by means of slight variations.",
              "The earliest known Chinese logographs are engraved on the shoulder bones of large animals and on tortoise shells.",
              "For this reason the script found on these objects is commonly called jiaguwen, or shell-and-bone script.",
              "It seems likely that each of the ideographs was carefully composed before it was engraved.",

              "They must have evolved from rough and careless scratches in the still more distant past.",
              "Since the literal content of most jiaguwen is related to ancient religious, mythical prognostication or to rituals, jiaguwen is also known as oracle bone script.",
              "Archaeologists and paleographers have demonstrated that this early script was widely used in the Shang dynasty (c.",
              "1600\u20131046 bce).",
              "Nevertheless, the 1992 discovery of a similar inscription on a potsherd at Dinggongcun in Shandong province demonstrates that the use of a mature script can be dated to the late Neolithic Longshan culture (c.",

              "It was said that Cangjie, the legendary inventor of Chinese writing, got his ideas from observing animals\u2019 footprints and birds\u2019 claw marks on the sand as well as other natural phenomena.",
              "He then started to work out simple images from what he conceived as representing different objects such as those that are given below: Surely, the first images that the inventor drew of these few objects could not have been quite so stylized but must have undergone some modifications to reach the above stage.",
              "Each image is composed of a minimum number of lines and yet is easily recognizable.",
              "Nouns no doubt came first.",

              "If the three creatures were not standing in an orderly manner, they could become rough and aggressive to anyone approaching them.",
              "From the aesthetic point of view, three such images could not be arranged side by side within an imaginary square without cramping one another, and in the end none would look like a deer at all.",
              "Jiaguwen was followed by a form of writing found on bronze vessels associated with ancestor worship and thus known as jinwen (\u201cmetal script\u201d).",

              "The following words can be compared with similar words in bone-and-shell script: This third stage in the development of Chinese calligraphy was known as xiaozhuan (\u201csmall seal\u201d) style.",
              "Small-seal script is characterized by lines of even thickness and many curves and circles.",
              "Each word tends to fill up an imaginary square, and a passage written in small-seal style has the appearance of a series of equal squares neatly arranged in columns and rows, each of them balanced and well-spaced.",
              "This uniform script had been established chiefly to meet the growing demands for record keeping.",
              "Unfortunately, the small-seal style could not be written speedily and therefore was not entirely suitable, giving rise to the fourth stage, lishu, or official style.",

              "Careful examination of lishu reveals no circles and very few curved lines.",
              "Squares and short straight lines, vertical and horizontal, predominate.",
              "Because of the speed needed for writing, the brush in the hand tends to move up and down, and an even thickness of line cannot be easily achieved.",
              "Lishu is thought to have been invented by Cheng Miao (240\u2013207 bce), who had offended Shihuangdi and was serving a 10-year sentence in prison.",
              "He spent his time in prison working out this new development, which opened up seemingly endless possibilities for later calligraphers.",
              "Freed by lishu from earlier constraints, they evolved new variations in the shape of strokes and in character structure.",

              "While stroke thickness may vary, the shapes remain rigid;",
              "for instance, the vertical lines had to be shorter and the horizontal ones longer.",
              "As this curtailed the freedom of hand to express individual artistic taste, a fifth stage developed\u2014zhenshu (kaishu), or regular script.",
              "No individual is credited with inventing this style, which was probably created during the period of the Three Kingdoms and Xi Jin (220\u2013317).",

              "in fact, what is known as modern Chinese writing is almost 2,000 years old, and the written words of China have not changed since the first century of the Common Era.",

              "Although the examination was abolished in 1905, most Chinese up to the present day try to acquire a hand in regular style.",
              "In zhenshu each stroke, each square or angle, and even each dot can be shaped according to the will and taste of the calligrapher.",
              "Indeed, a word written in regular style presents an almost infinite variety of problems of structure and composition, and, when executed, the beauty of its abstract design can draw the mind away from the literal meaning of the word itself.",
              "The greatest exponents of Chinese calligraphy were Wang Xizhi and his son Wang Xianzhi in the 4th century.",
              "Few of their original works have survived, but a number of their writings were engraved on stone tablets and woodblocks, and rubbings were made from them.",
              "Many great calligraphers imitated their styles, but none ever surpassed them for artistic transformation.",
              "Wang Xizhi not only provided the greatest example in the regular script, but he also relaxed the tension somewhat in the arrangement of the strokes in the regular style by giving easy movement to the brush to trail from one word to another.",
              "This is called xingshu, or running script.",
              "This, in turn, led to the creation of caoshu, or grass script, which takes its name from its resemblance to windblown grass\u2014disorderly yet orderly.",
              "The English term cursive writing does not describe grass script, for a standard cursive hand can be deciphered without much difficulty, but grass style greatly simplifies the regular style and can be deciphered only by seasoned calligraphers.",
              "It is less a style for general use than for that of the calligrapher who wishes to produce a work of abstract art.",
              "Technically speaking, there is no mystery in Chinese calligraphy.",
              "The tools for Chinese calligraphy are few\u2014an ink stick, an ink stone, a brush, and paper (some prefer silk).",
              "The calligrapher, using a combination of technical skill and imagination, must provide interesting shapes to the strokes and must compose beautiful structures from them without any retouching or shading and, most important of all, with well-balanced spaces between the strokes.",
              "This balance needs years of practice and training.",
              "The fundamental inspiration of Chinese calligraphy, as of all arts in China, is nature.",
              "In regular script each stroke, even each dot, suggests the form of a natural object.",
              "As every twig of a living tree is alive, so every tiny stroke of a piece of fine calligraphy has the energy of a living thing.",
              "Printing does not admit the slightest variation in the shapes and structures, but strict regularity is not tolerated by Chinese calligraphers, especially those who are masters of the caoshu.",
              "A finished piece of fine calligraphy is not a symmetrical arrangement of conventional shapes but, rather, something like the coordinated movements of a skillfully composed dance\u2014impulse, momentum, momentary poise, and the interplay of active forces combining to form a balanced whole."

              "Because of its clarity and legibility, it lends itself well to signs, titles, and other kinds of graphic art.",
              "Standard Style Early forms of standard style date from around the third century CE, but the great \u201cmasters\u201d of the form, such as Ouyang Xun (557\u2013641), Yan Zhenqing (709\u2013785), and Liu Gongquan (778\u2013865), lived during the Tang Period (618\u2013907).",

              "Cursive (Grass) Style The most flamboyant and yet recondite of all the scripts, the cursive style developed in the Qin and Han Periods, and some of its greatest early examples were written by Wang Xizhi (303\u2013361 CE).",
              "Making full use of the potential of the soft brush and fluid ink, cursive style characters go to extremes of simplification, drama, and individuality.",

              "it is still a component of primary education programs in schools and private households in Japan, Korea, and throughout the Chinese-speaking diaspora.",
              "These examinations were used to measure students\u2019 qualifications for positions in government offices.",
              "Examiners not only evaluated students on their knowledge of the Confucian classics and their ability to compose poetry and essays, but the ability to write elegantly shaped characters with the brush was a central part of the exams. The examinations\u2019 emphasis on calligraphy was more than a matter of ensuring that students\u2019 handwriting was up to the task of drafting legible bureaucratic documents.",
              "It was related to the theory that the practice of calligraphy was a form of moral training.",
              "Educated people in premodern East Asia commonly believed that because the process of learning to write well required years of repetitive, disciplined practice, it inevitably conveyed practitioners\u2019 sincerity, equanimity, strength of character, and perseverance.",
              "Those qualities were assumed to be visible in the handwriting of those who had achieved this high level of personal cultivation.",
              "Training in writing was the same thing as training in virtue;",
              "thus, for those who wished to achieve social and political influence, it was of great importance that one was able to write texts not only persuasive in content but also elegant in appearance.",

              "Furthermore, digital communication continues to supplant handwritten documents in modern East Asia, as it does in other parts of the developed world.",
              "Nonetheless, calligraphy has remained a vital if small part of the curriculum in the Chinese cultural sphere, and there are many reasons for this.",
              "Part of calligraphy\u2019s appeal is that it allows contemporary people to connect with an ancient practice, but there is also a lingering belief that it is useful in developing a disciplined virtuous personal character.",
              "As anthropologist Yuehping Yen writes of her fieldwork on calligraphy in modern China: The Chinese people believe that the person and the handwriting are mutually generative: Handwriting -> ren ru qi zi: The person resembles one\u2019s handwriting.",

              "However, many Japanese people continue to believe that a handwritten re\u0301sume\u0301 offers insight into the writer\u2019s personality and shows the applicant\u2019s sense of seriousness about the desired job.",
              "An online poll taken by Yahoo Japan as recently as 2015 asked the question, \u201cIf you were in charge of hiring, which applicant would you choose: the one who sent a handwritten re\u0301sume\u0301 or the one who typed it on a computer?",

              "2 The results of this poll are particularly interesting, as its respondents presumably were frequent users of online technology themselves.",

              "It has obvious benefits for learners of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean language;",
              "however, one of the most striking features of the Chinese writing system is its power to fascinate both those who can read it and those who cannot.",
              "In this sense, brush calligraphy may be easily integrated into classes covering a range of topics.",
              "The benefit of brush calligraphy in language classes may seem the most obvious.",
              "Because beginners typically concentrate on learning to write only a few characters at a time, its utility in helping students memorize large amounts of vocabulary may be small.",
              "However, for many learners, practice with a brush helps develop intuition about stroke order and composition, and promote accurate and elegant handwriting.",
              "It may also add enjoyment to what some students may find a tedious process of practicing writing Chinese characters.",
              "The potential for including brush calligraphy in nonlanguage classes is also great.",
              "For nonlanguage learners, Chinese characters have great fascination.",
              "They are visually appealing, and many of our students find them intriguing and mysterious.",
              "Such students are in good company: historically, it was not uncommon for people in the sinosphere to even believe that Chinese characters had healing or other magical properties.",
              "Even in a modern classroom, their obvious aesthetic attributes of grace and intricacy have a powerfully attractive quality for many students, particularly visual learners.",
              "The Calligraphy Classroom: Tools and Techniques Historically, calligraphy\u2019s basic tool kit included items that came to be called the \u201cFour Treasures of a Scholar\u2019s Studio\u201d: brush, ink, paper, and ink stone.",
              "Typical Chinese calligraphy paper is called xuanzhi, which is often erroneously translated as \u201crice paper\u201d but is more likely to contain fibers of mulberry, elm, or bamboo rather than rice.",
              "The invention of liquid bottled ink has enabled students to do without the labor-intensive (if elegant) stick ink, making it possible to use a shallow dish in place of an ink stone.",
              "In some cases, ink and paper can be discarded in favor of specially treated paper that temporarily darkens in contact with a brush dipped in water, then lightens again when dry.",
              "This enables the student to reuse the same sheet over and over again without buying new materials;",
              "furthermore, it eliminates the need for ink, which reduces costs and the potential for mess.",
              "Perhaps modern practitioners of brush calligraphy only require one \u201cTreasure,\u201d the brush itself.",
              "Nevertheless, the many varieties of inks, papers, and brushes create different effects, and educators wishing to offer students more than just a brief experience of calligraphy encourage their students to experiment widely.",
              "Standard script is the style that most commonly serves as the focus of calligraphy education programs in China, Japan, and Korea.",
              "The advantages of following this convention for educators in schools elsewhere are many: It is the one most familiar to learners of Chinese language, and the one that most closely resembles most fonts used in books and other printed documents.",
              "For this reason, the shapes and stroke counts of characters written in this style are easy to recognize.",
              "Furthermore, in keeping with its status as the most frequently used script, exemplars produced in this style are readily available.",
              "The most frequently mentioned character used as a primary focus of learning standard-style calligraphy is yong \u6c38, because its strokes correspond to the \u201ceight strokes\u201d regarded as the basic elements of the standard style: dot, horizontal, vertical, hook, raise, bent, down-left slant, and down-right slant.",
              "Textbooks typically choose the work of one of the \u201cgreat\u201d calligraphers, such as Ouyang Xun (557\u2013641), Yan Zhengqing (709\u2013785), or Liu Gongquan (778\u2013865), as a basis for their models.",
              "However, standard is not the only style, and there is strong pedagogical justification for using other styles, or at least starting with them when introducing beginning students to brush calligraphy.",
              "Seal script is a style option particularly well-suited to working with learners with no experience with Chinese characters, or with young children.",
              "This form is derived from characters used in the earliest stage of Chinese writing, such as those engraved on oracle bones.",
              "Many of them bear a close resemblance to pictorial images of the ideas they represent.",
              "The seal script version of \u201cdeer,\u201d for example, has lines suggestive of the animal\u2019s antlers, legs, and eye.",
              "The seal script version of \u201cwater\u201d appears to depict a sinuous stream.",
              "Even characters that require some explanation, such as those representing words related to \u201csun,\u201d horse,\u201d or \u201cheart,\u201d for instance, are easily identifiable to beginners.",
              "Seal Script Examples There are other advantages to seal script as well.",
              "Learners find that using the brush to write characters in this style is not all that different than writing Roman letters or making an outline sketch, and it allows them to gain practice in brush technique with a minimum of distractions.",
              "Completing a composition involving very few seal script characters\u2014or even one\u2014is therefore relatively simple and straightforward, and can be extremely rewarding for beginning or casual students of East Asian cultures.",
              "Another option for easing the transition between writing with pen or pencil and writing with a brush also involves an alternative to standard script.",
              "This is starting with clerical script and is the technique advocated by Dartmouth University calligraphy specialist Wen Xing in his recent book, Hiding the Tip: Gateway to Chinese Calligraphy.",
              "Clerical script, like seal script, allows writers to use the brush in a manner similar to the way they might when writing Roman letters.",
              "While clerical script characters are less pictorial than those written in seal script, and thus potentially more challenging to beginning learners, their close resemblance to standard script characters might be an advantage for Chinese-language learners.",
              "Furthermore, the strong influence of clerical style on running style and cursive style makes knowledge of it useful to those who aspire to more extensive study of Chinese calligraphy.",
              "In short, brush calligraphy can be a powerful resource for educators.",
              "As a cultural practice that is linked with East Asian religions, visual arts, thought, and society, it rewards discussion at a wide range of ages and levels\u2014from brief introduction to in-depth study.",
              "The simplicity of the brush calligraphy tool kit makes it possible for beginners to explore brush writing without making a deep commitment in terms of either cost or time.",
              "On the other hand, in its most sophisticated forms, brush calligraphy can offer a lifetime of satisfaction to students who continue to practice it.",
