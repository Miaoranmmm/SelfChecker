              "Without this organ, life is unimaginable.",

              "The purpose is to develop a temporary machine or pump for a person who has a disease of the heart and their survival without transplant is impossible.",
              "These temporary devices can provide enough time for the patient until a donor heart is available.",
              "The purpose of this review is to provide an overview and history of how man has developed an artificial heart for survival.",
              "The heart is the most important organ in the human body.",
              "It transports blood to various parts of our body and most importantly keeps us alive.",
              "The leading cause of death today is heart disease and around 600,000 people die from this yearly [1].",
              "Furthermore, heart failure is affecting around 20 million people exclusively in the United States and Europe [2].",
              "Approximately 100,000 people are diagnosed with progressive heart failure every year [2].",
              "If the heart failure has reached an advanced stage, \u201c60-94%\u201d of patients will die in 1 year [2].",
              "Due to these statistics, the heart has become a concern for doctors and scientists alike.",
              "There are many drugs in the market to treat heart disease but once the disease has reached a certain phase, the drugs can only do so much.",
              "The only option left after drugs is transplantation.",
              "Patients are then left to wait on a donor list but some will not make it waiting to receive a transplant.",
              "Additionally, there are approximately a little over 2,000 hearts available for patients per year but there are more than 3,000 patients waiting for a transplant [2, 3].",
              "Throughout the last century, many doctors have materialized their theories concerning the heart into new life-saving technologies.",
              "These theories culminated over the years into what is known as the artificial heart today.",
              "The theory of \u201cmechanical circulatory support\u201d was first hypothesized by Julien Jean Cesar LeGallois in 1812 [4].",
              "However, his hypothesis would not become a reality until the 21st century.",
              "Nearly a century after LeGallois\u2019 theory, the unforeseen pairing of Charles Lindbergh and Alexis Carrel joined forces to advance mechanical circulatory support in the 1920s.",
              "Lindbergh was an inventor who is mainly known today as an aviator who flew over the Atlantic whilst Carrel was a surgeon who won the Nobel Prize for his innovations in organ transplantation [5].",
              "Carrel was uncertain that while performing heart surgery, an external blood pump could support the human body.",
              "Lindbergh reviewed the issues that Carrel was having and went on to create several of his own blood pumps which turned out to be unsuccessful.",
              "It took him a few years but he eventually created a blood pump that actually worked.",
              "Lindbergh also went on to create a centrifuge that could securely separate blood plasma.",

              "This was a high bar to reach, since the first design had an external compressor with an airline through the skin into the patient's body.",
              "Compressed air inflated and deflated Dacron pouches or sacs, which collapsed and expanded to displace blood from a surrounding sac.",
              "While having the compressor outside the body was useful, since the mechanical parts (which were most susceptible to wear) could be easily replaced, it would make for a bulky piece of equipment to be wheeled about with the patient.",
              "It was difficult to see how this could be given to a patient and expect them to live an even partly normal life for many years.",
              "However, the history of the artificial heart is also intertwined with that of the heart transplant.",
              "This was again only a hopeful dream in the early 1960s, but by 1967 cardiac surgeon Christian Baarnard in Cape Town performed the first successful transplant.",
              "Now, the purpose of these first artificial hearts was changed.",
              "They did not need to be suitable for a lifetime;",
              "their purpose was to keep the patient alive until a transplant donor could be found.",
              "As with many highly experimental therapies, the first case was done on a patient who had run out of options.",
              "A 47-year-old man was being operated on to repair a huge aneurysm of the left ventricle that had thinned and swollen the heart wall.",
              "He was being supported by a heart-lung machine, which bypassed the heart and kept blood flowing through the body.",
              "However, he could not be weaned from the machine at the end of the operation as his heart was too weak.",
              "He desperately needed a transplant.",
              "Denton Cooley, DeBakey's associate, offered him the new experimental total artificial heart and he accepted.",
              "The patient was kept stable with the new device for 64 hours until a matching donor heart was found and then transplanted.",
              "This seemed at first a triumph for the total artificial heart, but tragically the patient died 32 hours later from sepsis.",
              "Not only that but the device had damaged both the blood and the kidneys, and the walls of the expandable sacs were coated with blood clots.",
              "This heralded a series of problems that would continue to thwart the scientists and engineers wrestling with this procedure.",
              "Infections and sepsis are a continual challenge to any device where there is a wire that must permanently cross the skin.",
              "Devices that move the blood will alter its composition and the foreign surfaces will cause the blood to clot, resulting in strokes and blood breakdown.",
              "The first Jarvik heart, one of the next iterations, was implanted in five patients and one lived for 620 days.",
              "But two of the patients had severe strokes, and eventually all died of either sepsis or blood problems. Rather than replace the heart, surgeons developed mechanical devices that would assist it in pumping blood around the body (Credit: Brian Nguyen/Alamy) Sian E Harding, a recognised authority in cardiac science, is Emeritus Professor of Cardiac Pharmacology in the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, where she led the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences and the BHF Centre for Cardiac Regeneration.",
              "She is the author of \"The Exquisite Machine,\" from which this article is excerpted.",
              "Heart transplantation also had a shaky start, with Baarnard's first patient dying after only 18 days.",
              "The first patient in the UK, whose transplantation was performed at London's National Heart Hospital, survived for only 45 days, and the general success rate remained disappointing.",
              "The problem here was not the mechanics of the operation or the initial performance of the new heart.",
              "It was the mismatch of the immune system of the recipient to that of the donor heart.",
              "Even though the donor heart is matched as closely as possible to the patient with the major tissue types, the immune system must be suppressed to stop the heart being rejected.",
              "You might also like: Drugs to suppress the immune system were not very sophisticated in the early days, but the development of ciclosporin in the early 1980s produced a revolution in immunosuppression that dramatically improved the success of heart transplantation.",
              "Now, it is a victim of its own success, with many more people in need of a transplant than there are donors.",
              "Only about 200 transplants are carried out in the UK each year despite more than 750,000 living with heart failure, and similar figures are seen worldwide.",
              "To fill this gap, scientists have been genetically modifying pigs to make their hearts compatible with the human immune system so that they can be transplanted to patients without being rejected.",
              "This has proved very complex and challenging, but first clinical transplants started in 2022.",
              "The success of heart transplantation, however, had reinvigorated the search for the total artificial heart, with the more achievable goal of keeping the patient alive until a donor is found, or \"bridge to transplant\" as it is called.",
              "For decades, the artificial heart technologies have improved through changes to more biocompatible materials, better valve design, and more efficient handling of blood flow.",
              "Successes have been achieved: one study saw 80% of patients on the artificial hearts surviving for over a year, and some for six years.",
              "The longest time a patient was supported to transplant was 1,373 days.",
              "But severe infectious complications were still common, and the goal of a complete \"destination\" therapy for artificial hearts was still a distant dream.",
              "Meanwhile, the urgent need to bridge to transplant had taken the technology in another direction.",
              "Rather than replacing the failing heart completely, the idea was to support it by assisting the blood flow.",
              "The ventricular assist device, or VAD, took blood out of the ventricle of the heart by a completely different route and pushed it into the aorta at high pressure.",
              "This added to the blood being ejected from the heart and thereby magnified the effective cardiac output.",
              "It also solved another problem encountered by the engineers of total artificial hearts \u2013 how to balance the right and left heart-blood flow.",
              "Robert Jarvik developed a device that could keep heart patients stable while they waited for a blood transplant, but it had limited success (Credit: Getty Images) The amount of blood circulating in the left ventricle/body loop must be very close to that in the right ventricle/lung loop.",
              "With 100,000 beats a day, even a teaspoon of difference at each beat would add up to 500 litres (110 gallons) of blood in the wrong place.",
              "The heart has evolved complex biological mechanisms to make sure this does not happen, but the engineers were having huge battles to try to do the same with feedback systems. For VADs, either the right (or more usually) the left ventricle can be independently supported, taking this problem away.",
              "Left ventricular assist devices, or LVADs, have produced a revolution in care for end-stage heart failure.",
              "More than 15,000 LVADs have now been implanted worldwide, and around a third of patients with end-stage heart failure are now supported on LVADs.",
              "The intention is usually to bridge the patients to transplant, but in fact the shortage of donor hearts means that patients can often stay on LVAD support for years.",
              "Survival rates of over 50% are seen at seven years, and there are reports of patients living up to 13 years on these devices.",
              "LVADs have therefore become by default a therapy in themselves.",
              "Again, technology has progressed, with newer LVADs performing better.",
              "A breakthrough idea was to stop imitating the heart, with its pulsing action, and move to constant flow of blood.",
              "Rotating paddles (impellers) push the blood along in a continuous motion, creating a smooth unbroken stream.",
              "This has the curious side effect of creating a patient without a pulse, which can be disconcerting for the unsuspecting physician as well as producing some unwanted side effects as the body adapts to the new flow.",
              "External battery packs are still an inconvenience and a source of infection, but systems are being developed that transfer energy transcutaneously (across the skin) based on induction (like domestic induction stoves).",
              "The LVAD units would still need a small, implanted battery in case of a temporary device failure \u2013 and it has been known for external battery packs to be snatched from patients by handbag thieves.",
              "The search for a completely implantable total artificial heart continues.",
              "Trying to develop external transcutaneous units to fully power the demands of the heart is the biggest barrier.",
              "Specifications for a total artificial heart require it to pump eight litres (14 pints) per minute of blood against a blood pressure of 110mmHg (millimetres of mercury).",
              "(The biological power storage molecule adenosine triphosphate [ATP] would be needed in quantities greater than half your body weight per day to power your own heart to do that, if ATP were not continually renewed in cells).",
              "Compressors have been miniaturised to be more portable, but it has been a struggle to make them completely implantable.",
              "Here it seems that the VAD technology may hold a solution, dispensing with compressors altogether and using instead the impeller devices, with dual right and left VAD working together.",
              "Solutions seem tantalisingly close, but no one is anticipating an easy ride.",
              "The many failures over the years have certainly produced in scientists a humility and awe for the natural engineering of the heart.",

              "Moreover, more than half of the deaths in the United States were caused by cardiovascular diseases.",
              "Many of these deaths could have been prevented by aggressive management and surgical procedures, including heart transplant operations.",
              "The shortage of donor hearts, however, led to hope that a totally implantable mechanical device could overcome the shortage and avoid the problem of immunological rejection, but early attempts to implant permanent artificial hearts were criticized as premature human experiments.",
              "Indeed, the controversies raised by experimental implantations in the 1960s may have inhibited the development of a permanent heart replacement.",
              "The poor quality of life provided by artificial hearts instead led to efforts to develop a new generation of left ventricular assist devices.",
              "The human heart is a remarkable organ\u2014little bigger than a fist\u2014that beats over 100,000 times a day without rest.",
              "In an average adult, the heart pumps more than 4,300 gallons (16,000 liters) of blood a day through nearly 100,000 miles (161,000 km) of blood vessels.",
              "Picturing the heart as just a pump, Michael E.",
              "DeBakey, a pioneer of heart surgery, who has been called the \"Texas Tornado,\" predicted that a mechanical device could duplicate its main function.",
              "Artificial hearts actually date back to 1957, when Willem Kolff, inventor of the artificial kidney, and Tetsuzo Akutsu implanted an experimental heart into animals.",
              "Kolff's model heart kept a dog alive for 36 hours.",
              "Heart specialists and scientists have pursued four general approaches to heart replacement: artificial hearts, transplantation of donor hearts, assist devices that replace just part of the natural heart, and replacement hearts developed by tissue-engineering techniques in the laboratory, or hearts grown in genetically altered animals.",
              "The ideal artificial heart would function essentially maintenance free for many years within the hot, humid, corrosive internal environment of the body.",
              "The design of a successful artificial heart would have to overcome the difficulties that have been revealed since the first such devices were tested in the 1960s: damage to the blood caused by contact with artificial materials, rejection of the replacement heart by the body's immune system, difficulties in delivering adequate power to the pump without connections through the skin, miniaturizing the pumps enough for use in children and small adults, and adjusting blood flow in response to physiological stress.",
              "Although the artificial hearts in development during the 1990s may solve many of these problems, these devices will probably not become practical or routine for many years.",
              "Indeed, the history of the artificial heart is a history of controversial cases.",
              "Studies conducted by the Institute of Medicine in the 1990s estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 Americans per year could be candidates for a total artificial heart and another 25,000 to 50,000 might need a left ventricular assist device.",
              "Heart failure affects about 5 million Americans per year;",
              "in addition, mortality from heart failure increased threefold between 1974 and 1994.",
              "Various forms of artificial pumps have provided temporary \"bridges,\" keeping patients alive while awaiting a transplant, but the number of donated hearts is only about 2,000 per year.",
              "For many patients, assist pumps, also known as left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), may be more practical than replacing the entire heart.",
              "DeBakey began working on an artificial heart and related devices in 1960.",
              "He invented a simple blood pump, the LVAD, that could assist the heart while a patient waited for a transplant.",
              "In 1966 DeBakey performed the first human implantation of an LVAD.",
              "One of the most dramatic events in twentieth-century surgery occurred in 1967, when Christiaan Barnard (1922- ), a South African surgeon, performed the first human heart transplant.",
              "(In many cases, heart disease may be so severe that a patient may not survive the wait for a donor heart.)",
              "Attempts to use animal organs, such as Leonard Bailey's 1984 transplantation of a baboon's heart into a newborn, who was identified as Baby Fae, ended in failure.",
              "Therefore, the shortage of donor organs provided a great impetus to the development of an artificial heart.",
              "On April 4, 1969, Denton A.",
              "Cooley performed the first human implantation of a total artificial heart when he used a device developed by Domingo Liotta to sustain the life of Haskell Karp.",
              "Karp was a 47-year-old patient who was in cardiac failure after surgery for a left ventricular aneurysm.",
              "Karp lived with the artificial heart in his chest for 65 hours but died shortly after receiving a heart transplant.",
              "DeBakey claimed that the heart Cooley used was identical to one under development in his laboratory and that Cooley had used it without permission.",
              "Because the device had been used with only limited success in calves, DeBakey considered human implantation premature and unwise.",
              "Although Cooley had obtained consent for the operation from the patient, he had not sought permission from the hospital review board or from federal agencies.",
              "He and Liotta thought that permission would not have been granted and that they would have lost a perfect opportunity to perform the experiment.",
              "The working relationship between Cooley and DeBakey was destroyed by the controversy surrounded the Karp operation.",
              "Then Karp's widow brought a wrongful death suit against Cooley.",
              "She claimed that she and her husband had not been fully informed of the risks of the experimental procedure.",
              "The judge dismissed the case, ruling that the patient had given informed consent and that the hospital and surgeons had thoroughly informed the patient of the risks of the procedure and the low probability of complete recovery or survival.",
              "The decision in this case is regarded as a landmark in the development and implementation of medical technology.",
              "In 1981 Cooley performed another controversial operation, the implantation of a total artificial heart developed by Tetsuzo Akutsu.",
              "The 36-year-old patient was sustained on the artificial heart for 55 hours until a donor heart was available for transplantation.",
              "Robert Jarvik, a physician and biomedical engineer, approached DeBakey about testing a similar device, known as the Jarvik-7, but DeBakey refused because he did not think that the device was ready for human use.",
              "One year later, William DeVries, in cooperation with Jarvik, implanted the Jarvik-7 heart into the chest of Barney Clark, a 61-year-old Seattle dentist dying of heart failure.",
              "In contrast to the Karp case, in which the artificial heart was implanted as a bridge to transplant, DeVries and Jarvik intended to use their artificial heart as a permanent replacement for the diseased heart.",
              "Clark, who survived for 112 days on the artificial heart, was honored by members of the implant team as a \"true pioneer\" who understood that he was participating in an experiment that was unlikely to save his life but one that would provide information to help biomedical science and other patients.",
              "Five similar implants were performed through 1985.",
              "The longest survivor was William Schroeder, who was supported by the Jarvik-7 for 620 days.",
              "The spectacle of the poor quality of life and painful complications endured by patients such as Clark and Schroeder created a significant public backlash against the artificial heart.",
              "Moreover, many doctors, scientists, ethicists, and policy makers concluded that use of the artificial heart was premature and that it would be well into the next century before a new generation of artificial hearts significantly improved patients' lives.",
              "The problems associated with implantable artificial hearts eventually led to a general consensus that an assist device would be more practical and beneficial to patients.",
              "The original purpose of LVADs was to keep people with terminal heart failure alive until a donor heart became available.",
              "In this manner, the Jarvik-7 was later used in hundreds of patients as a bridge to transplantation.",
              "By the early 1990s, sophisticated LVADs were being used routinely in hospitals all over the world.",
              "Many of the early devices, however, were too large for use in children and small adults.",
              "Researchers thus focused on the development of a small, but still powerful LVAD.",
              "DeBakey and others had to carry out some of their experiments and clinical trials in Europe because governmental rules regarding clinical trials were more stringent in the United States.",
              "Innovative solutions to the problem of creating a better pump grew out of a collaboration between DeBakey and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientists.",
              "(This collaboration came about following an operation that DeBakey had performed on David Saussier, a NASA engineer.",
              "The DeBakey Ventricular Assist Device (VAD), a miniaturized pump approximately one-tenth the size of the older devices, caused less damage to blood cells, required less than eight watts of power, and could be recharged through the skin.",
              "Many other experimental devices were also undergoing testing by 1998, when the 90-year-old DeBakey went to Germany to supervise the first human trials of his VAD personally.",
              "Six patients in all, the first, who was in critical condition at the time of the operation, died six weeks later.",
              "The second had his device removed because of the formation of a blood clot in the mechanism, but two other patients were able to leave the hospital with the device still in place.",
              "The new generation of LVADs offers hope to many patients because of an unexpected phenomenon reported by several heart transplant centers.",
              "Some of the patients using LVADS while waiting for a donor heart were actually recovering.",
              "Apparently, the complete rest to the left ventricle provided by the LVAD reversed heart failure to a significant extent and enlarged heart cells were returning to normal size.",
              "Therefore, LVADs might also be used as a \"bridge to recovery.\"",

              "Before its first successful transplantation in 1982, the Jarvik 7 was tested in clinical trials.",
              "Barney Clark, the first recipient of the Jarvik 7 lived for 112 days after the transplant.",
              "The second recipient went on to live for 620 days.",
              "In the three subsequent recipients, one died from blood loss, and the other two lived for 10 and 14 months [16].",
              "Essentially, all patients died from different complications such as multi-organ failure, stroke, and infection to name a few.",
              "The main issue with the Jarvik 7 was that a \u201clarge pneumatic console\u201d was required for treatment and therefore the patient could not leave the hospital [16].",
              "This caveat would not allow the Jarvik 7 to be a permanent artificial heart implant.",
              "Essentially, the Jarvik 7 had two \u201cair-powered pumps\u201d that copied the heart\u2019s function at 40 - 120 bpm (beats per minute) [16].",
              "Each chamber had a \u201cdisk-like mechanism\u201d which was made out of polyurethane that pushed the blood through the Jarvik 7 from the inflowing valve to the exiting valve [16].",
              "Cuffs were used to attach the Jarvik 7 to the heart\u2019s natural atria.",
              "The cuffs were attached by drive lines which were made of reinforced polyurethane.",
              "The drives lines were also coated to promote tissue growth.",
              "The drive lines were inserted through the patient\u2019s left side.",
              "A large electronic unit the size of a refrigerator supplied power to the Jarvik to allow it to operate.",
              "This unit also controlled the \u201cpump rate, pumping pressure, and other essential functions using electricity, compressed air, and a vacuum\u201d [16].",
              "Jarvik 7 was later renamed the Cardiowest Total Artificial Heart.",
              "This is because Symbion, who originally produced the device, haltered manufacturing in 1990 because they were not following FDA requirements.",
              "MedForte Research gained rights from Symbion and it later formed a partnership with University Medical Center in Tucson, Arizona [17].",
              "These two organizations went on to form the CardioWest heart.",
              "Consequently, the Jarvik 7 was then renamed to the Cardiowest Total Artificial Heart in 1991 [16, 17].",
              "In 2004, the Cardiowest TAH received FDA approval for bridge to transplant indications [2].",
              "Bridge to transplant basically means that the artificial heart is only in place till an actual human heart can be located for transplantation.",
              "Several years later, the CardioWest TAH was again renamed \u201cthe SynCardia temporary\u201d TAH in 2010.",
              "Clinical trials showed survival rates to be \u201c79% vs. 46%\u201d when evaluated against the control group [2, 18].",
              "The survival rates 1 and 5 years after transplantation were \u201c86% and 64%\u201d [2, 18].",
              "These statistics proved to be positive when compared with the statistics of that of the United Network of Organ Sharing [2].",
              "After the SynCardia temporary, the AbioCor TAH emerged.",
              "This is the first \u201cself-contained internal artificial heart\u201d [19].",
              "Researchers studied and tested this device for 30 years.",
              "Clinical trials began in 2001 and that same year the device was implanted in a human [19].",
              "The AbioCor went on to be approved by the FDA in 2006 [19].",
              "What is unique about this device is that it does not require any subcutaneous connections, meaning that that patient does not need to be hooked up to \u201cexternal air-pumping machines via tubes or wires that pierce the skin\u2019s surface\u201d [20].",
              "The AbioCor TAH weighs 2 pounds and is constituted of four parts which are implanted into the human body.",
              "These four parts are: electronic controller, thoracic unit, lithium battery, and transcutaneous energy transmission device (TET) [20].",
              "This also includes \u201ctwo artificial ventricles and corresponding valves\u201d.",
              "This system has a hydraulic pump which is run by a motor and mimics the human heartbeat.",
              "The battery that is implanted into the human body is continuously recharged by the TET and an external battery.",
              "The TET relays energy via the skin.",
              "The internal battery has power for up to 30 min whereas the external battery can last up to 4 h.",
              "It should be noted the AbioCor system is only geared towards patients who have biventricular heart failure [20].",
              "Biventricular heart failure occurs when both the left and right ventricles are not pumping a sufficient amount of blood to maintain the body [21].",
              "Basically, the FDA had granted that the AbioCor only be used under the Humanitarian Device Exception (HDE) [22].",
              "Following this exception, only one patient was transplanted with an AbioCor and it later went out of production due to complications from \u201cthromboembolism and atrial suck-down events\u201d [22].",
              "In March 2010, SynCardia released the portable freedom driver [23].",
              "With this device, patients will no longer be confined to a hospital due to the large pneumatic console.",
              "This will allow patients freedom and the ability to live their lives normally after being transplanted with an artificial heart.",
              "After receiving an artificial heart, patients are normally restricted to the hospital waiting for a human heart donor.",
              "This reduces the quality of life and incurs costs for the patients.",
              "Additionally, hospitals do not have the resources to maintain the current protocol.",
              "The portable freedom driver weighs 13 pounds and is basically a \u201cpiston-driven pneumatic compressor\u201d that supplies pressure to the TAH.",
              "The beat rate is the only parameter which is adjustable and is calculated prior to being connected to the patient [24].",
              "The purpose of the beat rate is to partly fill the ventricles.",
              "Thus, the TAH output produces a Frank Starling effect.",
              "A Frank Starling effect is when \u201cthe stroke volume\u201d of the heart rises because blood has filled the heart [25].",
              "The extra amount of blood causes the ventricular wall to expand, which in turn triggers the cardiac muscle to contract vigorously [25].",
              "After the Frank Starling response, electric motors within the device push the piston to allow backup superfluity [24].",
              "The patient can easily charge the portable freedom driver in any electrical outlet even via a car\u2019s auxiliary port.",
              "Patients even have the ability to bath with this device.",
              "The device contains lithium batteries which last for 3 h [24].",
              "This unique device allows the recipients of the TAH to be outpatients during their wait for a human heart donor.",
              "They would no longer be restricted to the hospital.",
              "It should be noted that though the artificial heart is an amazing accomplishment which has been made, it is also extremely costly.",
              "It can cost anywhere from $190,000 to $220,000 [26].",
              "More than 600 patients have been transplanted with the SynCardia TAH [18].",
              "This quantity is greatly significant when compared to the nearly 15 patients who received the AbioCor TAH [18, 22].",
              "The SynCardia is the most used TAH, making up 93% of the worldwide use of this device [18].",
              "It is the most successful TAH and exceeds \u201c116 patient-years of device support\u201d [18].",
              "The heart is a vital organ needed for human survival.",
              "It supplies oxygen to the major organs of our body.",
              "If the heart does not function properly, different organs such as the liver, kidneys, and brain will not receive oxygen.",

              "It is also distinct from a ventilator, used to support failing lungs, or the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is used to support those with both inadequate heart and lung function for up to days or weeks, unlike the bypass machine.",
              "A synthetic replacement for a heart remains a long-sought \"holy grail\" of modern medicine.",
              "The obvious benefit of a functional artificial heart would be to lower the need for heart transplants because the demand for organs always greatly exceeds supply.",
              "Although the heart is conceptually a pump, it embodies subtleties that defy straightforward emulation with synthetic materials and power supplies.",
