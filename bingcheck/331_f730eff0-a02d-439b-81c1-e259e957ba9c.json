    "query": "Can you explain the role of microRNAs in gene expression, and how are scientists using this knowledge to develop new treatments for genetic diseases?",
    "response": "Sure, I can try to explain. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally[^1^]. They generally bind to the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of their target mRNAs and repress protein production by destabilizing the mRNA and translational silencing[^1^]. However, they can also interact with other regions of the mRNA, such as the 5'-UTR, coding sequence, and gene promoters, and sometimes activate translation or transcription[^2^]. MiRNAs are involved in many biological processes, such as cell growth, differentiation, development, and apoptosis[^3^] [^4^], and they can target about 60% of the genes of humans and other mammals[^5^].\n\nScientists are using this knowledge to develop new treatments for genetic diseases by manipulating miRNA expression or function. For example, they can use synthetic miRNAs or miRNA mimics to enhance or restore the activity of a beneficial miRNA, or use anti-miRNAs or miRNA inhibitors to block or reduce the activity of a harmful miRNA. These approaches can modulate the expression of multiple genes involved in a disease pathway and potentially correct the underlying molecular defects.",

              "Based on their precursor structures, biogenesis pathways and modes of action, ncRNAs are classified as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs or esiRNAs), promoter associate RNAs (pRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and sno-derived RNAs.",
              "Among these, miRNAs appear as important cytoplasmic regulators of gene expression.",
              "miRNAs act as post-transcriptional regulators of their messenger RNA (mRNA) targets via mRNA degradation and/or translational repression.",
              "However, it is becoming evident that miRNAs also have specific nuclear functions.",
              "Among these, the most studied and debated activity is the miRNA-guided transcriptional control of gene expression.",
              "Although available data detail quite precisely the effectors of this activity, the mechanisms by which miRNAs identify their gene targets to control transcription are still a matter of debate.",
              "Here, we focus on nuclear functions of miRNAs and on alternative mechanisms of target recognition, at the promoter lavel, by miRNAs in carrying out transcriptional gene silencing.",
              "The most studied class of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are the miRNAs.",
              "They are encoded within the genomes of organisms ranging from plants to animals.",
              "It has been estimated that they are able to modulate up to 60% of protein-coding genes in the human genome at the translational level [1].",
              "Because of their ubiquitous role in gene regulation, they are involved in many physiological processes, such as differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and development, and their dysregulation has been related to various pathological disorders, including muscular dystrophy [2], diabetes [3] and several types of cancer [4].",
              "Biogenesis of miRNAs occurs through a multi-step process requiring both a nuclear and a cytoplasmic phase.",
              "They are transcribed typically by RNA polymerases II or III as long primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) with a cap and a poly-A tail.",
              "pri-miRNAs contain a double-stranded stem of about 30 base pairs, a terminal loop and two flanking unstructured single-stranded tails.",
              "pri-miRNAs are processed into short 70-nt stem-loop structures known as precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by a protein complex, the Microprocessor complex, which consists of the RNase III enzyme Drosha, and a double stranded-RNA binding protein, Di George syndrome critical region 8 gene (DGCR8).",
              "Further processing of pre-miRNAs by the RNase III enzyme Dicer generates miRNA duplexes (ds-miRNAs) [5,6] with a phosphate at the 5\u2032 end and a 2-nt overhang with a hydroxyl at the 3\u2032 end [7,8,9].",
              "The miRNA duplex, is successively loaded onto Argonaute (AGO) itself by an RNA inducing silencing complex (RISC) comprising Dicer, trans-activation response RNA-binding protein (TRBP) and AGO.",
              "TRBP identifies the \u201cguide\u201d and the \u201cpassenger\u201d strands in the ds-miRNA molecule.",
              "TRBP senses the thermodynamic properties of the ds-miRNAs, and once it recognizes the strand with the less stable 5\u2032 end, the protein loads the ds-miRNA in the correct orientation onto AGO proteins.",
              "AGO unwinds the duplex, and removes the passenger strand retaining the mature miRNA molecule [5,10].",

              "Other proteins found to bind extracellular miRNAs include high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (126, 127) and nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) (110, 118, 128).",
              "The presence of miRNAs in vesicles or with accompanying proteins is generally thought to protect extracellular miRNAs and increase their stability in the extracellular milieu (120).",
              "Although some extracellular miRNAs are regarded as by-products of cellular activities, such as cell injury or death (128), increasing evidence suggests that the release of extracellular miRNAs is a regulated process.",
              "It has been shown that the secretion of exosomal miRNAs is mediated by a ceramide-dependent pathway and the secreted miRNAs exert growth regulatory effects in target cells (129).",
              "Recently, it was demonstrated that atheroprotective laminar shear stress induced the release of vesicle-free miR-126-3p and other miRNAs, as well as AGO2, from endothelial cells by activating vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3) and synaptosomal-associated protein 23 (SNAP23) (130).",
              "This study also showed that miRNAs secreted from endothelium can regulate the activity of smooth muscle cells (130).",
              "In neuroendocrine cells, miRNAs in large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) are released by exocytosis through vesicle fusion, and this process is mediated by the SNARE complex and accelerated by Ca2+ stimulus (131).",
              "Secretion of miRNAs via exosomes have also been reported to be regulated by signaling molecules, such as interleukin-4 (IL4) (132) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (133).",
              "IL4-activated macrophages were found to secrete exosomes carrying oncogenic miRNAs to promote invasiveness of breast cancer cells (132).",
              "On the other hand, DHA, which has anticancer and anti-angiogenic activities, induced the secretion of miRNA-containing exosomes that exert inhibitory effects on tumor angiogenesis (133).",
              "Many studies have also demonstrated that extracellular miRNAs can exert biological functions in recipient cells to regulate their activity, thereby acting as intercellular signaling molecules.",
              "For example, exosome mediated transfer of miR-105 from metastatic breast cancer cells to endothelial cells directly targeted a tight junction protein, zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), and this led to the destruction of the barrier function of endothelium and promoted metastasis (134).",
              "Moreover, exosomes from umbilical cord blood were found to be enriched in miR-21-3p, which promoted the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts, and induced the angiogenic activities of endothelial cells, leading to accelerated wound healing (135).",
              "miRNAs, specifically miR-342\u20133p and miR-1246, secreted from a highly metastatic human oral cancer cell line, were found to induce metastasis in a poorly metastatic cancer cell line (136).",
              "Extracellular miRNAs have also been reported to bind to Toll-like receptors (137), activate downstream signaling events, and eventually lead to biological responses, such as tumor growth and metastasis (138), and neurodegeneration (139).",
              "Thus, miRNAs may act as chemical messengers to regulate cell-cell communications.",
              "The mechanisms of extracellular miRNA uptake are not well understood.",
              "It has been proposed that vesicle-associated extracellular miRNAs may enter cells by endocytosis, phagocytosis, or direct fusion with the plasma membranes, while vesicle-free secreted miRNAs may be taken up by specific receptors on the cell surface (140).",
              "Indeed, several studies have shown that miRNAs enter recipient cells by endocytosis and micropinocytosis (141, 142).",
              "This process has been reported to be dependent on clathrin, but not on caveolae or lipid rafts in PC12 cells (142).",
              "However, another study conducted in A549-P cells showed that endocytosis of exosomal miRNAs is mediated by caveolae- and lipid raft-dependent pathways (143).",
              "Furthermore, vesicle-free miRNAs associated with HDL are taken up by HDL receptor and scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) receptor in the plasma membrane of the target cells (126, 127).",
              "miRNAs have also been shown to transfer between co-cultured cells via direct cell-cell contact and gap junctions (144).",
              "While these studies suggest that extracellular miRNAs can interact with recipient cells via multiple mechanisms, the factors that determine the specificity of such interactions need to be investigated.",
              "Since the discovery of miRNAs in the earlier 1990s, tremendous progress has been made on how miRNAs are produced within cells, how they exert regulatory effects on gene expression, and how they are involved in various physiological and pathological events.",
              "It is now clear that miRNAs are powerful gene regulators, and that they not only help control mRNA stability and translation but are also involved in transcription.",
              "However, our understanding of when and how miRNAs can exert regulatory effects on transcription is limited.",
              "Similarly, the conditions under which miRNAs elicit translational activation need to be further explored.",
              "In addition, careful analysis and consideration of experimental techniques and model systems should be employed when attempting to generalize miRNA capabilities.",
              "The assaying of miRNA activity within a test tube may not be recapitulated within the cellular environment and thus should be viewed with caution.",
              "Many studies have been conducted in vitro by transfecting pre-miRNAs or mature mRNA mimics into immortalized and cancer cell lines.",
              "The extent to which findings from such studies reflect the endogenous miRNA functions in vivo requires further study.",
              "Also, the addition of chemical tags to miRNA could also impact miRNA:MRE interaction or AGO:miRNA interactions, specifically with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 miRNA nucleotide modifications.",
              "The first and last miRNA nucleotides clamp the miRNA within AGO proteins, and thus tags to these regions may affect miRNA functioning in unpredictable ways.",
              "Recent studies have shed light on the dynamic nature of miRNA actions and further revealed the complexity of miRNA-mediated gene regulation.",
              "Many factors contribute to the activity of miRNAs, including subcellular location, miRNA/mRNA abundance, miRNA:MRE affinity, cell type/state, and the availability of various miRISC components.",
              "miRNAs in the nucleus play a role in regulating transcription and alternative splicing.",
              "Cytosolic miRISC components shuttle between different compartments.",
              "Moreover, their localization, together with the levels of miRNAs and target mRNAs, and the affinity of the miRNA-mRNA interaction, are important for efficient gene regulation.",
              "Recent advances in single molecule imaging will greatly impact the field, as has already begun.",
              "Viewing the movement of single miRNA and/or mRNA with high spatial and temporal resolution will help us understand this complex dynamic in an unprecedented way.",
              "Investigation of large scale, global miRNA interactomes will also propel the field forward, allowing powerful mathematical models to be applied to highly complex regulatory networks.",
              "It is now accepted that extracellular/circulating miRNAs can not only serve as biomarkers for diseases, but also play important roles in intercellular communication.",
              "miRNAs regulate the activity of host cells, and they are also secreted and transferred to recipient cells.",
              "Many studies have shown that extracellular miRNAs are functionally active in recipient cells.",
              "Some miRNAs can even interact with cell surface receptors, such as Toll-like receptors.",
              "Therefore, miRNAs have hormone-like activities.",
              "However, most studies conducted so far were done in vitro using co-culture of different cell types.",
              "More in vivo studies are required to determine whether miRNAs target specific cells under physiological conditions.",

              "Currently, over 35,000 miRNA sequences have been identified in 271 organisms [2].",
              "MiRNAs, approximately 18\u201326 nucleotides long, are expressed in plants, fungi, animals, and unicellular organisms and their synthesis is a finely regulated multi-step process [3].",

              "Bioinformatics analyses have shown that a particular miRNA can regulate expression of up to thousand mRNAs through miRNA-mRNA interaction, and a single mRNA can be controlled by several miRNAs.",
              "Mainly, in mammalian cells, miRNAs bind to the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) of target mRNAs and induce mRNA deadenylation and decapping [4].",
              "Nevertheless, miRNAs can also interact with different regions, such as the 5\u2032-UTR, gene promoter and coding sequence.",
              "Pairing with the 3\u2032-UTR was reported to mediate post-transcriptional silencing more effectively than pairing with the 5\u2019-UTR or coding sequence, while miRNA interaction with promoter regions has been shown to induce transcription [4].",
              "However, what are the exact mechanisms of miRNA action?",
              "Duplexes of mature miRNA are assembled with an Argonaute (Ago 1\u20134) protein forming the miRISC complex (miRNA-induced silencing complex).",
              "Domain N of Ago fixes miRNA strands in place with the Ago PAZ domain that separates the miRNA duplex.",
              "miRISC usually retains the strand with less stable 5\u2019-end base pairing, while the other strand is degraded [4].",
              "The miRNA being partial complementary to a specific mRNA results in translational repression [4].",
              "The process of mRNA silencing also involves other proteins, such as the GW182s [5].",
              "These proteins bridge the link between Ago and downstream effectors, such as the cytoplasmic deadenylase complexes PAN2-PAN3 and CCR4-NOT ensuring mRNA repression.",
              "On the other hand, a perfect binding between miRNA-mRNA induces mRNA degradation by enzymes involved in the 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 mRNA decay pathway.",
              "In this pathway, poly(A) tail is removed from mRNA, which is then decapped and finally degraded starting from the 5\u2019-end.",

              "Once in the nucleus, miRISC complex can induce nuclear mRNA degradation but also participate to mRNA splicing and chromatin state regulation increasing mRNA levels.",
              "It is evident that the biological functions of miRNAs are determined by the mRNAs that they control.",
              "Efficient gene regulation is orchestrated by miRNA localization, target mRNA levels, affinity of the miRNA-mRNA interaction, and the presence of multiple factors (e.",

              "However, miRNA activity on the mRNA targets is difficult to identify.",
              "Despite the growing knowledge about the mechanisms involved in miRNA-mRNA interaction, the identification of potential targets in the human genome is still a challenge, which has been appropriately described as \u201ca classical needle in a haystack problem\u201d [6].",

              "Most importantly, the advantages and drawbacks of \u201clow-yield\u201d techniques and High-Throughput methods are reported, proving details on why miRNA validation is still challenging.",
              "Several approaches underlie the development of miRNA target prediction algorithms. These can be divided into two main categories: algorithms derived from characteristics of the mRNA sequence and/or based on the miRNA-mRNA interaction, and statistical inference based on Machine Learning.",
              "In the first case, different features of the miRNA-target complex are taken into account.",
              "Pairings of the seed sequence of miRNAs and mRNAs can be analyzed and evaluated.",
              "Thermodynamic analysis can be performed by computing the free energy of pair formation and its thermodynamic stability.",
              "The evolutionarily conservation of the target sequence across related species can be assessed.",
              "Finally, the 3\u2032-UTR structural accessibility for miRNAs can be evaluated, and the number of miRNA target sites can be calculated, since mRNAs may be regulated by the binding of different miRNAs to multiple target sites.",
              "In the case of Machine Learning, the idea is to identify miRNA targets that reference miRNA-mRNA duplexes with proven biological significance, rather than making \u201cde novo\u201d predictions proceeding from sequence features.",
              "Machine Learning in general is an application of artificial intelligence that provides systems with the ability to improve automatically through experience;",
              "they \u201clearn\u201d from sample datasets and use the acquired information to make predictions on unknown data [7].",
              "The features of these approaches are described in the following sections.",
              "The miRNA sequence is complementary to the sequence of 3\u2032-UTR of potential mRNA targets.",
              "The miRNA seed sequence, namely the first 2\u20137 nucleotides in the miRNA 5\u2032 region, is essential for binding target mRNAs [8].",
              "Indeed, specific characteristics within the seed region, but also within close proximity, have been associated with specific effects on the gene repression induced by miRNAs.",
              "Thus, all of these characteristics have been included in target prediction tools [9,10,11].",
              "The majority of the target prediction algorithms require Watson\u2013Crick pairing between miRNA and mRNA.",
              "In other words, guanine (G) must pair with cytosine (C), and adenosine (A) with uracil (U).",
              "Different algorithms consider different types of seed matching.",
              "The main kinds of seed matches [9,10,12,13] (see Figure 2) are the following: Main types of miRNA seed sequences (in order of descending regulatory efficiency).",
              "The presence of an adenosine opposite position 1 of miRNA is important because this adenosine is specifically recognized within the Argonaute protein [11], independently from the nucleotide in the miRNA sequence [14].",
              "Whereas sequence complementarity is clearly informative to predict miRNA\u2013mRNA interactions, important indications for evaluating hybridization stability are provided by the thermodynamic properties of the miRNA-mRNA complexes.",
              "In the majority of miRNA target prediction tools, the thermodynamic properties of the miRNA-mRNA complex are assessed by evaluating the free energy of the predicted interaction.",
              "Free energy is used to evaluate the stability of a biological system.",
              "Though the free energy of a miRNA-mRNA complex is lower, more energy is necessary to break the bond.",
              "In other words, when the free energy is low, a miRNA-mRNA complex is estimated to be more thermodynamically stable, and the miRNA-mRNA pairing is considered stronger.",
              "This is important information, since a stable miRNA-mRNA interaction can be more likely classified as a real interaction.",
              "Nevertheless, it is not easy to establish the proper threshold of free energy, since data obtained from known miRNA-mRNA complexes are insufficient [15].",
              "Some algorithms (e.",
              "g., MicroTAR [16]) only assess the thermodynamic stability to validate initial predictions based on sequence complementarities;",
              "other algorithms (e.",
              "g., RNAhybrid [17]) calculate the free energy as the first step for their evaluation.",
              "This strategy can be employed to predict non-canonical binding sites and does not need additional information.",
              "However, the algorithm itself is based on free energy calculations obtained from computational models of nucleotide association [18].",
              "To improve prediction efficiency, other features, such as sequence conservation, may be considered to effectively predict miRNA targets.",
              "The analysis of sequence conservation among different species is an approach used to try to reduce the number of false positives obtained by prediction algorithms. The principle underpinning this strategy is that miRNA-mRNA interactions with advantageous biological functions are selected and conserved during evolution.",
              "It is worth noting that a higher conservation has been reported in the miRNA seed sequence than in other sequences [9].",
              "Several target prediction algorithms identify orthologous 3\u2032-UTR sequences and then evaluate the conservation of the potential miRNA target site in other species, in particular in those that are closely related (e.",
              "g., miRanda [19]).",
              "This analysis across the species allows reducing the number of false positive predictions [15].",
              "However, this approach can present some limitations, since it only searches for targets of evolutionary conserved miRNAs, but conservation does not necessarily imply functionality.",
              "Indeed, previous studies have reported that about 30% of experimentally validated miRNA targets are not actually conserved [20].",
              "The conservation alone, therefore, is not sufficient for obtaining a reliable miRNA target prediction.",
              "Thus, it is strongly recommended to combine this approach with non-conservation models when it is necessary to perform de novo predictions.",
              "The structural accessibility of the binding sites is another important factor to consider to increase the reliability of predictions.",
              "Both miRNA and 3\u2032-UTR of the potential target should be accessible, at least in the regions of the seed sequence.",
              "While the accessibility of miRNA seed is ensured, as mature miRNAs are assembled into the RISC [21], the accessibility of the 3\u2032-UTR of mRNA needs to be estimated.",
              "Some algorithms identify partially accessible binding sites, then rank the targets in accordance with a specific score [22] or the free energy [23].",
              "Other algorithms calculate the free energy necessary to obtain the accessibility of the complementary site and add it to the energy of hybridization.",
              "This sum allows defining which binding sites are accessible and ranking the predicted targets [24].",
              "It is known that more than one miRNA can bind the same target and, therefore, multiple miRNAs may cooperate in controlling the expression/repression of target genes [25,26].",
              "Therefore, the miRNA-mediated regulation of a specific target gene changes depending on the number of miRNAs binding to that gene [27].",

              "While several studies found that the majority of extracellular miRNAs are not associated with exosomes/microvesicles but are instead bound to AGO2 (118, 125), another study reported that extracellular miRNAs are present predominantly in exosomes in human serum and saliva (120).",
              "Since these studies only measured a selected group of miRNAs in a few plasma samples, it is possible that the existence of predominantly exosomal or vesicle-free miRNAs is dependent on the miRNA itself, the cell type they originate from, and/or other factors affecting the secretion of miRNAs in individuals.",
              "Other proteins found to bind extracellular miRNAs include high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (126, 127) and nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) (110, 118, 128).",
              "The presence of miRNAs in vesicles or with accompanying proteins is generally thought to protect extracellular miRNAs and increase their stability in the extracellular milieu (120).",
              "Although some extracellular miRNAs are regarded as by-products of cellular activities, such as cell injury or death (128), increasing evidence suggests that the release of extracellular miRNAs is a regulated process.",
              "It has been shown that the secretion of exosomal miRNAs is mediated by a ceramide-dependent pathway and the secreted miRNAs exert growth regulatory effects in target cells (129).",
              "Recently, it was demonstrated that atheroprotective laminar shear stress induced the release of vesicle-free miR-126-3p and other miRNAs, as well as AGO2, from endothelial cells by activating vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3) and synaptosomal-associated protein 23 (SNAP23) (130).",
              "This study also showed that miRNAs secreted from endothelium can regulate the activity of smooth muscle cells (130).",
              "In neuroendocrine cells, miRNAs in large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) are released by exocytosis through vesicle fusion, and this process is mediated by the SNARE complex and accelerated by Ca2+ stimulus (131).",
              "Secretion of miRNAs via exosomes have also been reported to be regulated by signaling molecules, such as interleukin-4 (IL4) (132) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (133).",
              "IL4-activated macrophages were found to secrete exosomes carrying oncogenic miRNAs to promote invasiveness of breast cancer cells (132).",
              "On the other hand, DHA, which has anticancer and anti-angiogenic activities, induced the secretion of miRNA-containing exosomes that exert inhibitory effects on tumor angiogenesis (133).",
              "Many studies have also demonstrated that extracellular miRNAs can exert biological functions in recipient cells to regulate their activity, thereby acting as intercellular signaling molecules.",
              "For example, exosome mediated transfer of miR-105 from metastatic breast cancer cells to endothelial cells directly targeted a tight junction protein, zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), and this led to the destruction of the barrier function of endothelium and promoted metastasis (134).",
              "Moreover, exosomes from umbilical cord blood were found to be enriched in miR-21-3p, which promoted the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts, and induced the angiogenic activities of endothelial cells, leading to accelerated wound healing (135).",
              "miRNAs, specifically miR-342\u20133p and miR-1246, secreted from a highly metastatic human oral cancer cell line, were found to induce metastasis in a poorly metastatic cancer cell line (136).",
              "Extracellular miRNAs have also been reported to bind to Toll-like receptors (137), activate downstream signaling events, and eventually lead to biological responses, such as tumor growth and metastasis (138), and neurodegeneration (139).",
              "Thus, miRNAs may act as chemical messengers to regulate cell-cell communications.",
              "The mechanisms of extracellular miRNA uptake are not well understood.",
              "It has been proposed that vesicle-associated extracellular miRNAs may enter cells by endocytosis, phagocytosis, or direct fusion with the plasma membranes, while vesicle-free secreted miRNAs may be taken up by specific receptors on the cell surface (140).",
              "Indeed, several studies have shown that miRNAs enter recipient cells by endocytosis and micropinocytosis (141, 142).",
              "This process has been reported to be dependent on clathrin, but not on caveolae or lipid rafts in PC12 cells (142).",
              "However, another study conducted in A549-P cells showed that endocytosis of exosomal miRNAs is mediated by caveolae- and lipid raft-dependent pathways (143).",
              "Furthermore, vesicle-free miRNAs associated with HDL are taken up by HDL receptor and scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) receptor in the plasma membrane of the target cells (126, 127).",
              "miRNAs have also been shown to transfer between co-cultured cells via direct cell-cell contact and gap junctions (144).",
              "While these studies suggest that extracellular miRNAs can interact with recipient cells via multiple mechanisms, the factors that determine the specificity of such interactions need to be investigated.",
              "Since the discovery of miRNAs in the earlier 1990s, tremendous progress has been made on how miRNAs are produced within cells, how they exert regulatory effects on gene expression, and how they are involved in various physiological and pathological events.",
              "It is now clear that miRNAs are powerful gene regulators, and that they not only help control mRNA stability and translation but are also involved in transcription.",
              "However, our understanding of when and how miRNAs can exert regulatory effects on transcription is limited.",
              "Similarly, the conditions under which miRNAs elicit translational activation need to be further explored.",
              "In addition, careful analysis and consideration of experimental techniques and model systems should be employed when attempting to generalize miRNA capabilities.",
              "The assaying of miRNA activity within a test tube may not be recapitulated within the cellular environment and thus should be viewed with caution.",
              "Many studies have been conducted in vitro by transfecting pre-miRNAs or mature mRNA mimics into immortalized and cancer cell lines.",
              "The extent to which findings from such studies reflect the endogenous miRNA functions in vivo requires further study.",
              "Also, the addition of chemical tags to miRNA could also impact miRNA:MRE interaction or AGO:miRNA interactions, specifically with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 miRNA nucleotide modifications.",
              "The first and last miRNA nucleotides clamp the miRNA within AGO proteins, and thus tags to these regions may affect miRNA functioning in unpredictable ways.",
              "Recent studies have shed light on the dynamic nature of miRNA actions and further revealed the complexity of miRNA-mediated gene regulation.",
              "Many factors contribute to the activity of miRNAs, including subcellular location, miRNA/mRNA abundance, miRNA:MRE affinity, cell type/state, and the availability of various miRISC components.",
              "miRNAs in the nucleus play a role in regulating transcription and alternative splicing.",
              "Cytosolic miRISC components shuttle between different compartments.",
              "Moreover, their localization, together with the levels of miRNAs and target mRNAs, and the affinity of the miRNA-mRNA interaction, are important for efficient gene regulation.",
              "Recent advances in single molecule imaging will greatly impact the field, as has already begun.",
              "Viewing the movement of single miRNA and/or mRNA with high spatial and temporal resolution will help us understand this complex dynamic in an unprecedented way.",
              "Investigation of large scale, global miRNA interactomes will also propel the field forward, allowing powerful mathematical models to be applied to highly complex regulatory networks.",
              "It is now accepted that extracellular/circulating miRNAs can not only serve as biomarkers for diseases, but also play important roles in intercellular communication.",
              "miRNAs regulate the activity of host cells, and they are also secreted and transferred to recipient cells.",
              "Many studies have shown that extracellular miRNAs are functionally active in recipient cells.",
              "Some miRNAs can even interact with cell surface receptors, such as Toll-like receptors.",
              "Therefore, miRNAs have hormone-like activities.",
              "However, most studies conducted so far were done in vitro using co-culture of different cell types.",
              "More in vivo studies are required to determine whether miRNAs target specific cells under physiological conditions.",

              "Mainly, in mammalian cells, miRNAs bind to the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) of target mRNAs and induce mRNA deadenylation and decapping [4].",

              "Duplexes of mature miRNA are assembled with an Argonaute (Ago 1\u20134) protein forming the miRISC complex (miRNA-induced silencing complex).",

              "Once in the nucleus, miRISC complex can induce nuclear mRNA degradation but also participate to mRNA splicing and chromatin state regulation increasing mRNA levels.",
              "It is evident that the biological functions of miRNAs are determined by the mRNAs that they control.",

              "However, miRNA activity on the mRNA targets is difficult to identify.",
              "Despite the growing knowledge about the mechanisms involved in miRNA-mRNA interaction, the identification of potential targets in the human genome is still a challenge, which has been appropriately described as \u201ca classical needle in a haystack problem\u201d [6].",

              "Now, users have the opportunity to access a large range of solutions, but they must decide which tool to use.",
              "This choice may not be easy;",
              "it is at least necessary to be familiar with the basic assumptions and interpretation of the results.",
              "The aim of this review is to provide practical advice for this challenge, in order to make it easier to understand the subject.",

              "A specific section is dedicated to the Machine Learning (ML) approach.",

              "In the second part of this review, we describe the key approaches and the major experimental procedures to meet the criteria for validation.",
              "Most importantly, the advantages and drawbacks of \u201clow-yield\u201d techniques and High-Throughput methods are reported, proving details on why miRNA validation is still challenging.",
              "Several approaches underlie the development of miRNA target prediction algorithms. These can be divided into two main categories: algorithms derived from characteristics of the mRNA sequence and/or based on the miRNA-mRNA interaction, and statistical inference based on Machine Learning.",
              "In the first case, different features of the miRNA-target complex are taken into account.",
              "Pairings of the seed sequence of miRNAs and mRNAs can be analyzed and evaluated.",
              "Thermodynamic analysis can be performed by computing the free energy of pair formation and its thermodynamic stability.",
              "The evolutionarily conservation of the target sequence across related species can be assessed.",
              "Finally, the 3\u2032-UTR structural accessibility for miRNAs can be evaluated, and the number of miRNA target sites can be calculated, since mRNAs may be regulated by the binding of different miRNAs to multiple target sites.",
              "In the case of Machine Learning, the idea is to identify miRNA targets that reference miRNA-mRNA duplexes with proven biological significance, rather than making \u201cde novo\u201d predictions proceeding from sequence features.",
              "Machine Learning in general is an application of artificial intelligence that provides systems with the ability to improve automatically through experience;",
              "they \u201clearn\u201d from sample datasets and use the acquired information to make predictions on unknown data [7].",
              "The features of these approaches are described in the following sections.",
              "The miRNA sequence is complementary to the sequence of 3\u2032-UTR of potential mRNA targets.",
              "The miRNA seed sequence, namely the first 2\u20137 nucleotides in the miRNA 5\u2032 region, is essential for binding target mRNAs [8].",
              "Indeed, specific characteristics within the seed region, but also within close proximity, have been associated with specific effects on the gene repression induced by miRNAs.",
              "Thus, all of these characteristics have been included in target prediction tools [9,10,11].",
              "The majority of the target prediction algorithms require Watson\u2013Crick pairing between miRNA and mRNA.",
              "In other words, guanine (G) must pair with cytosine (C), and adenosine (A) with uracil (U).",
              "Different algorithms consider different types of seed matching.",
              "The main kinds of seed matches [9,10,12,13] (see Figure 2) are the following: Main types of miRNA seed sequences (in order of descending regulatory efficiency).",
              "The presence of an adenosine opposite position 1 of miRNA is important because this adenosine is specifically recognized within the Argonaute protein [11], independently from the nucleotide in the miRNA sequence [14].",
              "Whereas sequence complementarity is clearly informative to predict miRNA\u2013mRNA interactions, important indications for evaluating hybridization stability are provided by the thermodynamic properties of the miRNA-mRNA complexes.",
              "In the majority of miRNA target prediction tools, the thermodynamic properties of the miRNA-mRNA complex are assessed by evaluating the free energy of the predicted interaction.",
              "Free energy is used to evaluate the stability of a biological system.",
              "Though the free energy of a miRNA-mRNA complex is lower, more energy is necessary to break the bond.",
              "In other words, when the free energy is low, a miRNA-mRNA complex is estimated to be more thermodynamically stable, and the miRNA-mRNA pairing is considered stronger.",
              "This is important information, since a stable miRNA-mRNA interaction can be more likely classified as a real interaction.",
              "Nevertheless, it is not easy to establish the proper threshold of free energy, since data obtained from known miRNA-mRNA complexes are insufficient [15].",
              "Some algorithms (e.",
              "g., MicroTAR [16]) only assess the thermodynamic stability to validate initial predictions based on sequence complementarities;",
              "other algorithms (e.",
              "g., RNAhybrid [17]) calculate the free energy as the first step for their evaluation.",
              "This strategy can be employed to predict non-canonical binding sites and does not need additional information.",
              "However, the algorithm itself is based on free energy calculations obtained from computational models of nucleotide association [18].",
              "To improve prediction efficiency, other features, such as sequence conservation, may be considered to effectively predict miRNA targets.",
              "The analysis of sequence conservation among different species is an approach used to try to reduce the number of false positives obtained by prediction algorithms. The principle underpinning this strategy is that miRNA-mRNA interactions with advantageous biological functions are selected and conserved during evolution.",
              "It is worth noting that a higher conservation has been reported in the miRNA seed sequence than in other sequences [9].",
              "Several target prediction algorithms identify orthologous 3\u2032-UTR sequences and then evaluate the conservation of the potential miRNA target site in other species, in particular in those that are closely related (e.",
              "g., miRanda [19]).",
              "This analysis across the species allows reducing the number of false positive predictions [15].",
              "However, this approach can present some limitations, since it only searches for targets of evolutionary conserved miRNAs, but conservation does not necessarily imply functionality.",
              "Indeed, previous studies have reported that about 30% of experimentally validated miRNA targets are not actually conserved [20].",
              "The conservation alone, therefore, is not sufficient for obtaining a reliable miRNA target prediction.",
              "Thus, it is strongly recommended to combine this approach with non-conservation models when it is necessary to perform de novo predictions.",
              "The structural accessibility of the binding sites is another important factor to consider to increase the reliability of predictions.",
              "Both miRNA and 3\u2032-UTR of the potential target should be accessible, at least in the regions of the seed sequence.",
              "While the accessibility of miRNA seed is ensured, as mature miRNAs are assembled into the RISC [21], the accessibility of the 3\u2032-UTR of mRNA needs to be estimated.",
              "Some algorithms identify partially accessible binding sites, then rank the targets in accordance with a specific score [22] or the free energy [23].",
              "Other algorithms calculate the free energy necessary to obtain the accessibility of the complementary site and add it to the energy of hybridization.",
              "This sum allows defining which binding sites are accessible and ranking the predicted targets [24].",
              "It is known that more than one miRNA can bind the same target and, therefore, multiple miRNAs may cooperate in controlling the expression/repression of target genes [25,26].",
              "Therefore, the miRNA-mediated regulation of a specific target gene changes depending on the number of miRNAs binding to that gene [27].",
              "In particular, a relevant element in miRNA-induced silencing seems to be the number and the location of binding sites.",
              "Multiple target sites within 10\u201350 nucleotides of each other usually enhance repression, while sites very close together (< 8 nucleotides) generally operate competitively [14,28].",
              "The use of prediction algorithms also considering multi-targeting significantly reduces the number of predictions, increasing the probability of identifying true targets.",
              "Thus, it can be very useful for reducing the number of candidates before performing experimental validation studies of miRNA targets [15].",
              "There are plenty of computational tools that use different strategies or a combination of them.",
              "For example, miRanda, one of the first and most frequently used algorithms, is based on an evaluation of complementarity between miRNAs and 3\u2019-UTR regions, thermodynamic stability of the duplex structure, evolutionary conservation of the entire binding site, and its position within 3\u2032-UTR as a final filter [19].",
              "TargetScan primarily predicts potential miRNA targets by looking for the presence of 8mer, 7mer, and 6mer sites that match the seed region of every miRNA.",
              "It is possible to choose to include only conserved sites.",
              "Other features, such as seed-pairing stability, 3\u2032 compensatory pairing, and target site abundance, may be evaluated.",
              "The putative targets are then ranked based on the predicted efficacy of targeting, calculated using cumulative scores considering all the features of the sites.",
              "Moreover, TargetScan predicts the secondary structure to evaluate the free energy of predicted complexes [29].",
              "RNAhybrid finds the minimum free energy for short sequences, but also for the whole miRNA-mRNA complex.",
              "This tool evaluates the minimum free energy of hybridization for a long and a short RNA, so the short sequence is hybridized to the best fitting part of the long sequence.",
              "The user can impose several restrictions, such as the rate of unpaired bases allowed, to reduce the number of predictions [17].",
              "PITA offers a different approach for miRNA target prediction.",
              "The main feature assessed by this program is the accessibility of the target site.",
              "It evaluates the free energy gained from miRNA\u2013mRNA pair formation and the energy cost of making the target accessible to the miRNA, and computes the difference between these two parameters.",
              "It considers also the \u201cflank sites\u201d, the sites around the seed, which are involved in site accessibility.",
              "The user can impose restrictions to reduce the number of resulting targets (i.",

              "The term \u201cMachine Learning\u201d (ML) was used for the first time in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, who described ML as the \u201cfield of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\u201d [34].",
              "ML methods commonly enable computers to analyze collected data in order to build data-driven models, discover statistically significant patterns and relationships, and consequently make predictions on novel data.",
              "In practice, ML algorithms are able to \u201clearn\u201d from sets of data and use the acquired knowledge to analyze similar data and make predictions based on the examples that have been provided [7].",
              "In the case of the miRNA target identification, ML approaches do not refer to miRNA-mRNA features, such as sequence or thermodynamic stability, but try to recognize potential miRNA targets by referring to miRNA\u2013mRNA interactions with proven biological significance.",
              "Algorithms are \u201ctrained\u201d using experimentally verified miRNA-mRNA interactions as positive examples, and artificially created negative examples.",

              "In the presence of a novel previously unseen dataset, these patterns can be used to correctly predict whether a target is \u201creal\u201d or not.",
              "Interestingly, ML is not programmed to necessitate stringent seed matches in the 3\u2032-UTRs, but it learns by provided examples with biological relevance, so it also allows identifying non-canonical binding sites, including those within the coding regions.",
              "On the other hand, ML learns exclusively from the provided examples and consequently it is only able to find results similar to those examples [35].",
              "The general strategy for ML can be summarized as follows (see Figure 3): Scheme of Machine Learning general strategy.",
              "Some points are of fundamental importance in this process.",
              "First, the positive dataset, obtained from experimentally verified databases, largely depends on the features of the database of reference.",
              "Several databases of experimentally validated miRNA-mRNA target interactions are available, such as MiRTarBase [36], DIANA-TarBase [37], and miRecords [38].",
              "The use of these validated miRNA-mRNA interactions may introduce some bias, since these data have been produced by different laboratories, using different cell types and approaches [39].",
              "The negative dataset is equally important to obtain a well-trained classifier.",
              "If the sequences are too artificial, the Machine-Learning method will probably not be efficiently trained to discriminate between true and false interactions.",
              "Conversely, if the negative and the positive datasets are very similar to each other, the ML approach will not be able to distinguish between them.",
              "Moreover, an excess of positive or negative dataset can cause underfitting or overfitting models, respectively [35].",
              "Finally, the choice of the validation set is critical for ML: to verify its performance, a model should be assessed on a test dataset that is completely different from the dataset used for the training step (training dataset).",

              "Alternatively, the miRNAs localize within an intron or untranslated region (UTR) of a protein-coding gene (8).",
              "Two main pathways of biogenesis were identified as canonical and non-canonical ones.",
              "In the canonical biogenesis pathway, primary miRNAs (pri-miRNA) are transcribed from their genes by RNA polymerase III, and then processed into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNAs) by the Microprocessor complex, consisting of two multiprotein units (9\u201311).",

              "After, pre-miRNAs are exported, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, by a complex of exportin5 (XPO5) and RAS-related nuclear protein-guanosine-5\u2019-triphosphate-ase (Ran-GTPase) (11).",
              "In the cytoplasm, the terminal loop of pre-miRNA is removed by the RNase III endonuclease Dicer (13).",
              "At this point, miRNAs appear as short RNA duplexes termed miRNA duplexes that are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (15).",

              "Ago2 is the RISC catalytic component that leaves and/or removes one strand of the duplex (18, 19).",
              "Based on the directionality of the miRNA\u2019s strands originated, the name of the mature miRNA will be 5p strand (miRNA-5p) if it arises from the 5\u2032-end of the pre-miRNA hairpin, or will be 3p strand (miRNA-3p) if it originates from the 3\u2032-end.",
              "The two mature miRNAs strands have different target-specificity (20, 21).",
              "The strand which will remain incorporated into the RISC is the active strand, and it is named the guide strand, leading strand or miR.",
              "The other strand gets degraded, and it is named the passenger strand or miR* (22).",
              "Thermodynamic features that, in turn, are related to ribonucleotide (purines vs. pyrimidines) composition of the duplex, play an essential role in miRNA-RISC assembly (23).",

              "In detail, the miRNA in the RISC complex drives it to an mRNA target in a complementary-nucleotides-based way.",
              "Usually, the mRNA target-site is into 3'untranslated region (3\u2019UTR), and the complementary sequence on miRNA, called seed sequence, is located at 2-7 nucleotides.",
              "However, non-canonical seed regions have been identified, such as in the 5\u2019UTR sequence and the coding regions of mRNAs (27).",
              "After recognition, target mRNA is still stable, but miRISC prevents its translation by inhibition of translation elongation, or through protein degradation or ribosome drop-off.",
              "In the end, mRNA, after deadenylation and decay, is degraded (28, 29).",
              "More precisely, to date, it seems that translational repression and target mRNA degradation are spatiotemporal uncoupling events.",
              "Concerning the timing, in Drosophila, Zebrafish, and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), it was demonstrated that translational repression, at an early step, always occurred before mRNA degradation (30\u201333).",
              "This result suggests that the block of protein translation is the first event of miRNA-mediated gene silencing (the cause), and the mRNA target degradation is a secondary consequence (the effect).",
              "Concerning space, it was demonstrated that RISC assembly, its interaction with miRNA and targeted mRNA, and translational repression are processes compartmentalized on rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) membrane.",
              "On the contrary, the degradation of the mRNAs (deadenylation and decay) takes place on endosome/multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (34, 35).",
              "In addition to the well-known miRNAs cytoplasmic localization and functions, the nuclear ones are noteworthy.",
              "Indeed, it has been proven that minimal miRISC complex is also present in mammalian cell nuclei, where it is 20-fold smaller (36, 37).",
              "It consists only of Ago2 and miRNA, is loaded in the cytoplasm, and is imported into the nucleus by binding to importin 8 (IPO8) (38).",
              "The combination of minimal miRISC complex with Trinucleotide Repeat Containing Adaptor 6A (TNRC6A), which possesses a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES), ensure the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling (38) even though a more selective mechanism for miRNAs distribution could be operated by nucleotides-motif at the 3\u2019 end of the miRNA.",
              "In the nucleus, miRNAs contribute to the regulation of both coding and non-coding RNA transcriptome (28, 37).",
              "They can act in blocking or promoting pri-miRNA maturation regulating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) levels (39\u201341).",
              "Other nuclear miRNAs colocalize with ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) in the nucleolus, where they are stored, or in the cytoplasm where they influence the abundance of rRNAs and/or regulate ribosomes interaction with accessory proteins (42\u201345).",
              "Moreover, in the nucleus, miRNAs induce remodeling of chromatin structure, regulate alternative splicing, and in turn, regulate itself (46\u201348).",
              "miRNAs can also mediate transcriptional gene activation (TGA) or transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) (49, 50).",
              "TGA depends on the complementarity between DNA sequences of gene promoter and the 5\u2019-seed with a part of the flanking region of miRNA.",
              "Two mechanisms that unlock gene silencing have been identified: i) in case of silencing complexes on gene promoter, such as lncRNA or promoter-associated RNA (pRNA), miRNA can act inducing the cleavage of these molecules by the recruiting of the nuclear RISC;",
              "ii) miRNA can directly recognize the nascent RNA promoter and recruit the minimal miRISC that in turn enroll the protein complex assigned to shift the chromatin structure toward a more permissive arrangement (51, 52).",
              "About TGS, where epigenetic modifications have a more prominent role than in TGA: i) miRNA with its seed sequence may directly interact with single-stranded DNA complementary sequences in the promoter region inducing histone epigenetic modification and altering the binding of transcription factors;",
              "ii) miRISC may directly target to non-coding transcripts, sense and antisense, and serves as a molecular scaffold to recruit an inhibitory protein complex and chromatin modulators that will establish a non-permissive transcriptional status;",
              "iii) miRNA may hybridize with double-stranded DNA to form relatively stable RNA*DNA : DNA triplexes via Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen interaction that induces promoter-specific transcriptional repression through the disruption of the formation of the pre-initiation complex at the promoter (28, 37).",
              "miRNAs levels and their activity can be regulated by a series of post-translational modifications (PTMs) affecting the miRNA processing machine (see Table 1 and below section PARylation post-translational modification affect miRNA activity in tumors).",
              "Moreover, co- and post-transcriptional regulation of miRNA transcripts are performed by specific RNA-biding proteins (RBPs), which affect miRNA processing and loading into RISC, and facilitate the crosstalk between various RNA pathways [reviewed in (28)].",

              "Alterations in miRNA biogenesis can promote and support the onset of cancer.",
              "The oncogene p53, whose mutations occur in 50% of human cancers, promotes cancer interfering with Drosha in the Microprocessor complex.",
              "It inhibits miRNA processing, resulting in the accumulation of pri-miRNAs and parallel depletion of mature miRNAs (63).",
              "Mutant p53, by sequestrating the Drosha cofactors, DEAD-box RNA helicases p68 (DDX5), or p72/p82 (DDX17), promotes tumor cell migration, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cell survival (64, 65).",
              "Moreover, cancer is supported by altered expression levels of miRNA processing machinery components such as Drosha, DGCR8, and Dicer that are down-regulated or up-regulated in several cancers (66).",
              "For instance, in neuroblastoma and ovarian cancer, Drosha and Dicer\u2019s reduced expression levels and overexpression of DGCR8 correlate with tumor progression and a worse clinical outcome (67\u201369).",
              "Dicer mutations lead to altered expression levels or could affect the region encoding RNase III domains that cause defects in its function.",
              "In several tumors, such as pleuropulmonary blastoma, cystic nephroma, ovarian cancer, Wilms tumor, pituitary blastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, the pathogenesis is supported by reduced Dicer expression and/or impaired function that in turn induce an aberrant miRNA expression (70\u201373).",
              "Impaired function of the Dicer cofactor TRBP also contributes to miRNA dysregulation in cancer.",
              "In the Ewing sarcoma family tumor, it was demonstrated that cancer stem cell renewal and tumor maintenance depend on TRBP expression (74).",

              "miRtrons could be distinguished from canonical miRNAs looking for key features such as bulges in the stem region, guanine content, hairpin free energy, and hairpin length (84).",
              "An example of a non-canonical miRNA biogenesis Dicer-independent pathway is pre-miR-451.",
              "It is processed, initially, by Drosha to liberate the pre-miRNA, following, in the cytoplasm, it is loaded into Ago2 to catalyze the maturation of this microRNA (85).",
              "Pre-miR-451 is not processed by Dicer because its stem-loop structure is too short to be efficiently recognized and processed (86, 87).",
              "Therefore, in this mechanism, it seems that Ago2 is sufficient for RISC loading and proper guide strand selection (88).",

              "snoRNA-derived miRNAs are approximately 22 nucleotides in length, require Dicer activity, but are independent of Drosha/DGCR8, bind to Argonaute proteins and repress target mRNAs as miRNA do (92, 93).",

              "They can bind to the Ago proteins family in a cell-type-specific manner and can regulate mRNA stability by directly binding to it, inhibiting protein translation, or cleaving a partially complementary target site (94\u201396).",

              "Indeed, research on RNA has lagged behind the other macromolecules.",
              "Although there are multiple classes of these so-called noncoding RNAs, researchers like myself have started to focus a great deal of attention on short stretches of genetic material called microRNAs and their potential to treat various diseases, including cancer.",
              "Scientists regard microRNAs as master regulators of the genome due to their ability to bind to and alter the expression of many protein-coding RNAs.",
              "Indeed, a single microRNA can regulate anywhere from 10 to 100 protein-coding RNAs.",
              "Rather than translating DNA to proteins, they instead can bind to protein-coding RNAs to silence genes.",
              "The reason microRNAs can regulate such a diverse pool of RNAs stems from their ability to bind to target RNAs they don\u2019t perfectly match up with.",
              "This means a single microRNA can often regulate a pool of targets that are all involved in similar processes in the cell, leading to an enhanced response.",
              "Because a single microRNA can regulate multiple genes, many microRNAs can contribute to disease when they become dysfunctional.",
              "In 2002, researchers first identified the role dysfunctional microRNAs play in disease through patients with a type of blood and bone marrow cancer called chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",
              "This cancer results from the loss of two microRNAs normally involved in blocking tumor cell growth.",
              "Since then, scientists have identified over 2,000 microRNAs in people, many of which are altered in various diseases.",
              "The field has also developed a fairly solid understanding of how microRNA dysfunction contributes to disease.",
              "Changing one microRNA can change several other genes, resulting in a plethora of alterations that can collectively reshape the cell\u2019s physiology.",
              "For example, over half of all cancers have significantly reduced activity in a microRNA called miR-34a.",
              "Because miR-34a regulates many genes involved in preventing the growth and migration of cancer cells, losing miR-34a can increase the risk of developing cancer.",
              "Researchers are looking into using microRNAs as therapeutics for cancer, heart disease, neurodegenerative disease and others.",
              "While results in the laboratory have been promising, bringing microRNA treatments into the clinic has met multiple challenges.",
              "Many are related to inefficient delivery into target cells and poor stability, which limit their effectiveness.",
              "One reason why delivering microRNA treatments into cells is difficult is because microRNA treatments need to be delivered specifically to diseased cells while avoiding healthy cells.",
              "Unlike mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that are taken up by scavenging immune cells whose job is to detect foreign materials, microRNA treatments need to fool the body into thinking they aren\u2019t foreign in order to avoid immune attack and get to their intended cells.",
              "Scientists are studying various ways to deliver microRNA treatments to their specific target cells.",
              "One method garnering a great deal of attention relies on directly linking the microRNA to a ligand, a kind of small molecule that binds to specific proteins on the surface of cells.",
              "Compared with healthy cells, diseased cells can have a disproportionate number of some surface proteins, or receptors.",
              "So, ligands can help microRNAs home specifically to diseased cells while avoiding healthy cells.",

              "Typically, over one million copies per cell are needed in order to achieve sufficient delivery of the drug.",
              "One ligand that stands out is folate, also referred to as vitamin B9, a small molecule critical during periods of rapid cell growth such as fetal development.",
              "Because some tumor cells have over one million folate receptors, this ligand provides sufficient opportunity to deliver enough of a therapeutic RNA to target different types of cancer.",
              "For example, my laboratory developed a new molecule called FolamiR-34a \u2013 folate linked to miR-34a \u2013 that reduced the size of breast and lung cancer tumors in mice.",
              "One of the other challenges with using small RNAs is their poor stability, which leads to their rapid degradation.",
              "As such, RNA-based treatments are generally short-lived in the body and require frequent doses to maintain a therapeutic effect.",
              "To overcome this challenge, researchers are modifying small RNAs in various ways.",
              "While each RNA requires a specific modification pattern, successful changes can significantly increase their stability.",
              "This reduces the need for frequent dosing, subsequently decreasing treatment burden and cost.",
              "For example, modified GalNAc-siRNAs, another form of small RNAs, reduces dosing from every few days to once every six months in nondividing cells.",
              "My team developed folate ligands linked to modified microRNAs for cancer treatment that reduced dosing from once every other day to once a week.",

              "For example, a high-content screen for proliferation-related miRNAs in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes using a library of 875 miRNA mimics identified miR-590 and miR-199a as key miRNAs involved in neonatal cardiomyocyte regeneration165.",
              "Systemic delivery of these miRNAs using lipid carriers or adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery to neonatal rats resulted in increased numbers of cardiomyocytes and a reduction in fibrosis165.",

              "However, a particular miRNA targetome might include both oncogenes and tumour suppressors, as well as a number of targets not involved in cancer, which complicates the development of selective miRNA-directed therapeutics.",
              "Moreover, miRNAs, especially at non-physiological concentrations, can have unknown targets that could potentially lead to adverse effects by targeting normal cell homeostasis genes.",
