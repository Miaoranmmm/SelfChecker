    "query": "What was the most significant discovery made by Isaac Newton and how did it contribute to our understanding of the world?",
    "response": "Isaac Newton was a brilliant English physicist and mathematician who made many discoveries and inventions in the fields of optics, mechanics, calculus and gravity. One of his most significant discoveries was the **law of universal gravitation**, which states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them[^2^]. This discovery helped to explain the motion of planets, moons, comets and tides, and also inspired further developments in astronomy, physics and mathematics by Newton himself and other scientists such as Kepler, Euler, Laplace and Einstein[^4^] [^5^]. The law of universal gravitation was first published in his masterpiece **Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica** (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in 1687[^2^] [^5^], which is considered one of the most important works in the history of science[^2^].",

              "His formulation of the laws of motion resulted in the law of universal gravitation.",
              "After interrupted attendance at the grammar school in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, Isaac Newton finally settled down to prepare for university, going on to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1661, somewhat older than his classmates.",
              "There he immersed himself in Aristotle\u2019s work and discovered the works of Rene\u0301 Descartes before graduating in 1665 with a bachelor\u2019s degree.",
              "Isaac Newton was born to a widowed mother (his father died three months prior) and was not expected to survive, being tiny and weak.",
              "Shortly thereafter Newton was sent by his stepfather, the well-to-do minister Barnabas Smith, to live with his grandmother and was separated from his mother until Smith\u2019s death in 1653.",
              "Isaac Newton is widely known for his published work Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687), commonly known as the Principia.",
              "His laws of motion first appeared in this work.",
              "It is one of the most important single works in the history of modern science.",
              "Isaac Newton, (born December 25, 1642 [January 4, 1643, New Style], Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England\u2014died March 20 [March 31], 1727, London), English physicist and mathematician who was the culminating figure of the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century.",
              "In optics, his discovery of the composition of white light integrated the phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics.",
              "In mechanics, his three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation.",
              "In mathematics, he was the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus.",
              "Newton\u2019s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, 1687) was one of the most important single works in the history of modern science.",
              "Born in the hamlet of Woolsthorpe, Newton was the only son of a local yeoman, also Isaac Newton, who had died three months before, and of Hannah Ayscough.",
              "That same year, at Arcetri near Florence, Galileo Galilei had died;",
              "Newton would eventually pick up his idea of a mathematical science of motion and bring his work to full fruition.",
              "A tiny and weak baby, Newton was not expected to survive his first day of life, much less 84 years.",
              "Deprived of a father before birth, he soon lost his mother as well, for within two years she married a second time;",
              "her husband, the well-to-do minister Barnabas Smith, left young Isaac with his grandmother and moved to a neighbouring village to raise a son and two daughters.",
              "For nine years, until the death of Barnabas Smith in 1653, Isaac was effectively separated from his mother, and his pronounced psychotic tendencies have been ascribed to this traumatic event.",
              "That he hated his stepfather we may be sure.",
              "When he examined the state of his soul in 1662 and compiled a catalog of sins in shorthand, he remembered \u201cThreatning my father and mother Smith to burne them and the house over them.",
              "\u201d The acute sense of insecurity that rendered him obsessively anxious when his work was published and irrationally violent when he defended it accompanied Newton throughout his life and can plausibly be traced to his early years.",
              "After his mother was widowed a second time, she determined that her first-born son should manage her now considerable property.",
              "It quickly became apparent, however, that this would be a disaster, both for the estate and for Newton.",
              "He could not bring himself to concentrate on rural affairs\u2014set to watch the cattle, he would curl up under a tree with a book.",
              "Fortunately, the mistake was recognized, and Newton was sent back to the grammar school in Grantham, where he had already studied, to prepare for the university.",
              "As with many of the leading scientists of the age, he left behind in Grantham anecdotes about his mechanical ability and his skill in building models of machines, such as clocks and windmills.",
              "At the school he apparently gained a firm command of Latin but probably received no more than a smattering of arithmetic.",
              "By June 1661 he was ready to matriculate at Trinity College, Cambridge, somewhat older than the other undergraduates because of his interrupted education.",
              "When Newton arrived in Cambridge in 1661, the movement now known as the Scientific Revolution was well advanced, and many of the works basic to modern science had appeared.",
              "Astronomers from Nicolaus Copernicus to Johannes Kepler had elaborated the heliocentric system of the universe.",
              "Galileo had proposed the foundations of a new mechanics built on the principle of inertia.",
              "Led by Rene\u0301 Descartes, philosophers had begun to formulate a new conception of nature as an intricate, impersonal, and inert machine.",
              "Yet as far as the universities of Europe, including Cambridge, were concerned, all this might well have never happened.",
              "They continued to be the strongholds of outmoded Aristotelianism, which rested on a geocentric view of the universe and dealt with nature in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. Like thousands of other undergraduates, Newton began his higher education by immersing himself in Aristotle\u2019s work.",
              "Even though the new philosophy was not in the curriculum, it was in the air.",
              "Some time during his undergraduate career, Newton discovered the works of the French natural philosopher Descartes and the other mechanical philosophers, who, in contrast to Aristotle, viewed physical reality as composed entirely of particles of matter in motion and who held that all the phenomena of nature result from their mechanical interaction.",
              "A new set of notes, which he entitled \u201cQuaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae\u201d (\u201cCertain Philosophical Questions\u201d), begun sometime in 1664, usurped the unused pages of a notebook intended for traditional scholastic exercises;",
              "under the title he entered the slogan \u201cAmicus Plato amicus Aristoteles magis amica veritas\u201d (\u201cPlato is my friend, Aristotle is my friend, but my best friend is truth\u201d).",
              "Newton\u2019s scientific career had begun.",
              "The \u201cQuaestiones\u201d reveal that Newton had discovered the new conception of nature that provided the framework of the Scientific Revolution.",
              "He had thoroughly mastered the works of Descartes and had also discovered that the French philosopher Pierre Gassendi had revived atomism, an alternative mechanical system to explain nature.",
              "The \u201cQuaestiones\u201d also reveal that Newton already was inclined to find the latter a more attractive philosophy than Cartesian natural philosophy, which rejected the existence of ultimate indivisible particles.",
              "The works of the 17th-century chemist Robert Boyle provided the foundation for Newton\u2019s considerable work in chemistry.",
              "Significantly, he had read Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist, and was thereby introduced to another intellectual world, the magical Hermetic tradition, which sought to explain natural phenomena in terms of alchemical and magical concepts.",
              "The two traditions of natural philosophy, the mechanical and the Hermetic, antithetical though they appear, continued to influence his thought and in their tension supplied the fundamental theme of his scientific career.",
              "Although he did not record it in the \u201cQuaestiones,\u201d Newton had also begun his mathematical studies.",
              "He again started with Descartes, from whose La Ge\u0301ometrie he branched out into the other literature of modern analysis with its application of algebraic techniques to problems of geometry.",
              "He then reached back for the support of classical geometry.",
              "Within little more than a year, he had mastered the literature;",
              "and, pursuing his own line of analysis, he began to move into new territory.",
              "He discovered the binomial theorem, and he developed the calculus, a more powerful form of analysis that employs infinitesimal considerations in finding the slopes of curves and areas under curves.",
              "By 1669 Newton was ready to write a tract summarizing his progress, De Analysi per Aequationes Numeri Terminorum Infinitas (\u201cOn Analysis by Infinite Series\u201d), which circulated in manuscript through a limited circle and made his name known.",
              "During the next two years he revised it as De methodis serierum et fluxionum (\u201cOn the Methods of Series and Fluxions\u201d).",
              "The word fluxions, Newton\u2019s private rubric, indicates that the calculus had been born.",
              "Despite the fact that only a handful of savants were even aware of Newton\u2019s existence, he had arrived at the point where he had become the leading mathematician in Europe.",
              "When Newton received the bachelor\u2019s degree in April 1665, the most remarkable undergraduate career in the history of university education had passed unrecognized.",
              "On his own, without formal guidance, he had sought out the new philosophy and the new mathematics and made them his own, but he had confined the progress of his studies to his notebooks.",
              "Then, in 1665, the plague closed the university, and for most of the following two years he was forced to stay at his home, contemplating at leisure what he had learned.",
              "During the plague years Newton laid the foundations of the calculus and extended an earlier insight into an essay, \u201cOf Colours,\u201d which contains most of the ideas elaborated in his Opticks.",
              "It was during this time that he examined the elements of circular motion and, applying his analysis to the Moon and the planets, derived the inverse square relation that the radially directed force acting on a planet decreases with the square of its distance from the Sun\u2014which was later crucial to the law of universal gravitation.",
              "The world heard nothing of these discoveries."

              "Isaac Newton - Quotes, Facts &amp; Laws - Biography",
              "Isaac Newton was an English physicist and mathematician famous for his laws of physics.",
              "He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century.",
              "(1643-1727) Isaac Newton was a physicist and mathematician who developed the principles of modern physics, including the laws of motion and is credited as one of the great minds of the 17th-century Scientific Revolution.",
              "In 1687, he published his most acclaimed work, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), which has been called the single most influential book on physics.",
              "In 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne of England, making him Sir Isaac Newton.",
              "Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England.",
              "Using the \"old\" Julian calendar, Newton's birth date is sometimes displayed as December 25, 1642.",
              "Newton was the only son of a prosperous local farmer, also named Isaac, who died three months before he was born.",
              "A premature baby born tiny and weak, Newton was not expected to survive.",
              "When he was 3 years old, his mother, Hannah Ayscough Newton, remarried a well-to-do minister, Barnabas Smith, and went to live with him, leaving young Newton with his maternal grandmother.",
              "The experience left an indelible imprint on Newton, later manifesting itself as an acute sense of insecurity.",
              "He anxiously obsessed over his published work, defending its merits with irrational behavior.",
              "At age 12, Newton was reunited with his mother after her second husband died.",
              "She brought along her three small children from her second marriage.",
              "Newton was enrolled at the King's School in Grantham, a town in Lincolnshire, where he lodged with a local apothecary and was introduced to the fascinating world of chemistry.",
              "His mother pulled him out of school at age 12.",
              "Her plan was to make him a farmer and have him tend the farm.",
              "Newton failed miserably, as he found farming monotonous.",
              "Newton was soon sent back to King's School to finish his basic education.",
              "Perhaps sensing the young man's innate intellectual abilities, his uncle, a graduate of the University of Cambridge's Trinity College, persuaded Newton's mother to have him enter the university.",
              "Newton enrolled in a program similar to a work-study in 1661, and subsequently waited on tables and took care of wealthier students' rooms. When Newton arrived at Cambridge, the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century was already in full force.",
              "The heliocentric view of the universe\u2014theorized by astronomers Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler, and later refined by Galileo\u2014was well known in most European academic circles.",
              "Philosopher Rene\u0301 Descartes had begun to formulate a new concept of nature as an intricate, impersonal and inert machine.",
              "Yet, like most universities in Europe, Cambridge was steeped in Aristotelian philosophy and a view of nature resting on a geocentric view of the universe, dealing with nature in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. During his first three years at Cambridge, Newton was taught the standard curriculum but was fascinated with the more advanced science.",
              "All his spare time was spent reading from the modern philosophers.",
              "The result was a less-than-stellar performance, but one that is understandable, given his dual course of study.",
              "It was during this time that Newton kept a second set of notes, entitled \"Quaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae\" (\"Certain Philosophical Questions\").",
              "The \"Quaestiones\" reveal that Newton had discovered the new concept of nature that provided the framework for the Scientific Revolution.",
              "Though Newton graduated without honors or distinctions, his efforts won him the title of scholar and four years of financial support for future education.",
              "In 1665, the bubonic plague that was ravaging Europe had come to Cambridge, forcing the university to close.",
              "After a two-year hiatus, Newton returned to Cambridge in 1667 and was elected a minor fellow at Trinity College, as he was still not considered a standout scholar.",
              "In the ensuing years, his fortune improved.",
              "Newton received his Master of Arts degree in 1669, before he was 27.",
              "During this time, he came across Nicholas Mercator's published book on methods for dealing with infinite series.",
              "Newton quickly wrote a treatise, De Analysi, expounding his own wider-ranging results.",
              "He shared this with friend and mentor Isaac Barrow, but didn't include his name as author.",
              "In June 1669, Barrow shared the unaccredited manuscript with British mathematician John Collins.",
              "In August 1669, Barrow identified its author to Collins as \"Mr.",
              "Newton .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "very young .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "but of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things.\"",
              "Newton's work was brought to the attention of the mathematics community for the first time.",
              "Shortly afterward, Barrow resigned his Lucasian professorship at Cambridge, and Newton assumed the chair.",
              "Newton made discoveries in optics, motion and mathematics.",
              "Newton theorized that white light was a composite of all colors of the spectrum, and that light was composed of particles.",
              "His momentous book on physics, Principia, contains information on nearly all of the essential concepts of physics except energy, ultimately helping him to explain the laws of motion and the theory of gravity.",
              "Along with mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, Newton is credited for developing essential theories of calculus.",
              "Newton's first major public scientific achievement was designing and constructing a reflecting telescope in 1668.",
              "As a professor at Cambridge, Newton was required to deliver an annual course of lectures and chose optics as his initial topic.",
              "He used his telescope to study optics and help prove his theory of light and color.",
              "The Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope in 1671, and the organization's interest encouraged Newton to publish his notes on light, optics and color in 1672.",
              "These notes were later published as part of Newton's Opticks: Or, A treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and Colours of Light.",
              "Between 1665 and 1667, Newton returned home from Trinity College to pursue his private study, as school was closed due to the Great Plague.",
              "Legend has it that, at this time, Newton experienced his famous inspiration of gravity with the falling apple.",
              "According to this common myth, Newton was sitting under an apple tree when a fruit fell and hit him on the head, inspiring him to suddenly come up with the theory of gravity.",
              "While there is no evidence that the apple actually hit Newton on the head, he did see an apple fall from a tree, leading him to wonder why it fell straight down and not at an angle.",
              "Consequently, he began exploring the theories of motion and gravity.",
              "It was during this 18-month hiatus as a student that Newton conceived many of his most important insights\u2014including the method of infinitesimal calculus, the foundations for his theory of light and color, and the laws of planetary motion\u2014that eventually led to the publication of his physics book Principia and his theory of gravity.",
              "In 1687, following 18 months of intense and effectively nonstop work, Newton published Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), most often known as Principia.",
              "Principia is said to be the single most influential book on physics and possibly all of science.",
              "Its publication immediately raised Newton to international prominence.",
              "Principia offers an exact quantitative description of bodies in motion, with three basic but important laws of motion: A stationary body will stay stationary unless an external force is applied to it.",
              "Force is equal to mass times acceleration, and a change in motion (i.",
              "e., change in speed) is proportional to the force applied.",
              "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
              "Newton\u2019s three basic laws of motion outlined in Principia helped him arrive at his theory of gravity.",
              "Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation states that two objects attract each other with a force of gravitational attraction that\u2019s proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.",
              "These laws helped explain not only elliptical planetary orbits but nearly every other motion in the universe: how the planets are kept in orbit by the pull of the sun\u2019s gravity;",
              "how the moon revolves around Earth and the moons of Jupiter revolve around it;",
              "and how comets revolve in elliptical orbits around the sun.",
              "They also allowed him to calculate the mass of each planet, calculate the flattening of the Earth at the poles and the bulge at the equator, and how the gravitational pull of the sun and moon create the Earth\u2019s tides.",
              "In Newton's account, gravity kept the universe balanced, made it work, and brought heaven and Earth together in one great equation.",
              "DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S ISAAC NEWTON FACT CARD Not everyone at the Royal Academy was enthusiastic about Newton\u2019s discoveries in optics and 1672 publication of Opticks: Or, A treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and Colours of Light.",
              "Among the dissenters was Robert Hooke, one of the original members of the Royal Academy and a scientist who was accomplished in a number of areas, including mechanics and optics.",
              "While Newton theorized that light was composed of particles, Hooke believed it was composed of waves.",
              "Hooke quickly condemned Newton's paper in condescending terms, and attacked Newton's methodology and conclusions.",
              "Hooke was not the only one to question Newton's work in optics.",
              "Renowned Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens and a number of French Jesuits also raised objections.",
              "But because of Hooke's association with the Royal Society and his own work in optics, his criticism stung Newton the worst.",
              "Unable to handle the critique, he went into a rage\u2014a reaction to criticism that was to continue throughout his life.",
              "Newton denied Hooke's charge that his theories had any shortcomings and argued the importance of his discoveries to all of science.",
              "In the ensuing months, the exchange between the two men grew more acrimonious, and soon Newton threatened to quit the Royal Society altogether.",
              "He remained only when several other members assured him that the Fellows held him in high esteem.",
              "The rivalry between Newton and Hooke would continue for several years thereafter.",
              "Then, in 1678, Newton suffered a complete nervous breakdown and the correspondence abruptly ended.",
              "The death of his mother the following year caused him to become even more isolated, and for six years he withdrew from intellectual exchange except when others initiated correspondence, which he always kept short.",
              "During his hiatus from public life, Newton returned to his study of gravitation and its effects on the orbits of planets.",
              "Ironically, the impetus that put Newton on the right direction in this study came from Robert Hooke.",
              "In a 1679 letter of general correspondence to Royal Society members for contributions, Hooke wrote to Newton and brought up the question of planetary motion, suggesting that a formula involving the inverse squares might explain the attraction between planets and the shape of their orbits.",
              "Subsequent exchanges transpired before Newton quickly broke off the correspondence once again.",
              "But Hooke's idea was soon incorporated into Newton's work on planetary motion, and from his notes it appears he had quickly drawn his own conclusions by 1680, though he kept his discoveries to himself.",
              "In early 1684, in a conversation with fellow Royal Society members Christopher Wren and Edmond Halley, Hooke made his case on the proof for planetary motion.",
              "Both Wren and Halley thought he was on to something, but pointed out that a mathematical demonstration was needed.",
              "In August 1684, Halley traveled to Cambridge to visit with Newton, who was coming out of his seclusion.",
              "Halley idly asked him what shape the orbit of a planet would take if its attraction to the sun followed the inverse square of the distance between them (Hooke's theory).",
              "Newton knew the answer, due to his concentrated work for the past six years, and replied, \"An ellipse.\"",
              "Newton claimed to have solved the problem some 18 years prior, during his hiatus from Cambridge and the plague, but he was unable to find his notes.",
              "Halley persuaded him to work out the problem mathematically and offered to pay all costs so that the ideas might be published, which it was, in Newton\u2019s Principia.",
              "Upon the publication of the first edition of Principia in 1687, Robert Hooke immediately accused Newton of plagiarism, claiming that he had discovered the theory of inverse squares and that Newton had stolen his work.",
              "The charge was unfounded, as most scientists knew, for Hooke had only theorized on the idea and had never brought it to any level of proof.",
              "Newton, however, was furious and strongly defended his discoveries.",
              "He withdrew all references to Hooke in his notes and threatened to withdraw from publishing the subsequent edition of Principia altogether.",
              "Halley, who had invested much of himself in Newton's work, tried to make peace between the two men.",
              "While Newton begrudgingly agreed to insert a joint acknowledgment of Hooke's work (shared with Wren and Halley) in his discussion of the law of inverse squares, it did nothing to placate Hooke.",
              "As the years went on, Hooke's life began to unravel.",
              "His beloved niece and companion died the same year that Principia was published, in 1687.",
              "As Newton's reputation and fame grew, Hooke's declined, causing him to become even more bitter and loathsome toward his rival.",
              "To the very end, Hooke took every opportunity he could to offend Newton.",
              "Knowing that his rival would soon be elected president of the Royal Society, Hooke refused to retire until the year of his death, in 1703.",
              "Following the publication of Principia, Newton was ready for a new direction in life.",
              "He no longer found contentment in his position at Cambridge and was becoming more involved in other issues.",
              "He helped lead the resistance to King James II's attempts to reinstitute Catholic teaching at Cambridge, and in 1689 he was elected to represent Cambridge in Parliament.",
              "While in London, Newton acquainted himself with a broader group of intellectuals and became acquainted with political philosopher John Locke.",
              "Though many of the scientists on the continent continued to teach the mechanical world according to Aristotle, a young generation of British scientists became captivated with Newton's new view of the physical world and recognized him as their leader.",
              "One of these admirers was Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, a Swiss mathematician whom Newton befriended while in London.",
              "However, within a few years, Newton fell into another nervous breakdown in 1693.",
              "The cause is open to speculation: his disappointment over not being appointed to a higher position by England's new monarchs, William III and Mary II, or the subsequent loss of his friendship with Duillier;",
              "exhaustion from being overworked;",
              "or perhaps chronic mercury poisoning after decades of alchemical research.",
              "It's difficult to know the exact cause, but evidence suggests that letters written by Newton to several of his London acquaintances and friends, including Duillier, seemed deranged and paranoiac, and accused them of betrayal and conspiracy.",
              "Oddly enough, Newton recovered quickly, wrote letters of apology to friends, and was back to work within a few months.",
              "He emerged with all his intellectual facilities intact, but seemed to have lost interest in scientific problems and now favored pursuing prophecy and scripture and the study of alchemy.",
              "While some might see this as work beneath the man who had revolutionized science, it might be more properly attributed to Newton responding to the issues of the time in turbulent 17th century Britain.",
              "Many intellectuals were grappling with the meaning of many different subjects, not least of which were religion, politics and the very purpose of life.",
              "Modern science was still so new that no one knew for sure how it measured up against older philosophies.",
              "In 1696, Newton was able to attain the governmental position he had long sought: warden of the Mint;",
              "after acquiring this new title, he permanently moved to London and lived with his niece, Catherine Barton.",
              "Barton was the mistress of Lord Halifax, a high-ranking government official who was instrumental in having Newton promoted, in 1699, to master of the Mint\u2014a position that he would hold until his death.",
              "Not wanting it to be considered a mere honorary position, Newton approached the job in earnest, reforming the currency and severely punishing counterfeiters.",
              "As master of the Mint, Newton moved the British currency, the pound sterling, from the silver to the gold standard.",
              "In 1703, Newton was elected president of the Royal Society upon Robert Hooke's death.",
              "However, Newton never seemed to understand the notion of science as a cooperative venture, and his ambition and fierce defense of his own discoveries continued to lead him from one conflict to another with other scientists.",
              "By most accounts, Newton's tenure at the society was tyrannical and autocratic;",
              "he was able to control the lives and careers of younger scientists with absolute power.",
              "In 1705, in a controversy that had been brewing for several years, German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz publicly accused Newton of plagiarizing his research, claiming he had discovered infinitesimal calculus several years before the publication of Principia.",
              "In 1712, the Royal Society appointed a committee to investigate the matter.",
              "Of course, since Newton was president of the society, he was able to appoint the committee's members and oversee its investigation.",
              "Not surprisingly, the committee concluded Newton's priority over the discovery.",
              "That same year, in another of Newton's more flagrant episodes of tyranny, he published without permission the notes of astronomer John Flamsteed.",
              "It seems the astronomer had collected a massive body of data from his years at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England.",
              "Newton had requested a large volume of Flamsteed's notes for his revisions to Principia.",
              "Annoyed when Flamsteed wouldn't provide him with more information as quickly as he wanted it, Newton used his influence as president of the Royal Society to be named the chairman of the body of \"visitors\" responsible for the Royal Observatory.",
              "He then tried to force the immediate publication of Flamsteed's catalogue of the stars, as well as all of Flamsteed's notes, edited and unedited.",
              "To add insult to injury, Newton arranged for Flamsteed's mortal enemy, Edmund Halley, to prepare the notes for press.",
              "Flamsteed was finally able to get a court order forcing Newton to cease his plans for publication and return the notes\u2014one of the few times that Newton was bested by one of his rivals.",
              "Toward the end of this life, Newton lived at Cranbury Park, near Winchester, England, with his niece, Catherine (Barton) Conduitt, and her husband, John Conduitt.",
              "By this time, Newton had become one of the most famous men in Europe.",
              "His scientific discoveries were unchallenged.",
              "He also had become wealthy, investing his sizable income wisely and bestowing sizable gifts to charity.",
              "Despite his fame, Newton's life was far from perfect: He never married or made many friends, and in his later years, a combination of pride, insecurity and side trips on peculiar scientific inquiries led even some of his few friends to worry about his mental stability.",
              "By the time he reached 80 years of age, Newton was experiencing digestion problems and had to drastically change his diet and mobility.",
              "In March 1727, Newton experienced severe pain in his abdomen and blacked out, never to regain consciousness.",
              "He died the next day, on March 31, 1727, at the age of 84.",
              "Newton's fame grew even more after his death, as many of his contemporaries proclaimed him the greatest genius who ever lived.",
              "Maybe a slight exaggeration, but his discoveries had a large impact on Western thought, leading to comparisons to the likes of Plato, Aristotle and Galileo.",
              "Although his discoveries were among many made during the Scientific Revolution, Newton's universal principles of gravity found no parallels in science at the time.",
              "Of course, Newton was proven wrong on some of his key assumptions.",
              "In the 20th century, Albert Einstein would overturn Newton's concept of the universe, stating that space, distance and motion were not absolute but relative and that the universe was more fantastic than Newton had ever conceived.",
              "Newton might not have been surprised: In his later life, when asked for an assessment of his achievements, he replied, \"I do not know what I may appear to the world;",
              "but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself now and then in finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\"",

              "Isaac Newton - Wikipedia",
              "Sir Isaac Newton FRS (25 December 1642 \u2013 20 March 1726/27)[a] was an English polymath active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher.",
              "[7] He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed.",
              "His pioneering book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, consolidated many previous results and established classical mechanics.",
              "[8][9] Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus, though notably he developed calculus well before Leibniz.",
              "[10][11] He is considered one of the greatest and most influential scientists in history.",
              "[12][13][14][15][7] In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity.",
              "Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity.",
              "[16] He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles.",
              "Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems. Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum.",
              "His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704.",
              "He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid.",
              "In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.",
              "Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.",
              "He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity.",
              "He refused to take holy orders in the Church of England, unlike most members of the Cambridge faculty of the day.",
              "Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death.",
              "Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689\u20131690 and 1701\u20131702.",
              "He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696\u20131699) and Master (1699\u20131727) of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703\u20131727).",
              "Isaac Newton was born (according to the Julian calendar in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643[a]) at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire.",
              "[17] His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before.",
              "Born prematurely, Newton was a small child;",
              "his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug.",
              "[18] When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (ne\u0301e Blythe).",
              "Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.\"",
              "[19] Newton's mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah) from her second marriage.",
              "[20] From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School in Grantham, which taught Latin and Ancient Greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics.",
              "[21] He was removed from school and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659.",
              "His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated.",
              "[22] Henry Stokes, master at The King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school.",
              "Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student,[23] distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills.",
              "[24] In June 1661, Newton was admitted to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge.",
              "His uncle Reverend William Ayscough, who had studied at Cambridge, recommended him to the university.",
              "At Cambridge, Newton started as a subsizar, paying his way by performing valet duties until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, which covered his university costs for four more years until the completion of his MA.",
              "[25] At the time, Cambridge's teachings were based on those of Aristotle, whom Newton read along with then more modern philosophers, including Descartes and astronomers such as Galileo Galilei and Thomas Street.",
              "He set down in his notebook a series of \"Quaestiones\" about mechanical philosophy as he found it.",
              "In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus.",
              "Soon after Newton obtained his BA degree at Cambridge in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great Plague.",
              "Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student,[26] Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the next two years saw the development of his theories on calculus,[27] optics, and the law of gravitation.",
              "[28][29] In April 1667, Newton returned to the University of Cambridge, and in October he was elected as a fellow of Trinity.",
              "[30][31] Fellows were required to take holy orders and be ordained as Anglican priests, although this was not enforced in the Restoration years, and an assertion of conformity to the Church of England was sufficient.",
              "He made the commitment that \"I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7 years] arrives, or I will resign from the college.\"",
              "[32] Up until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the Thirty-nine Articles, the basis of Church of England doctrine.",
              "By 1675 the issue could not be avoided, and by then his unconventional views stood in the way.",
              "[33] His academic work impressed the Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow, who was anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity College two years later);",
              "in 1669, Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA.",
              "The terms of the Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church \u2013 presumably[weasel words] to leave more time for science.",
              "Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and King Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument;",
              "thus, a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.",
              "[34] Newton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.",
              "[1] Newton's work has been said \"to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied\".",
              "[35] His work on the subject, usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton's mathematical papers.",
              "[36] His work De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work \"of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things\".",
              "[37] Newton later became involved in a dispute with Leibniz over priority in the development of calculus (the Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy).",
              "Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently, although with very different mathematical notations.",
              "However, it is established that Newton came to develop calculus much earlier than Leibniz.",
              "[10][38][11] Leibniz's notation and \"differential Method\", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.",
              "[citation needed] His work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the Principia itself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of \"the method of first and last ratios\"[39] and explained why he put his expositions in this form,[40] remarking also that \"hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles.\"",
              "[41] Because of this, the Principia has been called \"a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus\" in modern times[42] and in Newton's time \"nearly all of it is of this calculus.\"",
              "[43] His use of methods involving \"one or more orders of the infinitesimally small\" is present in his De motu corporum in gyrum of 1684[44] and in his papers on motion \"during the two decades preceding 1684\".",
              "[45] Newton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism.",
              "[46] He was close to the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier.",
              "In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton's Principia, and corresponded with Leibniz.",
              "[47] In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.",
              "[48] Starting in 1699, other members[who?]",
              "of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism.",
              "[49] The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud;",
              "it was later found that Newton wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz.",
              "Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.",
              "[50] Newton is generally credited with the generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent.",
              "He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions to the theory of finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations.",
              "He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula) and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series.",
              "Newton's work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin's decimals.",
              "[51] In 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.",
              "[53][54] This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light \u2013 a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate.",
              "From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.",
              "[55] During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a prism, which he named a spectrum, could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism.",
              "[56] Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.",
              "[57] He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour.",
              "Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves.",
              "This is known as Newton's theory of colour.",
              "[58] From this work, he concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration).",
              "As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem.",
              "[59][60] Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope,[60] involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique.",
              "Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes.",
              "In late 1668,[61] he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope.",
              "It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image.",
              "In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope.",
              "[62] Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours,[63] which he later expanded into the work Opticks.",
              "When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate.",
              "Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679\u201380, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions,[64] which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector.",
              "But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.",
              "[65] Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium.",
              "He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk.",
              "II, Props.",
              "12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.",
              "13).",
              "However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction.",
              "Today's quantum mechanics, photons, and the idea of wave\u2013particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.",
              "In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles.",
              "The contact with the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Henry More revived his interest in alchemy.",
              "[66] He replaced the ether with occult forces based on Hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles.",
              "John Maynard Keynes, who acquired many of Newton's writings on alchemy, stated that \"Newton was not the first of the age of reason: He was the last of the magicians.\"",
              "[67] Newton's contributions to science cannot be isolated from his interest in alchemy.",
              "[66] This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science, and had he not relied on the occult idea of action at a distance, across a vacuum, he might not have developed his theory of gravity.",
              "In 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light.",
              "He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation \"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\"",
              "[68] Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator, using a glass globe.",
              "[69] In his book Opticks, Newton was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of multiple-prism arrays.",
              "[70] Some 278 years after Newton's discussion, multiple-prism beam expanders became central to the development of narrow-linewidth tunable lasers.",
              "Also, the use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the multiple-prism dispersion theory.",
              "[70] Subsequent to Newton, much has been amended.",
              "Young and Fresnel discarded Newton's particle theory in favour of Huygens' wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light's wavelength.",
              "Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics.",
              "The German poet and scientist, Goethe, could not shake the Newtonian foundation but \"one hole Goethe did find in Newton's armour, .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible.",
              "He, therefore, thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must forever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible.",
              "This inference was proved by Dollond to be wrong.\"",
              "[71] Newton had been developing his theory of gravitation as far back as 1665.",
              "[28][29] In 1679, Newton returned to his work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion.",
              "This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679\u201380 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions.",
              "[64] Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680\u20131681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed.",
              "[72] After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector.",
              "Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684.",
              "[73] This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.",
              "The Principia was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Halley.",
              "In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion.",
              "Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics.",
              "They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years.",
              "Many of these advances continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world.",
              "He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.",
              "[74] In the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the first analytical determination (based on Boyle's law) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon's gravitational attraction on the Earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the Moon, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.",
              "[74] Newton's biographer David Brewster reported that the complexity of applying his theory of gravity to the motion of the moon was so great it affected Newton's health: \"[H]e was deprived of his appetite and sleep\" during his work on the problem in 1692\u201393, and told the astronomer John Machin that \"his head never ached but when he was studying the subject\".",
              "According to Brewster Edmund Halley also told John Conduitt that when pressed to complete his analysis Newton \"always replied that it made his head ache, and kept him awake so often, that he would think of it no more\".",
              "[Emphasis in original][75] Newton made clear his heliocentric view of the Solar System\u2014developed in a somewhat modern way because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the \"deviation of the Sun\" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System.",
              "[76] For Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather \"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World\", and this centre of gravity \"either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line\" (Newton adopted the \"at rest\" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest).",
              "[77] Newton's postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing \"occult agencies\" into science.",
              "[78] Later, in the second edition of the Principia (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding General Scholium, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did;",
              "but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena.",
              "(Here Newton used what became his famous expression \"hypotheses non-fingo\"[79]).",
              "With the Principia, Newton became internationally recognised.",
              "[80] He acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier.",
              "[81] In 1710, Newton found 72 of the 78 \"species\" of cubic curves and categorised them into four types.",
              "[82] In 1717, and probably with Newton's help, James Stirling proved that every cubic was one of these four types.",
              "Newton also claimed that the four types could be obtained by plane projection from one of them, and this was proved in 1731, four years after his death.",
              "[83] In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible.",
              "A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5:7\u2014the Johannine Comma\u2014and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.",
              "[84] Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England for Cambridge University in 1689 and 1701, but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed.",
              "[85] He was, however, noted by Cambridge diarist Abraham de la Pryme to have rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted.",
              "[86] Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer.",
              "He took charge of England's great recoining, trod on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower, and secured the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley.",
              "Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30 years of his life.",

              "His formulation of the laws of motion resulted in the law of universal gravitation.",
              "After interrupted attendance at the grammar school in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, Isaac Newton finally settled down to prepare for university, going on to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1661, somewhat older than his classmates.",

              "In optics, his discovery of the composition of white light integrated the phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics.",
              "In mechanics, his three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation.",

              "Newton\u2019s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, 1687) was one of the most important single works in the history of modern science.",
              "Born in the hamlet of Woolsthorpe, Newton was the only son of a local yeoman, also Isaac Newton, who had died three months before, and of Hannah Ayscough.",
              "That same year, at Arcetri near Florence, Galileo Galilei had died;",
              "Newton would eventually pick up his idea of a mathematical science of motion and bring his work to full fruition.",
              "A tiny and weak baby, Newton was not expected to survive his first day of life, much less 84 years.",
              "Deprived of a father before birth, he soon lost his mother as well, for within two years she married a second time;",
              "her husband, the well-to-do minister Barnabas Smith, left young Isaac with his grandmother and moved to a neighbouring village to raise a son and two daughters.",
              "For nine years, until the death of Barnabas Smith in 1653, Isaac was effectively separated from his mother, and his pronounced psychotic tendencies have been ascribed to this traumatic event.",
              "That he hated his stepfather we may be sure.",
              "When he examined the state of his soul in 1662 and compiled a catalog of sins in shorthand, he remembered \u201cThreatning my father and mother Smith to burne them and the house over them.",
              "\u201d The acute sense of insecurity that rendered him obsessively anxious when his work was published and irrationally violent when he defended it accompanied Newton throughout his life and can plausibly be traced to his early years.",
              "After his mother was widowed a second time, she determined that her first-born son should manage her now considerable property.",
              "It quickly became apparent, however, that this would be a disaster, both for the estate and for Newton.",
              "He could not bring himself to concentrate on rural affairs\u2014set to watch the cattle, he would curl up under a tree with a book.",
              "Fortunately, the mistake was recognized, and Newton was sent back to the grammar school in Grantham, where he had already studied, to prepare for the university.",
              "As with many of the leading scientists of the age, he left behind in Grantham anecdotes about his mechanical ability and his skill in building models of machines, such as clocks and windmills.",
              "At the school he apparently gained a firm command of Latin but probably received no more than a smattering of arithmetic.",
              "By June 1661 he was ready to matriculate at Trinity College, Cambridge, somewhat older than the other undergraduates because of his interrupted education.",
              "When Newton arrived in Cambridge in 1661, the movement now known as the Scientific Revolution was well advanced, and many of the works basic to modern science had appeared.",
              "Astronomers from Nicolaus Copernicus to Johannes Kepler had elaborated the heliocentric system of the universe.",
              "Galileo had proposed the foundations of a new mechanics built on the principle of inertia.",
              "Led by Rene\u0301 Descartes, philosophers had begun to formulate a new conception of nature as an intricate, impersonal, and inert machine.",
              "Yet as far as the universities of Europe, including Cambridge, were concerned, all this might well have never happened.",
              "They continued to be the strongholds of outmoded Aristotelianism, which rested on a geocentric view of the universe and dealt with nature in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. Like thousands of other undergraduates, Newton began his higher education by immersing himself in Aristotle\u2019s work.",
              "Even though the new philosophy was not in the curriculum, it was in the air.",
              "Some time during his undergraduate career, Newton discovered the works of the French natural philosopher Descartes and the other mechanical philosophers, who, in contrast to Aristotle, viewed physical reality as composed entirely of particles of matter in motion and who held that all the phenomena of nature result from their mechanical interaction.",
              "A new set of notes, which he entitled \u201cQuaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae\u201d (\u201cCertain Philosophical Questions\u201d), begun sometime in 1664, usurped the unused pages of a notebook intended for traditional scholastic exercises;",
              "under the title he entered the slogan \u201cAmicus Plato amicus Aristoteles magis amica veritas\u201d (\u201cPlato is my friend, Aristotle is my friend, but my best friend is truth\u201d).",
              "Newton\u2019s scientific career had begun.",
              "The \u201cQuaestiones\u201d reveal that Newton had discovered the new conception of nature that provided the framework of the Scientific Revolution.",
              "He had thoroughly mastered the works of Descartes and had also discovered that the French philosopher Pierre Gassendi had revived atomism, an alternative mechanical system to explain nature.",
              "The \u201cQuaestiones\u201d also reveal that Newton already was inclined to find the latter a more attractive philosophy than Cartesian natural philosophy, which rejected the existence of ultimate indivisible particles.",
              "The works of the 17th-century chemist Robert Boyle provided the foundation for Newton\u2019s considerable work in chemistry.",
              "Significantly, he had read Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist, and was thereby introduced to another intellectual world, the magical Hermetic tradition, which sought to explain natural phenomena in terms of alchemical and magical concepts.",
              "The two traditions of natural philosophy, the mechanical and the Hermetic, antithetical though they appear, continued to influence his thought and in their tension supplied the fundamental theme of his scientific career.",
              "Although he did not record it in the \u201cQuaestiones,\u201d Newton had also begun his mathematical studies.",
              "He again started with Descartes, from whose La Ge\u0301ometrie he branched out into the other literature of modern analysis with its application of algebraic techniques to problems of geometry.",
              "He then reached back for the support of classical geometry.",
              "Within little more than a year, he had mastered the literature;",
              "and, pursuing his own line of analysis, he began to move into new territory.",
              "He discovered the binomial theorem, and he developed the calculus, a more powerful form of analysis that employs infinitesimal considerations in finding the slopes of curves and areas under curves.",
              "By 1669 Newton was ready to write a tract summarizing his progress, De Analysi per Aequationes Numeri Terminorum Infinitas (\u201cOn Analysis by Infinite Series\u201d), which circulated in manuscript through a limited circle and made his name known.",
              "During the next two years he revised it as De methodis serierum et fluxionum (\u201cOn the Methods of Series and Fluxions\u201d).",
              "The word fluxions, Newton\u2019s private rubric, indicates that the calculus had been born.",
              "Despite the fact that only a handful of savants were even aware of Newton\u2019s existence, he had arrived at the point where he had become the leading mathematician in Europe.",
              "When Newton received the bachelor\u2019s degree in April 1665, the most remarkable undergraduate career in the history of university education had passed unrecognized.",
              "On his own, without formal guidance, he had sought out the new philosophy and the new mathematics and made them his own, but he had confined the progress of his studies to his notebooks.",
              "Then, in 1665, the plague closed the university, and for most of the following two years he was forced to stay at his home, contemplating at leisure what he had learned.",
              "During the plague years Newton laid the foundations of the calculus and extended an earlier insight into an essay, \u201cOf Colours,\u201d which contains most of the ideas elaborated in his Opticks.",
              "It was during this time that he examined the elements of circular motion and, applying his analysis to the Moon and the planets, derived the inverse square relation that the radially directed force acting on a planet decreases with the square of its distance from the Sun\u2014which was later crucial to the law of universal gravitation.",
              "The world heard nothing of these discoveries."

              "From his discovery of the laws of gravity and motion to his work developing the math behind Calculus to his role in the creation of the Royal Society, Isaac Newton was one of the most consequential scientific figures in history.",
              "Responsible for discoveries in math, physics, and optics, his 1687 work Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica is considered one of the greatest scientific works ever written and lays the foundations for classical mechanics and the theory of gravity, which dominated the field of physics until Einstein's theory of relativity took its place in the early 20th century.",
              "Coming from rather humble, though not impoverished, beginnings, Newton did not seem like someone destined to leave so large a mark on the field of science and math.",
              "A decent enough student, he came upon the scientific scene just as the Scientific Revolution was hitting its stride in the 17th century, and his work could easily be considered that Revolution's apex.",
              "Sir Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643 (December 25, 1642 according to the Julian calendar used in England at the time), in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England.",
              "The son of a reasonably well-off farming family, his father died a few months before he was born.",
              "Newton himself was a premature infant who was not expected to live.",
              "He obviously survived infancy, but spent his formative early years living with his maternal grandmother, after his mother remarried.",
              "A gifted child, Newton was said to be taken with building models, including a small, working flour mill that used a mouse running in a wheel for power, and an elaborate system of sundials which was accurate to the minute.",
              "His early education was disrupted when his family tried to make a farmer out of him, but he found it incredibly boring.",
              "His family acquiesced and returned him to school.",
              "He later enrolled in Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, in 1661, where he studied law and paid for his education and upkeep by working as a servant and cleaning up the rooms of wealthier students.",
              "The university closed in 1665 after an outbreak of Bubonic plague ripped through England, and he returned home during this time.",
              "The apocryphal story of the apple falling from a tree inspiring Newton's discovery of the laws of gravity is said to have occurred at this time, but is almost certainly a myth.",
              "Whatever happened in the two years that Newton spent away from Cambridge, he certainly made the most of this time.",
              "Shortly before Cambridge closed in 1665, Isaac Newton developed the generalized binomial theorem, an important part of elementary algebra.",
              "During his time at home, Newton made major strides in his theory of gravitation, calculus, and optics, much of which would be formally published later in his career.",
              "His De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, contributed to important progress in the mathematical field of infinite series and was decribed by a leading British mathematician at the time and Newton's mentor, Isaac Barrow, as the work \"of an extraordinary genius.\"",
              "Newton, upon his return to Cambridge in 1667, took up a position as a Fellow at Trinity College.",
              "This technically required him to become a member of the clergy of the Church of England, but Newton's \"unconventional\" religious views for the time stood in the way and would be a point of contention for many years until he was given a special dispensation to avoid becoming ordained by King Charles II.",
              "One of Newton's first major inventions was a function of his duties as a Fellow of the College, which required him to give lectures at the university.",
              "He chose to lecture on optics for his first few years, from 1670 to 1672 and, to prove his theories about the nature of light and color, he invented the first-known telescope that used reflecting mirrors instead of lenses.",
              "His work on optics, principally that white light entering through a prism produced a spectrum of color that could then be reformed into white light using a lens and a second prism, settled an ongoing debate about the nature of color.",
              "Newton showed that color was a feature of light itself, not of the object being illuminated, known as Newton's theory of color.",
              "In a bit of foreshadowing of the course of his life, Newton was invited to share his ideas about light with The Royal Society, the elite scientific community that helped drive the Scientific Revolution in Britain and beyond.",
              "Newton described his experiments with light in a less-than straightforward manner, which meant the Society's members could not reproduce Newton's results.",
              "When Robert Hooke criticized Newton's findings on light and color, Newton took the experience badly and saw the essential criticism of peer review as a personal attack.",
              "This led Newton to withdraw from intellectual society for many years, delaying the publication of many of his most important works for more than a decade.",
              "Though he would return in time and eventually rose to lead The Royal Society as President, this absence from the academic scene would lay the foundation for one of the greatest scientific controversies in history.",
              "While it's universally recognized in academia that German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently co-invented Calculus with Isaac Newton, Newton would beg to differ - and he begged with an absolute vengeance.",
              "So-called priority fights are a pretty big deal in a field where discoveries of important laws or phenomena are the currency of the realm, and it doesn't get much bigger than Calculus.",
              "Calculus is the mathematical bedrock of all kinds of scientific disciplines, owing largely to its ability to measure rates of change or to extrapolate greater data from smaller data, such as the surface area and volume of complex shapes.",
              "Newton had to invent calculus in order to explain many of his discoveries around gravitation and classical mechanics, but he did not publish these findings until 1704, and even then in a somewhat muddled way.",
              "Meanwhile, in Germany, Leibniz \u2014 an accomplished scientist and mathematician in his own right, had laid down the same math in a cleaner, more efficient manner in 1684, along with the conventional notation used around the world today.",
              "Newton and his allies accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and Newton used his stature and position as the President of The Royal Society to destroy the reputation of Leibniz, an effort that was largely successful.",
              "It has only been in recent years that Leibniz has been given his fair share of the credit for the invention of Calculus.",
              "Probably the greatest of Isaac Newton's discoveries was laid down in Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687, known today as Newton's Laws of Motion.",
              "This foundational work of modern physics demonstrated and explained how macroscopic objects moved, both on Earth and in the heavens, according to the same mathematical laws and could be explained with three essential principles, often stated as: The first law, that of inertia, explains how objects in motion and at rest \"prefer\" to keep their existing state as-is and resists change unless compelled by some force.",
              "This helps to explain acceleration, deceleration, and the like.",
              "The second law, that of force, can be summed up in the equation: Force = mass x acceleration This formula is essential to the mechanics of motion and defines the math that governs how the first law of motion actually works in practice \u2014 that is, how much force needs to be applied to overcome an object's inertia.",
              "The third law, that of action and reaction, defines motion as an interaction of complementary forces.",
              "In the case of an airplane, the shape of the wing pushes air down.",
              "In response, the air pushes against the shape of the wing, lifting it up.",
              "The wing, attached to a fuselage, pushes the plane up.",
              "The weight of the fuselage, attached to the wing, pulls the wing down against the air in response.",
              "There is much more that could be said about the Principia and its impact on modern science, but for now, it's enough to say that it remained the bedrock of physical sciences for centuries and is still highly relevant even to this day.",
              "With the publication of Principia, Opticks, and many other works, Newton pretty much cemented himself as one of the greatest scientific minds in human history \u2014 but he was still a man of his time.",
              "In the 17th century, alchemy was falling out of favor but was still practiced, being pursued with all its fruitless attempts at turning lead into gold and uncovering the secrets of immortality through the fabled Philosopher's Stone.",
              "During the period of self-imposed exile following the poor reception of his work in optics, Newton dove deep into some less-than-scientific pursuits.",
              "Newton devoted a considerable amount of effort to alchemical studies, and it's estimated that his surviving papers, collected after his death, amount to an estimated 10 million words, enough to fill an entire bookcase in a library on their own.",
              "Of those 10 million words, a surprisingly large number pertained to alchemical formulas and forensic study of the Bible in search of hidden codes and prophecies.",
              "The religious conjectures he put in writing, including his rejection of the essential Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity, would have branded him as a heretic in the eyes of the public, and his pursuit of a philosopher's stone that could grant immortality would be an embarrassment for a figure of Newton's stature, at least in the eyes of many of his supporters.",
              "As a result, his legal heir, John Conduitt, the husband of Catherine Barton, Newton's half-niece, kept these papers under wraps and they would not begin to see the light of day until the middle of the 20th century, when many of them started to see widespread publication.",
              "Isaac Newton was known to have a mean streak, including making threats and lashing out at friend and enemy alike.",
              "Speculations have long been made about his personal relationships, or lack thereof, by both modern figures and his contemporaries.",
              "In one letter to his friend, the political philosopher John Locke, Newton wrote: \"SIR, \u2014 Being of opinion that you endeavoured to embroil me with women, and by other means, I was so much affected with it, as that when one told me you were sickly and would not live, I answered, 'twere better if you were dead.",
              "I desire you to forgive me this uncharitableness.\"",
              "Robert Hooke certainly didn't set out to make Newton his enemy, but Newton nonetheless held a grudge over the legitimate scientific criticism of his work and used his position as President of the Royal Society to attempt to erase Hooke's contributions from history.",
              "He engaged in another nasty fight with British astronomer John Flamsteed in 1712.",
              "Flamsteed had dedicated much of his scientific efforts toward producing a definitive star catalogue full of rich and precise detail.",
              "Newton was impatient with Flamsteed's fastidiousness regarding his data and turned over large chunks of it to astronomer Edmond Halley (of Halley's Comet fame) to edit.",
              "Newton then published the error-filled volume of Historia Colestis Britannica without Flamsteed's consent.",
              "Horrified and humiliated, Flamsteed spent a considerable sum buying up all the copies of the slapdash volume he could and proceeded to make a show of openly burning them at the Royal Observatory.",
              "Newton was not amused, and stripped any mention of Flamsteed from his Principia Mathematica, even though Flamsteed's contributions to the work were substantial.",

              "Born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, England, Sir Isaac Newton began developing his theories on light, calculus and celestial mechanics while on break from Cambridge University.",
              "Years of research culminated with the 1687 publication of \u201cPrincipia,\u201d a landmark work that established the universal laws of motion and gravity.",

              "Also a student of Biblical history and alchemy, the famed scientist served as president of the Royal Society of London and master of England\u2019s Royal Mint until his death in 1727.",
              "Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England.",
              "The son of a farmer who died three months before he was born, Newton spent most of his early years with his maternal grandmother after his mother remarried.",
              "His education was interrupted by a failed attempt to turn him into a farmer, and he attended the King\u2019s School in Grantham before enrolling at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Trinity College in 1661.",
              "Newton studied a classical curriculum at Cambridge, but he became fascinated by the works of modern philosophers such as Rene\u0301 Descartes, even devoting a set of notes to his outside readings he titled \u201cQuaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae\u201d (\u201cCertain Philosophical Questions\u201d).",
              "When the Great Plague shuttered Cambridge in 1665, Newton returned home and began formulating his theories on calculus, light and color, his farm the setting for the supposed falling apple that inspired his work on gravity.",
              "Newton returned to Cambridge in 1667 and was elected a minor fellow.",
              "He constructed the first reflecting telescope in 1668, and the following year he received his Master of Arts degree and took over as Cambridge\u2019s Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.",
              "Asked to give a demonstration of his telescope to the Royal Society of London in 1671, he was elected to the Royal Society the following year and published his notes on optics for his peers.",
              "Through his experiments with refraction, Newton determined that white light was a composite of all the colors on the spectrum, and he asserted that light was composed of particles instead of waves.",
              "His methods drew sharp rebuke from established Society member Robert Hooke, who was unsparing again with Newton\u2019s follow-up paper in 1675.",
              "Known for his temperamental defense of his work, Newton engaged in heated correspondence with Hooke before suffering a nervous breakdown and withdrawing from the public eye in 1678.",
              "In the following years, he returned to his earlier studies on the forces governing gravity and dabbled in alchemy.",
              "In 1684, English astronomer Edmund Halley paid a visit to the secluded Newton.",
              "Upon learning that Newton had mathematically worked out the elliptical paths of celestial bodies, Halley urged him to organize his notes.",
              "The result was the 1687 publication of \u201cPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\u201d (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), which established the three laws of motion and the law of universal gravity.",
              "Newton\u2019s three laws of motion state that (1) Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external force acts on it;",

              "Determined to prove his position wasn\u2019t merely symbolic, Newton moved the pound sterling from the silver to the gold standard and sought to punish counterfeiters.",
              "The death of Hooke in 1703 allowed Newton to take over as president of the Royal Society, and the following year he published his second major work, \u201cOpticks.",
              "\u201d Composed largely from his earlier notes on the subject, the book detailed Newton\u2019s painstaking experiments with refraction and the color spectrum, closing with his ruminations on such matters as energy and electricity.",
              "In 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne of England.",
              "Around this time, the debate over Newton\u2019s claims to originating the field of calculus exploded into a nasty dispute.",
              "Newton had developed his concept of \u201cfluxions\u201d (differentials) in the mid 1660s to account for celestial orbits, though there was no public record of his work.",
              "In the meantime, German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz formulated his own mathematical theories and published them in 1684.",
              "As president of the Royal Society, Newton oversaw an investigation that ruled his work to be the founding basis of the field, but the debate continued even after Leibniz\u2019s death in 1716.",
              "Researchers later concluded that both men likely arrived at their conclusions independent of one another.",
              "Newton was also an ardent student of history and religious doctrines, and his writings on those subjects were compiled into multiple books that were published posthumously.",
              "Having never married, Newton spent his later years living with his niece at Cranbury Park near Winchester, England.",
              "He died in his sleep on March 31, 1727, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.",
              "A giant even among the brilliant minds that drove the Scientific Revolution, Newton is remembered as a transformative scholar, inventor and writer.",
              "He eradicated any doubts about the heliocentric model of the universe by establishing celestial mechanics, his precise methodology giving birth to what is known as the scientific method.",

              "[note 1] The publication of the law has become known as the \"first great unification\", as it marked the unification of the previously described phenomena of gravity on Earth with known astronomical behaviors.",
              "[1][2][3] This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called inductive reasoning.",
              "[4] It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton's work Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (\"the Principia\"), first published on 5 July 1687.",
              "When Newton presented Book 1 of the unpublished text in April 1686 to the Royal Society, Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him.",
              "The equation for universal gravitation thus takes the form: where F is the gravitational force acting between two objects, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, r is the distance between the centers of their masses, and G is the gravitational constant.",
              "The first test of Newton's law of gravitation between masses in the laboratory was the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798.",
              "[5] It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton's Principia and approximately 71 years after his death.",
              "Newton's law of gravitation resembles Coulomb's law of electrical forces, which is used to calculate the magnitude of the electrical force arising between two charged bodies.",
              "Both are inverse-square laws, where force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies.",
              "Coulomb's law has charge in place of mass and a different constant.",
              "Newton's law has later been superseded by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, but the universality of the gravitational constant is intact and the law still continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity in most applications.",
              "Relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme accuracy, or when dealing with very strong gravitational fields, such as those found near extremely massive and dense objects, or at small distances (such as Mercury's orbit around the Sun).",
              "Around 1600, the scientific method began to take root.",
              "Rene\u0301 Descartes started over with a more fundamental view, developing ideas of matter and action independent of theology.",
              "Galileo Galilei wrote about experimental measurements of falling and rolling objects.",
              "Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion summarized Tycho Brahe's astronomical observations [6]: 132 In 1687 Isaac Newton published his Principia which combined his laws of motion with new mathematical analysis to explain Kepler's empirical results.",
              "[6]: 134 His explanation was in the form of a law of universal gravitation: any two bodies are attracted by a force proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to their separation squared.",
              "[7]: 28 Newton's original formula was: where the symbol \u221d {\\displaystyle \\propto } means \"is proportional to\".",
              "To make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them (the gravitational constant).",
              "Newton would need an accurate measure of this constant to prove his inverse-square law.",
              "While Newton was able to formulate his law of gravity in his monumental work, he was deeply uncomfortable with the notion of \"action at a distance\" that his equations implied.",
              "In 1692, in his third letter to Bentley, he wrote: \"That one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one another, is to me so great an absurdity that, I believe, no man who has in philosophic matters a competent faculty of thinking could ever fall into it.\"",
              "He never, in his words, \"assigned the cause of this power\".",
              "In all other cases, he used the phenomenon of motion to explain the origin of various forces acting on bodies, but in the case of gravity, he was unable to experimentally identify the motion that produces the force of gravity (although he invented two mechanical hypotheses in 1675 and 1717).",
              "Moreover, he refused to even offer a hypothesis as to the cause of this force on grounds that to do so was contrary to sound science.",

              "This is because, as expected from Newton\u2019s third law, if Earth exerts a force on the Moon, then the Moon should exert an equal and opposite force on Earth (see Figure).",

              "Why is there also a high tide on the opposite side of Earth?",
              "The answer is that Earth is pulled toward the Moon more than the water on the far side, because Earth is closer to the Moon.",
              "So the water on the side of Earth closest to the Moon is pulled away from Earth, and Earth is pulled away from water on the far side.",
              "As Earth rotates, the tidal bulge (an effect of the tidal forces between an orbiting natural satellite and the primary planet that it orbits) keeps its orientation with the Moon.",
              "Thus there are two tides per day (the actual tidal period is about 12 hours and 25.",
              "2 minutes), because the Moon moves in its orbit each day as well).",

              "Including the mass term allows us to use this formula in a new way.",
              "If we can measure the motions (distances and orbital periods) of objects acting under their mutual gravity, then the formula will permit us to deduce their masses.",
              "For example, we can calculate the mass of the Sun by using the distances and orbital periods of the planets, or the mass of Jupiter by noting the motions of its moons.",

              "Perhaps to reduce the risk of public misunderstanding, Newton included at the beginning of Book 3 (in the second (1713) and third (1726) editions) a section titled \"Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy\".",
              "In the four rules, as they came finally to stand in the 1726 edition, Newton effectively offers a methodology for handling unknown phenomena in nature and reaching towards explanations for them.",
              "The four Rules of the 1726 edition run as follows (omitting some explanatory comments that follow each): This section of Rules for philosophy is followed by a listing of \"Phenomena\", in which are listed a number of mainly astronomical observations, that Newton used as the basis for inferences later on, as if adopting a consensus set of facts from the astronomers of his time.",
              "Both the \"Rules\" and the \"Phenomena\" evolved from one edition of the Principia to the next.",
              "Rule 4 made its appearance in the third (1726) edition;",
              "Rules 1\u20133 were present as \"Rules\" in the second (1713) edition, and predecessors of them were also present in the first edition of 1687, but there they had a different heading: they were not given as \"Rules\", but rather in the first (1687) edition the predecessors of the three later \"Rules\", and of most of the later \"Phenomena\", were all lumped together under a single heading \"Hypotheses\" (in which the third item was the predecessor of a heavy revision that gave the later Rule 3).",
              "From this textual evolution, it appears that Newton wanted by the later headings \"Rules\" and \"Phenomena\" to clarify for his readers his view of the roles to be played by these various statements.",
              "In the third (1726) edition of the Principia, Newton explains each rule in an alternative way and/or gives an example to back up what the rule is claiming.",
              "The first rule is explained as a philosophers' principle of economy.",
              "The second rule states that if one cause is assigned to a natural effect, then the same cause so far as possible must be assigned to natural effects of the same kind: for example, respiration in humans and in animals, fires in the home and in the Sun, or the reflection of light whether it occurs terrestrially or from the planets.",
              "An extensive explanation is given of the third rule, concerning the qualities of bodies, and Newton discusses here the generalisation of observational results, with a caution against making up fancies contrary to experiments, and use of the rules to illustrate the observation of gravity and space.",
              "Isaac Newton's statement of the four rules revolutionised the investigation of phenomena.",
              "With these rules, Newton could in principle begin to address all of the world's present unsolved mysteries.",
              "He was able to use his new analytical method to replace that of Aristotle, and he was able to use his method to tweak and update Galileo's experimental method.",
              "The re-creation of Galileo's method has never been significantly changed and in its substance, scientists use it today.",
              "[citation needed] The General Scholium is a concluding essay added to the second edition, 1713 (and amended in the third edition, 1726).",
              "[48] It is not to be confused with the General Scholium at the end of Book 2, Section 6, which discusses his pendulum experiments and resistance due to air, water, and other fluids.",
              "Here Newton used the expression hypotheses non fingo, \"I formulate no hypotheses\",[9] in response to criticisms of the first edition of the Principia.",
              "(\"Fingo\" is sometimes nowadays translated \"feign\" rather than the traditional \"frame,\" although \"feign\" does not properly translate \"fingo\").",
              "Newton's gravitational attraction, an invisible force able to act over vast distances, had led to criticism that he had introduced \"occult agencies\" into science.",
              "[49] Newton firmly rejected such criticisms and wrote that it was enough that the phenomena implied gravitational attraction, as they did;",
              "but the phenomena did not so far indicate the cause of this gravity, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things not implied by the phenomena: such hypotheses \"have no place in experimental philosophy\", in contrast to the proper way in which \"particular propositions are inferr'd from the phenomena and afterwards rendered general by induction\".",
              "[50] Newton also underlined his criticism of the vortex theory of planetary motions, of Descartes, pointing to its incompatibility with the highly eccentric orbits of comets, which carry them \"through all parts of the heavens indifferently\".",
              "Newton also gave theological argument.",
              "From the system of the world, he inferred the existence of a god, along lines similar to what is sometimes called the argument from intelligent or purposive design.",
              "It has been suggested that Newton gave \"an oblique argument for a unitarian conception of God and an implicit attack on the doctrine of the Trinity\".",
              "[51][52] The General Scholium does not address or attempt to refute the church doctrine;",
              "it simply does not mention Jesus, the Holy Ghost, or the hypothesis of the Trinity.",
              "In January 1684, Edmond Halley, Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke had a conversation in which Hooke claimed to not only have derived the inverse-square law but also all the laws of planetary motion.",
              "Wren was unconvinced, Hooke did not produce the claimed derivation although the others gave him time to do it, and Halley, who could derive the inverse-square law for the restricted circular case (by substituting Kepler's relation into Huygens' formula for the centrifugal force) but failed to derive the relation generally, resolved to ask Newton.",
              "[53] Halley's visits to Newton in 1684 thus resulted from Halley's debates about planetary motion with Wren and Hooke, and they seem to have provided Newton with the incentive and spur to develop and write what became Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica.",
              "Halley was at that time a Fellow and Council member of the Royal Society in London (positions that in 1686 he resigned to become the Society's paid Clerk).",
              "[54] Halley's visit to Newton in Cambridge in 1684 probably occurred in August.",
              "[55] When Halley asked Newton's opinion on the problem of planetary motions discussed earlier that year between Halley, Hooke and Wren,[56] Newton surprised Halley by saying that he had already made the derivations some time ago;",
              "but that he could not find the papers.",
              "(Matching accounts of this meeting come from Halley and Abraham De Moivre to whom Newton confided.)",
              "Halley then had to wait for Newton to \"find\" the results, and in November 1684 Newton sent Halley an amplified version of whatever previous work Newton had done on the subject.",
              "This took the form of a 9-page manuscript, De motu corporum in gyrum (Of the motion of bodies in an orbit): the title is shown on some surviving copies, although the (lost) original may have been without a title.",
              "Newton's tract De motu corporum in gyrum, which he sent to Halley in late 1684, derived what is now known as the three laws of Kepler, assuming an inverse square law of force, and generalised the result to conic sections.",
              "It also extended the methodology by adding the solution of a problem on the motion of a body through a resisting medium.",
              "The contents of De motu so excited Halley by their mathematical and physical originality and far-reaching implications for astronomical theory, that he immediately went to visit Newton again, in November 1684, to ask Newton to let the Royal Society have more of such work.",
              "[57] The results of their meetings clearly helped to stimulate Newton with the enthusiasm needed to take his investigations of mathematical problems much further in this area of physical science, and he did so in a period of highly concentrated work that lasted at least until mid-1686.",
              "[58] Newton's single-minded attention to his work generally, and to his project during this time, is shown by later reminiscences from his secretary and copyist of the period, Humphrey Newton.",
              "His account tells of Isaac Newton's absorption in his studies, how he sometimes forgot his food, or his sleep, or the state of his clothes, and how when he took a walk in his garden he would sometimes rush back to his room with some new thought, not even waiting to sit before beginning to write it down.",
              "[59] Other evidence also shows Newton's absorption in the Principia: Newton for years kept up a regular programme of chemical or alchemical experiments, and he normally kept dated notes of them, but for a period from May 1684 to April 1686, Newton's chemical notebooks have no entries at all.",
              "[60] So, it seems that Newton abandoned pursuits to which he was formally dedicated and did very little else for well over a year and a half, but concentrated on developing and writing what became his great work.",
              "The first of the three constituent books was sent to Halley for the printer in spring 1686, and the other two books somewhat later.",
              "The complete work, published by Halley at his own financial risk,[61] appeared in July 1687.",
              "Newton had also communicated De motu to Flamsteed, and during the period of composition, he exchanged a few letters with Flamsteed about observational data on the planets, eventually acknowledging Flamsteed's contributions in the published version of the Principia of 1687.",
              "The process of writing that first edition of the Principia went through several stages and drafts: some parts of the preliminary materials still survive, while others are lost except for fragments and cross-references in other documents.",
              "[62] Surviving materials show that Newton (up to some time in 1685) conceived his book as a two-volume work.",
              "The first volume was to be titled De motu corporum, Liber primus, with contents that later appeared in extended form as Book 1 of the Principia.",
              "[citation needed] A fair-copy draft of Newton's planned second volume De motu corporum, Liber Secundus survives, its completion dated to about the summer of 1685.",
              "It covers the application of the results of Liber primus to the Earth, the Moon, the tides, the Solar System, and the universe;",
              "in this respect, it has much the same purpose as the final Book 3 of the Principia, but it is written much less formally and is more easily read.",
              "[citation needed] It is not known just why Newton changed his mind so radically about the final form of what had been a readable narrative in De motu corporum, Liber Secundus of 1685, but he largely started afresh in a new, tighter, and less accessible mathematical style, eventually to produce Book 3 of the Principia as we know it.",
              "Newton frankly admitted that this change of style was deliberate when he wrote that he had (first) composed this book \"in a popular method, that it might be read by many\", but to \"prevent the disputes\" by readers who could not \"lay aside the[ir] prejudices\", he had \"reduced\" it \"into the form of propositions (in the mathematical way) which should be read by those only, who had first made themselves masters of the principles established in the preceding books\".",
              "[63] The final Book 3 also contained in addition some further important quantitative results arrived at by Newton in the meantime, especially about the theory of the motions of comets, and some of the perturbations of the motions of the Moon.",
              "The result was numbered Book 3 of the Principia rather than Book 2 because in the meantime, drafts of Liber primus had expanded and Newton had divided it into two books.",
              "The new and final Book 2 was concerned largely with the motions of bodies through resisting mediums.[64] But the Liber Secundus of 1685 can still be read today.",
              "Even after it was superseded by Book 3 of the Principia, it survived complete, in more than one manuscript.",
              "After Newton's death in 1727, the relatively accessible character of its writing encouraged the publication of an English translation in 1728 (by persons still unknown, not authorised by Newton's heirs).",
              "It appeared under the English title A Treatise of the System of the World.",
              "[65] This had some amendments relative to Newton's manuscript of 1685, mostly to remove cross-references that used obsolete numbering to cite the propositions of an early draft of Book 1 of the Principia.",
              "Newton's heirs shortly afterwards published the Latin version in their possession, also in 1728, under the (new) title De Mundi Systemate, amended to update cross-references, citations and diagrams to those of the later editions of the Principia, making it look superficially as if it had been written by Newton after the Principia, rather than before.",
              "[66] The System of the World was sufficiently popular to stimulate two revisions (with similar changes as in the Latin printing), a second edition (1731), and a \"corrected\" reprint[67] of the second edition (1740).",
              "The text of the first of the three books of the Principia was presented to the Royal Society at the close of April 1686.",
              "Hooke made some priority claims (but failed to substantiate them), causing some delay.",
              "When Hooke's claim was made known to Newton, who hated disputes, Newton threatened to withdraw and suppress Book 3 altogether, but Halley, showing considerable diplomatic skills, tactfully persuaded Newton to withdraw his threat and let it go forward to publication.",
              "Samuel Pepys, as president, gave his imprimatur on 30 June 1686, licensing the book for publication.",
              "The Society had just spent its book budget on De Historia piscium,[68] and the cost of publication was borne by Edmund Halley (who was also then acting as publisher of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society):[69] the book appeared in summer 1687.",
              "[70] After Halley had personally financed the publication of Principia, he was informed that the society could no longer afford to provide him the promised annual salary of \u00a350.",

              "Rather, their speed varies so that the line joining the centres of the sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.",

              "At this time, his proof that white light was a combination of primary colors (found via prismatics) replaced the prevailing theory of colors and received an overwhelmingly favorable response and occasioned bitter disputes with Robert Hooke and others, which forced him to sharpen his ideas to the point where he already composed sections of his later book Opticks by the 1670s in response.",

              "[74] After his 1679\u20131680 correspondence with Hooke, described below, Newton adopted the language of inward or centripetal force.",

              "and as if to whet Newton's interest, he asked what Newton thought about various matters, giving a whole list, mentioning \"compounding the celestial motions of the planets of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body\", and \"my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse\", and then a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions (which Hooke described at length), and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys, the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge, and other items. Newton's reply offered \"a fansy of my own\" about a terrestrial experiment (not a proposal about celestial motions) which might detect the Earth's motion, by the use of a body first suspended in air and then dropped to let it fall.",
              "The main point was to indicate how Newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the Earth's motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical, but he went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid Earth had not been in the way (on a spiral path to the centre).",

              "[108] Newton also maintained annotated copies of the first edition specially bound up with interleaves on which he could note his revisions;",
              "two of these copies still survive,[109] but he had not completed the revisions by 1708.",
              "Newton had almost severed connections with one would-be editor, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, and another, David Gregory seems not to have met with his approval and was also terminally ill, dying in 1708.",
              "Nevertheless, reasons were accumulating not to put off the new edition any longer.",
              "[110] Richard Bentley, master of Trinity College, persuaded Newton to allow him to undertake a second edition, and in June 1708 Bentley wrote to Newton with a specimen print of the first sheet, at the same time expressing the (unfulfilled) hope that Newton had made progress towards finishing the revisions.",
              "[111] It seems that Bentley then realised that the editorship was technically too difficult for him, and with Newton's consent he appointed Roger Cotes, Plumian professor of astronomy at Trinity, to undertake the editorship for him as a kind of deputy (but Bentley still made the publishing arrangements and had the financial responsibility and profit).",
              "The correspondence of 1709\u20131713 shows Cotes reporting to two masters, Bentley and Newton, and managing (and often correcting) a large and important set of revisions to which Newton sometimes could not give his full attention.",
              "[112] Under the weight of Cotes' efforts, but impeded by priority disputes between Newton and Leibniz,[113] and by troubles at the Mint,[114] Cotes was able to announce publication to Newton on 30 June 1713.",

              "No work of science has drawn more attention from philosophers than Newton's Principia.",
              "The reasons for this, however, and consequently the focus of the attention have changed significantly from one century to the next.",
              "During the 20th Century philosophers have viewed the Principia in the context of Einstein's new theory of gravity in his theory of general relativity.",
              "The main issues have concerned the relation between Newton's and Einstein's theories of gravity and what the need to replace the former with the latter says about the nature, scope, and limits of scientific knowledge.",
              "During most of the 18th Century, by contrast, Newton's theory of gravity remained under dispute, especially because of the absence of a mechanism \u2014 in particular, a contact mechanism \u2014 producing gravitational forces.",
              "The philosophic literature correspondingly endeavored to clarify and to resolve, one way or the other, the dispute over whether the Principia should or should not be viewed as methodologically well founded.",
              "By the 1790s Newton's theory of gravity had become established among those engaged in research in orbital mechanics and physical geodesy, leading to the Principia becoming the exemplar of science at its most successful.",
              "Philosophic interest in the Principia during the 19th Century therefore came to focus on how Newton had achieved this success, in part to characterize the knowledge that had been achieved and in part to pursue comparable knowledge in other areas of research.",
              "Unfortunately, a very large fraction of the philosophic literature in all three centuries has suffered from a quite simplistic picture of the Principia itself.",
              "The main goal of this entry is to replace that simplistic picture with one that does more justice to the richness of both the content and the methodology of the Principia.",
              "Viewed retrospectively, no work was more seminal in the development of modern physics and astronomy than Newton's Principia.",
              "Its conclusion that the force retaining the planets in their orbits is one in kind with terrestrial gravity ended forever the view dating back at least to Aristotle that the celestial realm calls for one science and the sublunar realm, another.",
              "Just as the Preface to its first edition had proposed, the ultimate success of Newton's theory of gravity made the identification of the fundamental forces of nature and their characterization in laws the primary pursuit of physics.",
              "The success of the theory led as well to a new conception of exact science under which every systematic discrepancy between observation and theory, no matter how small, is taken as telling us something important about the world.",
              "And, once it became clear that the theory of gravity provided a far more effective means than observation for precisely characterizing complex orbital motions \u2014 just as Newton had proposed in the Principia in the case of the orbit of the Moon \u2014 physical theory gained primacy over observation for purposes of answering specific questions about the world.",
              "The retrospective view of the Principia has been different in the aftermath of Einstein's special and general theories of relativity from what it was throughout the nineteenth century.",
              "Newtonian theory is now seen to hold only to high approximation in limited circumstances in much the way that Galileo's and Huygens's results for motion under uniform gravity came to be seen as holding only to high approximation in the aftermath of Newtonian inverse-square gravity.",
              "In the middle of the nineteenth century, however, when there was no reason to think that any confuting discrepancy between Newtonian theory and observation was ever going to emerge, the Principia was viewed as the exemplar of perfection in empirical science in much the way that Euclid's Elements had been viewed as the exemplar of perfection in mathematics at the beginning of the seventeenth century.",
              "Because of the extent to which Einsteinian theory was grounded historically on Newtonian science, the Principia has retained its unique seminal position in the history of physics in our post-Newtonian era.",
              "Perhaps more strikingly, because of the logical relationship between Newtonian and Einsteinian theory \u2014 Einstein showed that Newtonian gravity holds as a limit-case of general relativity in just the way Newton showed (in Book 1, Section 10) that Galilean uniform gravity holds as a limit-case of inverse-square gravity \u2014 even though the Principia can no longer be regarded as an exemplar of perfection, it is still widely regarded by physicists as an exemplar of empirical science at its best.",

              "he seems to have exhausted his Argument, and left little to be done by those that shall succeed him\u201d[1] \u2014 the most positive view of it that anyone could have substantiated during the first half of the eighteenth century would have emphasized its promise more than its achievements.",
              "The theory of gravity had too many loose ends, the most glaring of which was a factor of 2 discrepancy in the mean motion of the lunar apogee, a discrepancy that undercut the claim that the Moon is held in orbit by an inverse-square force.",
              "No one knew these loose ends better than Newton himself, yet no one had a greater sense of the potential of the theory of gravity to resolve a whole host of questions in planetary astronomy \u2014 which may well explain why he made these loose ends difficult to see except by the most technically skilled, careful readers.",
              "Between the late 1730s and the early 1750s the situation changed dramatically when several of the loose ends were tied up, in some cases yielding such extraordinary results as the first truly successful descriptive account of the motion of the Moon in the history of astronomy.",
              "During the second half of the eighteenth century the promise of the Principia was not only universally recognized by those active in empirical research, but a large fraction of this promise was realized.",
              "What we now call \u201cNewtonian mechanics\u201d emerged in this process, as did the gravity-based accounts of the often substantial divergences of the planets from Keplerian motion, the achievement of Newton's theory of gravity that ultimately ended all opposition to it.",
              "During the eighteenth century the Principia was also seen as putting forward a world view directly in opposition to the broadly Cartesian world view that in many circles had taken over from the Scholastic world view during the second half of the seventeenth century.",
              "Newton clearly intended the work to be viewed in this way when in 1686 he changed its title to Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in allusion to Descartes's most prominent work at the time, Principia Philosophiae.",
              "(The title page of Newton's first edition underscored this allusion by placing the first and third words of the title in larger type.)",
              "The main difference in the world view in Newton's Principia was to rid the celestial spaces of vortices carrying the planets.",
              "Newtonians subsequently went beyond Newton in enhancing this world view in various ways, including forces everywhere expressly acting at a distance.",
              "The \u201cclockwork universe\u201d aspect of the Newtonian world view, for example, is not to be found in the Principia;",
              "it was added by Laplace late in the eighteenth century, after the success of the theory of gravity in accounting for complex deviations from Keplerian motion became fully evident.",
              "In addition to viewing the theory of gravity as potentially transforming orbital astronomy, Newton saw the Principia as illustrating a new way of doing natural philosophy.",
              "One aspect of this new way, announced in the Preface to the first edition, was the focus on forces: A second aspect of the new method concerns the use of mathematical theory not to derive testable conclusions from hypotheses, as Galileo and Huygens had done, but to cover a full range of alternative theoretical possibilities, enabling the empirical world then to select among them.",
              "This new approach is spelled out most forcefully at the end of Book 1, Section 11: A third aspect of the new method, which proved most controversial at the time, was the willingness to hold questions about the mechanism through which forces effect their changes in motion in abeyance, even when the mathematical theory of the species and proportions of the forces seemed to leave no alternative but action at a distance.",
              "This aspect remained somewhat tacit in the first edition, but then, in response to criticisms it received, was made polemically explicit in the General Scholium added at the end of the second edition: During most of the eighteenth century the primary challenge the Principia presented to philosophers revolved around what to make of a mathematical theory of forces in the absence of a mechanism, other than action at a distance, through which these forces work.",
              "By the last decades of the century, however, little room remained for questioning whether gravity does act according to the laws that Newton had set forth and does suffice for all the motions of the heavenly bodies and of our sea.",
              "No one could deny that a science had emerged that, at least in certain respects, so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally.",
              "The challenge to philosophers then became one of spelling out first the precise nature and limits of the knowledge attained in this science and then how, methodologically, this extraordinary advance had been achieved, with a view to enabling other areas of inquiry to follow suit.",
              "The view is commonplace that what Newton did was to put forward his theory of gravity to explain Kepler's already established \u201claws\u201d of orbital motion;",
              "and the universality of the law of gravity then ended up explaining the deviations from Keplerian motion by attributing them to gravitational interaction of the planets.",
              "This is wrong on several counts, the most immediate of which is that Kepler's \u201claws\u201d were by no means established before the Principia.",
              "The rules for calculating orbital motion that Kepler put forward in the first two decades of the seventeenth century had indeed achieved a spectacular gain in accuracy over anything that had come before.",
              "Kepler's rules, however, did not yield comparable accuracy for the motion of the Moon, and even in the case of the planets the calculated locations were sometimes off by as much as a fourth of the width of the Moon.",
              "More importantly, by 1680 several other approaches to calculating the orbits had been put forward that achieved the same level of not quite adequate accuracy as Kepler's.",
              "In particular, Newton was familiar with seven different approaches to calculating planetary orbits, all at roughly the same accuracy.",
              "Only two of these, Kepler's and Jeremiah Horrocks's, used Kepler's area rule \u2014 planets sweep out equal areas in equal times with respect to the Sun \u2014 to locate planets along their trajectories.",
              "Ismae\u0308l Boulliau and, following him, Thomas Streete (from whose Astronomia Carolina Newton first learned orbital astronomy) replaced the area rule with a geometric construction.",
              "Vincent Wing had adopted still another geometric construction in the late 1660s after having earlier used a point of equal angular motion oscillating about the empty focus of the ellipse;",
              "and Nicolaus Mercator in 1676 added still a further geometric construction.",
              "[4] Of these six alternative approaches, only Horrocks and, following him, Streete, took Kepler's 3/2 power rule \u2014 the periods of the planets vary as the square root of the cube of their mean distances from the Sun \u2014 seriously enough to use the periods rather than positional observations to determine their mean distances.",
              "[5] All these approaches followed Kepler in using an ellipse to represent the trajectory.",
              "(The primary historical reason for this was Kepler's success in predicting the 1631 transit of Mercury across the Sun.)",
              "This, however, does not mean that the ellipse was established as anything more than a mathematically tractable close approximation to the true orbit.",
              "In fact, the planetary orbits known then are not all that elliptical.",
              "The minor axis of Mercury is only 2 percent shorter than the major axis, the minor axis of Mars, only 0.",
              "4 percent shorter, and in all other cases the difference between an ellipse and an eccentric circle was beyond detection.",
              "Newton had real grounds for claiming in a letter to Halley in June 1686 a \u201cright\u201d to the ellipse, remarking that \u201cKepler knew the Orb to be not circular but oval, and guest it to be Elliptical\u201d [C, II, 436].",
              "Entirely independently, the most judicious reader of the first edition of the Principia, Christiaan Huygens, wrote the following summary of the Principia\u2018s achievement in his notebook upon reading the complimentary copy Newton had sent him: So, all three of Kepler's rules that came to be called \u201claws\u201d after the Principia were known to be nothing more than holding to high approximation when Newton started on the project in 1684.",
              "And the leading issue in orbital astronomy at the time was not why Kepler's rules hold, but rather which, if any, of the comparably accurate different approaches to calculating orbits was to be preferred.",
              "The distinct possibility of the ellipse being only an approximation to the true trajectory explains the appropriateness of the question Hooke put to Newton in 1679 and Halley put to him again in 1684 \u2014 what trajectory does a body describe when moving under an inverse-square force directed toward a central body?",
              "The inverse-square part of this question came from combining the mathematical theory of uniform circular motion, which Huygens had published in his Horologium Oscillatorium of 1673, with Kepler's 3/2 power rule: the force in a string retaining a body in a uniform circular orbit varies directly as the radius of the circle and inversely as the square of the period;",
              "but the squares of the periods of the planets vary as the cubes of their mean distances;",
              "and hence, at least to a first approximation, the forces retaining the planets in their orbits vary inversely with the square of the radii of their nearly circular orbits.",
              "But now allow the distance of the orbiting body from the center to vary rather than remaining constant, as in a circle.",
              "What trajectory would result if the force toward the center varies as the inverse-square of the distance from the center toward which the force is always directed?",
              "The answer in the nine page tract \u201cDe Motu Corporum in Gyrum\u201d that Newton sent to Halley in November 1684 is, an ellipse, provided the velocity is not too high (and if it is, then instead a parabola or a hyperbola, depending on the velocity).",
              "The key step in developing this answer is a generalization of uniform circular motion to the case of motion under a \u201ccentripetal\u201d force \u2014 a term Newton coined from Huygens's \u201ccentrifugal\u201d force, by which he meant the tension in the string keeping the body in a circle;",
              "and a key to this step was the discovery that a body moving under any form of centripetal force always sweeps out equal areas in equal times with respect to that center, so that the appropriate geometrical representation of time for generalizing uniform circular motion is area swept out rather than angle or arc length.",
              "The tract also confirms that Kepler's 3/2 power rule continues to hold for bodies orbiting in confocal ellipses governed by inverse-square centripetal forces.",
              "These were remarkable steps forward at the time, but they and the questions behind them form only an initial part of the context in which Newton went on to write the Principia.",
              "Shortly after the \u201cDe Motu\u201d tract went off to London, Newton revised the tract and added two further passages.",
              "The question precipitating this revision appears to have been about the effect the inverse-square centripetal forces directed toward Jupiter, as implied by its satellites, have on the Sun.",
              "Newton first added two principles that he first called \u201chypotheses\u201d and then changed to \u201claws\u201d: Law 3: The relative motions of bodies enclosed in a given space are the same whether that space is at rest or moves perpetually and uniformly in a straight line without circular motion.",
              "Law 4: The common center of gravity does not alter its state of motion or rest through the mutual actions of bodies.",
              "[U, 267] The second of the two added passages concerns motion in resisting media;",
              "it provides a context in which to read Book 2 of the Principia.",
              "The first added passage, which has become known as the \u201cCopernican scholium,\u201d we here quote in full because it, better than anything else, explains what led Newton into the further research that turned the nine-page tract into the five hundred page Principia.",
              "It occurs as a single long paragraph, but is here broken into three segments in order to facilitate commenting on it: Moreover, the whole space of the planetary heavens is either at rest (as is commonly believed) or uniformly moved in a straight line, and similarly the common centre of gravity of the planets (by Law 4) is either at rest or is moved at the same time.",
              "In either case the motions of the planets among themselves (by Law 3) take place in the same manner and their common centre of gravity is at rest with respect to the whole space, and so it ought to be considered the immobile center of the whole planetary system.",
              "Thence indeed the Copernican system is proved a priori.",
              "For if a common centre of gravity is computed for any position of the planets, this either lies in the body of the Sun or will always be very near it.",
              "By reason of this deviation of the Sun from the center of gravity the centripetal force does not always tend to that immobile center, and hence the planets neither move exactly in ellipses nor revolve twice in the same orbit.",
              "Each time a planet revolves it traces a fresh orbit, as happens also with the motion of the Moon, and each orbit depends upon the combined motions of all the planets, not to mention their actions upon each other.",
              "Unless I am much mistaken, it would exceed the force of human wit to consider so many causes of motion at the same time, and to define the motions by exact laws which would allow of an easy calculation.",
              "Leaving aside these fine points, the simple orbit that is the mean between all vagaries will be the ellipse that I have discussed already.",
              "If any one shall attempt to determine this ellipse by trigonometrical computation from three observations (as is usual) he will be proceeding without due caution.",
              "For these observations will share in the very small irregular motions here neglected and so cause the ellipse to deviate somewhat from its actual magnitude and position (which ought to be the mean among all errors), and so there will be as many ellipses differing from each other as there are trios of observations employed.",
              "Very many observations must therefore be joined together and assigned to a single operation which mutually moderate each other and display the mean ellipse both as regards position and magnitude.",

              "[17] Third, the treatment of the variation of surface gravity with latitude (Book 3, Proposition 20) was significantly extended, partly in response to Huygens's alternative treatment of this variation, but also because of more recent data from near the Equator.",

              "In addition to these, two changes were made that were more polemical than substantive: Newton added the General Scholium following Book 3 in the second edition, and his editor Roger Cotes provided a long anti-Cartesian (and anti-Leibnizian) Preface.",

              "The naive distinction between true and apparent motion was, of course, entirely commonplace.",

              "Ptolemy's principal innovation in orbital astronomy \u2014 the so-called bi-section of eccentricity \u2014 entailed that half of the observed first inequality in the motion of the planets arises from a true variation in speed, and half from an only apparent variation associated with the observer being off center.",
              "Similarly, Copernicus's main point was that the second inequality \u2014 that is, the observed retrograde motions of the planets \u2014 involved not true, but only apparent motions.",
              "And the subsequent issue between the Copernican and Tychonic system concerned whether the observed annual motion of the Sun through the zodiac is a true or only an apparent motion of the Sun.",
              "So, what Newton is doing in the scholium on space and time is not to introduce a new distinction, but to explicate with more care a distinction that had been fundamental to astronomy for centuries.",
              "The distinctions between \u201cabsolute, true, and mathematical\u201d and \u201crelative, apparent, and common\u201d time and space are the conceptual basis Newton employs in laying out the corresponding distinction for motion.",
              "He says, \u201crelative, apparent, and common time is any sensible and external measure (precise or imprecise) of duration by motion,\u201d adding a parallel point about absolute space.",
              "He points out that the distinction between absolute and relative time has long been part of astronomy insofar as astronomers have long introduced corrections (via the equation of time) to the natural day \u201cin order to measure celestial motions on the basis of a truer time,\u201d and he raises the possibility of there being \u201cno uniform motion by which time may have an exact measure.",

              "In short, both absolute time and absolute location are quantities that cannot themselves be observed, but instead have to be inferred from measures of relative time and location, and these measures are always only provisional;",
              "that is, they are always open to the possibility of being replaced by some new (still relative) measure that is deemed to be better behaved across a variety of phenomena in parallel with the way in which sidereal time was deemed to be preferable to solar time.",
              "Notice here the expressed concern with measuring absolute, true, mathematical time, space, and motion, all of which are identified at the beginning of the scholium as quantities.",
              "The scholium that follows the eight definitions thus continues their concern with measures that will enable values to be assigned to the quantities in question.",
              "Newton expressly acknowledges that these measures are what we would now call theory-mediated and provisional.",
              "Measurement is at the very heart of the Principia.",
              "It pervades the definitions and scholium on space and time precisely because the primary point of this section is to spell out (in Howard Stein's words) \u201cthe empirical content of a set of theoretical notions\u201d [Stein, 1967, 281].",
              "Accordingly, while Newton's distinctions between absolute and relative time and space provide a conceptual basis for his explicating his distinction between absolute and relative motion, absolute time and space cannot enter directly into empirical reasoning insofar as they are not themselves empirically accessible.",
              "In other words, the Principia presupposes absolute time and space for purposes of conceptualizing the aim of measurement, but the measurements themselves are always of relative time and space, and the preferred measures are those deemed to be providing the best approximations to the absolute quantities.",
              "Newton never presupposes absolute time and space in his empirical reasoning.",
              "Motion in the planetary system is referred to the fixed stars, which are provisionally being taken as an appropriate reference for measurement, and sidereal time is provisionally taken as the preferred approximation to absolute time.",
              "Moreover, in the corollaries to the laws of motion Newton specifically renounces the need to worry about absolute versus relative motion in two cases: Corollary 5.",
              "When bodies are enclosed in a given space, their motions in relation to one another are the same whether the space is at rest or whether it is moving uniformly straight forward without circular motion.",
              "Corollary 6.",
              "If bodies are moving in any way whatsoever with respect to one another and are urged by equal accelerative forces along parallel lines, they will all continue to move with respect to one another in the same way as they would if they were not acted on by those forces.",
              "So, while the Principia presupposes absolute time and space for purposes of conceptualizing absolute motion, the presuppositions underlying all the empirical reasoning about actual motions are philosophically more modest.",
              "If absolute time and space cannot serve to distinguish absolute from relative motions \u2014 more precisely, absolute from relative changes of motion \u2014 empirically, then what can?",
              "Newton answers, \u201cThe causes which distinguish true motions from relative motions are the forces impressed upon bodies to generate motion.",
              "True motion is neither generated nor changed except by forces impressed upon the moving body itself.",
              "\u201d The problem then becomes one of distinguishing the forces impressed on bodies, where forces are quantities;",
              "and hence the key issue is whether there are theory-mediated measures of them that yield unequivocal values \u2014 in contrast to different measures of the same force that yield different values, the hallmark of relative motion.",
              "The famous bucket example that follows is offered as illustrating how forces can be distinguished that will then distinguish between true and apparent motion.",
              "The final paragraph of the scholium begins and ends as follows: What does follow are two books of propositions that provide means for inferring forces from motions and motions from forces and a final book that illustrates how these propositions can be applied to the system of the world first to identify the forces governing motion in our planetary system and then to use them to differentiate between certain true and apparent motions of particular interest.",
              "In this respect, the empirical content of the theoretical concepts that Newton has explicated in the section called \u201cDefinitions\u201d is inextricably linked with the physical theory presented in the rest of the Principia.",
              "The contention that the empirical reasoning in the Principia does not presuppose an unbridled form of absolute time and space should not be taken as suggesting that Newton's theory is free of fundamental assumptions about time and space that have subsequently proved to be problematic.",
              "For example, in the case of space, Newton presupposes that the geometric structure governing which lines are parallel and what the distances are between two points is three-dimensional and Euclidean.",
              "In the case of time Newton presupposes that, with suitable corrections for such factors as the speed of light, questions about whether two celestial events happened at the same time can in principle always have a definite answer.",
              "And the appeal to forces to distinguish real from apparent non-inertial motions presupposes that free-fall under gravity can always, at least in principle, be distinguished from inertial motion.",
              "[20] Equally, the contention that the empirical reasoning in the Principia does not presuppose an unbridled form of absolute space should not be taken as denying that Newton invoked absolute space as his means for conceptualizing true deviations from inertial motion.",
              "Corollary 5 to the Laws of Motion, quoted above, put him in a position to introduce the notion of an inertial frame, but he did not do so, perhaps in part because Corollary 6 showed that even using an inertial frame to define deviations from inertial motion would not suffice.",
              "Empirically, nevertheless, the Principia follows astronomical practice in treating celestial motions relative to the fixed stars, and one of its key empirical conclusions (Book 3, Prop.",

              "Only the first of the three laws Newton gives in the Principia corresponds to any of these principles, and even the statement of it is distinctly different: Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed.",
              "This general principle, which following the lead of Newton came to be called the principle or law of inertia, had been in print since Pierre Gassendi's De motu impresso a motore translato of 1641.",
              "Newton probably first encountered it in print when he read Descartes' Principia, where it is comprised by his first two \u201claws of nature\u201d and is used immediately to assert \u201cthat any body which is moving in a circle constantly tends to move away from the center of the circle which it is describing.",
              "\u201d This is the basis for Descartes concluding that some form of unseen matter (namely the vortices) must be in contact with the planets, for otherwise they would go off in a straight line.",

              "Newton had adopted it as a \u201chypothesis\u201d in the registered version of \u201cDe Motu,\u201d though stated without reference to impressed forces: Every body under the sole action of its innate force moves uniformly in a straight line indefinitely unless something extraneous hinders it.",
              "The striking difference in the formulation in the Principia versus the one in \u201cDe Motu\u201d \u2014 and, for that matter, versus all earlier formulations in print \u2014 is the reference to impressed forces.",
              "In all earlier formulations, any departure from uniform motion in a straight line implied the existence of a material impediment to the motion;",
              "in the more abstract formulation in the Principia, the existence of an impressed force is implied, with the question of how this force is effected left open.",
              "The modern F=ma form of Newton's second law nowhere occurs in any edition of the Principia even though he had seen his second law formulated in this way in print during the interval between the second and third editions in Jacob Hermann's Phoronomia of 1716.",
              "Instead, it has the following formulation in all three editions: A change in motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and takes place along the straight line in which that force is impressed.",
              "In the body of the Principia this law is applied both to discrete cases, in which an instantaneous impulse such as from impact is effecting the change in motion, and to continuously acting cases, such as the change in motion in the continuous deceleration of a body moving in a resisting medium.",

              "1], at its place A where a force is impressed upon it, have a motion by which, when uniformly continued, it would describe the straight line Aa, but shall by the impressed force be Figure 1 deflected from this line into another one Ab and, when it ought to be located at the place a, be found at the place b, then because the body, free of the impressed force, would have occupied the place a and is thrust out from this place by that force and transferred therefrom to the place b, the translation of the body from the place a to the place b will, in the meaning of this Law, be proportional to this force and directed to the same goal towards which this force is impressed.",
              "Whence, if the same body deprived of all motion and impressed by the same force with the same direction, could in the same time be transported from the place A to the place B, the two straight lines AB and ab will be parallel and equal.",
              "For the same force, by acting with the same direction and in the same time on the same body whether at rest or carried on with any motion whatever, will in the meaning of this Law achieve an identical translation towards the same goal;",
              "and in the present case the translation is AB where the body was at rest before the force was impressed, and ab where it was there in a state of motion.",
              "[M, 541] In other words, the measure of the change in motion is the distance between the place where the body would have been after a given time had it not been acted on by the force and the place it is after that time.",
              "This is in keeping with the measure universally used at the time for the strength of the acceleration of surface gravity, namely the distance a body starting from rest falls vertically in the first second.",
              "The only special provision that Newton has to make is for non-uniform continuously acting forces, for which, in accord with Lemma 10, he takes the distance AB to vary \u201cat the very beginning of the motion in the squared ratio of the times.",
              "\u201d[21] If this way of interpreting the second law seems perverse, keep in mind that the geometric mathematics Newton used in the Principia \u2014 and others were using before him \u2014 had no way of representing acceleration as a quantity in its own right.",
              "Newton, of course, could have conceptualized acceleration as the second derivative of distance with respect to time within the framework of the symbolic calculus.",
              "This indeed is the form in which Jacob Hermann presented the second law in his Phoronomia of 1716 (and Euler in the 1740s).",
              "But the geometric mathematics used in the Principia offered no way of representing second derivatives.",
              "(Newton employed curvature \u2014 that is, the circle \u201ctouching a curve\u201d \u2014 in place of the second derivative with respect to distance throughout the Principia).",
              "Hence, it was natural for Newton to stay with the established tradition of using a length as the measure of the change of motion produced by a force, even independently of the advantage this measure had of allowing the law to cover both discrete and continuously acting forces (with the given time taken in the limit in the continuous case).",
              "Under this interpretation, Newton's second law would not have seemed novel at the time.",
              "The consequences of impact were also being interpreted in terms of the distance between where the body would have been after a given time, had it not suffered the impact, and where it was after this time, following the impact, with the magnitude of this distance depending on the relative bulks of the impacting bodies.",
              "Moreover, Huygens's account of the centrifugal force (that is, the tension in the string) in uniform circular motion in his Horologium Oscillatorium used as the measure for the force the distance between where the body would have been had it continued in a straight line and its location on the circle in a limiting small increment of time;",
              "and he then added that the tension in the string would also be proportional to the weight of the body.",
              "So, construed in the indicated way, Newton's second law was novel only in its replacing bulk and weight with mass.",
              "[22] In the early stages of his work on the Principia Newton had identified three logically equivalent alternatives for the third law: the action-reaction principle he ultimately chose, the principle we call conservation of linear momentum (Corollary 3 in the Principia), and the principle that \u201cthe common center of gravity of two or more bodies does not change its state whether of motion or of rest as a result of the actions of the bodies upon one another\u201d (Corollary 4).",
              "Huygens had stated that both of these principles follow from his solution for spheres in collision, and the center of gravity principle, as Newton emphasizes, amounts to nothing more than a generalization of the principle of inertia.",
              "Even though his third law was novel in comparison with these other two,[23] Newton nevertheless chose it and relegated the other two to corollaries.",
              "Two things can be said about this choice.",
              "First, the third law is a local principle, while the two alternatives to it are global principles, and Newton, unlike those working in mechanics on the Continent at the time, generally preferred fundamental principles to be local, perhaps because they pose less of an evidence burden.",
              "Second, with the choice of the third law, the three laws all expressly concern impressed forces: the first law authorizes inferences to the presence of an impressed force on a body, the second, to its magnitude and direction, and the third to the correlative force on the body producing it.",
              "In this regard, Newton's three laws of motion are indeed axioms characterizing impressed force.",
              "Real forces, in contrast to such apparent forces as Coriolis forces (of which Newton was entirely aware, though of course not under this name), are forces for which the third law, as well as the first two, hold, for only by means of this law can real forces and hence changes of motion be distinguished from apparent ones.",
              "Newton presents his first two laws as already \u201caccepted by mathematicians and confirmed by experiments of many kinds\u201d [P, 424].",
              "[24] For the third law, by contrast, he offers a variety of forms of support, including experiments on impact.",
              "One important element that becomes clear in his discussion of evidence for the third law \u2014 and also in Corollary 2 \u2014 is that Newton's impressed force is the same as static force that had been employed in the theory of equilibrium of devices like the level and balance for some time.",
              "Newton is not introducing a novel notion of force, but only extending a familiar notion of force.",
              "Indeed, Huygens too had employed this notion of static force in his Horologium Oscillatorium when he identified his centrifugal force with the tension in the string (or the pressure on a wall) retaining an object in circular motion, in explicit analogy with the tension exerted by a heavy body on a string from which it is dangling.",
              "Huygens's theory of centrifugal force was going beyond the standard treatment of static forces only in its inferring the magnitude of the force from the motion of the body in a circle.",
              "Newton's innovation beyond Huygens was first to focus not on the force on the string, but on the correlative force on the moving body, and second to abstract this force away from the mechanism by which it acts on the body.",
              "Three steps were thus involved in passing from the already familiar static forces to the more abstract Newtonian \u201cdynamic\u201d forces, one by Huygens and two by Newton.",
              "[25] The continuity with Huygens's theory of centrifugal force is important in another respect.",
              "In his brief defense of the first two laws of motion Newton remarks, \u201cWhat has been demonstrated concerning the times of oscillating pendulums depends on the same first two laws and first two corollaries, and this is supported by daily experience with clocks\u201d [P, 424].",
              "In Huygens's Horologium Oscillatorium, the only place any counterpart to the second law surfaces is in the theory of centrifugal force and uniform circular motion.",
              "The theory Huygens presents extends to conical pendulums, including a conical pendulum clock that he indicates has advantages over simple pendulum clocks.",
              "In the 1670s Newton had used a conical pendulum to confirm Huygens's announced value of the strength of surface gravity as measured by simple cycloidal and small-arc circular pendulums.[26] (Huygens himself had measured the strength of surface gravity with a conical pendulum, obtaining the same value to four significant figures as he had obtained with simple pendulums.[27]) The precise agreement between these two theory-mediated measures of surface gravity, one of them predicated on Newton's first two laws of motion and the other not, in fact constituted the strongest evidence for the first two laws at the time the Principia was first published.",
              "For, the simple pendulum measure was known to be stable and accurate into the fourth significant figure.",
              "The evidence in hand for the first two laws, taken as a basis for measuring forces, was thus much stronger than has often been appreciated.",
              "Save perhaps for the attribution of the F=ma form of the second law to the Principia, the most widespread mistake about Newton's three laws of motion is that they alone sufficed for all problems in classical mechanics.",
              "Those who developed what we now call Newtonian mechanics during the eighteenth century at all times appreciated how far from the truth this is.",
              "Newton's three laws of motion suffice for problems involving what Euler dubbed \u201cpoint-masses.",

              "But the three laws must be supplemented by further principles for a whole host of celebrated problems involving bodies, rigid or otherwise, that are not mere point-masses.",
              "Perhaps the simplest prominent example at the time was the problem of a small arc circular pendulum with two (or more) point-mass bobs along the string.",
              "Huygens had solved this problem in the part of his Horologium Oscillatorium entitled \u201cThe Center of Oscillation,\u201d in the process providing the theoretical basis for using added masses to tune pendulum clocks.",
              "[28] The reason why Newton's three laws of motion have to be supplemented to solve this problem is easy to see.",
              "Consider the case of a pendulum with two point-masses along the length of a rigid string.",
              "The outer point-mass has the effect of reducing the speed of the inner one, versus what it would have had without the outer one, and the inner point-mass increases the speed of the outer one.",
              "In other words, motion is transferred from the inner one to the outer one along the segment of the string joining them.",
              "Once the force transmitted to each point-mass along the string is known, Newton's three laws of motion are sufficient to determine the motion.",
              "But his three laws are not sufficient to determine what this force transmitted along the string is.",
              "Some other principle beyond them is needed to solve the problem.",

              "A fundamental contrast between Newton's mathematical theory of motion under centripetal forces and the mathematical theories of motion developed by Galileo and Huygens is that Newton's is generic.",

              "This is notable for two reasons.",

              "The subsequent results in Sections 12 and 13 indicate that, in the case of all other kinds of centripetal force, the attraction toward a sphere is not the same as attraction toward all its mass concentrated in the center;",

              "But the time is proportional to PQ divided by the velocity v, and in the limit as Q approaches P, PQ approaches PR, so that t2 becomes equal to PR2/v2.",
              "Proposition 36 of Book 3 of Euclid entails that in this limit PR2 is equal to the product of QR and twice the radius SP, and hence the force for uniform motion in a circle varies as v2/SP or v2/r.",
              "[35] Newton's Proposition 6 generalizes this result to not necessarily uniform motion under centripetal forces along an arbitrary trajectory in which equal areas are swept out in equal times with respect to S, in accord with Proposition 1 of Book 1.",
              "The central force at P is again proportional to the displacement from the tangent QR over a short increment of time divided by the square of this time;",

              "In the second edition Newton adds a corollary that displays another way of seeing the result as a generalization of uniform circular motion: the centripetal force along the trajectory must everywhere vary as v2/(\u03c1sinSPR), where \u03c1 is the radius of curvature of the trajectory at P.",

              "If the force center is at a focus S of the ellipse, then the limit of (QR/QT2) is everywhere equal to half the constant latus rectum of the ellipse, and hence the force varies as 1/SP2, or 1/r2.",
              "But if the force center is at the center C of the ellipse, the force turns out to vary as PC, that is, linearly with r.",
              "This contrast raises an interesting question.",
              "What conclusion can be drawn in the case of motion in an ellipse for which the foci are very near the center, and the center of force is not known to be exactly at the focus?",
              "Newton clearly noticed this question and supplied the means for answering it in the Scholium that ends Section 2.",
              "Section 10 includes a philosophically important result that has gone largely unnoticed in the literature on the Principia.",
              "Newton's argument that terrestrial gravity extends to the Moon depends crucially on Huygens's precise measurement of the strength of surface gravity.",
              "This theory-mediated measurement was based on the isochronism[36] of the cycloidal pendulum under uniform gravity directed in parallel lines toward a flat Earth.",
              "But gravity is directed toward the center of the (nearly) spherical Earth along lines that are not parallel to one another, and according to Newton's theory it is not uniform.",
              "So, does Huygens's measurement cease to be valid in the context of the Principia?",
              "Newton recognized this concern and addressed it in Propositions 48 through 52 by extending Huygens's theory of the cycloidal pendulum to cover the hypocycloidal pendulum \u2014 that is, a cycloidal path produced when the generating circle rolls along the inside of a sphere instead of along a flat surface.",
              "Proposition 52 then shows that such a pendulum, although not isochronous under inverse-square centripetal forces, is isochronous under centripetal forces that vary linearly with the distance to the center.",
              "Insofar as gravity varies thus linearly below the surface in a uniformly dense sphere, the hypocycloidal pendulum is isochronous up to the surface, and hence it can in principle be used to measure the strength of gravity.",
              "A corollary to this proposition goes further by pointing out that, as the radius of the sphere is increased indefinitely, its surface approaches a plane surface and the law of the hypocycloidal asymptotically approaches Huygens's law of the cycloidal pendulum.",
              "This not only validates Huygens's measurement of surface gravity, but also provides a formula that can be used to determine the error associated with using Huygens's theory rather than the theory of the hypocycloidal pendulum.",
              "Thus, what Newton has taken the trouble to do in Section 10 is to show that Huygens's theory of pendulums under uniform parallel gravity is a limit-case of Newton's theory of pendulums under universal gravity.",
              "At the end of Section 2 he points out in passing that this limit strategy also captures Galileo's theory of projectile motion.",
              "In other words, Newton took the trouble to show that the Galilean-Huygensian theory of local motion under their uniform gravity is a particular limit-case of his theory of universal gravity, just as Einstein took the trouble to show that Newtonian gravity is a limit-case of the theory of gravity of general relativity.",
              "Newton's main reason for doing this appears to have been the need to validate a measurement pivotal to the evidential reasoning for universal gravity in Book 3.",
              "From a philosophic standpoint, however, what is striking is not merely his recognizing this need, but more so the trouble he went to to fulfill it.",
              "Section 10 may thus illustrate best of all that Newton had a clear reason for including everything he chose to include in the Principia.",
              "Section 9 includes another often overlooked result that is pivotal to the evidential reasoning for universal gravity in Book 3.",
              "Proposition 45 applies the result on precessing orbits mentioned earlier to the special case of nearly circular orbits, that is, orbits like those of the then known planets and their satellites.",
              "This proposition establishes that such orbits, under purely centripetal forces, are stationary \u2014 that is, do not precess \u2014 if and only if the centripetal force governing them is exactly inverse-square.",
              "It does this by deriving a formula relating the exponent n in the force law to the angle \u03b8 between the point where the orbiting body is furthest from the force center to the point where it is nearest, that is, the apsidal angle: n = (180/\u03b8)2-3.",
              "(To illustrate, if the apsidal angle is 180 degrees, as in a Keplerian ellipse, then the exponent in the force law is -2, and if the apsidal angle is 90 degrees, as in an ellipse for which the force center is in the center, the exponent is +1.)",

              "Perhaps in part in emulation of the approach to centripetal forces that appeared to have succeeded so well in Books 1 and 3, the approach Newton takes in Book 2 is to develop, so far as he can, a generic mathematical theory of motion under resistance forces and then turn to experimental phenomena so that, in the words of Book 1, \u201cit may be found out which conditions of forces apply\u201d to different kinds of fluids.",

              "Because Newton's goal was to reach a conclusion about the contribution to the total resistance made by the inertia of the fluid, and he recognized that surface friction and viscosity can contribute to the resistance as well, his empirical problem became one of disaggregating the inertial contribution from the total resistance, that is, the contribution that alone varies with the density of the fluid.",
              "Fortunately, because gravitational forces so totally dominate celestial motions, this need to disaggregate different sorts of forces did not arise in Book 3.",

              "The idea was to start a pendulum from several different heights in order to cover a range of velocities and then to use simultaneous algebraic equations to fit a two or three term polynomial to two or three lost-arc data-points, changing the exponents until the polynomial achieved good agreement with the other lost-arc data points.",
              "The theoretical solutions for pendulum motion under resistance forces in Section 6 would then allow him to infer the forces from the rate of decay of the pendulum.",

              "In principle, therefore, he saw himself in a position to infer laws for resistance forces on spheres from the phenomenon of pendulum decay in full parallel with his deduction of the law of universal gravity from the phenomena of orbital motion in Book 3.",
              "And he could then conclude from the total absence of signs of resistance forces acting on the planets and, most especially, comets that the density of any fluid in the celestial regions must be exactly or very nearly zero.",
              "Unfortunately, pendulum-decay turned out not to be as well behaved a phenomenon as Newton anticipated it was going to be while he was working on the first edition.",
              "The problem, as he later realized, was that he had to let the pendulum swing many times in order to measure the rate of decay, and in the process it gave rise to a \u201cto and fro\u201d motion in the surrounding fluid, so that the relative velocity between the bob and the fluid, which is the velocity that matters in resistance, could not be determined or controlled.",
              "The General Scholium following Section 6[39] reports detailed decay-rate data for an impressive range of experiments, including different size bobs in air and bobs moving as well in water and mercury.",

              "Any reader who worked through the data discovered what Newton knew, but was less than candid about: no polynomial fit the data.",
              "The experiments did clearly indicate that resistance forces involve no power of velocity greater than 2, and they provided good evidence that a velocity squared effect was dominant, even to the extent of masking any effect involving some other power.",
              "Newton also managed to extract some highly qualified evidence that the velocity squared effect varies as the density of the fluid and the frontal area (that is, the square of the diameter) of spheres.",
              "The approach to resistance in the first edition relied entirely on pendulum-decay experiments.",
              "The disappointing evidence they yielded led to a far weaker statement of the conclusion about the absence of fluid in the celestial regions in the first edition than the conclusion in the subsequent editions quoted above.",
              "Not long after the first edition was published, Newton initiated some vertical-fall experiments in water that persuaded him that the phenomenon of vertical-fall in resisting media would yield much better behaved data.",

              "Paul's Cathedral) to establish a resistance effect on spheres that is proportional to the density of the fluid, the square of the diameter, and the square of the velocity.",
              "The data from these experiments were very good \u2014 indeed, even better than Newton realized, for small vagaries in them that he dismissed as experimental error were in fact not vagaries at all, but evidence that no polynomial of the sort he was seeking is adequate for resistance forces.",
              "While the vertical-fall experiments put Newton in a position to make his concluding rejection of vortex theories more forceful, they also posed a methodological complication.",
              "The vertical-fall experiments offered no way of disaggregating the contribution to resistance made by the inertia of the medium from the total resistance.",
              "But the argument against vortices required him to show that, no matter how perfectly free of friction and viscosity the celestial fluid might be, its inertia would still give rise to resistance forces that would affect the motions of comets, if not planets as well.",
              "From the resistance measured in the pendulum-decay experiments, Newton could conclude that the forces in air and water are dominated by a contribution that varies as the velocity squared.",
              "In the vertical-fall experiments in air and water the measured forces varied to first approximation as the product of the density and the velocity squared, but only to a first approximation, leaving room to question whether a purely inertial contribution had been isolated.",
              "Newton dealt with this problem by offering a rather ad hoc theoretical derivation for the purely inertial contribution, showing how closely it agreed with the vertical-fall results, and proposing that the differences between the theoretical and the measured resistances could be used to investigate other contributions.",
              "Success of such a program in characterizing the contributions made by surface friction and the viscosity would have provided compelling support for Newton's theory of the inertial contribution.",
              "Still, the approach left Newton with not so straightforward a derivation of the laws of resistance forces from phenomena as he had hoped for in the first edition.",
              "[40] In fact, there is a deep mistake in Newton's approach to resistance forces that came to be understood only at the beginning of the twentieth century.",
              "Resistance forces do not arise from independent contributions made by such factors as the viscosity and inertia of the fluid.",
              "Consequently, no polynomial consisting of a few always positive terms in powers of velocity can ever be adequate for resistance forces.",
              "The first indication of this came when d'Alembert, unhappy with Newton's ad hoc theory for the inertial contribution, analyzed the flow of what we now call a perfect fluid about spheres and bodies of other shapes, discovering in all cases that the net force of the fluid is exactly zero.",
              "Consequently, contrary to Newton, there is no such thing as the contribution made to resistance purely by the inertia of the fluid.",
              "Resistance forces always arise from a combination of viscous and inertial effects, however low the viscosity of the fluid may be.",
              "Newton's assumption that resistance forces can be represented as a sum, one term of which gives the contribution made purely by the inertia of the fluid, was wrong empirically, much as his assumptions about simultaneity and space being Euclidean turned out to be wrong.",
              "Unlike the latter assumptions, however, the assumption about resistance amounted to a dead end.",

              "[43] The answer is simple: Newton's reasoning is approximative.",

              "The conclusions, so taken, do indeed then show that the premises hold only quam proxime, and not exactly.",
              "This conclusion in no way contradicts the premises.",
              "Recognizing that Newton's reasoning is approximative answers another complaint about the \u201cdeduction\u201d of universal gravity: Newton invokes the proposition, if bodies move uniformly in concentric circular orbits whose periods vary as the 3/2 power of the radii, then the centripetal forces acting on these bodies vary as the inverse-square of the radii of the orbits, knowing full well that observation had established for centuries that the planets do not move uniformly in circular orbits.",
              "[44] Newton does indeed invoke this proposition first to conclude (in Prop.",

              "2) that there is an inverse-square centripetal acceleration field around the Sun.",
              "[45] The orbits of the satellites of Jupiter were then considered to be circular, and hence Newton's inference from their motion was not so problematic.",
              "While, however, the orbits of Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn were considered to be very nearly circular, the motion in them had been known from before Ptolemy not to be uniform.",
              "Newton expressly concedes that his inference of the inverse-square from the 3/2 power rule for the planets is only approximate when, in the very next sentence, he remarks, \u201cBut this second part of the proposition is proved with the greatest exactness from the fact that the aphelia are at rest.",
              "\u201d The absence of precession, however, can be used to infer the inverse-square only for each orbit individually, not a single, unified inverse-square centripetal acceleration field encompassing all of the orbits.",
              "Newton is accordingly using the 3/2 rule for circular orbits to establish that an inverse-square field holds around the Sun to at least a first approximation, and then using the absence of precession of the individual orbits to tighten the approximation.",
              "Interpreting Newton's deduction of universal gravity as an exercise in approximative reasoning answers a further complaint of Duhem's: insofar as the area rule holds only to high approximation, so too do any number of alternatives to it, such as Boulliau's geometric construction, and hence Newton's \u201cdeduction\u201d begs the question of why the area rule is to be preferred to these alternatives.",
              "[46] This question, however, is irrelevant so long as the conclusion remains in the weak form, the law of gravity holds quam proxime for the planets and their satellites over the time period for which observations have shown the phenomena to hold quam proxime.",
              "The phenomena really are sufficient to reach the conclusion in this weak form.",
              "So, the complaint has bite only when the law of gravity is taken to be exact.",
              "But there, however, Newton does provide a response to it when he concludes in Propositions 13 and 14 that the planets would describe areas exactly proportional to the times in stationary orbits if \u201cthe Sun were at rest and the remaining planets did not act upon one another.",
              "\u201d[47] The reason, then, why the phenomena from which Newton proceeded in the deduction have claim to being preferred to alternatives to them is that the theory deduced from them, when taken to hold exactly, identifies circumstances under which the phenomena would hold exactly, as well.",
              "That this be the case amounts to a requirement on the deduction from phenomena: the leap to taking the law of gravity as exact is justified only if it yields circumstances in which the phenomena from which it was inferred would hold exactly.",
              "[48] This analysis of the \u201cdeduction\u201d of universal gravity does not answer two further complaints lodged against it.",
              "First, in concluding that the centripetal force acting on the Moon is inverse-square, Newton grants that the precession of the lunar orbit implies an exponent of -2 and 4/243 for the force rather than exactly -2, but then claims that the small fraction can be accounted for by the perturbing action of the Sun's gravity.",
              "But the magnitude for the action of the Sun that he gives in Proposition 3[49] is twice the value he later in Book 3 indicates is the correct value.",
              "This lacuna was not resolved by Alexis-Claude Clairaut until two decades after Newton died.",
              "Second, when Newton invokes the third law of motion in the corollaries to Proposition 5, he is tacitly assuming that, for example, Jupiter and the Sun are, in effect, directly interacting.",
              "In other words, he is ignoring the alternative favored by Huygens that some unseen medium is effecting the centripetal force on Jupiter, a medium that can in principle absorb the linear momentum which Newton is assuming is being transferred to the Sun.",
              "Huygens may well have perceived this lacuna, to which Cotes explicitly called Newton's attention while he was preparing the second edition.",
              "[50] The group of propositions following the deduction of universal gravity gives indications of the evidential strategy that lies behind the leap to taking this law to be exact.",
              "Immediately upon concluding first that the planets would sweep out equal areas in equal times in exact ellipses and then that the orbits would be exactly stationary were it not for the gravitational interactions among the planets, Newton calls attention to the easiest to observe deviations from this idealization, the then still mysterious vagaries in the motions of Jupiter and Saturn which Newton attributes to their gravitational interaction.",
              "Because, according to the theory, the idealization would hold exactly in the specified circumstances, these and all other deviations must result from further forces not taken into account in the idealized case.",
              "Identifying these forces and showing that, according to the theory, they do produce the deviations is a way for ongoing research to marshal continuing evidence to bear on the theory of gravity.",
              "To put the point differently, the initial idealizations that Newton identifies can serve as the starting point for a process of successive approximations that should yield increasingly close agreement with the complex true motions.",
              "These idealizations are especially well suited for this purpose precisely because, according to the theory, they would hold exactly were no other forces at work, and hence every deviation from them should be physically telling, and not just, for example, an accidental feature of a curve-fit.",
              "Pursuit of such a research program of successive approximations promises to yield either further evidence for the theory of gravity when the program is successful or the exceptions Newton speaks of in Rule 4 that require the theory to be revised.",
              "Of the other results developed in the group of propositions following the deduction of universal gravity, the most heralded at the time were the defense of Copernicanism in Proposition 12 and the identification of the cause of the tides in Proposition 24 \u2014 two topics that Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes had all addressed.",
              "Nevertheless, the two Propositions that proved most important were 19 and 20, which respectively derive the non-spheroidal figure of the Earth and the variation of surface gravity with latitude under the assumption that the density of the Earth is uniform.",
              "This is the only passage in the Principia that Newton reworked extensively in both the second and then again in the third edition.",
              "As Newton was fully aware, and Huygens and a few others realized, these are the only results in the Principia that depend on universal gravity \u2014 that is, inverse-square gravity directed toward every particle of matter forming the Earth \u2014 and not merely macroscopic celestial gravity \u2014 inverse-square gravity directed toward celestial bodies.",
              "In his Discourse on the Cause of Gravity, Huygens offered an alternative theoretical account of the figure of the Earth and the variation of surface gravity, and he claimed to have evidence confirming it and hence refuting Newton's universal gravity.",
              "[51] In part because evidence on the figure of the Earth and the variation of gravity with latitude were accessible in expeditions to the equator, these were the results in the Principia that were the first to receive concerted critical attention during the 1730s and 1740s.",
              "There was a complication in all this, however.",
              "The extremely precise results for both the figure of the Earth and the variation of gravity that Newton tabulated in the second and third editions were based on uniform density, and hence, just like Keplerian motion, represented an idealization, departures from which would point to non-uniformities of density.",
              "Not until Clairaut's Theory of the Figure of the Earth did means become available to calculate the effects of non-uniformities in the density.",
              "[52] Propositions 25 through 35 derive quantitative results for three lunar inequalities \u2014 the systematic departure from the area rule called the \u201cthe variation,\u201d the 18 year motion of the line of nodes, and the fluctuating inclination of the orbit \u2014 from the perturbing action of the Sun.",
              "For all three Newton starts with a circular orbit, so these too involve departures from an idealization.",
              "The values he obtained for the different components of the solar perturbing force in Proposition 25 and subsequently, as needed, were accurate to several significant figures.",
              "All three derivations, which are mathematically demanding, were successful in obtaining agreement with the values of the inequalities obtained from observation, especially so the derivation for the recession of the lunar nodes, for which he achieves agreement with the known value to better than 98 percent.",
              "(Newton must have been mystified by the failure of his seemingly parallel derivation of the 9 year precession of the line of apsides to achieve better than 50 percent agreement.)",
              "The Scholium following Proposition 35 opens with the explanation for the preceding efforts on the lunar inequalities: \u201cI wished to show by these computations of the lunar motions that the lunar motions can be computed from their causes by the theory of gravity\u201d [P, 869].",
              "Newton never found a way of deriving the precession of the lunar apogee from the theory of gravity, and consequently he never succeeded with a complete, gravity-derived account of the lunar orbit.",
              "[53] The mathematical treatment of the three lunar inequalities nevertheless did provide added support for his theory of gravity.",
              "It also introduced the idea of attacking the problem of the true orbit in a sequence of successive approximations by calculating perturbations in motion in an assumed orbit caused by the gravitational action of the Sun.",
              "This was not only an entirely new approach to the then unsolved problem of simply describing the motion of the Moon, an approach that proceeded from the physical cause to the motion;",
              "it was also the beginnings of the perturbational approach that dominated all of celestial mechanics from the middle of the eighteenth century until late in the twentieth.",
              "[54] As difficult as Propositions 25 through 35 were for readers at the time \u2014 and still are for readers now \u2014 they crucially promoted the further research on the complicated orbital motions that ultimately supplied overwhelming support for Newton's theory of gravity.",
              "It was a real breakthrough when Newton discovered that the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon acting on an oblately spheroidal Earth would produce a wobble of the Earth that, at least qualitatively, could account for the precession of the Equinoxes.",
              "No physical explanation for this phenomenon had been proposed before.",
              "Newton faced a problem, however, in trying to carry out a quantitative derivation of the precession: he knew the magnitude of the gravitational action of the Sun on the Earth but not that of the Moon, for he could not obtain the mass of the Moon in the way he had for the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn insofar as no bodies orbit the Moon.",
              "Propositions 36 and 37 endeavor to infer the force of the Moon on the Earth from the difference in the heights of the tides when the Sun and Moon are in conjunction and in opposition.",
              "In the first edition Newton managed to derive a value for the rate of the precession in good agreement with the known value, but during the quarter century between the first and second editions he concluded that the value he had used for the Moon's force (6 and 1/3 times the Sun's force) was much too large.",
              "The derivation of the precession was therefore extensively revised in the second edition, using a new value for the Moon's force (4.",
              "4815 times the Sun's force, still more than a factor of 2 greater than the correct value).",
              "In all editions the derivation in Proposition 39 treated the wobble not directly as the motion of a rigid body, but by analogy with the motion of the lunar nodes.",
              "By the standards of our present physics, no part of Book 3 is further off-base than Newton's solution for the precession.",
              "The phenomenon, however, subsequently provided important evidence for Newton's theory of gravity when d'Alembert in 1749 carried out a successful derivation based on rigid body motion and a correct value of the Moon's force derived from the then recently discovered phenomenon of the nutation of the Earth.",
              "Newton's account of the tides in Propositions 24, 36, and 37 was much heralded not only at the time, but still today.",
              "He is nevertheless receiving more credit for this than he is due.",
              "He did identify solar and lunar gravity as the forces driving the tides, but this is all he did.",
              "He ignored the rotation of the Earth, and worse he considered only the radial component of the solar and lunar gravitational forces in these three propositions.",
              "In fact, the radial component of these forces has a very small effect compared with the transradial component, that is, the component perpendicular to the radial component.",
              "All of this became clear in the 1770s when Laplace developed the mathematical theory of tidal motion from which all subsequent work has proceeded.",
              "Book 3 ends with a revolutionary analysis of comet trajectories that occupies roughly one-third of the total length of the Book in all three editions.",
              "This analysis was slow in coming.",
              "As late as June 1686, Newton wrote: \u201cthe third [book] wants the Theory of Comets\u201d [C, II, 437].",
              "What made the problem difficult, as compared to planet trajectories, was the need to work from a small number of imprecise one-shot observations made from a moving Earth.",
              "The method presented in the Principia fits a parabola iteratively to the observations, employing novel finite-difference methods that Newton later expanded into a full tract in mathematics, \u201cMethodis Differentialis.",
              "\u201d The method presupposes the theory of gravity first in opting for a parabola and second in assuming that the inverse-square centripetal forces known from the planets act on comets along their entire trajectory.",
              "The text notes that the trajectories may well be ellipses, but the period of return in that case would be the best way of determining the ellipse.",
              "(The parabola approximates the high-curvature end of ellipses with high eccentricity.)",
              "The proposal that comets may return was novel, but even more revolutionary at the time was the claim that they button-hook around the Sun, implying that what had sometimes in the past been taken for two distinct comets were really one comet before and after perihelion.",
              "In the first edition the method was applied only to the comet of 1680-81.",
              "The results are presented in a one-foot long diagram on the only fold-out page in the edition.",
              "Nothing like this diagram, shown in Figure 3, had ever appeared in print before.",
              "The diagram continued to appear in the next two editions, though in reduced form not requiring a fold-out in the third.",
              "In the second edition the method was refined and applied as well to the comets of 1664-65, 1683, and 1682 reflecting research Halley had carried out and published in his Astronomiae Cometicae Synopsis of 1705.",
              "The comet of 1682, now known as Halley's comet, was singled out as being sufficiently similar in trajectory to the comet of 1607 to warrant the proposal that it returns every 75 years.",
              "Figure 3 Added in the third edition was the retrograde comet of 1723, for which Bradley had supplied comparatively accurate observations and the method correspondingly displayed its most impressive success, with no discrepancies between the calculated and observed positions exceeding 1 minute of arc in either longitude or latitude.",
              "This suggested that the more exacting the observations entering into the calculation, the more accurate was the method.",
              "Because Newton's theory of comet trajectories depended only on that part of the theory of gravity that was least controversial \u2014 inverse-square centripetal accelerations everywhere around the Sun \u2014 it did not provoke much philosophical resistance.",
              "The success of the method provided evidence that these centripetal forces act equally on comets, contrary to Hooke's proposal in his Cometa of 1678 that comets must consist of a fundamentally different kind of material from the planets insofar as they do not respond to the forces directed toward the Sun in the same way.",
              "The success of the method also provided strong evidence that inverse-square forces toward the Sun hold throughout the space surrounding it, for not only do comets traverse the spaces between the planet orbits, but also their trajectories, in contrast to those of the then known planets, are often highly inclined with respect to the plane of the ecliptic.",
              "Most of all, however, the success of the method provided the most compelling evidence against not only Cartesian vortices, but all theories claiming that the planets are carried around the Sun by fluid vortices.",
              "Corollary 3 to Proposition 39 in all three editions summarizes the argument: This was the argument that convinced Huygens when he read the first edition, and it became all the more compelling thereafter as the method was so successful with further comets.",
              "[55] The added evidence supplied by the theory of comets highlights a sometimes overlooked aspect of Book 3.",
              "The development of evidence for the theory of gravity in it does not end with the \u201cdeduction\u201d of the law of universal gravity at the beginning, but continues all the way through the Book.",
              "During the eighteenth century attention focused overwhelmingly on the evidence supplied by Newton's theory of the figure of the Earth and the variation of surface gravity, the theory of the tides, the quantitative derivations of select lunar inequalities, the derivation of the precession of the equinoxes, and the theory of comets.",
              "This suggests that, both then and now, the \u201cdeduction\u201d of universal gravity should not be read in isolation from the rest of Book 3, but instead the entire Book should be seen as offering a sustained evidential argument for the theory.",
              "Read this way in the context of the rest of the Book, the \u201cdeduction\u201d is most appropriately viewed as intended to establish universal gravity, but only provisionally, as a theory on which further research is to be predicated, research that will continue to bring evidence to bear on the theory.",
              "From Halley's anonymous review of the first edition of the Principia forward, there has been a marked tendency to overstate what the Principia achieved, glossing over the many loose ends it left for others to recognize and address.",
              "A consequence of this is an equal tendency to distort the context of the enormous advances made in both mechanics and orbital astronomy during the eighteenth century, diminishing the difficulties those following Newton faced and their accomplishments in resolving them.",
              "The Principia is peculiar in this regard, for a list of its achievements without mentioning their loose ends overstates what it accomplished, but a list of its loose ends risks understating its extraordinary achievements.",
              "In an effort to strike a balance we here list eleven major scientific issues of the time to which Book 3 supplied answers in the sequence listed, the answers, and the most important loose ends in the reasoning offered in the evidential arguments for those answers.",
              "1.",
              "What physically retains the planets in orbits around the Sun and their satellites in orbit around them?",
              "Newton's answer \u2014 inverse-square gravity, one in kind with everyday terrestrial gravity \u2014 turned on a largely suppressed failure to account for more than half of the precession of the lunar orbit, it tacitly assumed interaction between the Sun and Jupiter and the other individual planets, and it raised unanswered questions about whether the perihelia of the planetary orbits do or do not precess.",
              "2.",
              "How does gravity vary, both below and above the surface of the Earth?",
              "In the absence of confirming data, Newton's answer \u2014 to a first approximation, linearly with distance to the center below the surface, and inversely with the square of the distance above it \u2014 presupposed uniform density in the first part and a spherical Earth with spherically symmetric density in the second, and therefore left open the possibility that gravity is constant near the surface of the Earth, just as Huygens continued to claim in his response to the Principia [HD, 153], citing supporting evidence.",
              "3.",
              "What are the relative densities of the planets, with respect to one another and to the Sun?",
              "Newton gives theory-dependent answers for Jupiter, Saturn, and the Earth in the corollaries to Proposition 8, but the one for the Earth, even in the third edition, depended on a still questionable value for the horizontal solar parallax (required to determine the distance of the Moon from the Earth in astronomical units), and no corroborating evidence for these answers had emerged, such as from the actions of Jupiter and Saturn on one another.",
              "4.",
              "Is there some principled way to resolve the dispute between the Copernican and Tychonic systems and thereby settle the question of the proper center to which all the motions in our planetary system should be referred?",
              "Newton's answer \u2014 the center of gravity of the system, about which the Sun circulates at comparatively small distances \u2014 depended on the assumed applicability of the third law of motion in claiming that the Sun is in motion, and the precise location of the center of gravity remained open in the absence of values for the relative masses of Mercury, Venus, and Mars.",
              "5.",
              "What are the true motions of the planets, and which, if any, of the schemes for calculating planet locations is to be preferred, Kepler's or one of the alternatives to it?",
              "Newton's answer was not simple: \u201cIf the sun were at rest and the remaining planets did not act upon one another, their orbits would be elliptical, having the sun in their common focus, and they would describe areas proportional to the times;",
              "\u201d and the aphelia and nodes would be stationary.",
              "The Keplerian system, amended in the manner of Horrocks to infer mean distances from the periods, is therefore the preferred approximation to the true motions.",
              "The main loose-end in this answer was whether the actual motions do deviate from the Keplerian ideal, and if so, whether all the deviations could be attributed to specific forces, gravitational or otherwise.",
              "A further loose-end, addressed in part in Book 3, was whether the non-Keplerian motion of the Moon can be shown not to be a counterexample to Newton's argument in the case of the planets.",
              "6.",
              "Is the motion of Jupiter and Saturn aberrant and, if so, what are the inequalities in it and what causes them?",
              "Newton answered yes, because they interact gravitationally, and the dominant inequality has a period corresponding to the 19 years between their consecutive conjunctions.",
              "(The second part of this answer did not appear in the first edition.)",
              "By the early 1720s it had become clear that the dominant period in the anomalies of motion of these two planets is not that of the time between conjunctions, but something of much longer duration, giving rise to the questions of what the vagaries actually are and whether they can truly be derived from Jupiter's and Saturn's gravitational forces.",
              "7.",
              "How, if at all, does the Earth's surface gravity vary with latitude, and how, if at all, does the Earth's figure differ from a sphere?",
              "Newton's answer changes from the first to the second to the third edition, but in all cases vagaries in the cited data raise the question of what the actual variations are.",
              "Also, because his idealized theoretical calculation assumes uniform density, his answer raises the questions whether the density of the Earth is uniform and whether the true figure of the Earth and variation of surface gravity can be reconciled with non-uniformities in density.",
              "8.",
              "What precisely is the motion of the Moon, and what gives rise to the inequalities in it, inequalities not observed in the motions of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn?",
              "Newton's answer to the second part is the perturbing effect of the Sun's gravity, leaving the answer to the first in the form of a promissory note: work out all the perturbations from solar gravity, and you will have the answer.",
              "The major open question was whether the complex motion of the line of apsides and the inequality known as the evection \u2014 the two features for which the Horrocksian cinematic model that Newton had employed in the Scholium to Book 3, Proposition 35 had resorted to an old-fashoined epicycle \u2014 can be derived from the action of solar gravity.",
              "9.",
              "What causes the tides, and why do they vary in time as well as from place to place in the way they do?",
              "Because Newton's answer \u2014 the gravitational action of the Sun and the Moon \u2014 was merely qualitative, it left room to question whether the Moon attracts the Earth and, if so, by how strong a force.",
              "Also left open was the question of how the inertia and viscosity of the seas and the rotation of the Earth affect the tides, a question requiring a dynamic analysis of the motions of the seas in response to solar and lunar gravity.",
              "10.",
              "What physically produces the precession of the equinoxes?",
              "Newton's derivation of the precession from the gravitational action of the Moon and Sun raised three unresolved questions: What are the correct values for the mass of the Moon and the oblateness of the Earth?",
              "Is the resulting motion of the Earth really analogous to that of the lunar nodes?",
              "How does the varying inclination of the Moon affect the calculated motion?",
              "11.",
              "What trajectories do comets describe?",
              "Newton's answer \u2014 conic-sections that can at least be approximated by parabolas in the region in which they are observable \u2014 gave weight to the question whether the parabolic trajectory works for all comets, and not just the comet of 1680-81 in the case of the first edition, the three others analyzed in the second, and the additional one in the third.",
              "The Principia also left open questions about how the gravity of Jupiter and Saturn might affect comet motions, whether any significance should be attached to the residual discrepancies between theory and observation in Newton's results, and which, if any, comets do return in some regular fashion.",
              "Careful reading of the Principia makes clear that, although unforthcoming about any of the loose ends, Newton was perfectly aware of them all, in one way or another flagging each for the benefit of the highly astute reader.",
              "An instructive way to present the history of eighteenth century research in the wake of the Principia is to trace how each of the loose ends became a prominent matter of concern and was then resolved, at least to the point of being removed as in any way a threat to Newton's theory of gravity.",
              "This process of addressing the loose ends in Book 3 did not get underway until the 1730s, after Newton had died.",
              "During his lifetime the most pressing complaint against the Principia was the absence of a mechanism to account for its action save for action at a distance, which Newton himself regarded as \u201cso great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.",
              "\u201d[56] The absence of a mechanism, however, was not something that Newton himself regarded as a loose-end in the Principia, for he insisted that all the conclusions listed above could be established, and any loose ends in them resolved, through the law of universal gravity alone, independently of the mechanism responsible for it.",
              "Over the decades after he died, those engaged in research predicated on his theory of gravity came increasingly to this same view of the question of mechanism.",
              "In two passages that remained word for word the same in all three editions Newton announced that the Principia was meant to illustrate a new approach to empirical inquiry.",
              "Neither the remark about deriving forces from phenomena of motion and then motions from these forces in the Preface to the first edition nor the remark about comparing a generic mathematical theory of centripetal forces with the phenomena in order to find out which conditions of force actually hold at the end of Book 1, Section 11, however, shed much light on just what this new approach is supposed to be.",
              "Other than these two passages, the only notable remark about methodology is the famous passage, quoted earlier, from the General Scholium added in the second edition as a final, parting statement: Much of the discussion of the methodology of the Principia in the philosophical literature, from the eighteenth century down to the present time, has taken this clearly polemical passage as the starting point, generating unfortunately more heat than light.",
              "[57] This is not the place to grapple with all the controversies surrounding this passage.",
              "Some guarded comments about the methodology of the Principia may nevertheless prove helpful.",
              "It is scarcely surprising that the unprecedented success of Newton's theory of gravity stimulated interest in the methodology of the Principia.",
              "The obvious thought was to emulate this success in other areas by following the same method.",
              "But then, even independently of questions about what the method was, one has to consider exactly how it contributed to the success.",
              "Viewed in retrospect, Book 2 makes clear that this question has no simple answer.",
              "If Newton followed the same method in Book 2, then the failure of his effort on resistance forces \u2014 even worse, the failure that he did not recognize \u2014 shows that the method was no guarantee of success.",
              "The empirical world must cooperate for it to succeed.",
              "Two aspects of the general thrust of the method are perfectly clear.",
              "First, Newton viewed it as contrasting with what was then called the method of hypotheses \u2014 that is, the method of putting forward hypotheses that reached far beyond the available data and then marshalling evidence for them by deducing testable conclusions from them.",
              "[58] Second, Newton viewed the method as requiring that questions be regarded as open when empirical considerations had not yet yielded answers to them.",
              "Whatever may have been required for empirical consideration to establish a theoretical conclusion, and whatever the status, provisional or otherwise, any such established conclusion was supposed to have, Newton viewed the method as allowing \u2014 even mandating \u2014 that theoretical answers to some questions could be established even while other closely related questions remained in abeyance.",
              "In particular, to use Newton's phrasing from the Scholium that ends Section 11, the physical species and physical proportions of forces could, in the appropriate sense, be established even though the question of their physical causes remained open.",
              "The clear aim of the method was accordingly to limit theoretical claims to \u201cinductive generalizations,\u201d as specified by the Rules of Reasoning, of conclusions dictated by experiment and observation.",
              "Newton's eschewing the method of hypotheses produced no controversy at the time.",
              "In a manuscript revision of his \u201cEssay on the causes of celestial motions\u201d Leibniz even adopted Newtonian phrasing: \u201cWhat follows is not based on hypotheses but is deduced from phenomena by the laws of motion\u201d [Aiton, 1972, 132].",
              "A large fraction of those who had read at most small portions of the Principia and depended on others for their knowledge of it most likely saw Newton as having hypothesized inverse-square attraction and hence as in fact following the method of hypotheses.",
              "In the years after Newton died, the most celebrated issues receiving concentrated research arose not from how Newton had arrived at universal gravity, but from the claims he had derived from it concerning the figure of the Earth, the vagaries in the motions of Jupiter and Saturn, and the motion of the Moon.",
              "The individuals at the center of this research certainly saw these issues as a test of Newton's theory of gravity, but the distinction between taking the theory as a hypothesis and taking it as a provisionally established conclusion was a distinction without much difference for them.",
              "Still, it is worth noting that the conclusion Clairaut first drew from the factor of 2 discrepancy in the motion of the lunar apogee was not that Newton's theory of gravity was false, but that the inverse-square needed to be supplemented by a 1/r4 term \u2014 a response fully in keeping with Newton's fourth rule of reasoning.",
              "The aspect of Newton's method that did produce controversy at the time was his insisting that he had established conclusions about the physical species and physical proportions of celestial forces while holding questions about their physical causes in abeyance.",
              "This was the core of the complaint by Cartesians that the Principia was a work of mathematics, not physics.",
              "For Newton's two most important critics, however, Huygens and Leibniz, the objection was not to holding the question of physical causes open, but to accepting certain conclusions that in their mind ruled out the very possibility of a proper answer to the question of physical cause.",
              "The defect in Newton's method lay in its not imposing the constraint on theory that all action be through contact, and not at a distance.",
              "The violation of this constraint lay behind Huygens's remarking, This, then, was the truly controversial aspect of Newton's method in the Principia with which the next generation had to come to some accommodation before research on its loose ends could become respectable.",
              "[59] The idea of developing a mathematical theory in order to enable experiment and observation to provide theory-mediated answers to questions did not originate with the Principia.",
              "In his Horologium Oscillatorium, the work the Principia most emulates, Huygens had developed a mathematical theory of pendulum motion that enabled measurement of the length and period of pendulums to provide a robust precise answer to the question, how far does an object fall in the absence of air resistance in the first second?",
              "\u2014 the measure then of the strength of surface gravity;",
              "and he had developed a mathematical theory of uniform circular motion that enabled measurement of the height and period of conical pendulums to provide a second answer to this question.",
              "By the time Newton started on the Principia pendulums had been used for more than a decade to answer questions about how surface gravity varies between Paris and other locations.",
              "The special problem Newton saw himself as having to face in using mathematical theory to a comparable end in the Principia stemmed from his realization, expressed in the \u201cCopernican scholium,\u201d that the phenomena of orbital motions are inordinately complicated and hence open to multiple competing descriptions.",
              "The problem thus became one of finding a way to use mathematical theory to draw definite robust answers to questions about the physical species and proportions of forces from these phenomena.",
              "These answers opened the way to pursing the true motions in a sequence of successive approximations, in the process of which continuing evidence could be brought to bear on the theory, potentially delimiting its exactness and its universal applicability in the manner Newton had noted in his fourth rule of reasoning.",
              "Because the \u201cCopernican scholium\u201d was unknown at the time, the subtleties of the new method Newton followed to get around this problem went largely unnoticed.",
              "Needless to say, these comments do not answer the philosophically most interesting question of how the method of the Principia contributed to the unprecedented success of its theory of gravity.",
              "Hopefully, however, they do remove some sources of confusion that have distorted so much of the philosophical discussion of the Principia.",

              "No work of science has drawn more attention from philosophers than Newton's Principia.",
              "The reasons for this, however, and consequently the focus of the attention have changed significantly from one century to the next.",
              "During the 20th Century philosophers have viewed the Principia in the context of Einstein's new theory of gravity in his theory of general relativity.",
              "The main issues have concerned the relation between Newton's and Einstein's theories of gravity and what the need to replace the former with the latter says about the nature, scope, and limits of scientific knowledge.",
              "During most of the 18th Century, by contrast, Newton's theory of gravity remained under dispute, especially because of the absence of a mechanism \u2014 in particular, a contact mechanism \u2014 producing gravitational forces.",
              "The philosophic literature correspondingly endeavored to clarify and to resolve, one way or the other, the dispute over whether the Principia should or should not be viewed as methodologically well founded.",
              "By the 1790s Newton's theory of gravity had become established among those engaged in research in orbital mechanics and physical geodesy, leading to the Principia becoming the exemplar of science at its most successful.",
              "Philosophic interest in the Principia during the 19th Century therefore came to focus on how Newton had achieved this success, in part to characterize the knowledge that had been achieved and in part to pursue comparable knowledge in other areas of research.",
              "Unfortunately, a very large fraction of the philosophic literature in all three centuries has suffered from a quite simplistic picture of the Principia itself.",
              "The main goal of this entry is to replace that simplistic picture with one that does more justice to the richness of both the content and the methodology of the Principia.",
              "Viewed retrospectively, no work was more seminal in the development of modern physics and astronomy than Newton's Principia.",
              "Its conclusion that the force retaining the planets in their orbits is one in kind with terrestrial gravity ended forever the view dating back at least to Aristotle that the celestial realm calls for one science and the sublunar realm, another.",
              "Just as the Preface to its first edition had proposed, the ultimate success of Newton's theory of gravity made the identification of the fundamental forces of nature and their characterization in laws the primary pursuit of physics.",
              "The success of the theory led as well to a new conception of exact science under which every systematic discrepancy between observation and theory, no matter how small, is taken as telling us something important about the world.",
              "And, once it became clear that the theory of gravity provided a far more effective means than observation for precisely characterizing complex orbital motions \u2014 just as Newton had proposed in the Principia in the case of the orbit of the Moon \u2014 physical theory gained primacy over observation for purposes of answering specific questions about the world.",
              "The retrospective view of the Principia has been different in the aftermath of Einstein's special and general theories of relativity from what it was throughout the nineteenth century.",
              "Newtonian theory is now seen to hold only to high approximation in limited circumstances in much the way that Galileo's and Huygens's results for motion under uniform gravity came to be seen as holding only to high approximation in the aftermath of Newtonian inverse-square gravity.",
              "In the middle of the nineteenth century, however, when there was no reason to think that any confuting discrepancy between Newtonian theory and observation was ever going to emerge, the Principia was viewed as the exemplar of perfection in empirical science in much the way that Euclid's Elements had been viewed as the exemplar of perfection in mathematics at the beginning of the seventeenth century.",
              "Because of the extent to which Einsteinian theory was grounded historically on Newtonian science, the Principia has retained its unique seminal position in the history of physics in our post-Newtonian era.",
              "Perhaps more strikingly, because of the logical relationship between Newtonian and Einsteinian theory \u2014 Einstein showed that Newtonian gravity holds as a limit-case of general relativity in just the way Newton showed (in Book 1, Section 10) that Galilean uniform gravity holds as a limit-case of inverse-square gravity \u2014 even though the Principia can no longer be regarded as an exemplar of perfection, it is still widely regarded by physicists as an exemplar of empirical science at its best.",
              "In spite of extravagant claims made about the Principia by some in the years after it first appeared \u2014 \u201c.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "he seems to have exhausted his Argument, and left little to be done by those that shall succeed him\u201d[1] \u2014 the most positive view of it that anyone could have substantiated during the first half of the eighteenth century would have emphasized its promise more than its achievements.",
              "The theory of gravity had too many loose ends, the most glaring of which was a factor of 2 discrepancy in the mean motion of the lunar apogee, a discrepancy that undercut the claim that the Moon is held in orbit by an inverse-square force.",
              "No one knew these loose ends better than Newton himself, yet no one had a greater sense of the potential of the theory of gravity to resolve a whole host of questions in planetary astronomy \u2014 which may well explain why he made these loose ends difficult to see except by the most technically skilled, careful readers.",
              "Between the late 1730s and the early 1750s the situation changed dramatically when several of the loose ends were tied up, in some cases yielding such extraordinary results as the first truly successful descriptive account of the motion of the Moon in the history of astronomy.",
              "During the second half of the eighteenth century the promise of the Principia was not only universally recognized by those active in empirical research, but a large fraction of this promise was realized.",
              "What we now call \u201cNewtonian mechanics\u201d emerged in this process, as did the gravity-based accounts of the often substantial divergences of the planets from Keplerian motion, the achievement of Newton's theory of gravity that ultimately ended all opposition to it.",
              "During the eighteenth century the Principia was also seen as putting forward a world view directly in opposition to the broadly Cartesian world view that in many circles had taken over from the Scholastic world view during the second half of the seventeenth century.",
              "Newton clearly intended the work to be viewed in this way when in 1686 he changed its title to Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in allusion to Descartes's most prominent work at the time, Principia Philosophiae.",
              "(The title page of Newton's first edition underscored this allusion by placing the first and third words of the title in larger type.)",
              "The main difference in the world view in Newton's Principia was to rid the celestial spaces of vortices carrying the planets.",
              "Newtonians subsequently went beyond Newton in enhancing this world view in various ways, including forces everywhere expressly acting at a distance.",
              "The \u201cclockwork universe\u201d aspect of the Newtonian world view, for example, is not to be found in the Principia;",
              "it was added by Laplace late in the eighteenth century, after the success of the theory of gravity in accounting for complex deviations from Keplerian motion became fully evident.",
              "In addition to viewing the theory of gravity as potentially transforming orbital astronomy, Newton saw the Principia as illustrating a new way of doing natural philosophy.",
              "One aspect of this new way, announced in the Preface to the first edition, was the focus on forces: A second aspect of the new method concerns the use of mathematical theory not to derive testable conclusions from hypotheses, as Galileo and Huygens had done, but to cover a full range of alternative theoretical possibilities, enabling the empirical world then to select among them.",
              "This new approach is spelled out most forcefully at the end of Book 1, Section 11: A third aspect of the new method, which proved most controversial at the time, was the willingness to hold questions about the mechanism through which forces effect their changes in motion in abeyance, even when the mathematical theory of the species and proportions of the forces seemed to leave no alternative but action at a distance.",
              "This aspect remained somewhat tacit in the first edition, but then, in response to criticisms it received, was made polemically explicit in the General Scholium added at the end of the second edition: During most of the eighteenth century the primary challenge the Principia presented to philosophers revolved around what to make of a mathematical theory of forces in the absence of a mechanism, other than action at a distance, through which these forces work.",
              "By the last decades of the century, however, little room remained for questioning whether gravity does act according to the laws that Newton had set forth and does suffice for all the motions of the heavenly bodies and of our sea.",
              "No one could deny that a science had emerged that, at least in certain respects, so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally.",
              "The challenge to philosophers then became one of spelling out first the precise nature and limits of the knowledge attained in this science and then how, methodologically, this extraordinary advance had been achieved, with a view to enabling other areas of inquiry to follow suit.",
              "The view is commonplace that what Newton did was to put forward his theory of gravity to explain Kepler's already established \u201claws\u201d of orbital motion;",
              "and the universality of the law of gravity then ended up explaining the deviations from Keplerian motion by attributing them to gravitational interaction of the planets.",
              "This is wrong on several counts, the most immediate of which is that Kepler's \u201claws\u201d were by no means established before the Principia.",
              "The rules for calculating orbital motion that Kepler put forward in the first two decades of the seventeenth century had indeed achieved a spectacular gain in accuracy over anything that had come before.",
              "Kepler's rules, however, did not yield comparable accuracy for the motion of the Moon, and even in the case of the planets the calculated locations were sometimes off by as much as a fourth of the width of the Moon.",
              "More importantly, by 1680 several other approaches to calculating the orbits had been put forward that achieved the same level of not quite adequate accuracy as Kepler's.",
              "In particular, Newton was familiar with seven different approaches to calculating planetary orbits, all at roughly the same accuracy.",
              "Only two of these, Kepler's and Jeremiah Horrocks's, used Kepler's area rule \u2014 planets sweep out equal areas in equal times with respect to the Sun \u2014 to locate planets along their trajectories.",
              "Ismae\u0308l Boulliau and, following him, Thomas Streete (from whose Astronomia Carolina Newton first learned orbital astronomy) replaced the area rule with a geometric construction.",
              "Vincent Wing had adopted still another geometric construction in the late 1660s after having earlier used a point of equal angular motion oscillating about the empty focus of the ellipse;",
              "and Nicolaus Mercator in 1676 added still a further geometric construction.",
              "[4] Of these six alternative approaches, only Horrocks and, following him, Streete, took Kepler's 3/2 power rule \u2014 the periods of the planets vary as the square root of the cube of their mean distances from the Sun \u2014 seriously enough to use the periods rather than positional observations to determine their mean distances.",
              "[5] All these approaches followed Kepler in using an ellipse to represent the trajectory.",
              "(The primary historical reason for this was Kepler's success in predicting the 1631 transit of Mercury across the Sun.)",
              "This, however, does not mean that the ellipse was established as anything more than a mathematically tractable close approximation to the true orbit.",
              "In fact, the planetary orbits known then are not all that elliptical.",
              "The minor axis of Mercury is only 2 percent shorter than the major axis, the minor axis of Mars, only 0.",
              "4 percent shorter, and in all other cases the difference between an ellipse and an eccentric circle was beyond detection.",
              "Newton had real grounds for claiming in a letter to Halley in June 1686 a \u201cright\u201d to the ellipse, remarking that \u201cKepler knew the Orb to be not circular but oval, and guest it to be Elliptical\u201d [C, II, 436].",
              "Entirely independently, the most judicious reader of the first edition of the Principia, Christiaan Huygens, wrote the following summary of the Principia\u2018s achievement in his notebook upon reading the complimentary copy Newton had sent him: So, all three of Kepler's rules that came to be called \u201claws\u201d after the Principia were known to be nothing more than holding to high approximation when Newton started on the project in 1684.",
              "And the leading issue in orbital astronomy at the time was not why Kepler's rules hold, but rather which, if any, of the comparably accurate different approaches to calculating orbits was to be preferred.",
              "The distinct possibility of the ellipse being only an approximation to the true trajectory explains the appropriateness of the question Hooke put to Newton in 1679 and Halley put to him again in 1684 \u2014 what trajectory does a body describe when moving under an inverse-square force directed toward a central body?",
              "The inverse-square part of this question came from combining the mathematical theory of uniform circular motion, which Huygens had published in his Horologium Oscillatorium of 1673, with Kepler's 3/2 power rule: the force in a string retaining a body in a uniform circular orbit varies directly as the radius of the circle and inversely as the square of the period;",
              "but the squares of the periods of the planets vary as the cubes of their mean distances;",
              "and hence, at least to a first approximation, the forces retaining the planets in their orbits vary inversely with the square of the radii of their nearly circular orbits.",
              "But now allow the distance of the orbiting body from the center to vary rather than remaining constant, as in a circle.",
              "What trajectory would result if the force toward the center varies as the inverse-square of the distance from the center toward which the force is always directed?",
              "The answer in the nine page tract \u201cDe Motu Corporum in Gyrum\u201d that Newton sent to Halley in November 1684 is, an ellipse, provided the velocity is not too high (and if it is, then instead a parabola or a hyperbola, depending on the velocity).",
              "The key step in developing this answer is a generalization of uniform circular motion to the case of motion under a \u201ccentripetal\u201d force \u2014 a term Newton coined from Huygens's \u201ccentrifugal\u201d force, by which he meant the tension in the string keeping the body in a circle;",
              "and a key to this step was the discovery that a body moving under any form of centripetal force always sweeps out equal areas in equal times with respect to that center, so that the appropriate geometrical representation of time for generalizing uniform circular motion is area swept out rather than angle or arc length.",
              "The tract also confirms that Kepler's 3/2 power rule continues to hold for bodies orbiting in confocal ellipses governed by inverse-square centripetal forces.",
              "These were remarkable steps forward at the time, but they and the questions behind them form only an initial part of the context in which Newton went on to write the Principia.",
              "Shortly after the \u201cDe Motu\u201d tract went off to London, Newton revised the tract and added two further passages.",
              "The question precipitating this revision appears to have been about the effect the inverse-square centripetal forces directed toward Jupiter, as implied by its satellites, have on the Sun.",
              "Newton first added two principles that he first called \u201chypotheses\u201d and then changed to \u201claws\u201d: Law 3: The relative motions of bodies enclosed in a given space are the same whether that space is at rest or moves perpetually and uniformly in a straight line without circular motion.",
              "Law 4: The common center of gravity does not alter its state of motion or rest through the mutual actions of bodies.",
              "[U, 267] The second of the two added passages concerns motion in resisting media;",
              "it provides a context in which to read Book 2 of the Principia.",
              "The first added passage, which has become known as the \u201cCopernican scholium,\u201d we here quote in full because it, better than anything else, explains what led Newton into the further research that turned the nine-page tract into the five hundred page Principia.",
              "It occurs as a single long paragraph, but is here broken into three segments in order to facilitate commenting on it: Moreover, the whole space of the planetary heavens is either at rest (as is commonly believed) or uniformly moved in a straight line, and similarly the common centre of gravity of the planets (by Law 4) is either at rest or is moved at the same time.",
              "In either case the motions of the planets among themselves (by Law 3) take place in the same manner and their common centre of gravity is at rest with respect to the whole space, and so it ought to be considered the immobile center of the whole planetary system.",
              "Thence indeed the Copernican system is proved a priori.",
              "For if a common centre of gravity is computed for any position of the planets, this either lies in the body of the Sun or will always be very near it.",
              "By reason of this deviation of the Sun from the center of gravity the centripetal force does not always tend to that immobile center, and hence the planets neither move exactly in ellipses nor revolve twice in the same orbit.",
              "Each time a planet revolves it traces a fresh orbit, as happens also with the motion of the Moon, and each orbit depends upon the combined motions of all the planets, not to mention their actions upon each other.",
              "Unless I am much mistaken, it would exceed the force of human wit to consider so many causes of motion at the same time, and to define the motions by exact laws which would allow of an easy calculation.",
              "Leaving aside these fine points, the simple orbit that is the mean between all vagaries will be the ellipse that I have discussed already.",
              "If any one shall attempt to determine this ellipse by trigonometrical computation from three observations (as is usual) he will be proceeding without due caution.",
              "For these observations will share in the very small irregular motions here neglected and so cause the ellipse to deviate somewhat from its actual magnitude and position (which ought to be the mean among all errors), and so there will be as many ellipses differing from each other as there are trios of observations employed.",
              "Very many observations must therefore be joined together and assigned to a single operation which mutually moderate each other and display the mean ellipse both as regards position and magnitude.",
              "[U, 280] The first segment highlights a further component of the historical context in which the Principia was written and read.",
              "Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus in 1613 had provided decisive evidence against the Ptolemaic system,[6] but it could not provide grounds favoring the Copernican over the Tychonic system.",
              "In the latter, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn circumnavigate the Sun, and the Sun circumnavigates the Earth, with the consequence that these seven bodies are at all times in the same position in relation to one another as they are in the Copernican system.",
              "Whether any decisive empirical grounds could be found favoring the Copernican over the Tychonic system became one of the most celebrated issues of the seventeenth century.",
              "Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes all published major books in the first half of the century purporting to resolve this issue,[7] Kepler and Descartes basing their arguments on the physical mechanism each had proposed as governing the orbital motion.",
              "Nevertheless, the leading observational astronomer of the second half of the century, G.",
              "D.",
              "Cassini, was a Tychonist.",
              "In the first segment of the \u201cCopernican Scholium\u201d Newton identifies the center of gravity of the planetary system as the appropriate point to which all the motion should be referred \u2014 the technical issue behind the issue over the two systems \u2014 and then announces that the centripetal forces identified in the text of \u201cDe Motu\u201d as governing the orbital motion open the way to establishing a slightly qualified form of the Copernican system.",
              "[8] Newton's discovery of this line of reasoning was surely a major factor urging him on to the Principia.",
              "The second segment of the \u201cCopernican Scholium\u201d addresses an issue in orbital astronomy that forms a still further component in the historical context of the Principia.",
              "Separate from the question whether Kepler's or some other approach was to be preferred was the question whether the true motions are significantly more irregular and complicated than the calculated motions in any of these approaches.",
              "The complexity of the lunar orbit and the continuing failure to describe it within the accuracy Kepler had achieved for the planets was one consideration lying behind this question.",
              "Another came from Kepler's own finding, noted in the Preface to his Rudolphine Tables[9] and subsequently supported by others, that the true motions may involve further vagaries, as evidenced by apparent changes in the values of orbital elements over time.",
              "The most important consideration behind this question, however, came from Descartes' claim that, in keeping with the changing motions of his vortices over long periods of time, the orbits are not mathematically perfect and \u201cthey are continuously changed by the passing of the ages\u201d [D, 3, 34].",
              "In the second segment of the quoted Scholium, Newton concludes that, in contrast to the ellipse that answered the mathematical question put to him by Hooke and Halley, the true orbits are not ellipses, but are indeed indefinitely complex.",
              "This conclusion is nowhere so forcefully stated in the published Principia, but knowledgeable readers nonetheless saw the work as answering the question whether the true motions are mathematically perfect in the negative.",
              "Finally, the second and third segments together not only point out that Keplerian motion is only an approximation to the true motions, but they call attention to the potential pitfalls in using the orbits published by Kepler and others as evidence for claims about the planetary system.",
              "For example, if the true motions are so complicated, then it is not surprising that all the different calculational approaches were achieving comparable accuracy, for all of them at best hold only approximately.",
              "Equally, the success in calculating the orbits could not serve as a basis to argue against Cartesian vortices, for the irregularities entailed by them could not simply be dismissed.",
              "The spectre raised was the very one Newton had objected to during the controversy over his earlier light and color papers: too many hypotheses could be made to fit the same data.",
              "[10] Worse, the multiplicity of tenable hypotheses was a spectre haunting mathematical astronomy as a discipline from the end of the sixteenth century forward.",
              "[11] So, the conclusion that calculated orbits can at most be mere approximations would have been seen as raising the possibility that truth and exactness were beyond the reach of mathematical astronomy.",
              "The main reason why the Principia includes so much beyond the \u201cDe Motu\u201d tract is Newton's endeavor to reach conclusions that had claim to being exact and true in spite of the inordinate complexities of the actual motions.",
              "The historical context in which Newton wrote the Principia involved a set of issues that readers of the first edition saw it as addressing: Was Kepler's approach to calculating the orbits, or some other, to be preferred?",
              "Was there some empirical basis for resolving the issue of the Copernican versus the Tychonic system?",
              "Were the true motions complicated and irregular versus the calculated motions?",
              "Can mathematical astronomy be an exact science?",
              "No reader of the Principia at the time had the benefit of seeing how Newton had these questions tied together in the \u201cCopernican Scholium\u201d because it did not appear in print until two hundred years later.",
              "[12] Nothing, however, brings out more clearly the extent to which the expanded scope of the Principia stemmed from Newton's preoccupation with the problem of reaching conclusions that had claim to being exact from evidence that, by his reckoning, held at best to high approximation.",
              "This is why the \u201cCopernican scholium\u201d provides the most illuminating context for reading the Principia.",
              "Equally, its being unknown for so long helps to explain why the Principia has generally been read so simplistically.",
              "Newton originally planned a two-book work, with the first book consisting of propositions mathematically derived from the laws of motion, including a handful concerning motion under resistance forces, and the second book, written and even formatted in the manner of Descartes's Principia, applying these propositions to lay out the system of the world.",
              "By the middle of 1686 Newton had switched to a three-book structure, with the second book devoted to motion in resisting media.",
              "What appears to have convinced him that this topic required a separate book was the promise of pendulum-decay experiments to allow him to measure the variation of resistance forces with velocity.",
              "[14] When Hooke raised a priority issue on inverse-square forces, Newton dropped the original version of the last book, switching to presenting the system of the world in a sequence of mathematically argued propositions, many of which demand far more of the reader than anything in the original version.",

              "Newton was disappointed in the critical response to the first edition.",
              "The response in England was adulatory, but the failure to note loose ends must have led Newton to doubt how much anyone had mastered technical details.",

              "On the one hand, he was convinced by Newton's argument that inverse-square terrestrial gravity not only extends to the Moon, but is one in kind with the centripetal force holding the planets in orbit;",
              "on the other hand, Others on the Continent pressed this complaint even more forcefully.",

              "He will give it when he substitutes true motions for those that he has supposed.",
              "[15] Complicating the matter further was the publication in 1689 of Leibniz's \u201cEssay on the causes of celestial motions,\u201d which offered a vortex theory in which \u201ca planet moves with a double motion composed of the harmonic circulation of its fluid deferent orb, and the paracentric motion, as if it had a certain gravity of attraction, namely an impulsion towards the Sun\u201d [L, 132].",
              "[16] Leibniz further concluded that when the body \u201cis carried in an ellipse (or another conic section) with a harmonic circulation, and the centre both of attraction and of circulation is at the focus of the ellipse, then the attractions or solicitations of gravity will be directly as the squares of the circulations, or inversely as the squares of the radii or distances from the focus\u201d [L, 137].",
              "So, within a year and a half of the publication of the Principia a competing vortex theory of Keplerian motion had appeared that was consistent with Newton's conclusion that the centripetal forces in Keplerian motion are inverse-square.",

              "First, the structure of the argument for universal gravity at the beginning of Book 3 was made more evident, and the word \u2018hypothesis\u2019 was dropped from it.",
              "Second, because of disappointment with pendulum-decay experiments and an erroneous claim about the rate a liquid flows vertically through a hole in the bottom of a container, the second half of Section 7 of Book 2 was entirely replaced, ending with new vertical-fall experiments to measure resistance forces versus velocity and a forcefully stated rejection of all vortex theories.",
              "[17] Third, the treatment of the variation of surface gravity with latitude (Book 3, Proposition 20) was significantly extended, partly in response to Huygens's alternative treatment of this variation, but also because of more recent data from near the Equator.",
              "Fourth, the treatment of the wobble of the Earth producing the precession of the equinoxes was revised in order to accommodate a much reduced gravitational force of the Moon on the Earth than in the first edition.",
              "Fifth, several further examples of comets were added at the end of Book 3, taking advantage of Halley's efforts on the topic during the intervening years.",
              "In addition to these, two changes were made that were more polemical than substantive: Newton added the General Scholium following Book 3 in the second edition, and his editor Roger Cotes provided a long anti-Cartesian (and anti-Leibnizian) Preface.",
              "The third edition appeared in 1726, thirty nine years after the first.",
              "Most changes in it involved either refinements or new data.",
              "The most significant revision of substance was to the variation of surface gravity with latitude, where Newton now concluded that the data showed that the Earth has a uniform density.",
              "Subsequent editions and translations have been based on the third edition.",
              "Of particular note is the edition published by two Jesuits, Le Seur and Jacquier, in 1739-42, for it contains proposition-by-proposition commentary, much of it employing the Leibnizian calculus, that extends to roughly the same length as Newton's text.",
              "The Principia opens with a section called \u201cDefinitions\u201d that includes Newton's discussion of absolute space, time, and motion.",
              "No part of the Principia has received more discussion by philosophers over the three centuries since it was published.",
              "Unfortunately, however, a tendency not to pay close attention to the text has caused much of this discussion to produce unnecessary confusion.",
              "[18] The definitions inform the reader of how key technical terms, all of them designating quantities, are going to be used throughout the Principia.",
              "In the process Newton introduces terms that have remained a part of physics ever since, such as mass, inertia, and centripetal force.",
              "The emphasis in every one of the definitions is on how the designated quantity is to be measured, as illustrated by the opening definition: \u201cQuantity of matter [or mass] is a measure of matter that arises from its density and volume jointly.",
              "\u201d (Because a primary measure of density was then specific gravity, no circularity arises here.)",

              "It is important to recognize that, in calling the referents of the defined terms \u201cquantities,\u201d Newton is assigning them to the ontological category of quantity in Aristotle's sense.",
              "Thus force and motion are quantities that have direction as well as magnitude, and it makes no sense to talk of forces as individuated entities or substances.",
              "Newton's laws of motion and the propositions derived from them involve relations among quantities, not among objects.",
              "In place of \u201cno entity without identity,\u201d we have \u201cno quantity without definite proportions;",
              "\u201d[19] and the demand on measurement is to supply values that unequivocally yield an adequate approximation to these definite proportions.",
              "Immediately following the eight definitions is a Scholium on space, time, and motion.",
              "One source of confusion in the literature on this scholium is not paying attention to the primary distinction Newton is drawing, which is between \u201cabsolute, true, mathematical\u201d motion versus \u201crelative, apparent, common\u201d motion.",
              "The naive distinction between true and apparent motion was, of course, entirely commonplace.",
              "Moreover, Newton is scarcely introducing it into astronomy.",
              "Ptolemy's principal innovation in orbital astronomy \u2014 the so-called bi-section of eccentricity \u2014 entailed that half of the observed first inequality in the motion of the planets arises from a true variation in speed, and half from an only apparent variation associated with the observer being off center.",
              "Similarly, Copernicus's main point was that the second inequality \u2014 that is, the observed retrograde motions of the planets \u2014 involved not true, but only apparent motions.",
              "And the subsequent issue between the Copernican and Tychonic system concerned whether the observed annual motion of the Sun through the zodiac is a true or only an apparent motion of the Sun.",
              "So, what Newton is doing in the scholium on space and time is not to introduce a new distinction, but to explicate with more care a distinction that had been fundamental to astronomy for centuries.",
              "The distinctions between \u201cabsolute, true, and mathematical\u201d and \u201crelative, apparent, and common\u201d time and space are the conceptual basis Newton employs in laying out the corresponding distinction for motion.",
              "He says, \u201crelative, apparent, and common time is any sensible and external measure (precise or imprecise) of duration by motion,\u201d adding a parallel point about absolute space.",
              "He points out that the distinction between absolute and relative time has long been part of astronomy insofar as astronomers have long introduced corrections (via the equation of time) to the natural day \u201cin order to measure celestial motions on the basis of a truer time,\u201d and he raises the possibility of there being \u201cno uniform motion by which time may have an exact measure.",

              "\u201cBut since these parts of space cannot be seen and cannot be distinguished from one another by our senses, we use sensible measures in their stead,\u201d adding \u201cit is possible that there is no body truly at rest to which places and motions may be referred\u201d [P, 410].",
              "In short, both absolute time and absolute location are quantities that cannot themselves be observed, but instead have to be inferred from measures of relative time and location, and these measures are always only provisional;",
              "that is, they are always open to the possibility of being replaced by some new (still relative) measure that is deemed to be better behaved across a variety of phenomena in parallel with the way in which sidereal time was deemed to be preferable to solar time.",
              "Notice here the expressed concern with measuring absolute, true, mathematical time, space, and motion, all of which are identified at the beginning of the scholium as quantities.",
              "The scholium that follows the eight definitions thus continues their concern with measures that will enable values to be assigned to the quantities in question.",
              "Newton expressly acknowledges that these measures are what we would now call theory-mediated and provisional.",
              "Measurement is at the very heart of the Principia.",
              "It pervades the definitions and scholium on space and time precisely because the primary point of this section is to spell out (in Howard Stein's words) \u201cthe empirical content of a set of theoretical notions\u201d [Stein, 1967, 281].",
              "Accordingly, while Newton's distinctions between absolute and relative time and space provide a conceptual basis for his explicating his distinction between absolute and relative motion, absolute time and space cannot enter directly into empirical reasoning insofar as they are not themselves empirically accessible.",
              "In other words, the Principia presupposes absolute time and space for purposes of conceptualizing the aim of measurement, but the measurements themselves are always of relative time and space, and the preferred measures are those deemed to be providing the best approximations to the absolute quantities.",
              "Newton never presupposes absolute time and space in his empirical reasoning.",
              "Motion in the planetary system is referred to the fixed stars, which are provisionally being taken as an appropriate reference for measurement, and sidereal time is provisionally taken as the preferred approximation to absolute time.",
              "Moreover, in the corollaries to the laws of motion Newton specifically renounces the need to worry about absolute versus relative motion in two cases: Corollary 5.",
              "When bodies are enclosed in a given space, their motions in relation to one another are the same whether the space is at rest or whether it is moving uniformly straight forward without circular motion.",
              "Corollary 6.",
              "If bodies are moving in any way whatsoever with respect to one another and are urged by equal accelerative forces along parallel lines, they will all continue to move with respect to one another in the same way as they would if they were not acted on by those forces.",
              "So, while the Principia presupposes absolute time and space for purposes of conceptualizing absolute motion, the presuppositions underlying all the empirical reasoning about actual motions are philosophically more modest.",
              "If absolute time and space cannot serve to distinguish absolute from relative motions \u2014 more precisely, absolute from relative changes of motion \u2014 empirically, then what can?",
              "Newton answers, \u201cThe causes which distinguish true motions from relative motions are the forces impressed upon bodies to generate motion.",
              "True motion is neither generated nor changed except by forces impressed upon the moving body itself.",
              "\u201d The problem then becomes one of distinguishing the forces impressed on bodies, where forces are quantities;",
              "and hence the key issue is whether there are theory-mediated measures of them that yield unequivocal values \u2014 in contrast to different measures of the same force that yield different values, the hallmark of relative motion.",
              "The famous bucket example that follows is offered as illustrating how forces can be distinguished that will then distinguish between true and apparent motion.",
              "The final paragraph of the scholium begins and ends as follows: What does follow are two books of propositions that provide means for inferring forces from motions and motions from forces and a final book that illustrates how these propositions can be applied to the system of the world first to identify the forces governing motion in our planetary system and then to use them to differentiate between certain true and apparent motions of particular interest.",
              "In this respect, the empirical content of the theoretical concepts that Newton has explicated in the section called \u201cDefinitions\u201d is inextricably linked with the physical theory presented in the rest of the Principia.",
              "The contention that the empirical reasoning in the Principia does not presuppose an unbridled form of absolute time and space should not be taken as suggesting that Newton's theory is free of fundamental assumptions about time and space that have subsequently proved to be problematic.",
              "For example, in the case of space, Newton presupposes that the geometric structure governing which lines are parallel and what the distances are between two points is three-dimensional and Euclidean.",
              "In the case of time Newton presupposes that, with suitable corrections for such factors as the speed of light, questions about whether two celestial events happened at the same time can in principle always have a definite answer.",
              "And the appeal to forces to distinguish real from apparent non-inertial motions presupposes that free-fall under gravity can always, at least in principle, be distinguished from inertial motion.",
              "[20] Equally, the contention that the empirical reasoning in the Principia does not presuppose an unbridled form of absolute space should not be taken as denying that Newton invoked absolute space as his means for conceptualizing true deviations from inertial motion.",
              "Corollary 5 to the Laws of Motion, quoted above, put him in a position to introduce the notion of an inertial frame, but he did not do so, perhaps in part because Corollary 6 showed that even using an inertial frame to define deviations from inertial motion would not suffice.",
              "Empirically, nevertheless, the Principia follows astronomical practice in treating celestial motions relative to the fixed stars, and one of its key empirical conclusions (Book 3, Prop.",
              "14, Corol.",
              "1) is that the fixed stars are at rest with respect to the center of gravity of our planetary system.",
              "The designation \u201claws of motion\u201d had been used in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in the late 1660s for principles governing motion under impact put forward by Christopher Wren, John Wallis, and Christiaan Huygens.",
              "Only the first of the three laws Newton gives in the Principia corresponds to any of these principles, and even the statement of it is distinctly different: Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed.",
              "This general principle, which following the lead of Newton came to be called the principle or law of inertia, had been in print since Pierre Gassendi's De motu impresso a motore translato of 1641.",
              "Newton probably first encountered it in print when he read Descartes' Principia, where it is comprised by his first two \u201claws of nature\u201d and is used immediately to assert \u201cthat any body which is moving in a circle constantly tends to move away from the center of the circle which it is describing.",
              "\u201d This is the basis for Descartes concluding that some form of unseen matter (namely the vortices) must be in contact with the planets, for otherwise they would go off in a straight line.",
              "It is the first of the three hypotheses from which Huygens develops his theory of \u201cfalling heavy bodies and their motion in a cycloid\u201d in his Horologium Oscillatorium of 1673: If there were no gravity, and if the air did not impede the motion of bodies, then any body will continue its given motion with uniform velocity in a straight line.",
              "Newton had adopted it as a \u201chypothesis\u201d in the registered version of \u201cDe Motu,\u201d though stated without reference to impressed forces: Every body under the sole action of its innate force moves uniformly in a straight line indefinitely unless something extraneous hinders it.",
              "The striking difference in the formulation in the Principia versus the one in \u201cDe Motu\u201d \u2014 and, for that matter, versus all earlier formulations in print \u2014 is the reference to impressed forces.",
              "In all earlier formulations, any departure from uniform motion in a straight line implied the existence of a material impediment to the motion;",
              "in the more abstract formulation in the Principia, the existence of an impressed force is implied, with the question of how this force is effected left open.",
              "The modern F=ma form of Newton's second law nowhere occurs in any edition of the Principia even though he had seen his second law formulated in this way in print during the interval between the second and third editions in Jacob Hermann's Phoronomia of 1716.",
              "Instead, it has the following formulation in all three editions: A change in motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and takes place along the straight line in which that force is impressed.",
              "In the body of the Principia this law is applied both to discrete cases, in which an instantaneous impulse such as from impact is effecting the change in motion, and to continuously acting cases, such as the change in motion in the continuous deceleration of a body moving in a resisting medium.",
              "Newton thus appears to have intended his second law to be neutral between discrete forces (that is, what we now call impulses) and continuous forces.",
              "(His stating the law in terms of proportions rather than equality bypasses what seems to us an inconsistency of units in treating the law as neutral between these two.)",
              "The obvious question with the second law is what Newton means by \u201ca change in motion.",
              "\u201d If he had meant a change in what we call momentum \u2014 that is, if he had meant, in modern notation, \u0394mv \u2014 the proper phrasing would have been \u201ca change in the quantity of motion.",
              "\u201d In a passage composed in the early 1690s when Newton was intending to restructure the Principia, he explained what he meant: If the body A should [see Fig.",
              "1], at its place A where a force is impressed upon it, have a motion by which, when uniformly continued, it would describe the straight line Aa, but shall by the impressed force be Figure 1 deflected from this line into another one Ab and, when it ought to be located at the place a, be found at the place b, then because the body, free of the impressed force, would have occupied the place a and is thrust out from this place by that force and transferred therefrom to the place b, the translation of the body from the place a to the place b will, in the meaning of this Law, be proportional to this force and directed to the same goal towards which this force is impressed.",
              "Whence, if the same body deprived of all motion and impressed by the same force with the same direction, could in the same time be transported from the place A to the place B, the two straight lines AB and ab will be parallel and equal.",
              "For the same force, by acting with the same direction and in the same time on the same body whether at rest or carried on with any motion whatever, will in the meaning of this Law achieve an identical translation towards the same goal;",
              "and in the present case the translation is AB where the body was at rest before the force was impressed, and ab where it was there in a state of motion.",
              "[M, 541] In other words, the measure of the change in motion is the distance between the place where the body would have been after a given time had it not been acted on by the force and the place it is after that time.",
              "This is in keeping with the measure universally used at the time for the strength of the acceleration of surface gravity, namely the distance a body starting from rest falls vertically in the first second.",
              "The only special provision that Newton has to make is for non-uniform continuously acting forces, for which, in accord with Lemma 10, he takes the distance AB to vary \u201cat the very beginning of the motion in the squared ratio of the times.",
              "\u201d[21] If this way of interpreting the second law seems perverse, keep in mind that the geometric mathematics Newton used in the Principia \u2014 and others were using before him \u2014 had no way of representing acceleration as a quantity in its own right.",
              "Newton, of course, could have conceptualized acceleration as the second derivative of distance with respect to time within the framework of the symbolic calculus.",
              "This indeed is the form in which Jacob Hermann presented the second law in his Phoronomia of 1716 (and Euler in the 1740s).",
              "But the geometric mathematics used in the Principia offered no way of representing second derivatives.",
              "(Newton employed curvature \u2014 that is, the circle \u201ctouching a curve\u201d \u2014 in place of the second derivative with respect to distance throughout the Principia).",
              "Hence, it was natural for Newton to stay with the established tradition of using a length as the measure of the change of motion produced by a force, even independently of the advantage this measure had of allowing the law to cover both discrete and continuously acting forces (with the given time taken in the limit in the continuous case).",
              "Under this interpretation, Newton's second law would not have seemed novel at the time.",
              "The consequences of impact were also being interpreted in terms of the distance between where the body would have been after a given time, had it not suffered the impact, and where it was after this time, following the impact, with the magnitude of this distance depending on the relative bulks of the impacting bodies.",
              "Moreover, Huygens's account of the centrifugal force (that is, the tension in the string) in uniform circular motion in his Horologium Oscillatorium used as the measure for the force the distance between where the body would have been had it continued in a straight line and its location on the circle in a limiting small increment of time;",
              "and he then added that the tension in the string would also be proportional to the weight of the body.",
              "So, construed in the indicated way, Newton's second law was novel only in its replacing bulk and weight with mass.",
              "[22] In the early stages of his work on the Principia Newton had identified three logically equivalent alternatives for the third law: the action-reaction principle he ultimately chose, the principle we call conservation of linear momentum (Corollary 3 in the Principia), and the principle that \u201cthe common center of gravity of two or more bodies does not change its state whether of motion or of rest as a result of the actions of the bodies upon one another\u201d (Corollary 4).",
              "Huygens had stated that both of these principles follow from his solution for spheres in collision, and the center of gravity principle, as Newton emphasizes, amounts to nothing more than a generalization of the principle of inertia.",
              "Even though his third law was novel in comparison with these other two,[23] Newton nevertheless chose it and relegated the other two to corollaries.",
              "Two things can be said about this choice.",
              "First, the third law is a local principle, while the two alternatives to it are global principles, and Newton, unlike those working in mechanics on the Continent at the time, generally preferred fundamental principles to be local, perhaps because they pose less of an evidence burden.",
              "Second, with the choice of the third law, the three laws all expressly concern impressed forces: the first law authorizes inferences to the presence of an impressed force on a body, the second, to its magnitude and direction, and the third to the correlative force on the body producing it.",
              "In this regard, Newton's three laws of motion are indeed axioms characterizing impressed force.",
              "Real forces, in contrast to such apparent forces as Coriolis forces (of which Newton was entirely aware, though of course not under this name), are forces for which the third law, as well as the first two, hold, for only by means of this law can real forces and hence changes of motion be distinguished from apparent ones.",
              "Newton presents his first two laws as already \u201caccepted by mathematicians and confirmed by experiments of many kinds\u201d [P, 424].",
              "[24] For the third law, by contrast, he offers a variety of forms of support, including experiments on impact.",
              "One important element that becomes clear in his discussion of evidence for the third law \u2014 and also in Corollary 2 \u2014 is that Newton's impressed force is the same as static force that had been employed in the theory of equilibrium of devices like the level and balance for some time.",
              "Newton is not introducing a novel notion of force, but only extending a familiar notion of force.",
              "Indeed, Huygens too had employed this notion of static force in his Horologium Oscillatorium when he identified his centrifugal force with the tension in the string (or the pressure on a wall) retaining an object in circular motion, in explicit analogy with the tension exerted by a heavy body on a string from which it is dangling.",
              "Huygens's theory of centrifugal force was going beyond the standard treatment of static forces only in its inferring the magnitude of the force from the motion of the body in a circle.",
              "Newton's innovation beyond Huygens was first to focus not on the force on the string, but on the correlative force on the moving body, and second to abstract this force away from the mechanism by which it acts on the body.",
              "Three steps were thus involved in passing from the already familiar static forces to the more abstract Newtonian \u201cdynamic\u201d forces, one by Huygens and two by Newton.",
              "[25] The continuity with Huygens's theory of centrifugal force is important in another respect.",
              "In his brief defense of the first two laws of motion Newton remarks, \u201cWhat has been demonstrated concerning the times of oscillating pendulums depends on the same first two laws and first two corollaries, and this is supported by daily experience with clocks\u201d [P, 424].",
              "In Huygens's Horologium Oscillatorium, the only place any counterpart to the second law surfaces is in the theory of centrifugal force and uniform circular motion.",
              "The theory Huygens presents extends to conical pendulums, including a conical pendulum clock that he indicates has advantages over simple pendulum clocks.",
              "In the 1670s Newton had used a conical pendulum to confirm Huygens's announced value of the strength of surface gravity as measured by simple cycloidal and small-arc circular pendulums.[26] (Huygens himself had measured the strength of surface gravity with a conical pendulum, obtaining the same value to four significant figures as he had obtained with simple pendulums.[27]) The precise agreement between these two theory-mediated measures of surface gravity, one of them predicated on Newton's first two laws of motion and the other not, in fact constituted the strongest evidence for the first two laws at the time the Principia was first published.",
              "For, the simple pendulum measure was known to be stable and accurate into the fourth significant figure.",
              "The evidence in hand for the first two laws, taken as a basis for measuring forces, was thus much stronger than has often been appreciated.",
              "Save perhaps for the attribution of the F=ma form of the second law to the Principia, the most widespread mistake about Newton's three laws of motion is that they alone sufficed for all problems in classical mechanics.",

              "Newton recognized this concern and addressed it in Propositions 48 through 52 by extending Huygens's theory of the cycloidal pendulum to cover the hypocycloidal pendulum \u2014 that is, a cycloidal path produced when the generating circle rolls along the inside of a sphere instead of along a flat surface.",
              "Proposition 52 then shows that such a pendulum, although not isochronous under inverse-square centripetal forces, is isochronous under centripetal forces that vary linearly with the distance to the center.",

              "A corollary to this proposition goes further by pointing out that, as the radius of the sphere is increased indefinitely, its surface approaches a plane surface and the law of the hypocycloidal asymptotically approaches Huygens's law of the cycloidal pendulum.",
              "This not only validates Huygens's measurement of surface gravity, but also provides a formula that can be used to determine the error associated with using Huygens's theory rather than the theory of the hypocycloidal pendulum.",

              "These propositions\u2014 which Newton has taken the trouble to show still hold in a quam proxime form \u2014 are the very ones he invokes in Book 3 to conclude that the forces retaining bodies in their orbits in our planetary system are all centripetal and inverse-square.",
              "(By contrast, as noted earlier, while the proposition, \u201cif a Keplerian ellipse exactly, then inverse-square exactly,\u201d is true, the proposition, \u201cif a Keplerian ellipse quam proxime, then inverse-square quam proxime,\u201d is not true when the eccentricity of the ellipse is not large, as explained in Smith, 2002.)",
              "A failure to notice these quam proxime forms in Book 1 blinds one to the subtlety of the approximative reasoning Newton employs in Book 3.",
              "The purpose of Book 2 is to provide a conclusive refutation of the Cartesian idea, adopted as well by Leibniz, that the planets are carried around their orbits by fluid vortices.",
              "Newton's main argument, which extends from the beginning of Section 1 until the end of Section 7, occupies 80 percent of the Book.",
              "Section 9, which ends the Book, offers a further, parting argument.",
              "We best dispense with this second argument before turning to the first.",
              "The thrust of the argument in Section 9 is that fluid vortices are incompatible with Kepler's area and 3/2 power rules.",
              "The argument has two shortcomings, both of them recognized by Newton's opponents at the time.",
              "First, the entire argument is predicated on a hypothesis: \u201cThe resistance that arises from want of slipperiness of the parts of the fluid is, ceteris paribus, proportional to the velocity with which the parts of the fluid are separated from one another.",
              "\u201d Fluids of this sort are now called \u201cNewtonian.",
              "\u201d The absence of evidence for the hypothesis left Newton's opponents free to adopt other rules for the velocity gradient in a vortex generated around a rotating cylinder or sphere, rules that could undercut his conclusions.",
              "Second, his analysis of the vortex generated around a rotating cylinder or sphere involves fundamentally wrong physics: it defines steady state in terms of a balance of forces instead of torques across each shell element comprising the vortex.",
              "To use Johann Bernoulli's words from 1730, Newton \u201ccompletely neglects to take into account the action of the lever, the consideration of which however is absolutely necessary here, it being obvious that the same force, applied along the tangent to the circumference of a large wheel, has a greater efficacity for making it turn than it has when applied to the circumference of a smaller radius.",
              "\u201d[38] (This is not the only place in the Principia where it is clear that Newton had not thought through the mechanics of angular motion.)",
              "The argument that carried much more weight at the time \u2014 it convinced Huygens, for example \u2014 is the one that extends across the first seven sections of the Book.",
              "The thrust of this argument is clear from its conclusion, as stated more forcefully in the second and third editions than in the first: To reach this conclusion Newton had to show that (1) the inertia of the fluid does indeed produce a resistance force proportional to its density, a force that (2) is independent of the tenacity (that is, surface friction) and the friction of the parts (that is, viscosity) of the fluid.",
              "Perhaps in part in emulation of the approach to centripetal forces that appeared to have succeeded so well in Books 1 and 3, the approach Newton takes in Book 2 is to develop, so far as he can, a generic mathematical theory of motion under resistance forces and then turn to experimental phenomena so that, in the words of Book 1, \u201cit may be found out which conditions of forces apply\u201d to different kinds of fluids.",
              "The theory in Book 1 is generic in that it examines centripetal forces that vary as different functions of the distance from the force center.",
              "The theory in Book 2 is generic in that it examines motion under resistance forces that vary as the velocity, the velocity squared, the sum of these two, and ultimately even the sum of two or three independent contributions, each of which is allowed to vary as any power of velocity whatever.",
              "Because Newton's goal was to reach a conclusion about the contribution to the total resistance made by the inertia of the fluid, and he recognized that surface friction and viscosity can contribute to the resistance as well, his empirical problem became one of disaggregating the inertial contribution from the total resistance, that is, the contribution that alone varies with the density of the fluid.",
              "Fortunately, because gravitational forces so totally dominate celestial motions, this need to disaggregate different sorts of forces did not arise in Book 3.",
              "From Newton's point of view, then, the basic problem \u2014 assuming that three independent mechanisms contribute to the total resistance forces, only one of which is proportional to the fluid density \u03c1f \u2014 was to find an experimental phenomenon that would allow him to determine (1) the three exponents in the following schema, and (2) laws defining the three coefficients \u2014 or, more minimally, at least the variation of the coefficient of the last term for the specific case of spheres: Some preliminary pendulum-decay experiments showed promise for doing this, leading him in the first edition to rely solely on this phenomenon.",
              "The idea was to start a pendulum from several different heights in order to cover a range of velocities and then to use simultaneous algebraic equations to fit a two or three term polynomial to two or three lost-arc data-points, changing the exponents until the polynomial achieved good agreement with the other lost-arc data points.",
              "The theoretical solutions for pendulum motion under resistance forces in Section 6 would then allow him to infer the forces from the rate of decay of the pendulum.",
              "These theoretical solutions covered resistance forces that vary not only as velocity to the powers 0, 1, and 2, but also as any power at all of velocity.",
              "In principle, therefore, he saw himself in a position to infer laws for resistance forces on spheres from the phenomenon of pendulum decay in full parallel with his deduction of the law of universal gravity from the phenomena of orbital motion in Book 3.",
              "And he could then conclude from the total absence of signs of resistance forces acting on the planets and, most especially, comets that the density of any fluid in the celestial regions must be exactly or very nearly zero.",
              "Unfortunately, pendulum-decay turned out not to be as well behaved a phenomenon as Newton anticipated it was going to be while he was working on the first edition.",
              "The problem, as he later realized, was that he had to let the pendulum swing many times in order to measure the rate of decay, and in the process it gave rise to a \u201cto and fro\u201d motion in the surrounding fluid, so that the relative velocity between the bob and the fluid, which is the velocity that matters in resistance, could not be determined or controlled.",
              "The General Scholium following Section 6[39] reports detailed decay-rate data for an impressive range of experiments, including different size bobs in air and bobs moving as well in water and mercury.",
              "The reader is also shown in detail how to proceed from the data in each case to a polynomial as above defining the resistance force.",
              "Any reader who worked through the data discovered what Newton knew, but was less than candid about: no polynomial fit the data.",
              "The experiments did clearly indicate that resistance forces involve no power of velocity greater than 2, and they provided good evidence that a velocity squared effect was dominant, even to the extent of masking any effect involving some other power.",
              "Newton also managed to extract some highly qualified evidence that the velocity squared effect varies as the density of the fluid and the frontal area (that is, the square of the diameter) of spheres.",
              "The approach to resistance in the first edition relied entirely on pendulum-decay experiments.",
              "The disappointing evidence they yielded led to a far weaker statement of the conclusion about the absence of fluid in the celestial regions in the first edition than the conclusion in the subsequent editions quoted above.",
              "Not long after the first edition was published, Newton initiated some vertical-fall experiments in water that persuaded him that the phenomenon of vertical-fall in resisting media would yield much better behaved data.",
              "In the second and third editions, therefore, even though the pendulum-decay experiments are still fully reported, the central argument in Book 2 relies on vertical-fall experiments (including ones from the top of the dome of the newly completed St.",
              "Paul's Cathedral) to establish a resistance effect on spheres that is proportional to the density of the fluid, the square of the diameter, and the square of the velocity.",
              "The data from these experiments were very good \u2014 indeed, even better than Newton realized, for small vagaries in them that he dismissed as experimental error were in fact not vagaries at all, but evidence that no polynomial of the sort he was seeking is adequate for resistance forces.",
              "While the vertical-fall experiments put Newton in a position to make his concluding rejection of vortex theories more forceful, they also posed a methodological complication.",
              "The vertical-fall experiments offered no way of disaggregating the contribution to resistance made by the inertia of the medium from the total resistance.",
              "But the argument against vortices required him to show that, no matter how perfectly free of friction and viscosity the celestial fluid might be, its inertia would still give rise to resistance forces that would affect the motions of comets, if not planets as well.",
              "From the resistance measured in the pendulum-decay experiments, Newton could conclude that the forces in air and water are dominated by a contribution that varies as the velocity squared.",
              "In the vertical-fall experiments in air and water the measured forces varied to first approximation as the product of the density and the velocity squared, but only to a first approximation, leaving room to question whether a purely inertial contribution had been isolated.",
              "Newton dealt with this problem by offering a rather ad hoc theoretical derivation for the purely inertial contribution, showing how closely it agreed with the vertical-fall results, and proposing that the differences between the theoretical and the measured resistances could be used to investigate other contributions.",
              "Success of such a program in characterizing the contributions made by surface friction and the viscosity would have provided compelling support for Newton's theory of the inertial contribution.",
              "Still, the approach left Newton with not so straightforward a derivation of the laws of resistance forces from phenomena as he had hoped for in the first edition.",
              "[40] In fact, there is a deep mistake in Newton's approach to resistance forces that came to be understood only at the beginning of the twentieth century.",
              "Resistance forces do not arise from independent contributions made by such factors as the viscosity and inertia of the fluid.",
              "Consequently, no polynomial consisting of a few always positive terms in powers of velocity can ever be adequate for resistance forces.",
              "The first indication of this came when d'Alembert, unhappy with Newton's ad hoc theory for the inertial contribution, analyzed the flow of what we now call a perfect fluid about spheres and bodies of other shapes, discovering in all cases that the net force of the fluid is exactly zero.",
              "Consequently, contrary to Newton, there is no such thing as the contribution made to resistance purely by the inertia of the fluid.",
              "Resistance forces always arise from a combination of viscous and inertial effects, however low the viscosity of the fluid may be.",
              "Newton's assumption that resistance forces can be represented as a sum, one term of which gives the contribution made purely by the inertia of the fluid, was wrong empirically, much as his assumptions about simultaneity and space being Euclidean turned out to be wrong.",
              "Unlike the latter assumptions, however, the assumption about resistance amounted to a dead end.",
              "All Newton achieved in Book 2 with resistance forces was merely a curve-fit.",
              "Save for the short opening sections, \u201cRegulae Philosophandi\u201d and \u201cPhenomena,\u201d Book 3, in contrast to Books 1 and 2, is not marked off into sections.",
              "Nevertheless, the main body of it does consist of four clearly separate parts: (1) the derivation of the law of gravity (Props.",

              "These parts will be discussed in sequence below.",
              "Newton's first two rules of reasoning appeared in the first edition (there labeled as hypotheses[41]), the third rule was added in the second edition, and the fourth rule, in the third edition.",
              "These are rules intended to govern evidential reasoning in natural philosophy, akin to rules of deductive reasoning except for their very much not guaranteeing true conclusions from true premises.",
              "In particular, Rule 2 authorizes the inference from same effect to same cause, a notoriously invalid inference, and Rule 3 authorizes inductive generalization to all bodies universally of those qualities of bodies \u201cthat belong to all bodies on which experiments can be made.",
              "\u201d Newton's phrasing carries no suggestion that these rules yield truths or even a high probability of truth.",
              "The operative phrase in both Rules 3 and 4, for example, is properly translated \u201cshould be taken,\u201d and Rule 4 makes the provisional character of the authorized inferences explicit: The philosophic question why Newton's rules are appropriate is best addressed not by asking how they increase the probability of truth, but by asking whether there is some strategy in ongoing research for which these rules will both promote further discoveries and safeguard against dead-end garden paths that ultimately require all the supposed discoveries to be discarded.",
              "Six astronomical phenomena are listed and discussed in the section called \u201cPhenomena\u201d \u2014 most importantly, that Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and the satellites of the latter two sweep out equal areas in equal times with respect to the central bodies of their respective orbits, and their periods vary as the 3/2 power of their mean distances from these bodies.",
              "The ellipse, by the way, is not one of the phenomena.",
              "In Phenomenon 3 Newton rules out the Ptolemaic system, just as Galileo had in his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, by appealing to the phases of Mercury and Venus and their absence in the case of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn to conclude that these five orbits encircle the Sun.",
              "But this Phenomenon and all the others are carefully formulated to remain neutral between the Copernican and Tychonic systems. In Phenomenon 4 Boulliau's calculated orbits are treated on a par with Kepler's, indicating that the phenomena do not rule out the possibility that Boulliau's alternative to the area rule is correct.",
              "Phenomenon 6 explicitly grants that the area rule holds only approximately for the Moon, with a further remark indicating that none of the phenomena are being put forward as holding exactly.",
              "This points the way to the most reasonable reading of all of the phenomena: they describe to reasonably high approximation, but not more than that, the observations of the planets and their satellites made by Tycho and others over a finite period of time \u2014 roughly from 1570 to the time of Newton's writing.",
              "On this way of viewing the Phenomena, they are in no way contentious or problematic.",
              "They leave entirely open not only questions about whether any claims concerning the orbits made by Kepler and his contemporaries hold exactly, but also questions about whether any of these claims hold even remotely in other eras, past or future.",
              "The Phenomena are thus not inconsistent with Descartes' insistence that the motions are constantly changing.",
              "The \u201cdeduction\u201d of the law of universal gravity from the phenomena in the first eight propositions of Book 3 has provoked a great deal of controversy in the philosophical literature over the last century or so.",
              "[42] At the heart of this controversy is the challenge posed by Pierre Duhem: how can a deduction proceed from premises (the planets sweep out equal areas in equal times and their orbits are stationary) to a conclusion, the law of gravity, that then implies that the premises are false (the planets do not sweep out equal areas in equal times and the orbits are not stationary, but instead precess)?",
              "[43] The answer is simple: Newton's reasoning is approximative.",
              "He is using \u201cif, then\u201d statements that have been shown in Book 1 to hold in \u201cif .",

              "Of course, this means that the deduction shows only that the conclusions, most notably the law of gravity, hold quam proxime over the restricted period of time for which the premises hold.",
              "The Rules of Reasoning then license the conclusion to be taken exactly, without restriction of space or time.",
              "The conclusions, so taken, do indeed then show that the premises hold only quam proxime, and not exactly.",
              "This conclusion in no way contradicts the premises.",
              "Recognizing that Newton's reasoning is approximative answers another complaint about the \u201cdeduction\u201d of universal gravity: Newton invokes the proposition, if bodies move uniformly in concentric circular orbits whose periods vary as the 3/2 power of the radii, then the centripetal forces acting on these bodies vary as the inverse-square of the radii of the orbits, knowing full well that observation had established for centuries that the planets do not move uniformly in circular orbits.",
              "[44] Newton does indeed invoke this proposition first to conclude (in Prop.",
              "1) that, in modern parlance, there is an inverse-square centripetal acceleration field around Jupiter and Saturn and next to conclude (in Prop.",
              "2) that there is an inverse-square centripetal acceleration field around the Sun.",
              "[45] The orbits of the satellites of Jupiter were then considered to be circular, and hence Newton's inference from their motion was not so problematic.",
              "While, however, the orbits of Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn were considered to be very nearly circular, the motion in them had been known from before Ptolemy not to be uniform.",
              "Newton expressly concedes that his inference of the inverse-square from the 3/2 power rule for the planets is only approximate when, in the very next sentence, he remarks, \u201cBut this second part of the proposition is proved with the greatest exactness from the fact that the aphelia are at rest.",
              "\u201d The absence of precession, however, can be used to infer the inverse-square only for each orbit individually, not a single, unified inverse-square centripetal acceleration field encompassing all of the orbits.",
              "Newton is accordingly using the 3/2 rule for circular orbits to establish that an inverse-square field holds around the Sun to at least a first approximation, and then using the absence of precession of the individual orbits to tighten the approximation.",
              "Interpreting Newton's deduction of universal gravity as an exercise in approximative reasoning answers a further complaint of Duhem's: insofar as the area rule holds only to high approximation, so too do any number of alternatives to it, such as Boulliau's geometric construction, and hence Newton's \u201cdeduction\u201d begs the question of why the area rule is to be preferred to these alternatives.",
              "[46] This question, however, is irrelevant so long as the conclusion remains in the weak form, the law of gravity holds quam proxime for the planets and their satellites over the time period for which observations have shown the phenomena to hold quam proxime.",
              "The phenomena really are sufficient to reach the conclusion in this weak form.",
              "So, the complaint has bite only when the law of gravity is taken to be exact.",
              "But there, however, Newton does provide a response to it when he concludes in Propositions 13 and 14 that the planets would describe areas exactly proportional to the times in stationary orbits if \u201cthe Sun were at rest and the remaining planets did not act upon one another.",
              "\u201d[47] The reason, then, why the phenomena from which Newton proceeded in the deduction have claim to being preferred to alternatives to them is that the theory deduced from them, when taken to hold exactly, identifies circumstances under which the phenomena would hold exactly, as well.",
              "That this be the case amounts to a requirement on the deduction from phenomena: the leap to taking the law of gravity as exact is justified only if it yields circumstances in which the phenomena from which it was inferred would hold exactly.",
              "[48] This analysis of the \u201cdeduction\u201d of universal gravity does not answer two further complaints lodged against it.",
              "First, in concluding that the centripetal force acting on the Moon is inverse-square, Newton grants that the precession of the lunar orbit implies an exponent of -2 and 4/243 for the force rather than exactly -2, but then claims that the small fraction can be accounted for by the perturbing action of the Sun's gravity.",
              "But the magnitude for the action of the Sun that he gives in Proposition 3[49] is twice the value he later in Book 3 indicates is the correct value.",
              "This lacuna was not resolved by Alexis-Claude Clairaut until two decades after Newton died.",
              "Second, when Newton invokes the third law of motion in the corollaries to Proposition 5, he is tacitly assuming that, for example, Jupiter and the Sun are, in effect, directly interacting.",
              "In other words, he is ignoring the alternative favored by Huygens that some unseen medium is effecting the centripetal force on Jupiter, a medium that can in principle absorb the linear momentum which Newton is assuming is being transferred to the Sun.",
              "Huygens may well have perceived this lacuna, to which Cotes explicitly called Newton's attention while he was preparing the second edition.",
              "[50] The group of propositions following the deduction of universal gravity gives indications of the evidential strategy that lies behind the leap to taking this law to be exact.",
              "Immediately upon concluding first that the planets would sweep out equal areas in equal times in exact ellipses and then that the orbits would be exactly stationary were it not for the gravitational interactions among the planets, Newton calls attention to the easiest to observe deviations from this idealization, the then still mysterious vagaries in the motions of Jupiter and Saturn which Newton attributes to their gravitational interaction.",
              "Because, according to the theory, the idealization would hold exactly in the specified circumstances, these and all other deviations must result from further forces not taken into account in the idealized case.",
              "Identifying these forces and showing that, according to the theory, they do produce the deviations is a way for ongoing research to marshal continuing evidence to bear on the theory of gravity.",
              "To put the point differently, the initial idealizations that Newton identifies can serve as the starting point for a process of successive approximations that should yield increasingly close agreement with the complex true motions.",
              "These idealizations are especially well suited for this purpose precisely because, according to the theory, they would hold exactly were no other forces at work, and hence every deviation from them should be physically telling, and not just, for example, an accidental feature of a curve-fit.",
              "Pursuit of such a research program of successive approximations promises to yield either further evidence for the theory of gravity when the program is successful or the exceptions Newton speaks of in Rule 4 that require the theory to be revised.",
              "Of the other results developed in the group of propositions following the deduction of universal gravity, the most heralded at the time were the defense of Copernicanism in Proposition 12 and the identification of the cause of the tides in Proposition 24 \u2014 two topics that Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes had all addressed.",
              "Nevertheless, the two Propositions that proved most important were 19 and 20, which respectively derive the non-spheroidal figure of the Earth and the variation of surface gravity with latitude under the assumption that the density of the Earth is uniform.",
              "This is the only passage in the Principia that Newton reworked extensively in both the second and then again in the third edition.",
              "As Newton was fully aware, and Huygens and a few others realized, these are the only results in the Principia that depend on universal gravity \u2014 that is, inverse-square gravity directed toward every particle of matter forming the Earth \u2014 and not merely macroscopic celestial gravity \u2014 inverse-square gravity directed toward celestial bodies.",
              "In his Discourse on the Cause of Gravity, Huygens offered an alternative theoretical account of the figure of the Earth and the variation of surface gravity, and he claimed to have evidence confirming it and hence refuting Newton's universal gravity.",
              "[51] In part because evidence on the figure of the Earth and the variation of gravity with latitude were accessible in expeditions to the equator, these were the results in the Principia that were the first to receive concerted critical attention during the 1730s and 1740s.",
              "There was a complication in all this, however.",
              "The extremely precise results for both the figure of the Earth and the variation of gravity that Newton tabulated in the second and third editions were based on uniform density, and hence, just like Keplerian motion, represented an idealization, departures from which would point to non-uniformities of density.",
              "Not until Clairaut's Theory of the Figure of the Earth did means become available to calculate the effects of non-uniformities in the density.",
              "[52] Propositions 25 through 35 derive quantitative results for three lunar inequalities \u2014 the systematic departure from the area rule called the \u201cthe variation,\u201d the 18 year motion of the line of nodes, and the fluctuating inclination of the orbit \u2014 from the perturbing action of the Sun.",
              "For all three Newton starts with a circular orbit, so these too involve departures from an idealization.",
              "The values he obtained for the different components of the solar perturbing force in Proposition 25 and subsequently, as needed, were accurate to several significant figures.",
              "All three derivations, which are mathematically demanding, were successful in obtaining agreement with the values of the inequalities obtained from observation, especially so the derivation for the recession of the lunar nodes, for which he achieves agreement with the known value to better than 98 percent.",
              "(Newton must have been mystified by the failure of his seemingly parallel derivation of the 9 year precession of the line of apsides to achieve better than 50 percent agreement.)",
              "The Scholium following Proposition 35 opens with the explanation for the preceding efforts on the lunar inequalities: \u201cI wished to show by these computations of the lunar motions that the lunar motions can be computed from their causes by the theory of gravity\u201d [P, 869].",
              "Newton never found a way of deriving the precession of the lunar apogee from the theory of gravity, and consequently he never succeeded with a complete, gravity-derived account of the lunar orbit.",
              "[53] The mathematical treatment of the three lunar inequalities nevertheless did provide added support for his theory of gravity.",
              "It also introduced the idea of attacking the problem of the true orbit in a sequence of successive approximations by calculating perturbations in motion in an assumed orbit caused by the gravitational action of the Sun.",
              "This was not only an entirely new approach to the then unsolved problem of simply describing the motion of the Moon, an approach that proceeded from the physical cause to the motion;",
              "it was also the beginnings of the perturbational approach that dominated all of celestial mechanics from the middle of the eighteenth century until late in the twentieth.",
              "[54] As difficult as Propositions 25 through 35 were for readers at the time \u2014 and still are for readers now \u2014 they crucially promoted the further research on the complicated orbital motions that ultimately supplied overwhelming support for Newton's theory of gravity.",
              "It was a real breakthrough when Newton discovered that the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon acting on an oblately spheroidal Earth would produce a wobble of the Earth that, at least qualitatively, could account for the precession of the Equinoxes.",
              "No physical explanation for this phenomenon had been proposed before.",
              "Newton faced a problem, however, in trying to carry out a quantitative derivation of the precession: he knew the magnitude of the gravitational action of the Sun on the Earth but not that of the Moon, for he could not obtain the mass of the Moon in the way he had for the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn insofar as no bodies orbit the Moon.",
              "Propositions 36 and 37 endeavor to infer the force of the Moon on the Earth from the difference in the heights of the tides when the Sun and Moon are in conjunction and in opposition.",
              "In the first edition Newton managed to derive a value for the rate of the precession in good agreement with the known value, but during the quarter century between the first and second editions he concluded that the value he had used for the Moon's force (6 and 1/3 times the Sun's force) was much too large.",
              "The derivation of the precession was therefore extensively revised in the second edition, using a new value for the Moon's force (4.",
              "4815 times the Sun's force, still more than a factor of 2 greater than the correct value).",
              "In all editions the derivation in Proposition 39 treated the wobble not directly as the motion of a rigid body, but by analogy with the motion of the lunar nodes.",
              "By the standards of our present physics, no part of Book 3 is further off-base than Newton's solution for the precession.",
              "The phenomenon, however, subsequently provided important evidence for Newton's theory of gravity when d'Alembert in 1749 carried out a successful derivation based on rigid body motion and a correct value of the Moon's force derived from the then recently discovered phenomenon of the nutation of the Earth.",
              "Newton's account of the tides in Propositions 24, 36, and 37 was much heralded not only at the time, but still today.",
              "He is nevertheless receiving more credit for this than he is due.",
              "He did identify solar and lunar gravity as the forces driving the tides, but this is all he did.",
              "He ignored the rotation of the Earth, and worse he considered only the radial component of the solar and lunar gravitational forces in these three propositions.",
              "In fact, the radial component of these forces has a very small effect compared with the transradial component, that is, the component perpendicular to the radial component.",
              "All of this became clear in the 1770s when Laplace developed the mathematical theory of tidal motion from which all subsequent work has proceeded.",
              "Book 3 ends with a revolutionary analysis of comet trajectories that occupies roughly one-third of the total length of the Book in all three editions.",
              "This analysis was slow in coming.",
              "As late as June 1686, Newton wrote: \u201cthe third [book] wants the Theory of Comets\u201d [C, II, 437].",
              "What made the problem difficult, as compared to planet trajectories, was the need to work from a small number of imprecise one-shot observations made from a moving Earth.",
              "The method presented in the Principia fits a parabola iteratively to the observations, employing novel finite-difference methods that Newton later expanded into a full tract in mathematics, \u201cMethodis Differentialis.",
              "\u201d The method presupposes the theory of gravity first in opting for a parabola and second in assuming that the inverse-square centripetal forces known from the planets act on comets along their entire trajectory.",
              "The text notes that the trajectories may well be ellipses, but the period of return in that case would be the best way of determining the ellipse.",
              "(The parabola approximates the high-curvature end of ellipses with high eccentricity.)",
              "The proposal that comets may return was novel, but even more revolutionary at the time was the claim that they button-hook around the Sun, implying that what had sometimes in the past been taken for two distinct comets were really one comet before and after perihelion.",
              "In the first edition the method was applied only to the comet of 1680-81.",
              "The results are presented in a one-foot long diagram on the only fold-out page in the edition.",
              "Nothing like this diagram, shown in Figure 3, had ever appeared in print before.",
              "The diagram continued to appear in the next two editions, though in reduced form not requiring a fold-out in the third.",
              "In the second edition the method was refined and applied as well to the comets of 1664-65, 1683, and 1682 reflecting research Halley had carried out and published in his Astronomiae Cometicae Synopsis of 1705.",
              "The comet of 1682, now known as Halley's comet, was singled out as being sufficiently similar in trajectory to the comet of 1607 to warrant the proposal that it returns every 75 years.",
              "Figure 3 Added in the third edition was the retrograde comet of 1723, for which Bradley had supplied comparatively accurate observations and the method correspondingly displayed its most impressive success, with no discrepancies between the calculated and observed positions exceeding 1 minute of arc in either longitude or latitude.",
              "This suggested that the more exacting the observations entering into the calculation, the more accurate was the method.",
              "Because Newton's theory of comet trajectories depended only on that part of the theory of gravity that was least controversial \u2014 inverse-square centripetal accelerations everywhere around the Sun \u2014 it did not provoke much philosophical resistance.",
              "The success of the method provided evidence that these centripetal forces act equally on comets, contrary to Hooke's proposal in his Cometa of 1678 that comets must consist of a fundamentally different kind of material from the planets insofar as they do not respond to the forces directed toward the Sun in the same way.",
              "The success of the method also provided strong evidence that inverse-square forces toward the Sun hold throughout the space surrounding it, for not only do comets traverse the spaces between the planet orbits, but also their trajectories, in contrast to those of the then known planets, are often highly inclined with respect to the plane of the ecliptic.",
              "Most of all, however, the success of the method provided the most compelling evidence against not only Cartesian vortices, but all theories claiming that the planets are carried around the Sun by fluid vortices.",
              "Corollary 3 to Proposition 39 in all three editions summarizes the argument: This was the argument that convinced Huygens when he read the first edition, and it became all the more compelling thereafter as the method was so successful with further comets.",
              "[55] The added evidence supplied by the theory of comets highlights a sometimes overlooked aspect of Book 3.",
              "The development of evidence for the theory of gravity in it does not end with the \u201cdeduction\u201d of the law of universal gravity at the beginning, but continues all the way through the Book.",
              "During the eighteenth century attention focused overwhelmingly on the evidence supplied by Newton's theory of the figure of the Earth and the variation of surface gravity, the theory of the tides, the quantitative derivations of select lunar inequalities, the derivation of the precession of the equinoxes, and the theory of comets.",
              "This suggests that, both then and now, the \u201cdeduction\u201d of universal gravity should not be read in isolation from the rest of Book 3, but instead the entire Book should be seen as offering a sustained evidential argument for the theory.",
              "Read this way in the context of the rest of the Book, the \u201cdeduction\u201d is most appropriately viewed as intended to establish universal gravity, but only provisionally, as a theory on which further research is to be predicated, research that will continue to bring evidence to bear on the theory.",
              "From Halley's anonymous review of the first edition of the Principia forward, there has been a marked tendency to overstate what the Principia achieved, glossing over the many loose ends it left for others to recognize and address.",
              "A consequence of this is an equal tendency to distort the context of the enormous advances made in both mechanics and orbital astronomy during the eighteenth century, diminishing the difficulties those following Newton faced and their accomplishments in resolving them.",
              "The Principia is peculiar in this regard, for a list of its achievements without mentioning their loose ends overstates what it accomplished, but a list of its loose ends risks understating its extraordinary achievements.",
              "In an effort to strike a balance we here list eleven major scientific issues of the time to which Book 3 supplied answers in the sequence listed, the answers, and the most important loose ends in the reasoning offered in the evidential arguments for those answers.",
              "1.",
              "What physically retains the planets in orbits around the Sun and their satellites in orbit around them?",
              "Newton's answer \u2014 inverse-square gravity, one in kind with everyday terrestrial gravity \u2014 turned on a largely suppressed failure to account for more than half of the precession of the lunar orbit, it tacitly assumed interaction between the Sun and Jupiter and the other individual planets, and it raised unanswered questions about whether the perihelia of the planetary orbits do or do not precess.",
              "2.",
              "How does gravity vary, both below and above the surface of the Earth?",
              "In the absence of confirming data, Newton's answer \u2014 to a first approximation, linearly with distance to the center below the surface, and inversely with the square of the distance above it \u2014 presupposed uniform density in the first part and a spherical Earth with spherically symmetric density in the second, and therefore left open the possibility that gravity is constant near the surface of the Earth, just as Huygens continued to claim in his response to the Principia [HD, 153], citing supporting evidence.",
              "3.",
              "What are the relative densities of the planets, with respect to one another and to the Sun?",
              "Newton gives theory-dependent answers for Jupiter, Saturn, and the Earth in the corollaries to Proposition 8, but the one for the Earth, even in the third edition, depended on a still questionable value for the horizontal solar parallax (required to determine the distance of the Moon from the Earth in astronomical units), and no corroborating evidence for these answers had emerged, such as from the actions of Jupiter and Saturn on one another.",
              "4.",
              "Is there some principled way to resolve the dispute between the Copernican and Tychonic systems and thereby settle the question of the proper center to which all the motions in our planetary system should be referred?",
              "Newton's answer \u2014 the center of gravity of the system, about which the Sun circulates at comparatively small distances \u2014 depended on the assumed applicability of the third law of motion in claiming that the Sun is in motion, and the precise location of the center of gravity remained open in the absence of values for the relative masses of Mercury, Venus, and Mars.",
              "5.",
              "What are the true motions of the planets, and which, if any, of the schemes for calculating planet locations is to be preferred, Kepler's or one of the alternatives to it?",
              "Newton's answer was not simple: \u201cIf the sun were at rest and the remaining planets did not act upon one another, their orbits would be elliptical, having the sun in their common focus, and they would describe areas proportional to the times;",
              "\u201d and the aphelia and nodes would be stationary.",
              "The Keplerian system, amended in the manner of Horrocks to infer mean distances from the periods, is therefore the preferred approximation to the true motions.",
              "The main loose-end in this answer was whether the actual motions do deviate from the Keplerian ideal, and if so, whether all the deviations could be attributed to specific forces, gravitational or otherwise.",
              "A further loose-end, addressed in part in Book 3, was whether the non-Keplerian motion of the Moon can be shown not to be a counterexample to Newton's argument in the case of the planets.",
              "6.",
              "Is the motion of Jupiter and Saturn aberrant and, if so, what are the inequalities in it and what causes them?",
              "Newton answered yes, because they interact gravitationally, and the dominant inequality has a period corresponding to the 19 years between their consecutive conjunctions.",
              "(The second part of this answer did not appear in the first edition.)",
              "By the early 1720s it had become clear that the dominant period in the anomalies of motion of these two planets is not that of the time between conjunctions, but something of much longer duration, giving rise to the questions of what the vagaries actually are and whether they can truly be derived from Jupiter's and Saturn's gravitational forces.",
              "7.",
              "How, if at all, does the Earth's surface gravity vary with latitude, and how, if at all, does the Earth's figure differ from a sphere?",
              "Newton's answer changes from the first to the second to the third edition, but in all cases vagaries in the cited data raise the question of what the actual variations are.",
              "Also, because his idealized theoretical calculation assumes uniform density, his answer raises the questions whether the density of the Earth is uniform and whether the true figure of the Earth and variation of surface gravity can be reconciled with non-uniformities in density.",
              "8.",
              "What precisely is the motion of the Moon, and what gives rise to the inequalities in it, inequalities not observed in the motions of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn?",
              "Newton's answer to the second part is the perturbing effect of the Sun's gravity, leaving the answer to the first in the form of a promissory note: work out all the perturbations from solar gravity, and you will have the answer.",
              "The major open question was whether the complex motion of the line of apsides and the inequality known as the evection \u2014 the two features for which the Horrocksian cinematic model that Newton had employed in the Scholium to Book 3, Proposition 35 had resorted to an old-fashoined epicycle \u2014 can be derived from the action of solar gravity.",
              "9.",
              "What causes the tides, and why do they vary in time as well as from place to place in the way they do?",
              "Because Newton's answer \u2014 the gravitational action of the Sun and the Moon \u2014 was merely qualitative, it left room to question whether the Moon attracts the Earth and, if so, by how strong a force.",
              "Also left open was the question of how the inertia and viscosity of the seas and the rotation of the Earth affect the tides, a question requiring a dynamic analysis of the motions of the seas in response to solar and lunar gravity.",
              "10.",
              "What physically produces the precession of the equinoxes?",
              "Newton's derivation of the precession from the gravitational action of the Moon and Sun raised three unresolved questions: What are the correct values for the mass of the Moon and the oblateness of the Earth?",
              "Is the resulting motion of the Earth really analogous to that of the lunar nodes?",
              "How does the varying inclination of the Moon affect the calculated motion?",
              "11.",
              "What trajectories do comets describe?",
              "Newton's answer \u2014 conic-sections that can at least be approximated by parabolas in the region in which they are observable \u2014 gave weight to the question whether the parabolic trajectory works for all comets, and not just the comet of 1680-81 in the case of the first edition, the three others analyzed in the second, and the additional one in the third.",
              "The Principia also left open questions about how the gravity of Jupiter and Saturn might affect comet motions, whether any significance should be attached to the residual discrepancies between theory and observation in Newton's results, and which, if any, comets do return in some regular fashion.",
              "Careful reading of the Principia makes clear that, although unforthcoming about any of the loose ends, Newton was perfectly aware of them all, in one way or another flagging each for the benefit of the highly astute reader.",
              "An instructive way to present the history of eighteenth century research in the wake of the Principia is to trace how each of the loose ends became a prominent matter of concern and was then resolved, at least to the point of being removed as in any way a threat to Newton's theory of gravity.",
              "This process of addressing the loose ends in Book 3 did not get underway until the 1730s, after Newton had died.",
              "During his lifetime the most pressing complaint against the Principia was the absence of a mechanism to account for its action save for action at a distance, which Newton himself regarded as \u201cso great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.",
              "\u201d[56] The absence of a mechanism, however, was not something that Newton himself regarded as a loose-end in the Principia, for he insisted that all the conclusions listed above could be established, and any loose ends in them resolved, through the law of universal gravity alone, independently of the mechanism responsible for it.",
              "Over the decades after he died, those engaged in research predicated on his theory of gravity came increasingly to this same view of the question of mechanism.",
              "In two passages that remained word for word the same in all three editions Newton announced that the Principia was meant to illustrate a new approach to empirical inquiry.",
              "Neither the remark about deriving forces from phenomena of motion and then motions from these forces in the Preface to the first edition nor the remark about comparing a generic mathematical theory of centripetal forces with the phenomena in order to find out which conditions of force actually hold at the end of Book 1, Section 11, however, shed much light on just what this new approach is supposed to be.",
              "Other than these two passages, the only notable remark about methodology is the famous passage, quoted earlier, from the General Scholium added in the second edition as a final, parting statement: Much of the discussion of the methodology of the Principia in the philosophical literature, from the eighteenth century down to the present time, has taken this clearly polemical passage as the starting point, generating unfortunately more heat than light.",
              "[57] This is not the place to grapple with all the controversies surrounding this passage.",
              "Some guarded comments about the methodology of the Principia may nevertheless prove helpful.",
              "It is scarcely surprising that the unprecedented success of Newton's theory of gravity stimulated interest in the methodology of the Principia.",
              "The obvious thought was to emulate this success in other areas by following the same method.",
              "But then, even independently of questions about what the method was, one has to consider exactly how it contributed to the success.",
              "Viewed in retrospect, Book 2 makes clear that this question has no simple answer.",
              "If Newton followed the same method in Book 2, then the failure of his effort on resistance forces \u2014 even worse, the failure that he did not recognize \u2014 shows that the method was no guarantee of success.",
              "The empirical world must cooperate for it to succeed.",
              "Two aspects of the general thrust of the method are perfectly clear.",
              "First, Newton viewed it as contrasting with what was then called the method of hypotheses \u2014 that is, the method of putting forward hypotheses that reached far beyond the available data and then marshalling evidence for them by deducing testable conclusions from them.",
              "[58] Second, Newton viewed the method as requiring that questions be regarded as open when empirical considerations had not yet yielded answers to them.",
              "Whatever may have been required for empirical consideration to establish a theoretical conclusion, and whatever the status, provisional or otherwise, any such established conclusion was supposed to have, Newton viewed the method as allowing \u2014 even mandating \u2014 that theoretical answers to some questions could be established even while other closely related questions remained in abeyance.",
              "In particular, to use Newton's phrasing from the Scholium that ends Section 11, the physical species and physical proportions of forces could, in the appropriate sense, be established even though the question of their physical causes remained open.",
              "The clear aim of the method was accordingly to limit theoretical claims to \u201cinductive generalizations,\u201d as specified by the Rules of Reasoning, of conclusions dictated by experiment and observation.",
              "Newton's eschewing the method of hypotheses produced no controversy at the time.",
              "In a manuscript revision of his \u201cEssay on the causes of celestial motions\u201d Leibniz even adopted Newtonian phrasing: \u201cWhat follows is not based on hypotheses but is deduced from phenomena by the laws of motion\u201d [Aiton, 1972, 132].",
              "A large fraction of those who had read at most small portions of the Principia and depended on others for their knowledge of it most likely saw Newton as having hypothesized inverse-square attraction and hence as in fact following the method of hypotheses.",
              "In the years after Newton died, the most celebrated issues receiving concentrated research arose not from how Newton had arrived at universal gravity, but from the claims he had derived from it concerning the figure of the Earth, the vagaries in the motions of Jupiter and Saturn, and the motion of the Moon.",
              "The individuals at the center of this research certainly saw these issues as a test of Newton's theory of gravity, but the distinction between taking the theory as a hypothesis and taking it as a provisionally established conclusion was a distinction without much difference for them.",
              "Still, it is worth noting that the conclusion Clairaut first drew from the factor of 2 discrepancy in the motion of the lunar apogee was not that Newton's theory of gravity was false, but that the inverse-square needed to be supplemented by a 1/r4 term \u2014 a response fully in keeping with Newton's fourth rule of reasoning.",
              "The aspect of Newton's method that did produce controversy at the time was his insisting that he had established conclusions about the physical species and physical proportions of celestial forces while holding questions about their physical causes in abeyance.",
              "This was the core of the complaint by Cartesians that the Principia was a work of mathematics, not physics.",
              "For Newton's two most important critics, however, Huygens and Leibniz, the objection was not to holding the question of physical causes open, but to accepting certain conclusions that in their mind ruled out the very possibility of a proper answer to the question of physical cause.",
              "The defect in Newton's method lay in its not imposing the constraint on theory that all action be through contact, and not at a distance.",
              "The violation of this constraint lay behind Huygens's remarking, This, then, was the truly controversial aspect of Newton's method in the Principia with which the next generation had to come to some accommodation before research on its loose ends could become respectable.",
              "[59] The idea of developing a mathematical theory in order to enable experiment and observation to provide theory-mediated answers to questions did not originate with the Principia.",
              "In his Horologium Oscillatorium, the work the Principia most emulates, Huygens had developed a mathematical theory of pendulum motion that enabled measurement of the length and period of pendulums to provide a robust precise answer to the question, how far does an object fall in the absence of air resistance in the first second?",
              "\u2014 the measure then of the strength of surface gravity;",
              "and he had developed a mathematical theory of uniform circular motion that enabled measurement of the height and period of conical pendulums to provide a second answer to this question.",
              "By the time Newton started on the Principia pendulums had been used for more than a decade to answer questions about how surface gravity varies between Paris and other locations.",
              "The special problem Newton saw himself as having to face in using mathematical theory to a comparable end in the Principia stemmed from his realization, expressed in the \u201cCopernican scholium,\u201d that the phenomena of orbital motions are inordinately complicated and hence open to multiple competing descriptions.",
              "The problem thus became one of finding a way to use mathematical theory to draw definite robust answers to questions about the physical species and proportions of forces from these phenomena.",
              "These answers opened the way to pursing the true motions in a sequence of successive approximations, in the process of which continuing evidence could be brought to bear on the theory, potentially delimiting its exactness and its universal applicability in the manner Newton had noted in his fourth rule of reasoning.",
              "Because the \u201cCopernican scholium\u201d was unknown at the time, the subtleties of the new method Newton followed to get around this problem went largely unnoticed.",
              "Needless to say, these comments do not answer the philosophically most interesting question of how the method of the Principia contributed to the unprecedented success of its theory of gravity.",
              "Hopefully, however, they do remove some sources of confusion that have distorted so much of the philosophical discussion of the Principia.",

              "Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (English: The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy)[1] often referred to as simply the Principia (/pr\u026an\u02c8s\u026api\u0259, pr\u026an\u02c8k\u026api\u0259/), is a book by Isaac Newton that expounds Newton's laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation.",
              "The Principia is written in Latin and comprises three volumes, and was first published on 5 July 1687.",
              "[2][3] The Principia is considered one of the most important works in the history of science.",
              "[4] The French mathematical physicist Alexis Clairaut assessed it in 1747: \"The famous book of Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy marked the epoch of a great revolution in physics.",

              "[5] Joseph-Louis Lagrange described it as \"the greatest production of a human mind\".",
              "[6] A more recent assessment has been that while acceptance of Newton's laws was not immediate, by the end of the century after publication in 1687, \"no one could deny that\" (out of the Principia) \"a science had emerged that, at least in certain respects, so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally\".",
              "[7] The Principia forms the foundation of classical mechanics.",
              "Among other achievements, it explains Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which Kepler had first obtained empirically.",
              "In formulating his physical laws, Newton developed and used mathematical methods now included in the field of calculus, expressing them in the form of geometric propositions about \"vanishingly small\" shapes.",
              "[8] In a revised conclusion to the Principia (see \u00a7 General Scholium), Newton emphasized the empirical nature of the work with the expression Hypotheses non fingo (\"I frame/feign no hypotheses\").",
              "[9] After annotating and correcting his personal copy of the first edition,[10] Newton published two further editions, during 1713[11] with errors of the 1687 corrected, and an improved version[12] of 1726.",
              "[11] The Preface of the work states:[13] .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "Rational Mechanics will be the sciences of motion resulting from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any motion, accurately proposed and demonstrated .",

              ".",
              "And therefore we offer this work as mathematical principles of his philosophy.",
              "For all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this\u2014from the phenomena of motions to investigate the forces of Nature, and then from these forces to demonstrate the other phenomena .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "The Principia deals primarily with massive bodies in motion, initially under a variety of conditions and hypothetical laws of force in both non-resisting and resisting media, thus offering criteria to decide, by observations, which laws of force are operating in phenomena that may be observed.",
              "It attempts to cover hypothetical or possible motions both of celestial bodies and of terrestrial projectiles.",
              "It explores difficult problems of motions perturbed by multiple attractive forces.",
              "Its third and final book deals with the interpretation of observations about the movements of planets and their satellites.",
              "It: The opening sections of the Principia contain, in revised and extended form, nearly[14] all of the content of Newton's 1684 tract De motu corporum in gyrum.",
              "The Principia begin with \"Definitions\"[15] and \"Axioms or Laws of Motion\",[16] and continues in three books: Book 1, subtitled De motu corporum (On the motion of bodies) concerns motion in the absence of any resisting medium.",
              "It opens with a collection of mathematical lemmas on \"the method of first and last ratios\",[17] a geometrical form of infinitesimal calculus.",
              "[8] The second section establishes relationships between centripetal forces and the law of areas now known as Kepler's second law (Propositions 1\u20133),[18] and relates circular velocity and radius of path-curvature to radial force[19] (Proposition 4), and relationships between centripetal forces varying as the inverse-square of the distance to the center and orbits of conic-section form (Propositions 5\u201310).",
              "Propositions 11\u201331[20] establish properties of motion in paths of eccentric conic-section form including ellipses, and their relationship with inverse-square central forces directed to a focus and include Newton's theorem about ovals (lemma 28).",
              "Propositions 43\u201345[21] are demonstration that in an eccentric orbit under centripetal force where the apse may move, a steady non-moving orientation of the line of apses is an indicator of an inverse-square law of force.",
              "Book 1 contains some proofs with little connection to real-world dynamics.",
              "But there are also sections with far-reaching application to the solar system and universe: Propositions 57\u201369[22] deal with the \"motion of bodies drawn to one another by centripetal forces\".",
              "This section is of primary interest for its application to the Solar System, and includes Proposition 66[23] along with its 22 corollaries:[24] here Newton took the first steps in the definition and study of the problem of the movements of three massive bodies subject to their mutually perturbing gravitational attractions, a problem which later gained name and fame (among other reasons, for its great difficulty) as the three-body problem.",
              "Propositions 70\u201384[25] deal with the attractive forces of spherical bodies.",
              "The section contains Newton's proof that a massive spherically symmetrical body attracts other bodies outside itself as if all its mass were concentrated at its centre.",
              "This fundamental result, called the Shell theorem, enables the inverse square law of gravitation to be applied to the real solar system to a very close degree of approximation.",
              "Part of the contents originally planned for the first book was divided out into a second book, which largely concerns motion through resisting mediums. Just as Newton examined consequences of different conceivable laws of attraction in Book 1, here he examines different conceivable laws of resistance;",
              "thus Section 1 discusses resistance in direct proportion to velocity, and Section 2 goes on to examine the implications of resistance in proportion to the square of velocity.",
              "Book 2 also discusses (in Section 5) hydrostatics and the properties of compressible fluids;",
              "Newton also derives Boyle's law.",
              "[26] The effects of air resistance on pendulums are studied in Section 6, along with Newton's account of experiments that he carried out, to try to find out some characteristics of air resistance in reality by observing the motions of pendulums under different conditions.",
              "Newton compares the resistance offered by a medium against motions of globes with different properties (material, weight, size).",
              "In Section 8, he derives rules to determine the speed of waves in fluids and relates them to the density and condensation (Proposition 48;",
              "[27] this would become very important in acoustics).",
              "He assumes that these rules apply equally to light and sound and estimates that the speed of sound is around 1088 feet per second and can increase depending on the amount of water in air.",
              "[28] Less of Book 2 has stood the test of time than of Books 1 and 3, and it has been said that Book 2 was largely written to refute a theory of Descartes which had some wide acceptance before Newton's work (and for some time after).",
              "According to Descartes's Cartesian theory of vortices, planetary motions were produced by the whirling of fluid vortices that filled interplanetary space and carried the planets along with them.",
              "[29] Newton wrote at the end of Book 2[30] his conclusion that the hypothesis of vortices was completely at odds with the astronomical phenomena, and served not so much to explain as to confuse them.",
              "Book 3, subtitled De mundi systemate (On the system of the world), is an exposition of many consequences of universal gravitation, especially its consequences for astronomy.",
              "It builds upon the propositions of the previous books and applies them with further specificity than in Book 1 to the motions observed in the Solar System.",
              "Here (introduced by Proposition 22,[31] and continuing in Propositions 25\u201335[32]) are developed several of the features and irregularities of the orbital motion of the Moon, especially the variation.",
              "Newton lists the astronomical observations on which he relies,[33] and establishes in a stepwise manner that the inverse square law of mutual gravitation applies to Solar System bodies, starting with the satellites of Jupiter[34] and going on by stages to show that the law is of universal application.",
              "[35] He also gives starting at Lemma 4[36] and Proposition 40[37] the theory of the motions of comets, for which much data came from John Flamsteed and Edmond Halley, and accounts for the tides,[38] attempting quantitative estimates of the contributions of the Sun[39] and Moon[40] to the tidal motions;",
              "and offers the first theory of the precession of the equinoxes.",
              "[41] Book 3 also considers the harmonic oscillator in three dimensions, and motion in arbitrary force laws.",
              "In Book 3 Newton also made clear his heliocentric view of the Solar System, modified in a somewhat modern way, since already in the mid-1680s he recognised the \"deviation of the Sun\" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System.",
              "[42] For Newton, \"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World\",[43] and that this centre \"either is at rest, or moves uniformly forward in a right line\".",
              "[44] Newton rejected the second alternative after adopting the position that \"the centre of the system of the world is immoveable\", which \"is acknowledg'd by all, while some contend that the Earth, others, that the Sun is fix'd in that centre\".",
              "[44] Newton estimated the mass ratios Sun:Jupiter and Sun:Saturn,[45] and pointed out that these put the centre of the Sun usually a little way off the common center of gravity, but only a little, the distance at most \"would scarcely amount to one diameter of the Sun\".",
              "[46] The sequence of definitions used in setting up dynamics in the Principia is recognisable in many textbooks today.",
              "Newton first set out the definition of mass The quantity of matter is that which arises conjointly from its density and magnitude.",
              "A body twice as dense in double the space is quadruple in quantity.",
              "This quantity I designate by the name of body or of mass.",
              "This was then used to define the \"quantity of motion\" (today called momentum), and the principle of inertia in which mass replaces the previous Cartesian notion of intrinsic force.",
              "This then set the stage for the introduction of forces through the change in momentum of a body.",
              "Curiously, for today's readers, the exposition looks dimensionally incorrect, since Newton does not introduce the dimension of time in rates of changes of quantities.",
              "He defined space and time \"not as they are well known to all\".",
              "Instead, he defined \"true\" time and space as \"absolute\"[47] and explained: Only I must observe, that the vulgar conceive those quantities under no other notions but from the relation they bear to perceptible objects.",
              "And it will be convenient to distinguish them into absolute and relative, true and apparent, mathematical and common.",
              ".",
              ".",
              ".",
              "instead of absolute places and motions, we use relative ones;",
              "and that without any inconvenience in common affairs;",
              "but in philosophical discussions, we ought to step back from our senses, and consider things themselves, distinct from what are only perceptible measures of them.",
              "To some modern readers it can appear that some dynamical quantities recognised today were used in the Principia but not named.",
              "The mathematical aspects of the first two books were so clearly consistent that they were easily accepted;",
              "for example, Locke asked Huygens whether he could trust the mathematical proofs and was assured about their correctness.",
              "However, the concept of an attractive force acting at a distance received a cooler response.",
              "In his notes, Newton wrote that the inverse square law arose naturally due to the structure of matter.",
              "However, he retracted this sentence in the published version, where he stated that the motion of planets is consistent with an inverse square law, but refused to speculate on the origin of the law.",
              "Huygens and Leibniz noted that the law was incompatible with the notion of the aether.",
              "From a Cartesian point of view, therefore, this was a faulty theory.",
              "Newton's defence has been adopted since by many famous physicists\u2014he pointed out that the mathematical form of the theory had to be correct since it explained the data, and he refused to speculate further on the basic nature of gravity.",
              "The sheer number of phenomena that could be organised by the theory was so impressive that younger \"philosophers\" soon adopted the methods and language of the Principia.",
              "Perhaps to reduce the risk of public misunderstanding, Newton included at the beginning of Book 3 (in the second (1713) and third (1726) editions) a section titled \"Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy\".",
              "In the four rules, as they came finally to stand in the 1726 edition, Newton effectively offers a methodology for handling unknown phenomena in nature and reaching towards explanations for them.",
              "The four Rules of the 1726 edition run as follows (omitting some explanatory comments that follow each): This section of Rules for philosophy is followed by a listing of \"Phenomena\", in which are listed a number of mainly astronomical observations, that Newton used as the basis for inferences later on, as if adopting a consensus set of facts from the astronomers of his time.",
              "Both the \"Rules\" and the \"Phenomena\" evolved from one edition of the Principia to the next.",
              "Rule 4 made its appearance in the third (1726) edition;",
              "Rules 1\u20133 were present as \"Rules\" in the second (1713) edition, and predecessors of them were also present in the first edition of 1687, but there they had a different heading: they were not given as \"Rules\", but rather in the first (1687) edition the predecessors of the three later \"Rules\", and of most of the later \"Phenomena\", were all lumped together under a single heading \"Hypotheses\" (in which the third item was the predecessor of a heavy revision that gave the later Rule 3).",
              "From this textual evolution, it appears that Newton wanted by the later headings \"Rules\" and \"Phenomena\" to clarify for his readers his view of the roles to be played by these various statements.",
              "In the third (1726) edition of the Principia, Newton explains each rule in an alternative way and/or gives an example to back up what the rule is claiming.",
              "The first rule is explained as a philosophers' principle of economy.",
              "The second rule states that if one cause is assigned to a natural effect, then the same cause so far as possible must be assigned to natural effects of the same kind: for example, respiration in humans and in animals, fires in the home and in the Sun, or the reflection of light whether it occurs terrestrially or from the planets.",
              "An extensive explanation is given of the third rule, concerning the qualities of bodies, and Newton discusses here the generalisation of observational results, with a caution against making up fancies contrary to experiments, and use of the rules to illustrate the observation of gravity and space.",
              "Isaac Newton's statement of the four rules revolutionised the investigation of phenomena.",
              "With these rules, Newton could in principle begin to address all of the world's present unsolved mysteries.",
              "He was able to use his new analytical method to replace that of Aristotle, and he was able to use his method to tweak and update Galileo's experimental method.",
              "The re-creation of Galileo's method has never been significantly changed and in its substance, scientists use it today.",
              "[citation needed] The General Scholium is a concluding essay added to the second edition, 1713 (and amended in the third edition, 1726).",
              "[48] It is not to be confused with the General Scholium at the end of Book 2, Section 6, which discusses his pendulum experiments and resistance due to air, water, and other fluids.",
              "Here Newton used the expression hypotheses non fingo, \"I formulate no hypotheses\",[9] in response to criticisms of the first edition of the Principia.",
              "(\"Fingo\" is sometimes nowadays translated \"feign\" rather than the traditional \"frame,\" although \"feign\" does not properly translate \"fingo\").",
              "Newton's gravitational attraction, an invisible force able to act over vast distances, had led to criticism that he had introduced \"occult agencies\" into science.",
              "[49] Newton firmly rejected such criticisms and wrote that it was enough that the phenomena implied gravitational attraction, as they did;",
              "but the phenomena did not so far indicate the cause of this gravity, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things not implied by the phenomena: such hypotheses \"have no place in experimental philosophy\", in contrast to the proper way in which \"particular propositions are inferr'd from the phenomena and afterwards rendered general by induction\".",
              "[50] Newton also underlined his criticism of the vortex theory of planetary motions, of Descartes, pointing to its incompatibility with the highly eccentric orbits of comets, which carry them \"through all parts of the heavens indifferently\".",
              "Newton also gave theological argument.",
              "From the system of the world, he inferred the existence of a god, along lines similar to what is sometimes called the argument from intelligent or purposive design.",
              "It has been suggested that Newton gave \"an oblique argument for a unitarian conception of God and an implicit attack on the doctrine of the Trinity\".",
              "[51][52] The General Scholium does not address or attempt to refute the church doctrine;",
              "it simply does not mention Jesus, the Holy Ghost, or the hypothesis of the Trinity.",
              "In January 1684, Edmond Halley, Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke had a conversation in which Hooke claimed to not only have derived the inverse-square law but also all the laws of planetary motion.",
              "Wren was unconvinced, Hooke did not produce the claimed derivation although the others gave him time to do it, and Halley, who could derive the inverse-square law for the restricted circular case (by substituting Kepler's relation into Huygens' formula for the centrifugal force) but failed to derive the relation generally, resolved to ask Newton.",
              "[53] Halley's visits to Newton in 1684 thus resulted from Halley's debates about planetary motion with Wren and Hooke, and they seem to have provided Newton with the incentive and spur to develop and write what became Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica.",
              "Halley was at that time a Fellow and Council member of the Royal Society in London (positions that in 1686 he resigned to become the Society's paid Clerk).",
              "[54] Halley's visit to Newton in Cambridge in 1684 probably occurred in August.",
              "[55] When Halley asked Newton's opinion on the problem of planetary motions discussed earlier that year between Halley, Hooke and Wren,[56] Newton surprised Halley by saying that he had already made the derivations some time ago;",
              "but that he could not find the papers.",
              "(Matching accounts of this meeting come from Halley and Abraham De Moivre to whom Newton confided.)",
              "Halley then had to wait for Newton to \"find\" the results, and in November 1684 Newton sent Halley an amplified version of whatever previous work Newton had done on the subject.",
              "This took the form of a 9-page manuscript, De motu corporum in gyrum (Of the motion of bodies in an orbit): the title is shown on some surviving copies, although the (lost) original may have been without a title.",
              "Newton's tract De motu corporum in gyrum, which he sent to Halley in late 1684, derived what is now known as the three laws of Kepler, assuming an inverse square law of force, and generalised the result to conic sections.",
              "It also extended the methodology by adding the solution of a problem on the motion of a body through a resisting medium.",
              "The contents of De motu so excited Halley by their mathematical and physical originality and far-reaching implications for astronomical theory, that he immediately went to visit Newton again, in November 1684, to ask Newton to let the Royal Society have more of such work.",
              "[57] The results of their meetings clearly helped to stimulate Newton with the enthusiasm needed to take his investigations of mathematical problems much further in this area of physical science, and he did so in a period of highly concentrated work that lasted at least until mid-1686.",
              "[58] Newton's single-minded attention to his work generally, and to his project during this time, is shown by later reminiscences from his secretary and copyist of the period, Humphrey Newton.",
              "His account tells of Isaac Newton's absorption in his studies, how he sometimes forgot his food, or his sleep, or the state of his clothes, and how when he took a walk in his garden he would sometimes rush back to his room with some new thought, not even waiting to sit before beginning to write it down.",
              "[59] Other evidence also shows Newton's absorption in the Principia: Newton for years kept up a regular programme of chemical or alchemical experiments, and he normally kept dated notes of them, but for a period from May 1684 to April 1686, Newton's chemical notebooks have no entries at all.",
              "[60] So, it seems that Newton abandoned pursuits to which he was formally dedicated and did very little else for well over a year and a half, but concentrated on developing and writing what became his great work.",
              "The first of the three constituent books was sent to Halley for the printer in spring 1686, and the other two books somewhat later.",
              "The complete work, published by Halley at his own financial risk,[61] appeared in July 1687.",
              "Newton had also communicated De motu to Flamsteed, and during the period of composition, he exchanged a few letters with Flamsteed about observational data on the planets, eventually acknowledging Flamsteed's contributions in the published version of the Principia of 1687.",
              "The process of writing that first edition of the Principia went through several stages and drafts: some parts of the preliminary materials still survive, while others are lost except for fragments and cross-references in other documents.",
              "[62] Surviving materials show that Newton (up to some time in 1685) conceived his book as a two-volume work.",
              "The first volume was to be titled De motu corporum, Liber primus, with contents that later appeared in extended form as Book 1 of the Principia.",
              "[citation needed] A fair-copy draft of Newton's planned second volume De motu corporum, Liber Secundus survives, its completion dated to about the summer of 1685.",
              "It covers the application of the results of Liber primus to the Earth, the Moon, the tides, the Solar System, and the universe;",
              "in this respect, it has much the same purpose as the final Book 3 of the Principia, but it is written much less formally and is more easily read.",
              "[citation needed] It is not known just why Newton changed his mind so radically about the final form of what had been a readable narrative in De motu corporum, Liber Secundus of 1685, but he largely started afresh in a new, tighter, and less accessible mathematical style, eventually to produce Book 3 of the Principia as we know it.",
              "Newton frankly admitted that this change of style was deliberate when he wrote that he had (first) composed this book \"in a popular method, that it might be read by many\", but to \"prevent the disputes\" by readers who could not \"lay aside the[ir] prejudices\", he had \"reduced\" it \"into the form of propositions (in the mathematical way) which should be read by those only, who had first made themselves masters of the principles established in the preceding books\".",
              "[63] The final Book 3 also contained in addition some further important quantitative results arrived at by Newton in the meantime, especially about the theory of the motions of comets, and some of the perturbations of the motions of the Moon.",
              "The result was numbered Book 3 of the Principia rather than Book 2 because in the meantime, drafts of Liber primus had expanded and Newton had divided it into two books.",
              "The new and final Book 2 was concerned largely with the motions of bodies through resisting mediums.[64] But the Liber Secundus of 1685 can still be read today.",
              "Even after it was superseded by Book 3 of the Principia, it survived complete, in more than one manuscript.",
              "After Newton's death in 1727, the relatively accessible character of its writing encouraged the publication of an English translation in 1728 (by persons still unknown, not authorised by Newton's heirs).",
              "It appeared under the English title A Treatise of the System of the World.",
              "[65] This had some amendments relative to Newton's manuscript of 1685, mostly to remove cross-references that used obsolete numbering to cite the propositions of an early draft of Book 1 of the Principia.",
              "Newton's heirs shortly afterwards published the Latin version in their possession, also in 1728, under the (new) title De Mundi Systemate, amended to update cross-references, citations and diagrams to those of the later editions of the Principia, making it look superficially as if it had been written by Newton after the Principia, rather than before.",
              "[66] The System of the World was sufficiently popular to stimulate two revisions (with similar changes as in the Latin printing), a second edition (1731), and a \"corrected\" reprint[67] of the second edition (1740).",

              "When Hooke's claim was made known to Newton, who hated disputes, Newton threatened to withdraw and suppress Book 3 altogether, but Halley, showing considerable diplomatic skills, tactfully persuaded Newton to withdraw his threat and let it go forward to publication.",
              "Samuel Pepys, as president, gave his imprimatur on 30 June 1686, licensing the book for publication.",
              "The Society had just spent its book budget on De Historia piscium,[68] and the cost of publication was borne by Edmund Halley (who was also then acting as publisher of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society):[69] the book appeared in summer 1687.",

              "Rather, their speed varies so that the line joining the centres of the sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.",
              "To these two laws he added a third a decade later, in his 1619 book Harmonices Mundi (Harmonies of the world).",

              "Descartes' book of 1644 Principia philosophiae (Principles of philosophy) stated that bodies can act on each other only through contact: a principle that induced people, among them himself, to hypothesize a universal medium as the carrier of interactions such as light and gravity\u2014the aether.",
              "Newton was criticized for apparently introducing forces that acted at distance without any medium.",
              "[49] Not until the development of particle theory was Descartes' notion vindicated when it was possible to describe all interactions, like the strong, weak, and electromagnetic fundamental interactions, using mediating gauge bosons[72] and gravity through hypothesized gravitons.",
              "[73] Newton had studied these books, or, in some cases, secondary sources based on them, and taken notes entitled Quaestiones quaedam philosophicae (Questions about philosophy) during his days as an undergraduate.",
              "During this period (1664\u20131666) he created the basis of calculus and performed the first experiments in the optics of color.",
              "At this time, his proof that white light was a combination of primary colors (found via prismatics) replaced the prevailing theory of colors and received an overwhelmingly favorable response and occasioned bitter disputes with Robert Hooke and others, which forced him to sharpen his ideas to the point where he already composed sections of his later book Opticks by the 1670s in response.",
              "Work on calculus is shown in various papers and letters, including two to Leibniz.",

              "Surviving manuscripts of the 1660s also show Newton's interest in planetary motion and that by 1669 he had shown, for a circular case of planetary motion, that the force he called \"endeavour to recede\" (now called centrifugal force) had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.",
              "[74] After his 1679\u20131680 correspondence with Hooke, described below, Newton adopted the language of inward or centripetal force.",

              "Bruce Brackenridge, although much has been made of the change in language and difference of point of view, as between centrifugal or centripetal forces, the actual computations and proofs remained the same either way.",
              "They also involved the combination of tangential and radial displacements, which Newton was making in the 1660s.",
              "The difference between the centrifugal and centripetal points of view, though a significant change of perspective, did not change the analysis.",
              "[75] Newton also clearly expressed the concept of linear inertia in the 1660s: for this Newton was indebted to Descartes' work published 1644.",
              "[76] Hooke published his ideas about gravitation in the 1660s and again in 1674.",
              "He argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in Micrographia of 1665, in a 1666 Royal Society lecture On gravity, and again in 1674, when he published his ideas about the System of the World in somewhat developed form, as an addition to An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations.",
              "[77] Hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions between the Sun and planets, in a way that increased with nearness to the attracting body, along with a principle of linear inertia.",
              "Hooke's statements up to 1674 made no mention, however, that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions.",

              "[78] Hooke also did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration.",
              "On these two aspects, Hooke stated in 1674: \"Now what these several degrees [of gravitational attraction] are I have not yet experimentally verified\" (indicating that he did not yet know what law the gravitation might follow);",
              "and as to his whole proposal: \"This I only hint at present\", \"having my self many other things in hand which I would first compleat, and therefore cannot so well attend it\" (i.",
              "e., \"prosecuting this Inquiry\").",
              "[77] In November 1679, Hooke began an exchange of letters with Newton, of which the full text is now published.",
              "[79] Hooke told Newton that Hooke had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence,[80] and wished to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others;",
              "and as if to whet Newton's interest, he asked what Newton thought about various matters, giving a whole list, mentioning \"compounding the celestial motions of the planets of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body\", and \"my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse\", and then a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions (which Hooke described at length), and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys, the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge, and other items. Newton's reply offered \"a fansy of my own\" about a terrestrial experiment (not a proposal about celestial motions) which might detect the Earth's motion, by the use of a body first suspended in air and then dropped to let it fall.",
              "The main point was to indicate how Newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the Earth's motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical, but he went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid Earth had not been in the way (on a spiral path to the centre).",
              "Hooke disagreed with Newton's idea of how the body would continue to move.",
              "[81] A short further correspondence developed, and towards the end of it Hooke, writing on 6 January 1680 to Newton, communicated his \"supposition .",

              "[83]) In 1686, when the first book of Newton's Principia was presented to the Royal Society, Hooke claimed that Newton had obtained from him the \"notion\" of \"the rule of the decrease of Gravity, being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the Center\".",
              "At the same time (according to Edmond Halley's contemporary report) Hooke agreed that \"the Demonstration of the Curves generated therby\" was wholly Newton's.",
              "[79] A recent assessment about the early history of the inverse square law is that \"by the late 1660s\", the assumption of an \"inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons\".",
              "[84] Newton himself had shown in the 1660s that for planetary motion under a circular assumption, force in the radial direction had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.",
              "[74] Newton, faced in May 1686 with Hooke's claim on the inverse square law, denied that Hooke was to be credited as author of the idea, giving reasons including the citation of prior work by others before Hooke.",
              "[79] Newton also firmly claimed that even if it had happened that he had first heard of the inverse square proportion from Hooke, which it had not, he would still have some rights to it in view of his mathematical developments and demonstrations, which enabled observations to be relied on as evidence of its accuracy, while Hooke, without mathematical demonstrations and evidence in favour of the supposition, could only guess (according to Newton) that it was approximately valid \"at great distances from the center\".",
              "[79] The background described above shows there was basis for Newton to deny deriving the inverse square law from Hooke.",

              "[111] It seems that Bentley then realised that the editorship was technically too difficult for him, and with Newton's consent he appointed Roger Cotes, Plumian professor of astronomy at Trinity, to undertake the editorship for him as a kind of deputy (but Bentley still made the publishing arrangements and had the financial responsibility and profit).",
