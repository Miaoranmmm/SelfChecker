    "query": "What is the history and cultural significance behind the traditional Argentine tango, and how has it evolved over time to become a revered art form worldwide?",
    "response": "That's a great question. The Argentine tango is a dance and musical form that originated in Buenos Aires in the late 19th century, and has since become a revered art form worldwide. It is a result of the cultural mix of European immigrants, indigenous Argentinians and former slaves who lived in the poor neighborhoods of the city[^1^] [^2^]. The tango was initially a dance between two men, resembling a duel, and later involved women, especially prostitutes who used it to seduce clients[^2^]. The tango was considered to be the dance of the lower classes, but it also attracted the curiosity of the upper classes who slummed in the bars and nightclubs where it was performed[^3^]. The tango reached its peak of popularity in the 1940s and early 1950s, which is known as the Golden Age of tango[^3^]. However, it declined after the military coup that overthrew Juan Peron in 1955, which imposed curfews and censorship that affected the nightlife and culture of Buenos Aires[^3^]. The tango was revived in the 1980s, thanks to several shows that toured Europe and the US, such as Tango Argentino, and the interest of young Argentinians who rediscovered the dance of their grandparents[^3^]. Today, the tango is recognized as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO, and is performed and taught in many countries around the world[^4^] [^5^]. The tango is not only a dance, but also a musical genre that combines elements of European, African and criollo traditions. The main instrument of tango music is the bandoneon, a type of accordion that was imported from Germany in the late 19th century[^5^]. The tango music has evolved over time, from the traditional style of the Golden Age to the modern style of Astor Piazzolla and others who incorporated elements of jazz, classical and rock music into their compositions[^6^]. The tango is also a social activity that brings people together in dance parties called milongas, where dancers follow a set of etiquette rules and codes to respect each other and enjoy the music[^3^]. The tango is a complex and expressive dance that requires skill, passion and connection between partners. It is also a reflection of Argentina's history and culture, and a symbol of its identity and diversity.",

              "Written by Carla Chinski, Content Marketing Manager for Vamos Academy The definite Argentine star of the show, tango is a dance that embodies the essence of Buenos Aires.",
              "It is slow, sexy, and much harder than it looks.",
              "It is widely regarded as one of those \u201cmust-do\u201d events for people visiting Buenos Aires;",
              "there are a wide range of places to watch it and try it out.",
              "Tango seems to be a lot like jazz music: people either love it or hate it.",
              "It requires a lot of patience and precision.",
              "As improvisational as a dance can be, you are still bound to your partner with limitations.",
              "Getting to the level of complete free will and still making your partner looks brilliant, it takes years and years of practice.",
              "This dance is all about confidence.",
              "The leading partner must control everything and move with bold and calculated exactitude.",
              "Any sign of hesitation will be noticeable, and can very easily throw off the rhythm and your dancing partner.",
              "Once you become a more advanced dancer, you\u2019ll learn to mix-and-match the moves, leaving a lot of room for improvisation.",
              "The person in charge will use their hands and chest to direct their partner through the moves.",
              "There is a great amount of balance involved, so when the dance moves started requiring crossed legs and dynamic foot movements, it can get tricky, like tight-rope walking.",
              "Either way, it is definitely worth checking out during your time in Buenos Aires.",
              "Tango is originally a working-class dance from the Ri\u0301o de la Plata around the twentieth century.",
              "It is said that tango has african-american roots, and that the dance is pretty associated to other folkloric dances like the milonga and the candombe.",
              "The dance was accompanied by instruments like piano and guitar.",
              "Song lyrics began to be crafted in lunfardo (the slang of the lower-middle class, convicts and immigrants), and so the poetry became increasingly important.",
              "The poetry of tango tends to be sultry, nostalgic and very sentimental.",
              "Songs like \u201cMi Buenos Aires Querido\u201d and \u201cPor Una Cabeza\u201d are romantically-themed songs, and in time they\u2019ve become world-famous.",

              "Carlos Gardel surely sounds familiar because of his starring roles in film and his international fame.",
              "Nowadays, tango has expanded well beyond its national origins and into different cultures like to become a part of Asian customs, for instance.",
              "Other influential composers include Astor Piazolla.",
              "The style of his pieces are easily identifiable for their integration of jazz instrumentation and improvisation.",

              "There are many milongas in the city of Buenos Aires.",
              "But what exactly is a Milonga?",
              "Well, a milonga describes the scene and place where people dance tango and practice the dance, be it with others or individually.",
              "There are many options for milongas in all the districs;",
              "the milongas form what\u2019s called a \u201ccircuito milonguero\u201d (milonga circle).",
              "All these terms can sound confusing;",
              "and besides, communication when dancing tango is key, even if bodily communication might seem good enough.",
              "We should note that milongas in Buenos Aires, just like the city night-life in general, take place at night and can go on until dawn.",
              "The meaning of a \u201cmilonga\u201d refers to both the event (to go to a milonga) and the dance itself (to dance a milonga).",
              "Milonga music stems from the payada, which is a genre of music belonging to gaucho culture, featuring a musical counterpoint and elements from the habanera.",
              "A milonga can take place in a bar, neighborhood club or salon, so each one will have a different feel.",
              "But what they all have in common is that they\u2019re spaces for learning: whether you\u2019re a beginning, intermediate or well-seasoned dancer, there\u2019s a place for you in the milonga scene.",
              "And although tango may seem like a coupled ordeal, there\u2019s a group component to practicing this dance.",
              "It\u2019s nice to learn with and from others, although you can also get individual tango lessons.",
              "As such, milongas are semi-formal and traditional events, meaning that certain attire is expected, and there are social norms regarding how to behave in the tango community (this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be yourself, though.)",
              "It\u2019s best to approach a milonga with no previous expectations and loosen up!",
              "Nowadays, in COVID-19 times, people interested in dancing tango (especially tourists!)",
              "are expected to dance with a roommate or already established partner to ensure sanitary safety.",
              "Some of these rules have been enforced and implemented by the city Government according to existing rules and regulations.",
              "You should check out times and slots available for tango and milongas;",
              "there are reduced quotas for dancing to ensure proper social distancing and air circulation.",
              "According to government regulations for 2021, \u201cEach shift will last up to two hours, with 30 minutes breaks between each one to sanitize and air out the premises.",
              "\u201d Plus, in order to take part in a milonga, you need a pase sanitario (sanitary pass), which you can get from an Android or iOs app store, called \u201cCUIDAR\u201d.",
              "There, you only have to input whatever symptoms you currently have (or don\u2019t have), and you\u2019ll get a 24-hour pass to take part in group activities.",
              "As of late, because infection numbers have decreased plenty, there is no \u201caforo\u201d (limited capacity) being enforced, so there\u2019s a possibility that opening hours and quotas will be more extended in the future.",
              "Another way of dancing that\u2019s growing more and more popular are the \u201cmilongas al aire libre\u201d (street tango dancing), because, of course, outdoor activities are safer than events that take place inside.",
              "Check out this video to see how it works: Futhermore, because tango is a physical activity, people are required to practice social distancing at all times\u2013remember: social distancing means keeping a 1.",
              "5 meter distance between each couple.",
              "You will probably see marks on the floor to help you keep proper distance with others.",
              "So, to get acclimated and accustomed to the tango scene in Buenos Aires, you should know there are different types of spaces to suit your needs: there are those milongas that are known as \u201cpra\u0301cticas\u201d (practice spaces) for tango beginners.",
              "In these pra\u0301cticas you can be sure you won\u2019t be judged for making mistakes while dancing, and you can take your time to learn by practice.",
              "This is adviseable for people with little to no experience.",
              "Another tip is to go to milongas in the afternoon\u2013to whichever space you\u2019re interested in specifically\u2013and ask the teacher that\u2019s available at the moment when he or she can give you lessons, how much they cost and if they work with beginning tango dancers.",
              "If you like the teacher, you can search for them on social media;",
              "if you don\u2019t have a specific person in mind, just try out one lesson to see what it\u2019s like!",
              "You can always switch teachers or partners (giving previous notice, of course.)",
              "It\u2019s a normal part of the learning process to also learn how to be patient with yourself: don\u2019t expect to be a professional dancer in a couple of weeks.",
              "It\u2019s also a good idea to plan ahead and think to what extent you want to plan your trip around tango dancing in the city.",
              "Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, many tango venues in Buenos Aires have shut down permanently.",
              "However, the best way to find out about what\u2019s going in in tango in the city of Buenos Aires and Argentina is to check out milonga magazines, that is, specific publications aimed at tango enthusiasts.",
              "It\u2019s also a fact that lots of milonga magazines that used to be a staple for the tango community are now shut down, or no longer exist\u2013this is true of a well known magazine, like DNI tango.",
              "But worry not: we still have two options for you.",
              "We recommend using a magazine to check out daily options for tango events, as well as for internationally-known events and venues;",
              "even info to contact a teacher you\u2019re interested in.",
              "The walk: What can the tango walk teach us?",
              "First, in the same way that we need to know how to walk with grace and balance before dancing, we need to know how to be ourselves before we can be in a relationship.",
              "There isn\u2019t anyone on this earth that can teach us how to be ourselves, because we aren\u2019t all the same.",
              "We need to define our individuality before we can be with another person.",
              "It\u2019s the same way that being single for a period of time can be a good thing.",
              "In that time we can cultivate our garden so that we can offer something to our partner.",
              "The stance: What\u2019s surprising about the tango stance is how much freedom is given with this step.",
              "In the stance, the couple is connected chest-to-chest.",
              "But at the level of the hips, each partner has plenty of space to do what they want.",
              "The change of pace: There are some movements of tango that involve a couple breaking away from each other in order to change pace.",
              "These movements coincide in beautifully with the music.",
              "La sacada: The sacada is my favorite part.",
              "The man blocks the foot of the woman, and she needs to overcome that with grace.",
              "Los molinetes: Finally, there is the molinetes \u2013 when the woman turns around the man.",
              "The woman needs, during the molinete, to maintain the connection of her chest with the man\u2019s chest to appear graceful.",
              "It\u2019s a difficult movement and it\u2019s easy to lose this connection between man and woman.",
              "If you\u2019re an experienced dancer, you might want to skip the regular learning process and go straight to the nitty-gritty.",
              "It\u2019s true that most more or less established milongas impart lessons for advanced, intermediate and beginner students.",
              "But it\u2019s more likely that in a popular milonga club you\u2019ll get access to specific, world-renowed teachers.",
              "It\u2019s also likely that you know your stuff, so don\u2019t be afraid\u2013as we\u2019ve already said\u2013to contact a specific teacher and find out where he or she works, to ask for private, individual lessons.",

              "With the rich history, numerous types and styles, and incredible appeal, tango dance remains one of the most popular dances in the entire world.",
              "Tango Etymology The exact origin of the word \u2018tango\u2019 cannot be located entirely, and many modern historians believe that several events and words shaped the name of this dance.",
              "Some of the most popular theories is that tango signified some other style of music that was popular in 17th and 18th century Argentina and Uruguay, that was taken from Spanish language where tango dancing (of a much different style than its modern version) become popular in the 19th century, or that it was taken from some Niger-Congo languages of Africa.",
              "No matter what its exact origins are, the words \u201c tango\u201d and \u201ctambo\u201d started being used for naming dance and musical gatherings of slaves in the region of the basin of River Plata.",
              "As this term started gaining popularity, it quickly became a synonym for the entire tango dance and tango music style.",
              "First historical record of the word \u201ctango\u201d can be found in the government proclamation in Argentina dated to 1789, in which authorities place a ban on \u201ctango\u201d musical gatherings that were frequented by slaves, lower classes of free people living in the port areas of Buenos Aires.",
              "The commonplace use of the word Tango in Argentina gained traction around 100 years later, near the very end of 19th century.",

              "It is important to mention that the initial burst of popularity of Tango dance was fueled with the emotions of thousands of young immigrant men who arrived in Argentina searching for better life.",
              "Hundreds of their influenced re-shaped original tango into a modern form that managed to eventually capture the imagination of wealthier Argentine citizens, who managed to spread this incredible dance around the world, starting with their visits to Paris in the early 1900s where this dance quickly became an overnight sensation.",

              "Andalusian tango was performed by one or two pairs of women with castanets, with very strong public frowns and fears that this mix of tango and flamenco was immoral and very flirty.",

              "A mix of the people from Africa, Spain, Italy, England, Poland, Russia and native-born Argentinian created a very potent cultural mix that soon started forming new traditions and a new way of life.",
              "One of those newly created things came from the mix of European minuet dances, polkas and many African influences that brought rhythms and instruments that formed Tango, a dance that very quickly became very popular in the poor neighborhood of Buenos Aires in the late 1880s where it was known as \u201cmusic of the immigrants\u201d.",
              "By mid-1800s, tango becomes a dance of choice during \u201cconventillos \u201d gatherings (large houses owned by several families, which featured dance halls or open ground suitable for dance gatherings) in the booming city of Buenos Aires.",
              "Fueled by closed codes of those houses, particular language used during a gathering, the dance became more and more popular, eventually starting to be danced by actors on the stages of the theater houses.",

              "Argentine Tango as a dance and musical form developed in Buenos Aires at the end of the 19th Century, and arrived in Europe and then the US in the first decades of the 1900s.",
              "This is the mode of dance that evolved into Ballroom tango, familiar to us from Rudy Valentino in the classic, anti-war silent movie \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\".",
              "The roots of tango came from urban folkloric dances of the poorer neighborhoods, a mixture of Spanish, Criollo (Gaucho/Native from the countryside) and certainly African elements.",
              "In the great immigrant flow of the early 20th century, tango became the culture of Buenos Aires of neighborhoods, bars, nightclubs, and popular theater.",
              "Tango has typically been considered to be the dance of the lower classes, but that didn't keep rich kids from slumming, and in the nicer neighborhoods, the servants and children grew up listening to tango played on victrolas, street musicians and organ grinders, the radio and movies.",
              "The tango continued to evolve in Buenos Aires, up through the early 1940s, which we call the \"Golden Age\" of tango.",
              "The Argentine Tango looks nothing at all like International or American ballroom tango.",
              "At its peak in the 1940s and early 50s, Tango had moved from the lower classes into the middle class.",
              "Tango fell out of favor when the Military Government overthrew Juan Peron in the mid-1950s.",
              "It wasn't that the Military banned tango;",
              "rather that they eliminated the night life through curfews and harassment.",
              "There was a moralistic element at work: proper society still thought of tango as a lifestyle of womanizers and layabouts.",
              "At the same time the generation of tango dancers who came of age in the 1940s eventually got married, had kids, and musical tastes became influenced by foreign music and dance like 50s rock-and-roll, 60s rock, 70s Argentine folk music and 80s \"Tropical\" (i.",

              "Tango dancing carried on in smaller, family parties, neighborhood dances, and performance shows.",
              "The worldwide tango revival from the 1980s to the present, began in Europe as a younger generation became entranced by watching several tango shows, notably \"Tango Argentino\", and the famous milonguero and stage dancer, Eduardo Arquimbao.",
              "Validated in Europe, young Argentines began studying the dance of their Grandparents.",
              "In the US only a few cities had tango before 1995, which was the year the present wave exploded across the country.",

              "A couple\u2014with their bodies pressed up closely against one another from cheek to rib cage, and the leader\u2019s arm around their partner\u2019s waist\u2014would launch into intricate steps, sinuous yet sharp, with dramatic turns followed by a sudden suggestive pause, which set up another similar series of steps.",
              "News spread about the dance, which people were calling the tango.",
              "Accompanied by the melancholy sound of the accordion-like bandoneo\u0301n, it expressed sadness, passion, and, most shockingly to some, sensuality.",
              "To high-society Argentines, accustomed to the polite formality of the waltz, this departure from propriety was made all the more offensive by its low-class origins.",

              "Color and verve Historian Simon Collier, in his book Tango, refers to the first eyewitness description of the dance in 1877, when the African Argentines were seen doing an improvisation of the candombe they called the tango, in which couples danced apart.",
              "As Collier tells it, groups of poor compadritos, the street-tough hipsters of Buenos Aires, visited African-Argentine dance venues, brought the dance back to their ramshackle barrios, and incorporated it into the milonga.",

              "The majority of immigrants were men, which meant competition for female companionship was fierce.",

              "However, it seems like the military often turned a blind eye to minors being out after curfew during rock concerts while keeping the rule in observance for milongas (tango dance parties).",
              "According to Solis, this, like most things, had to do with money.",
              "Rock venues made more profit than tango venues, and could thus afford to bribe government officials.",

              "Because there are never too many comical twists in history, the military regimes and rock also helped set the stage for tango\u2019s comeback.",
              "As Solis explains, in exile, Argentines started to come to the genre as a way to connect with their lost nation and bring it to Europe and North America.",
              "Hector Orezzoli, co-producer of the 1985 Broadway sensation Tango Argentino explained to the New York Times that Argentinians wanted to be European, so they thought of tango as tacky.",
              "Actual Europeans, however, couldn\u2019t get enough of it.",

              "Originally founded along the Rio de la Plata, the river that separates Argentina from Uruguay, in the 1880s, it should come as no surprise that tango eventually took the world by storm, since so many corners of the globe influenced its creation.",
              "Drawing inspiration from both African and European cultures, tango was influenced by Cuba\u2019s habanera dance, Argentinia\u2019s milonga and the traditional candombe dances of Argentina\u2019s African population.",
              "Much like the dance of the same name, tango music originated in lower-class areas of Buenos Aires and Montevideo and drew from multiple musical backgrounds, merging them together to create the distinct style we recognize today.",

              "When the Great Depression began in the 1930s, tango was not immune.",
              "The Depression coincided with the overthrow of the Argentinian government at that time, meaning that the focus of the Argentinian people was elsewhere (and few were in the mood for dancing).",

              "History of Argentine Tango - Dance of the Heart",
              "by Deb Sclar | Jun 20, 2013 | Tango History | 37 comments In the late 1800\u2019s, millions of European immigrants arrived on the shores of the Rio de la Plata in South America, in the two port cities of Montevideo, Uruguay and Buenos Aires, Argentina.",
              "Most of them were Italian and Spanish, and the vast majority were single young men looking to make their fortunes in America.",
              "They brought their music: the sweet sounds of the violin, the driving flamenco guitar, the strange mournful wail of the bandoneon \u2013 and their dances: the waltz, the mazurka, the polka \u2013 and mixed them with the Argentine folk music and dance, with the Cuban habanera, with the African candombe rhythms from the freed slaves\u2019 street parties.",
              "With very few women around, many of these young men found themselves looking for excitement in the bordello districts of the burgeoning port cities.",
              "The tango dance arose in these seedy waterfront areas from this turbulent mix, becoming a \u201cmating dance\u201d between barmaids and their customers in shady nightclubs.",
              "Shunned by the upper and middle classes in Argentina, it nevertheless became a sleazy fixture of urban nightlife in Buenos Aires.",
              "Young men in neighborhood gangs would practice the steps with each other in order to become skilled enough to win the attentions of a woman.",
              "A beginner would often dance the follower\u2019s part for six months to a year before being shown how to lead.",
              "As Argentina became very wealthy around the turn of the century, the sons of rich families would often look for adventure and excitement in the rougher parts of town, and learned the tango as part of their escapades.",
              "Some of these young men of privilege would show off the tango as a treat for their friends on their sojourns to Paris, then the cultural capital of the world.",
              "The Parisians were shocked and titillated by this raw, sensuous dance.",
              "This led to a \u201ctango craze\u201d that swept all of Europe, and reached America in the years just prior to World War I.",
              "New York newspapers in 1916 feature ads from over seven hundred tango establishments.",
              "While the original tango was disturbing to many arbiters of good taste, a heavily sanitized version of tango found its way into the European and American dance academies, where it remains a fixture in ballroom competitions today.",
              "But in Argentina, the blessings of the tango-mad people of Paris led to an acceptance of the original homegrown tango in all classes of society.",
              "Tango musicians found themselves elevated from roughneck street performers to respected and adored composers.",
              "The tango dance became the courtship ritual of the middle class.",
              "In the \u201940\u2019s, the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of tango, every night found half a million people dancing from midnight until 3 or 4 in the morning.",
              "The best tango orchestras would be booked for more than a year in advance.",
              "Each neighborhood would feature its own variation of tango, and intense rivalries often turned dance competitions into riots ended by the police.",
              "Elaborate unwritten codes of behavior in the \u201cmilongas\u201d or dance gatherings became as much a part of tango as the dance itself.",
              "Influenced by the rise of repressive military dictatorships in Argentina after World War II, tango dancing slowly declined in the face of curfews and clampdowns on public gatherings.",
              "Tango music developed a rich new concert-hall tradition, more and more removed from the dance.",
              "The culture of late-night dancing went underground, and nearly all the regular milongas closed their doors.",
              "Accompanying the return of democracy and social liberalization after the Falklands War of 1982-83, a groundswell of interest in learning to tango surfaced throughout Argentine society.",
              "A younger generation of dancers and teachers began reclaiming their tango heritage while re-examining the structural underpinnings of the dance they had inherited.",
              "Simultaneously and independently, the Paris debut of \u201cTango Argentino\u201d, a large tango touring stage production, brought the dance back to worldwide awareness.",
              "In theatrical reviews reminiscent of the shocked Parisians of two generations before, Broadway, London, and Paris again became enraptured by the smoldering passion in this exotic dance and music, cultivated in far-off Buenos Aires.",
              "A new generation of Argentine tango dancers, tango teachers, and tango musicians found receptive audiences for their country\u2019s primary cultural export.",
              "Audiences first enraptured by the stage spectacle of the big tango shows discovered for themselves the passionate pleasures of the social dance connection, available to anyone willing to invest a minimum of time in learning the silent vocabulary of the dance.",
              "Today, major cities around the world (including the Denver/Boulder metro area) feature active tango communities where strangers and acquaintances can once again meet to share the sweetness of \u201cthe three minutes that can last a lifetime.",
