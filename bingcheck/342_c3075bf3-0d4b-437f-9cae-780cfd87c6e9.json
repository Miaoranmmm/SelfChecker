    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. That's a very interesting question.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nAccording to some researchers, laughter has both biological and evolutionary purposes. Biologically, laughter can help regulate emotions, reduce stress, enhance immunity, and increase pain tolerance[^2^]. Evolutionarily, laughter can help establish and strengthen social bonds, signal safety and relief, and communicate playfulness and positive emotions[^1^] [^2^] [^4^] [^6^].\n\nLaughter is not unique to humans, as some other mammals such as great apes[^1^], rodents[^3^], and even rats[^5^] can produce vocalizations that resemble laughter when they are tickled or engaged in physical play. These sounds may have evolved from the labored breathing of physical play and later ritualized into a signal that is primarily produced during exhalation[^1^].\n\nHowever, human laughter is more complex and diverse than animal laughter, as it can be triggered by various stimuli such as humor, irony, sarcasm, or social cues. Human laughter also varies in intensity, duration, pitch, and context. Some researchers suggest that human laughter may have evolved from the panting sounds of our primate ancestors who used them to signal friendly intentions during social play[^6^].",

              "30, 1962, three schoolgirls started giggling in a boarding school classroom in the northeastern corner of what is now Tanzania\u2014and touched off a very strange epidemic.",
              "The three couldn\u2019t stop laughing\u2014and soon the uncontrollable cackles spread to their classmates.",
              "The laughing attacks lasted from a few minutes up to a few hours;",
              "one poor girl reportedly experienced symptoms for 16 straight days.",
              "Victims couldn\u2019t focus on their schoolwork, and would lash out if others tried to restrain them.",
              "When 95 of the school\u2019s 159 pupils had come down with what came to be known as omuneepo, the Swahili word for laughing disease, the school shut down.",
              "The students returned to their villages, taking omuneepo with them.",
              "The affliction spread from person to person, school to school, village to village.",
              "\u201cThe education of the children is being seriously interfered with and there is considerable fear among the village communities,\u201d noted local medical officers in a 1963 report in the Central African Journal of Medicine.",
              "They could find no explanation for the matter.",
              "When the epidemic finally died down months later, roughly a thousand people had been struck by the \u201claughing disease.",
              "\u201d As part of our effort to understand what makes people laugh, we traveled to northeastern Tanzania, tracing omuneepo\u2019s spread across the region more than a half-century ago.",
              "We tracked down teachers, students, and medical experts who experienced the phenomenon firsthand.",
              "We learned there was nothing funny at all about the situation at the time.",
              "The religious boarding school where the laughter began was marked by strict rules, windowless dorms, and devilishly uncomfortably chairs designed to promote correct posture.",
              "Investigators found similar conditions at other locations where the omuneepo later erupted: Serious overcrowding, poor food quality.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s a form of complaint,\u201d Kroeber Rugliyama, a longtime local psychiatrist said of the mysterious laughter.",
              "\u201cThey had no alternative form of expression.",
              "\u201d Laughter is a vexing subject even when it\u2019s not spreading through the countryside like a virulent disease.",
              "Take the work of Robert Provine, a neuroscientist and psychology professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.",
              "For his book, Laughter: A Scientific Investigation, Provine engaged in what he called \u201csidewalk neuroscience,\u201d tracking and observing real-world laughter.",
              "He and his collaborators used tape recorders to capture more than a thousand \u201claugh episodes\u201d in bars, shopping malls, cocktail parties, and class reunions.",
              "And he had dozens of student volunteers note in a \u201claugh log\u201d the circumstances around every time they tittered, chuckled, or guffawed.",
              "The results were surprising, even to Provine: Less than 20 percent of the real-world laughter incidents he cataloged were in response to anything resembling something funny.",
              "Far more often, people were giggling or chuckling at innocuous statements such as \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys later,\u201d \u201cI see your point,\u201d and \u201cLook, it\u2019s Andre!",
              "\u201d What\u2019s more, in all of these cases, the person who produced the laugh-provoking statement was 46 percent more likely to be the one chuckling than the person listening.",
              "And while laughter might seem like something that can erupt at any point in response to something funny, in only eight of the 1,200 laugh episodes Provine cataloged did the laughter interrupt what somebody was saying.",
              "Instead, 99.",
              "9 percent of the time, laughter occurred in tidy, natural breaks in the conversation, punctuating the speech like a period or exclamation point.",
              "Provine discovered that the laughter of our everyday lives isn\u2019t for the most part in response to anything resembling jokes.",
              "Instead, most of it occurs in conversations that, out of context, don\u2019t seem funny at all.",
              "Provine\u2019s discoveries suggest that laughter is inherently social, that at its core it\u2019s a form of communication and not just a byproduct of finding something funny.",
              "Sure enough, when Provine went through the laugh logs he\u2019d collected, he found his participants were 30 times more likely to laugh in the presence of others than when they were alone.",
              "Among the few solitary instances of laughter, nearly all occurred in response to TV shows or other media\u2014that is, electronic proxies for other people.",
              "When people noted in their journals that they were truly alone, they hardly recorded any laughter at all.",
              "So why would we have evolved the odd and powerful vocal mannerism of laughter?",
              "Why do we have an innate need to share what we find funny with others, and why can it can resemble an out-of-control disease?",
              "Evolutionary theory is rife with possible explanations, but one of the most compelling was put forward in a 2005 Quarterly Review of Biology article by an undergrad named Matthew Gervais and his adviser, evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson.",
              "It\u2019s based on the efforts of a quirky 19th-century French physician named Guillaume Duchenne, who went around zapping people\u2019s faces with electrodes.",
              "Luckily for Duchenne, he worked at an old woman\u2019s hospice, so he had access to a lot of prone bodies.",
              "He must have been quite the charmer.",
              "According to articles on Duchenne, all the ladies wanted to be electrocuted by the \u201clittle old man with his mischief box.",
              "\u201d Applying the prongs of his box to people\u2019s faces, Duchenne evoked one kind of smiling\u2014the voluntary kind, the type of expression we produce when we a grin to be polite.",
              "This mannerism, he discovered, involves the face\u2019s zygomatic major muscles raising the corners of the mouth.",
              "But Duchenne discovered there was a second variety of smiling and laughing, one that occurs when we find something truly entertaining or funny.",
              "This expression was more complex, utilizing both the zygomatic major muscles and the orbicularis oculi muscles that form crow\u2019s feet around your eyes.",
              "It\u2019s why people say a real smile is in the eyes.",
              "Duchenne was never able to reproduce with his electrodes this second form of expression\u2014now known as a Duchenne smile or Duchenne laughter\u2014and he came to believe it was \u201conly put at play by the sweet emotion of the soul.",
              "\u201d More than a century later, Gervais and Wilson saw Duchenne\u2019s discovery as evidence that laughter evolved at two different points in human development.",
              "First, they posited, at a point sometime between 2 million and 4 million years ago, came Duchenne laughter, the kind triggered by something funny.",
              "An outgrowth of the breathy panting emitted by primates during play fighting, it likely appeared before the emergence of language.",
              "This sort of laughter was a signal that things at the moment were OK, that danger was low and basic needs were met, and now was as good a time as any to explore, to play, to socialize.",
              "\u201cWhat the humor is indexing and the laughter is signaling is, \u2018this is an opportunity for learning,\u2019\u201d Gervais told us.",
              "\u201cIt signals this is a non-serious novelty, and recruits others to play and explore cognitively, emotionally and socially with the implications of this novelty.",
              "\u201d But then, sometime in the hundreds of thousands of years after that, theorized Gervais and Wilson, the other sort of laughter emerged\u2014the non-Duchenne sort, the kind that isn\u2019t dependent on something being funny.",
              "As people developed cognitively and behaviorally, they learned to mimic the spontaneous behavior of laughter to take advantage of its effects.",
              "They couldn\u2019t get it right\u2014they couldn\u2019t simulate the eye-muscle movements of real laughter and smiling\u2014but it was close.",
              "Mimicked laughter was a way to manipulate others\u2014sometimes for mutually beneficial purposes, sometimes for more devious reasons.",
              "As Gervais and Wilson put it in their paper, \u201cnon-Duchenne laughter came to occur in aggressive, nervous, or hierarchical contexts, functioning to signal, to appease, to manipulate, to deride, or to subvert.",
              "\u201d Laughter, in other words, is more than just a response to humor.",
              "It\u2019s a primal human tool, one of the building blocks of society.",
              "It taps into the core of what we are as social creatures, expressing from one person to another what often cannot be said in any other way: either that everything is in good fun\u2014or, as in the case of omuneepo, that something is very, very wrong.",

              "But it\u2019s not clear why laughter exists.",
              "While it is evidently an inherently social phenomenon \u2013 people are up to 30 times more likely to laugh in a group than when alone \u2013 laughter\u2019s function as a form of communication remains mysterious.",
              "A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and involving a large group of researchers led by Gregory Bryant from UCLA, suggests that laughter may indicate to listeners the friendship status of those laughing.",
              "The researchers asked listeners to judge the friendship status of pairs of strangers and friends based on short snippets of their simultaneous laughter.",
              "Drawn from 24 different societies, they found that listeners were able to reliably distinguish friends from strangers, based on specific acoustic characteristics of the laughter.",
              "In order to unravel how this is possible and what the true meaning of laughter is, we need to delve back into its early origins.",
              "Spontaneous laughter, which is unintentionally triggered by conversation or events, emerges in the first few months of life, even in children who are deaf or blind.",
              "Laughter not only transcends human cultural boundaries, but species boundaries, too: it is present in a similar form in other great apes.",
              "In fact, the evolutionary origins of human laughter can be traced back to between 10 and 16m years ago.",
              "While laughter has been linked to higher pain tolerance and the signalling of social status, its principal function appears to be creating and deepening social bonds.",
              "As our ancestors began to live in larger and more complex social structures, the quality of relationships became crucial to survival.",
              "The process of evolution would have favoured the development of cognitive strategies that helped form and sustain these cooperative alliances.",
              "Laughter probably evolved from laboured breathing during play such as tickling, which encourage cooperative and competitive behaviour in young mammals.",
              "This expression of the shared arousal experienced through play may have been effective in strengthening positive bonds, and laughter has indeed been shown to prolong the length of play behaviours in both children and chimpanzees, and to directly elicit both conscious and unconscious positive emotional responses in human listeners.",
              "The emergence of laughter and other primal vocalisations was at first intimately tied to how we felt: we only laughed when aroused in a positive way, just as we cried only when distressed, or roared only when angry.",
              "The key development came with the ability to vocalise voluntarily, without necessarily experiencing some underlying pain, rage, or positive emotion.",
              "This increased vocal control, made possible as our brains grew more complex, was ultimately vital in the development of language.",
              "But it also allowed us to consciously mimic laughter (and other vocalisations), providing a deceptive tool to artificially quicken and expand social bonds \u2013 and so increase survival odds.",
              "The idea that this volitional laughter also has an evolutionary origin is reinforced by the presence of similar behaviour in adult chimpanzees, who produce laugh imitations in response to the spontaneous laughter of others.",
              "The fake laughter of both chimpanzees and humans develops during childhood, is acoustically distinct from its spontaneous counterpart, and serves the same social bonding function.",
              "Today, both spontaneous and volitional laughter are prevalent in almost every aspect of human life, whether sharing a joke with a mate or during polite chitchat with a colleague.",
              "However, they\u2019re not equivalent in the ear of beholder.",
              "Spontaneous laughter is characterised by higher pitch (indicative of genuine arousal), shorter duration and shorter laugh bursts compared to volitional laughter.",
              "Researchers recently demonstrated that human listeners can distinguish between these two laugh types.",
              "Fascinatingly, they also showed that if you slow down and adjust the pitch of volitional laughter (to make it less recognisable as human) listeners can distinguish it from animal vocalisations, whereas they cannot do the same for spontaneous laughter, whose acoustic structure is far more similar to nonhuman primate equivalents.",
              "It\u2019s this audible difference that is demonstrated in the paper by Bryant and his colleagues.",
              "Friends are more likely to produce spontaneous laughs, while strangers who lack an established emotional connection are more likely to produce volitional laughter.",
              "The fact that we can accurately perceive these distinctions means that laughter is to some extent an honest signal.",
              "In the neverending evolutionary arms race, adaptive strategies for deception tend to co-evolve with strategies to detect that deception.",
              "The acoustic characteristics of authentic laughter are therefore useful cues to the bonds between and status of members of a group.",
              "This is something that may have aided decision-making in our evolutionary past.",
              "However, the study found that judgement accuracy was on average only 11% higher than chance.",
              "Perhaps this is partially because some strangers may have produced spontaneous laughs and some friends volitional laughs, but it\u2019s clear that imitating authentic emotional laughter is a valuable deceptive tool for social lubrication.",
              "One need only witness the contagious effects of canned laughter to see how true this is.",
              "In the complex reality of modern human social interaction, laughs are often aromatic blends of the full-bodied spontaneous and dark but smooth volitional types, further blurring the boundaries.",
              "Regardless, the goal is the same and we will most likely find ourselves becoming fonder of those we share the odd chuckle with.",
              "John Cleese once said: \u201cLaughter connects you with people.",

              "But it\u2019s not clear why laughter exists.",
              "While it is evidently an inherently social phenomenon \u2013 people are up to 30 times more likely to laugh in a group than when alone \u2013 laughter\u2019s function as a form of communication remains mysterious.",
              "A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and involving a large group of researchers led by Gregory Bryant from UCLA, suggests that laughter may indicate to listeners the friendship status of those laughing.",
              "The researchers asked listeners to judge the friendship status of pairs of strangers and friends based on short snippets of their simultaneous laughter.",
              "Drawn from 24 different societies, they found that listeners were able to reliably distinguish friends from strangers, based on specific acoustic characteristics of the laughter.",
              "In order to unravel how this is possible and what the true meaning of laughter is, we need to delve back into its early origins.",
              "Spontaneous laughter, which is unintentionally triggered by conversation or events, emerges in the first few months of life, even in children who are deaf or blind.",
              "Laughter not only transcends human cultural boundaries, but species boundaries, too: it is present in a similar form in other great apes.",
              "In fact, the evolutionary origins of human laughter can be traced back to between 10 and 16m years ago.",
              "While laughter has been linked to higher pain tolerance and the signalling of social status, its principal function appears to be creating and deepening social bonds.",
              "As our ancestors began to live in larger and more complex social structures, the quality of relationships became crucial to survival.",
              "The process of evolution would have favoured the development of cognitive strategies that helped form and sustain these cooperative alliances.",
              "Laughter probably evolved from laboured breathing during play such as tickling, which encourage cooperative and competitive behaviour in young mammals.",
              "This expression of the shared arousal experienced through play may have been effective in strengthening positive bonds, and laughter has indeed been shown to prolong the length of play behaviours in both children and chimpanzees, and to directly elicit both conscious and unconscious positive emotional responses in human listeners.",
              "The emergence of laughter and other primal vocalisations was at first intimately tied to how we felt: we only laughed when aroused in a positive way, just as we cried only when distressed, or roared only when angry.",
              "The key development came with the ability to vocalise voluntarily, without necessarily experiencing some underlying pain, rage, or positive emotion.",
              "This increased vocal control, made possible as our brains grew more complex, was ultimately vital in the development of language.",
              "But it also allowed us to consciously mimic laughter (and other vocalisations), providing a deceptive tool to artificially quicken and expand social bonds \u2013 and so increase survival odds.",
              "The idea that this volitional laughter also has an evolutionary origin is reinforced by the presence of similar behaviour in adult chimpanzees, who produce laugh imitations in response to the spontaneous laughter of others.",
              "The fake laughter of both chimpanzees and humans develops during childhood, is acoustically distinct from its spontaneous counterpart, and serves the same social bonding function.",
              "Today, both spontaneous and volitional laughter are prevalent in almost every aspect of human life, whether sharing a joke with a mate or during polite chitchat with a colleague.",
              "However, they\u2019re not equivalent in the ear of beholder.",
              "Spontaneous laughter is characterised by higher pitch (indicative of genuine arousal), shorter duration and shorter laugh bursts compared to volitional laughter.",
              "Researchers recently demonstrated that human listeners can distinguish between these two laugh types.",
              "Fascinatingly, they also showed that if you slow down and adjust the pitch of volitional laughter (to make it less recognisable as human) listeners can distinguish it from animal vocalisations, whereas they cannot do the same for spontaneous laughter, whose acoustic structure is far more similar to nonhuman primate equivalents.",
              "It\u2019s this audible difference that is demonstrated in the paper by Bryant and his colleagues.",
              "Friends are more likely to produce spontaneous laughs, while strangers who lack an established emotional connection are more likely to produce volitional laughter.",
              "The fact that we can accurately perceive these distinctions means that laughter is to some extent an honest signal.",
              "In the neverending evolutionary arms race, adaptive strategies for deception tend to co-evolve with strategies to detect that deception.",

              "The Science of Laughter: Exploring the Psychology and Evolution of Humor",
              "Laughter is a universal human experience that brings joy and lightens our spirits.",
              "But have you ever wondered why we find certain things funny?",
              "What triggers our laughter?",
              "In this blog post, we delve into the fascinating world of humor theories and scientific research to uncover the secrets behind what makes us laugh.",
              "Numerous theories have been proposed to explain the essence of humor.",
              "Three prominent theories include transgression, superiority, and incongruity.",
              "Transgression humor involves the violation of societal norms, while superiority humor stems from mockery and feelings of arrogance.",
              "However, incongruity theory suggests that laughter arises from the presence of two incompatible meanings in a single situation.",
              "By synthesizing these theories and extensive research, laughter can be distilled into three main stages: puzzlement, resolution, and signaling.",
              "Puzzlement refers to encountering a situation that seems strange or incongruous, inducing a sense of panic or transgression.",
              "The subsequent stage involves working through the tension caused by the incongruity and achieving resolution.",
              "Finally, the release of laughter acts as a clear signal to those around us that the threat has passed, signaling relief and safety.",
              "While incongruity is a fundamental aspect of humor, not all incongruous situations elicit laughter.",
              "The event must also be perceived as harmless to evoke humor.",
              "For example, witnessing a tiger strolling through a city may seem incongruous but is more likely to invoke fear.",
              "However, if the tiger were to roll down the street like a ball, it becomes humorous due to the unexpected and playful nature of the act.",
              "The preservation of laughter throughout human evolution suggests its potential role as a tool for survival.",
              "Laughter may have been favored by natural selection as a means to signal safety and unity after a perceived threat.",
              "Laughter's contagious nature strengthens social bonds and promotes a sense of togetherness, marking the end of fear or concern.",
              "Laughter is not just a psychological response;",
              "it also influences our physiology.",
              "Brain centers associated with laughter are closely linked to emotions, fear, and anxiety.",
              "When we laugh, we release tension and stress, promoting a sense of relief throughout our bodies.",
              "Numerous studies have shown that laughter can have positive effects on blood pressure, immune defenses, and mental well-being.",
              "It is even employed in healthcare settings to aid patients' healing processes.",
              "Laughter's significance extends beyond personal well-being.",
              "In educational settings, humor is utilized to enhance learning by capturing attention and creating a relaxed environment.",
              "It reduces anxiety, encourages active participation, and boosts motivation.",
              "Moreover, laughter plays a role in relationships, particularly romantic ones.",
              "Sharing laughter with someone can foster trust, create a sense of safety, and help overcome fears, making us more attracted to individuals who make us laugh.",
              "From an evolutionary perspective, laughter may have played a crucial role in risk awareness and self-preservation.",
              "Today, laughter remains a mechanism of relief when we face danger or perceive a threat that eventually subsides.",
              "While we now enjoy laughter for its uplifting qualities, it is intriguing to consider its ancestral significance.",
              "Laughter is a remarkable human phenomenon that brings joy, lightness, and relief.",
              "Its origins lie in incongruity, transgression, and superiority theories, but incongruity plays a central role in humor.",
              "Understanding the stages of laughter helps unravel its purpose as a survival tool and a means to foster social bonds.",
              "Moreover, laughter's physiological benefits, educational applications, and its impact on relationships make it an essential aspect of human life.",
              "So, the next time you burst into laughter, appreciate the complex mechanisms behind this remarkable phenomenon.",

              "However, we are unable to perceive this laughter as its frequency, around 50 kHz, exceeds the range of human hearing.",
              "Neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp and his colleagues discovered this phenomenon a few decades ago.",
              "They had noticed that rats emit brief bursts of high-frequency sound during play.",
              "They tickled the rats on their stomachs and necks to investigate whether this sound was a form of laughter.",
              "The sound was much more frequent than when the rats were playing.",
              "Numerous animal species exhibit laughter-like behavior, as indicated in a review article by bioanthropologist Sasha Winkler and communication scientist Gregory Bryant.",
              "Their comprehensive study encompasses 65 animal species, primarily mammals, including a kangaroo species and three bird species.",
              "What the laughter-like behaviors share is that they occur during play and when the animals are tickled.",
              "Given the prevalence of laughter across species, it is reasonable to assume that survival benefits are associated with this behavior.",
              "However, the exact nature of these benefits remains a significant question.",
              "While individuals who interact with animals recognize that they possess distinct emotions, there is a tendency to attribute human-like emotions to them.",
              "Darwin emphasized the continuity between humans and animals and was the first to study the expression of emotions in animals systematically.",
              "He saw humor as \"tickling the mind.\"",
              "Modern scientists try to avoid assuming that animals have the same emotions as humans, which would be a form of anthropomorphism.",
              "How do we know that the sounds made by rats are really laughter?",
              "The best method is to compare the behavior of different species.",
              "Panksepp draws several parallels between the rat sounds and the laughter of human children: (i) rats laugh most before sexual maturity, (ii) if frightened, they stop laughing when you tickle them, (iii) young rats prefer socializing with older rats that laugh a lot, and (iv) rats that have experience social isolation laughs more when they are allowed to socialize with other rats.",
              "All these parallels with human laughter behavior strongly suggest that the rats' sounds correspond to human laughter.",
              "Panksepp proposes that joy and other emotions we experience are linked to neurological processes.",
              "He speculates that the mechanisms underlying laughter are evolutionarily old and deeply rooted in the brain.",
              "A prevailing theory posits that laughter serves to encourage continued play.",
              "Many animals employ play signals\u2013dogs extend their front legs and bow their heads with upturned mouths, and chimpanzees have a special \"play face\" resembling a wide smile.",
              "Young mammals frequently engage in play-fighting\u2013they tumble around and nibble each other, often with a tickling effect.",
              "The point of play signals is that the participants know that wrestling and nibbling are not serious.",
              "Unlike a real fight, the intention is not to hurt each other.",
              "They communicate friendly intentions.",
              "While familiar with human laughter, what does it sound like in other animals?",
              "Typically, laughter is not particularly loud.",
              "One illustration comes from Nobel Prize winner Konrad Lorenz, who was one of the first to study laughter in dogs.",
              "He noted that dogs laugh during intense play and pant in addition to their raised mouths.",
              "In the species of monkeys studied, the play face is also associated with panting or laughing.",
              "Lorenz initially proposed that laughter evolved from an aggressive signal where the animal displays its teeth, but this theory has not been supported.",
              "A more recent hypothesis suggests that laughter evolved from the panting that occurs during play.",
              "Only a limited number of animal species, such as elephants and seals, exhibit loud laughter.",
              "In the case of elephants, this is likely related to their tendency to trumpet when they gasp intensely.",
              "Humans are the sole species among great apes that laugh loudly.",
              "One possible explanation for this is the differing anatomy of chimpanzees.",
              "As humans evolved to walk upright, they no longer needed to use their chests to control their arms while walking.",
              "As a result, breathing can be better controlled, and we can more easily create sounds with our vocal cords.",
              "Another reason animals should refrain from laughing out loud is the potential attraction of predators.",
              "A gasp can only be heard by those participating in the game.",

              "With us, animal laughter has been extended to other social contexts.",
              "However, the animal origin is evident in that those who laugh most when tickled are also those who laugh most in humorous contexts.",
              "As noted by Darwin, humor can be described as something that tickles the mind.",
              "So, what is it that provokes mirth?",
              "A common description is that it is unexpected and social while not perceived as dangerous.",
              "You don't laugh if you feel threatened.",
              "This is a rather soulless characteristic, as many things possess these qualities without leading to laughter.",
              "And what is perceived as very funny by one person only makes another person frown.",
              "Experiments involving chimpanzees' laughter have demonstrated that it also creates laughter in other group members and is important for play to continue.",
              "How can laughter be contagious?",
              "Over the last decade, cognitive scientists and neurologists have become increasingly interested in 'coupled' brains, that is, social activities where two or more people's brain activities can be shown to be synchronized.",
              "Researchers often assume that so-called mirror neurons are involved when explaining such connections, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood.",

              "This fact makes questions of cultural universality in human vocal communication seem narrower than some might imagine.",
              "In the case of laughter, related vocalizations across diverse species reveal a long evolutionary history of vocal play signalling (for a review, see [8]), bringing some perspective to the question of why laughter in humans appears quite similarly across cultures, and offering a framework for understanding how it currently functions.",
              "But humans do possess a species-specific capability that complicates the problem for researchers: speech production.",
              "Volitional control of speech articulators, operating through direct neural projections between motor cortex and laryngeal musculature, affords the production of complex, rapidly generated phonetic sounds useful for language [7,9].",
              "And the volitional control of articulators allows speakers to imitate other kinds of sounds in our environment [10,11].",
              "One likely target of selection for imitative volitional vocal machinery is evolutionarily conserved, spontaneous emotional vocalizations.",

              "g. laughs, cries and screams) that we share with most extant mammal species.",
              "The benefits of such an ability are fairly clear: if individuals evolve the ability to reliably generate emulations of emotional vocalizations, historically only produced in specific communicative contexts that included constraints of honest signal evolution involving strategic and efficacy costs [12], then agents can gain benefits potentially without paying these costs.",
              "That is, the signals can be faked, and consequently dishonest.",
              "This additional means of manipulation in vocal signalling introduces complexities for efforts to model its evolutionary dynamics, and is a crucial factor in any theoretical explanation of human vocal communication.",

              "Overall, we argue that laughter occurs in highly similar ways across all documented languages studied to date, and that listeners around the world hear laughter similarly, and are able to make accurate judgements about laughers from very brief exposures (e.",

              "A theoretical framework is needed that allows researchers to understand differences in communicative behaviours that certainly exist, and recognize them as variations on universal themes with particular constraints.",
              "One important issue when discussing laughter across cultures is the psychology of humour.",
              "The interdisciplinary study of laughter has long been closely linked with humour, ranging from early theories of laughter (e.",
              "g. [15]), to ethnography (e.",
              "g. [16]), to the nature of stimuli used to trigger laughter that is then subjected to acoustic analysis (e.",
              "g. [17]).",
              "There is little doubt that the complete story of laughter must include humour, but a full review and critique of the literature is beyond the scope of this article.",
              "For our purposes, we assume that events, utterances and ideas can be construed as humorous, and these phenomena are often linked to laughter.",
              "We can also safely adopt the premise that people's judgements of what counts as humorous are subject to much cultural variation [18].",
              "Descriptions of the details underlying this variation, and the complicated cognitive underpinnings of humour and social interaction, constitute a proximate analysis of a larger social communication system that includes laughter.",
              "The mechanisms by which humour is realized, and how it is effective during discourse, are intimately tied to the ultimate explanations of why people vocalize in the first place.",
              "Similarly, detailed analyses of the possible variations in acoustic structure of laughter constitute an additional proximate level of description that can inform ultimate theories regarding purported functions of laughter.",
              "In terms of culture, proximate details should be understood as variations on a theme, while understanding the evolutionary dynamics of vocal signalling requires an adaptationist account that applies universally.",
              "The concept of humour has engaged scholars across many disciplines, including but not limited to philosophy, linguistics, psychology, anthropology and even computer science (e.",
              "g. [18\u201322]).",
              "There is still no consensus of course, but theorists continue to propose accounts that detail aspects of the environment that afford cognitive effects one might identify as humour.",
              "It is worth noting, however, that theories of humour frequently neglect the social interactive context, often in favour of focusing on narrow phenomena such as the structural features of humorous content (e.",
              "g. the composition of a joke).",
              "Humour should be understood as an emergent property of a socially shared cognitive environment, characterizing multiple people's understanding of that environment and their mutually manifested attempts to engage in it [23,24].",
              "One attempt to integrate different accounts of humour is encryption theory [25], which also provides a framework for understanding the relationship between laughter and humour [26,27].",
              "Briefly, encryption theory proposes that humour is a special case of ostensive communication (i.",
              "e. the signalling of an intention to communicate) [28] in which meaning is encrypted (i.",
              "e. hidden) such that only receivers with certain information will be able to decrypt it.",
              "By relying on pragmatic reasoning required for the comprehension of implied meaning, listeners must derive their understanding of speakers' intentions based on evidence provided in signals (usually, but not always language-based).",
              "Success in properly interpreting intentional humour comes with endogenous reward, manifesting subjectively as pleasurable, and often triggering laughter.",
              "Proximate rewards are a hallmark of adaptation\u2014the motivational trigger for adaptive action.",
              "The motivation to engage socially using encrypted communication promotes the identification and assortment of social partners who share beliefs, worldviews, values and so on.",
              "We not only find our social partners using encryption, but help maintain our bonds through it as well, explaining why established friends engage in banter and humour even after social assortment has occurred.",
              "In its simplest manifestation, the encryption\u2013decryption circuit explains both the classic conundrum of the person who fails to get a joke, and the well-known phenomenon of how a joke loses its humour when it must be explained.",
              "If an individual does not possess the information necessary to recognize the hidden meaning of a comment, they will fail to get the humour.",
              "When a person does have the necessary information, their response often triggers the production of a signal that indicates this shared knowledge, most notably a spontaneous laugh.",
              "Of course, an individual can potentially recognize that an encrypted bit of information has been sent without knowing what is encrypted specifically, either to themselves or to another party, and attempt to produce a signal suggesting their understanding.",
              "But that signal will be volitionally produced and is at risk of being recognizable to others as faked\u2014a classic scenario for coevolutionary arms race dynamics [13].",
              "This basic social context is the ecology of intentional humour which shapes the evolutionary dynamics of not only laughter, but covert signalling more broadly [29].",
              "The encryption account nicely explains many of humour's most obvious qualities such as its obliqueness, subjectivity and cultural variation.",
              "By this view, many theories of humour are potential proximate mechanisms by which encryption does its work.",
              "For example, incongruity-resolution theory (e.",
              "g. [30]), variants of which are currently among the most popular theories of humour [31], describes a suite of possible encryption mechanisms. Many of these variants involve a multistage process where some incongruity is introduced (e.",
              "g. a joke set-up), and then that incongruity is resolved, usually through some unexpected means.",
              "The notion dates back centuries (e.",
              "g. [15,32]), and is central to more contemporary evolutionary-based accounts of humour as well [20].",
              "The specific content that is introduced into these devices must interface with the knowledge and communication systems of social agents, much of which is culturally shaped.",
              "Encryption theory provides a plausible evolutionary account of not only why people engage using such complex, honest social signalling, but also how laughter plays a role in the signalling circuit.",
              "An understanding of laughter across cultures requires an explanation of why people laugh in social settings, and how the content of people's communication triggers it.",
              "In other words, cognitive phenomena can be similar across disparate cultures, and cultural factors create variation in content.",
              "For instance, one account of humour proposes that benign violations of our expectations will result in humour\u2014potential threats to our state of being or appraisals become funny when they turn out harmless [33].",
              "However, what counts as a violation can often depend on culturally evolved norms\u2014the mechanism could be universal, but the specific content culturally varies.",
              "This theory provides another example of a proximate device that ultimately involves indirect communication (i.",
              "e. the exact violation is typically not explicitly stated), and is thus subsumed by the more general system of encryption.",
              "Overall, an encryption approach predicts that laughter should manifest itself quite similarly across cultures in both form (acoustic structure) and function (pragmatic and social signalling), but what content actually triggers it will be culturally dependent and potentially highly variable.",
              "This is due to culture- and language-specific information that can only be understood by individuals immersed in a given socioecological context [34].",
              "Moreover, across different cultures, people vary in how they value humour as a social phenomenon in the first place, and as such can constitute a source of variation in how humour occurs in ordinary interaction [35].",
              "If laughter sounds fundamentally similar across different languages and cultures, then we should expect it to be highly recognizable as a distinct vocal behaviour in cross-cultural studies, and potentially judged similarly in terms of social and emotional meaning.",
              "But, to date, there is limited empirical work examining how people around the world perceive laughter.",
              "The earliest study carefully investigating the cross-cultural perception of non-linguistic vocalizations found that individuals across very different societies (British and Himba) mutually identified laughing as indicative of tickling and amusement [36], despite other positive emotions not being reliably recognized.",
              "In follow-up work with the same Namibian population, using similar stimuli and methods, researchers also found that laughter was highly recognized as representing amusement, even though overall this team did not find evidence of widespread universal recognition of other emotion categories [37];",
              "for discussion, see [38].",
              "Even in a free-labelling paradigm, Himba participants mapped American laughter to amusement at a rate far exceeding any other emotion category, despite the many reasons we should expect high cultural variability using such a method.",
              "Moreover, they judged laughter as highly positive in valence and arousal.",
              "More recently, two large-scale studies investigated how listeners across multiple disparate cultures judged recordings of laughing.",
              "One study [39] examined the perception of conversational colaughter, defined as the simultaneous production (onsets within 1 s) in two interacting speakers of non-verbal laughter bursts.",

              "The extracted 48 colaugh stimuli averaged approximately 1 s in duration.",
              "The task was simple: judges were asked to listen to the colaughter and then report (i) whether they believed the presented pair of speakers were friends or strangers, and (ii) how much did they think the speakers liked one another.",
              "Results across cultures were strikingly similar.",
              "Overall, judges everywhere were able to correctly classify friend and stranger pairs significantly better than chance, ranging from 53 to 67% accuracy.",

              "Laughs with shorter duration, less regular pitch and intensity cycles, and less variation in pitch cycle regularity were more likely to be judged as between friends.",
              "These acoustic qualities are all associated with speaker arousal, suggesting that friendly colaughter likely reveals an affective correlate of familiarity in ordinary conversation.",
              "One unexpected and pronounced finding was that across all cultures\u2014without exception\u2014judges identified female pairs of friends most accurately across the six categories (friends and strangers across M\u2013M, F\u2013F and M\u2013F combinations).",
              "The accuracy difference is partially due to a culturally universal bias to overestimate the likelihood of reporting that a pair was friends when they were women (i.",
              "e. high false alarms).",

              "For this work, and the study from which the stimuli were created [13], spontaneous (real) laughter was defined as conversational laughter obtained between familiar speakers, and all exemplars were between female friends.",
              "Volitional (fake) laughter was defined as laughter produced on command in a laboratory context with no other instruction other than to \u2018now laugh,' and this sample was also composed of all women.",

              "But a conflation of categories in some stimuli works against the prediction that listeners should be able to distinguish the laughter types.",
              "In Bryant et al.",
              "[42], a set of 36 laughs (18 spontaneous) were presented to listeners (N = 884) worldwide and they were asked to judge whether they thought the laughter was \u2018real' or \u2018fake.'",
              "As expected, participants everywhere, on average, were able to distinguish the laugh types with above-chance performance (56\u201369%).",
              "Moreover, arousal-linked acoustic features, including higher intensity variability, higher fundamental frequency (fo), and lower harmonics-to-noise-ratio variability, were associated with listeners judging laughs as \u2018real'.",
              "Ultimately, it is likely that spontaneous laughter is more common between friends than strangers, and arousal is a basic low-level dimension that distinguishes it from volitional laughter more common between strangers.",
              "This fundamental connection between affect and sociality is highly recognizable universally.",
              "One interesting cultural difference emerged in the study of spontaneous and volitional laughter [42].",
              "Participants from small-scale societies, defined roughly as people living in small villages with low market integration, had a slight bias to report laughs as volitional, or \u2018fake' as they were asked.",

              "It is impossible to know what exactly caused this criterion shift.",
              "One possibility is that societies composed of relatively smaller groups of recurrent players might result in individuals sensitized to the volitional nature of social pleasantries that better characterize larger societies where a much higher proportion of social interactions are between people who have never met and could easily not have a repeated encounter.",
              "Put simply: they think American college students sound fake.",
              "Because of potential greater costs of errors in more close-knit communities, heightened sensitivity to emotion and intention detection could be adaptive in small-scale societies to a greater extent than in larger, industrialized societies where one-shot interactions with strangers are commonplace and generally benign.",
              "Another relevant aspect of this finding is the distinct possibility that several of the laughs included in the spontaneous condition were in fact volitional.",
              "The laughter was defined based on having occurred between friends in conversation, but many laughs between familiar speakers (in fact, perhaps a majority) are generated by the speech production system (making them volitional), and serve a variety of pragmatic and procedural functions.",
              "Most so-called \u2018fake' laughs are probably not deceptive, and in fact serve as reliable signals for a variety of discourse functions.",
              "But they are not emotionally triggered in the same way as spontaneous laughs.",
              "By this logic, small-scale participants were likely more accurate overall.",
              "In any case, the ease with which individuals worldwide were able to engage in the task and understand what was being asked of them, despite many having no experience with social science research, speaks to the universal nature of laughter\u2014people everywhere get it.",

              "For example, phonetic properties of vowel sounds that differ across languages could manifest themselves in volitional laughter.",
              "But studies have described incredible acoustic variability in laughter even within speakers of English, revealing, for example, that laughs range in structure from very short, quiet, broadband bursts of air, to extended sequences of loud, tonal bouts, with many variants in between [17].",

              "As described earlier, knowing what category a laugh belongs to can only be confirmed with certainty by examining cortical activity during production.",
              "One possibility in this study is that a majority of the laughs were in fact volitional, but varied in portrayed arousal (causing some to be judged as spontaneous), and as such revealed group identity.",

              "Below, we describe some of this work, illustrating the similarities and variation in not only how laughter appears in different conversational language users, but also how it can be automatically detected in speech streams. These research areas offer useful tools that researchers can use moving forward.",

              "One possibility is that simple perceptible dimensions such as arousal and valence, which have many known acoustic correlates, can help judges make better-than-chance categorizations of laughter in various experimental paradigms. But systematically linking the acoustic features to more specific functional categories will prove to be untenable.",

          "It\u2019s a primal human tool, one of the building blocks of society.",
          "While laughter has been linked to higher pain tolerance and the signalling of social status, its principal function appears to be creating and deepening social bonds.",
          "The process of evolution would have favoured the development of cognitive strategies that helped form and sustain these cooperative alliances.",
          "This expression of the shared arousal experienced through play may have been effective in strengthening positive bonds, and laughter has indeed been shown to prolong the length of play behaviours in both children and chimpanzees, and to directly elicit both conscious and unconscious positive emotional responses in human listeners.",
