    "query": "What is the most convincing scientific evidence to support the theory of evolution?",
    "response": "The theory of evolution is supported by multiple lines of evidence from different fields of biology, such as anatomy, molecular biology, biogeography, fossils, and direct observation[^2^].\n\nSome examples of evidence for evolution are:\n\n- Fossils: Fossils are the preserved remains or impressions of once-living organisms that show how species have changed over time. For instance, fossils of transitional forms between fish and amphibians, or between reptiles and birds, provide evidence for common ancestry and evolutionary change[^1^] [^2^].\n- Anatomy: Anatomy is the study of the structure and function of living organisms. Some anatomical features provide evidence for evolution by showing similarities and differences among species that reflect their evolutionary relationships. For example, homologous structures are structures that share the same basic form but perform different functions, such as the forelimbs of humans, whales, bats, and birds. These structures indicate that these species share a common ancestor that had the same basic limb structure[^2^].\n- Molecular biology: Molecular biology is the study of the structure and function of molecules such as DNA and proteins that are essential for life. Molecular evidence for evolution includes the genetic code, which is the same for all living organisms, and DNA comparisons, which can show how closely related species are based on their genetic similarity. For example, humans and chimpanzees share about 98% of their DNA sequences, indicating that they have a recent common ancestor[^2^].\n- Biogeography: Biogeography is the study of the distribution of organisms around the world. Biogeographical evidence for evolution includes the observation that species tend to be more similar to each other in the same geographic region than to species in different regions, reflecting their common origin and adaptation to local environments. For example, marsupials are a group of mammals that have pouches to carry their young. They are mostly found in Australia and nearby islands, where they evolved in isolation from other mammals. However, there are also some marsupials in South America, such as opossums, that share a more distant common ancestor with the Australian marsupials[^2^].\n- Direct observation: Direct observation is the process of witnessing or measuring changes in organisms over time. Direct evidence for evolution includes the observation of small-scale changes in populations over short time periods, such as changes in allele frequencies or phenotypes due to natural selection or genetic drift. For example, scientists have observed changes in beak size and shape in Galapagos finches in response to drought conditions or food availability[^2^]. Another example is the emergence of pesticide-resistant insects due to artificial selection by humans[^2^].\n\nThese are just some of the types of evidence that support the theory of evolution. There are many more examples and details that can be found in scientific literature and online resources.",

              "Gross anatomy involves the study of major body structures by dissection and observation and in its narrowest sense is concerned only with the human body.",
              "\u201cGross anatomy\u201d customarily refers to the study of those body structures large enough to be examined without the help of magnifying devices, while microscopic anatomy is concerned with the study of structural units small enough to be seen only with a light microscope.",
              "Dissection is basic to all anatomical research.",
              "The earliest record of its use was made by the Greeks, and Theophrastus called dissection \u201canatomy,\u201d from ana temnein, meaning \u201cto cut up.",
              "\u201d Comparative anatomy, the other major subdivision of the field, compares similar body structures in different species of animals in order to understand the adaptive changes they have undergone in the course of evolution.",
              "This ancient discipline reached its culmination between 1500 and 1850, by which time its subject matter was firmly established.",
              "None of the world\u2019s oldest civilizations dissected a human body, which most people regarded with superstitious awe and associated with the spirit of the departed soul.",
              "Beliefs in life after death and a disquieting uncertainty concerning the possibility of bodily resurrection further inhibited systematic study.",
              "Nevertheless, knowledge of the body was acquired by treating wounds, aiding in childbirth, and setting broken limbs.",
              "The field remained speculative rather than descriptive, though, until the achievements of the Alexandrian medical school and its foremost figure, Herophilus (flourished 300 bce), who dissected human cadavers and thus gave anatomy a considerable factual basis for the first time.",
              "Herophilus made many important discoveries and was followed by his younger contemporary Erasistratus, who is sometimes regarded as the founder of physiology.",
              "In the 2nd century ce, Greek physician Galen assembled and arranged all the discoveries of the Greek anatomists, including with them his own concepts of physiology and his discoveries in experimental medicine.",
              "The many books Galen wrote became the unquestioned authority for anatomy and medicine in Europe because they were the only ancient Greek anatomical texts that survived the Dark Ages in the form of Arabic (and then Latin) translations.",
              "Owing to church prohibitions against dissection, European medicine in the Middle Ages relied upon Galen\u2019s mixture of fact and fancy rather than on direct observation for its anatomical knowledge, though some dissections were authorized for teaching purposes.",
              "In the early 16th century, the artist Leonardo da Vinci undertook his own dissections, and his beautiful and accurate anatomical drawings cleared the way for Flemish physician Andreas Vesalius to \u201crestore\u201d the science of anatomy with his monumental De humani corporis fabrica libri septem (1543;",
              "\u201cThe Seven Books on the Structure of the Human Body\u201d), which was the first comprehensive and illustrated textbook of anatomy.",
              "As a professor at the University of Padua, Vesalius encouraged younger scientists to accept traditional anatomy only after verifying it themselves, and this more critical and questioning attitude broke Galen\u2019s authority and placed anatomy on a firm foundation of observed fact and demonstration.",
              "From Vesalius\u2019s exact descriptions of the skeleton, muscles, blood vessels, nervous system, and digestive tract, his successors in Padua progressed to studies of the digestive glands and the urinary and reproductive systems. Hieronymus Fabricius, Gabriello Fallopius, and Bartolomeo Eustachio were among the most important Italian anatomists, and their detailed studies led to fundamental progress in the related field of physiology.",
              "William Harvey\u2019s discovery of the circulation of the blood, for instance, was based partly on Fabricius\u2019s detailed descriptions of the venous valves.",
              "The new application of magnifying glasses and compound microscopes to biological studies in the second half of the 17th century was the most important factor in the subsequent development of anatomical research.",
              "Primitive early microscopes enabled Marcello Malpighi to discover the system of tiny capillaries connecting the arterial and venous networks, Robert Hooke to first observe the small compartments in plants that he called \u201ccells,\u201d and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek to observe muscle fibres and spermatozoa.",
              "Thenceforth attention gradually shifted from the identification and understanding of bodily structures visible to the naked eye to those of microscopic size.",
              "The use of the microscope in discovering minute, previously unknown features was pursued on a more systematic basis in the 18th century, but progress tended to be slow until technical improvements in the compound microscope itself, beginning in the 1830s with the gradual development of achromatic lenses, greatly increased that instrument\u2019s resolving power.",
              "These technical advances enabled Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann to recognize in 1838\u201339 that the cell is the fundamental unit of organization in all living things.",
              "The need for thinner, more transparent tissue specimens for study under the light microscope stimulated the development of improved methods of dissection, notably machines called microtomes that can slice specimens into extremely thin sections.",
              "In order to better distinguish the detail in these sections, synthetic dyes were used to stain tissues with different colours.",
              "Thin sections and staining had become standard tools for microscopic anatomists by the late 19th century.",
              "The field of cytology, which is the study of cells, and that of histology, which is the study of tissue organization from the cellular level up, both arose in the 19th century with the data and techniques of microscopic anatomy as their basis.",
              "In the 20th century anatomists tended to scrutinize tinier and tinier units of structure as new technologies enabled them to discern details far beyond the limits of resolution of light microscopes.",
              "These advances were made possible by the electron microscope, which stimulated an enormous amount of research on subcellular structures beginning in the 1950s and became the prime tool of anatomical research.",
              "About the same time, the use of X-ray diffraction for studying the structures of many types of molecules present in living things gave rise to the new subspecialty of molecular anatomy.",
              "Scientific names for the parts and structures of the human body are usually in Latin;",
              "for example, the name musculus biceps brachii denotes the biceps muscle of the upper arm.",
              "Some such names were bequeathed to Europe by ancient Greek and Roman writers, and many more were coined by European anatomists from the 16th century on.",
              "Expanding medical knowledge meant the discovery of many bodily structures and tissues, but there was no uniformity of nomenclature, and thousands of new names were added as medical writers followed their own fancies, usually expressing them in a Latin form.",
              "By the end of the 19th century the confusion caused by the enormous number of names had become intolerable.",
              "Medical dictionaries sometimes listed as many as 20 synonyms for one name, and more than 50,000 names were in use throughout Europe.",
              "In 1887 the German Anatomical Society undertook the task of standardizing the nomenclature, and, with the help of other national anatomical societies, a complete list of anatomical terms and names was approved in 1895 that reduced the 50,000 names to 5,528.",
              "This list, the Basle Nomina Anatomica, had to be subsequently expanded, and in 1955 the Sixth International Anatomical Congress at Paris approved a major revision of it known as the Paris Nomina Anatomica (or simply Nomina Anatomica).",
              "In 1998 this work was supplanted by the Terminologia Anatomica, which recognizes about 7,500 terms describing macroscopic structures of human anatomy and is considered to be the international standard on human anatomical nomenclature.",
              "The Terminologia Anatomica, produced by the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists and the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (later known as the Federative International Programme on Anatomical Terminologies), was made available online in 2011."

              "He studied macroscopic anatomy of which most were dissections of animals.",
              "The findings he made would carry on for centuries to come.",

              "These artists brought about some of the cornerstones for the modern anatomical sketches and human body diagrams of the organ systems of the body.",
              "The artists worked in conjunction with scientists to draw anatomically accurate sketches after the dissection of parts of human bodies.",
              "This period also brought about the work of Andreas Vesalius who contributed extensively to anatomy by his constant study of dissected humans and his work on the first-ever book on human anatomy.",
              "From the 17th to 20th centuries, numerous anatomists and physicians have contributed to creating the anatomy that we learn today and aiding in the advancement of medical knowledge.",
              "Up until those times, there was discrimination against scientists who wanted to use cadavers or dissect living humans in order to study human internal organs and human systems. Abraham Flexner wrote his famous article from the 20th century that highlighted the importance of medical research using the organs in the body and how dissections contribute to basic medical education and training.",
              "This helped to bring about normalcy in the field of anatomy and push the medical discoveries that we know today.",
              "Fields in biology often become more diverse due to research done by numerous scientists, doctors, and medical researchers who delve more into those studies.",
              "An expert in anatomy or an anatomist may do studies in complete anatomy or specific areas.",
              "Many historical anatomists have contributed to what we call anatomy today.",
              "William Harvey was an English physician who lived between 1578 and 1657.",
              "He is best known for being the official doctor for King James the first and discovering the circulatory system.",
              "Though before Harvey, others have hypothesized that there was a method by which blood is pumped around the body, Harvey confirmed these theories with arguments and experiments.",
              "Harvey used the volume to measure and estimate the amount of blood that would pass through the human body organs at a given timeframe.",
              "Since the body could not produce such large quantities of blood at once, it had to be circulated.",
              "Furthermore, he investigated the heartbeat and how it worked as a pump to push the blood around the body.",
              "After publishing in 1649 in a medical journal, Harvey\u2019s work received much criticism but was eventually accepted.",
              "Another well-known anatomist is Andreas Vesalius.",
              "He lived in Greece until the age of 50 where he studied and extensively described human anatomy and physiology.",
              "After receiving his doctorate, Vesalius devoted much of his time to dissecting and observing cadavers.",
              "So intrigued by this, Andreas began to follow a pattern of study involving doing his dissections and studying the ancient scientific texts in detail.",
              "He also discovered that the Galenic anatomy, which was used in many universities, was based on animal anatomy rather than human body systems. This was possibly due to the fact that human dissection was forbidden in the past.",
              "This discovery helped to push his creation of one of the first anatomical textbooks \u2018Fabrica\u2019 that was printed in 1543.",
              "French anthropologist and pathologist, Paul Broca, studied lesions in the brain that helped modern biology understand cranial functions better.",
              "He discovered in 1861 what is now known as the convolution of Broca, a section in the left frontal lobe of the brain known for helping with the articulation of speech.",
              "This also made him the first person to prove that specific parts of the brain were related to certain functions in the systems of the human body.",
              "Georges Cuvier was the founding father of comparative anatomy and paleontology.",
              "His work on the study of marine invertebrates as a tutor was sent to the Museum of Natural History in Paris where he was then encouraged to become a member of their team.",
              "He was the first to break down animals into subcategories based on their systems in the body.",
              "This rejected the typical anatomical organization that was used prior to the 18th century and helped others to explore the fact that animals are anatomically different and why this could be.",
              "All this and more helped Curvier to build the foundation of paleontology as a science.",
              "One of the subdivisions of anatomy is gross anatomy.",

              "These deal with outside of the body, regions of the body and specific body systems respectively.",
              "When we study surface anatomy, we do not need to dissect to learn and observe.",
              "This subdivision looks at the external body form and what it does in order to allow the body to function while protecting the internal structures.",

              "However, microscopic anatomy deals with only tissues and smaller entities since these are the only ones that can fit under the microscope.",
              "As said above, microscopic anatomy involves both histology and cytology.",
              "Both of these involve the thin slicing of organs to obtain specimens for the microscopes.",

              "As the name implies, embryology is the study of the embryo of an animal.",
              "An embryo exists during the period of time from which the egg is fertilized to the eighth week of the life of an organism.",
              "It looks critically at the organism\u2019s cell differentiation, division, and gastrulation.",
              "It is often described as the basis for the comprehension of how nervous systems and other crucial parts of the animal develop and function.",
              "This study has also in recent times, helped with the study of stem cells and how they can relate to cancer.",
              "The study of developmental anatomy is a wider and longer study than embryology as it studies from the moment of fertilization all the way into adulthood.",
              "This study puts the anatomy meaning into perspective as it concentrates on all aspects of the body form.",
              "It is a closer look at how the organism\u2019s body will change over the course of its life.",
              "Radiographic anatomy uses radiology in the form of x-rays to study the body and all its systems and organs.",
              "These can be radiographs or computerized tomography (CT) scans.",
              "These take the three-dimensional form of the body and put it into a two-dimensional picture so that the real-time look of the systems can be observed by a radiologist or medical doctor.",
              "The study of anatomy as it is altered by disease is known as pathological anatomy.",
              "This study helps the diagnosis and treatment of countless diseases through microscopic analysis of samples from bodily fluids, tissues, organs, and sometimes the entire body or autopsy.",
              "This is the branch of anatomy that is most popular throughout the world and for obvious reasons.",
              "We as humans are always curious as to how our body works and how it functions.",

              "This nomenclature is only available officially in its Latin form.",
              "Anatomical nomenclature was created because when referring to the human body, terms like \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 can become confusing depending on the position of the body.",

              "Anatomy has many sub-disciplines, and is used in many different fields.",
              "In general, there are two main types of anatomy: gross or macroscopic anatomy, and microscopic anatomy.",
              "However, most biology specialties require knowledge of both types of anatomy.",
              "Commonly called gross anatomy, macroscopic anatomy involves studying the structures and forms which can be seen on organism with the naked eye.",
              "The type of organism does not matter.",
              "A botanist may study the macroscopic anatomy of a plant, such as the shape and size of its leaves.",
              "A doctor might study the proportions of his patients, measuring their weight and height.",
              "Both of these scientists are using skills of gross anatomy.",
              "Many branches of biology use gross anatomy to evaluate their subjects.",
              "While this is often combined with microscopic anatomy and physiology, sometimes the macroscopic anatomy is the only observable system.",
              "This definitely true of archeology and evolutionary biology.",
              "Both of these branches of biology use evidence from the fossil record to establish relationships between extinct animals.",
              "Soft tissue does not often fossilize, thus these scientists must have a comprehensive knowledge of skeletal anatomy.",
              "Different species and fossils can be compared using comparative anatomy, which recognizes similarities between specimens.",
              "For instance, a scientist using comparative anatomy could hypothesize the evolutionary relationships between a bat, a blackbird, and an ostrich.",
              "At first glance, the blackbird and the bat may be more related based upon size.",
              "But the scientist would quickly notice that the bat is covered in hair, while the blackbird has feathers.",
              "Upon examination of the wings and their bones, the scientist would find that the bat wing resembles an outstretched hand, while the blackbird bones have fused into a large bone that extends the length of the wing, with the feathers and skin supporting the rest of the wing.",
              "Even though the ostrich cannot use its wings to fly, the structure of the bones are the same.",
              "They might be different sizes, but it is clear that the blackbird and ostrich are more closely related to each other than either is related to the bat.",
              "This simple exercise in gross anatomy provides the basis of the classification of many organisms. While gross anatomy provided the basis for many modern sciences, modern technology has revolutionized the study of microscopic anatomy.",
              "Starting with the invention of light microscopy and carrying through modern day inventions such as the electron microscope, the inner workings of cells and organisms are becoming increasingly understood.",

              "A histologist studying muscle tissue, for example, would examine how the cells are held together in the tissue.",
              "Looking further into the cells using an electron microscope, he would see the complex arrangement of proteins in the cell which allow it to contract.",
              "He may also notice the nucleus, which contains the DNA coding for all of the proteins and products the cell produces.",
              "Microscopic anatomy is often paired with biochemistry, molecular biology, and other disciplines to fully understand the organism or tissues being studied.",
              "Science knew for decades that cells contained many organelles.",
              "However, it was not until recent advances in DNA processing and protein analysis that the function of the many different organelles was understood.",
              "Using microscopic anatomy, scientist can also study the cells during the development of an organism.",
              "This is called embryology, and has developed into a wide field covering everything from human development to evolutionary relationships of organisms based on their developmental processes.",
              "Anatomy is a science older than science itself.",

              "Vision is fundamental to humans, and is the basis of our understanding of the world.",
              "As we advanced in thought and organization, early thinkers began to try to classify organisms. Without any other information, anatomy was often the only evidence available to bind organisms into groups.",
              "Aristotle was among the first to attempt serious organization of living things and used many attributes of their anatomy to group them together.",
              "His two main groups were plants and animals, two groups we can still easily distinguish today based on their gross anatomies.",
              "Early medicine advanced quickly once the moratorium on dissection was lifted.",
              "Often frowned upon in early society, early anatomists like Leonardo Da Vinci often received scrutiny from the public or the church for their scientific inquiry.",
              "However, an understanding of the human body arose from these early pioneers, upon which is built the medical knowledge of today.",
              "Many of the first works of human and animal anatomy were published during the Renaissance.",
              "Many authors showed an advanced, if slightly lacking or skewed view of anatomy as we know it today.",
              "But, without any way to understand the workings of the body further, gross anatomy was stranded by itself.",
              "Fast forward several hundred years and the \u201cFather of Taxonomy\u201d Carl Linnaeus was still mainly focused on gross anatomy as a starting point for classification.",
              "Darwin\u2019s idea of evolution and common ancestors became accepted at the end of the 1800\u2019s.",
              "Still, there were not many methods to evaluate the relationships between animals further.",
              "With the advent of better imaging technology, the 1900\u2019s brought the emergence of microscopic anatomy, and really started to change biology.",
              "Once it was understood that DNA was the principle mode through which organisms inherited traits, revolutions in many disciplines occurred.",
              "Medicine saw a rapid increase in understanding, thanks to the discovery that bacteria and other microbes can cause disease.",
              "The inner workings of the cell were being pieced together, and the functions of the many different organelles understood.",
              "Many aspects of evolutionary biology were rediscovered or overturned as microscopic anatomy and DNA revealed different relationships than were once assumed.",
              "This revolution continues today, as new developments in microscopic anatomy and physiology continually reshape our understanding of organisms. Many careers in the biological sciences require some knowledge of both gross and microscopic anatomy.",

              "Fossil evidence indicates clearly that marsupials originated in the New World.",
              "The oldest known marsupial fossils (which have been found in both China and North America) date from approximately 125 million years ago, during the Cretaceous Period (145 to 66 million years ago).",
              "Their presence in Australia and nearby islands is thought to have occurred from a single migration event in which a group of ancestral marsupials colonized Australia by using land connections with South America via Antarctica.",
              "Whether that took place before the rise of the placental mammals or whether placentals also reached Australasia but died out early on is a subject of lively controversy.",
              "By about 65 million years ago, Australasia was isolated from all other continental masses, and there marsupials evolved into many diverse forms, one of which, Diprotodon (a genus of giant wombats), rivaled the mastodons in bulk.",
              "In South America they survived alongside placentals, forming a significant part of the Neotropical mammalian fauna.",
              "Marsupials also populated Europe, Asia, and North Africa between 125 million and 14 million years ago.",
              "In Australia it is disputed whether aboriginal hunting, and particularly burning of the landscape, contributed to the disappearance of several large species (megafauna) some 50,000 to 45,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene Epoch (2.",
              "6 million to 11,700 years ago).",
              "Through human agency, however, marsupials were introduced to nearby islands of Australia and especially to New Zealand.",
              "In New Ireland the grey cuscus (Phalanger orientalis) was introduced more than 10,000 years ago, and the same species was transported to Timor more than 4,000 years ago.",
              "In Australia the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is an example of a marsupial that has readily adapted to changing conditions brought about by people and is even plentiful in some urban centres.",
              "Its adaptability to different locales is attributed to its tolerance for a variety of food, including household refuse.",
              "The Virginia opossum has experienced a similar success in North America.",
              "British colonization of Australia, which began in earnest during the early 19th century, brought methods of hunting and trapping, large-scale land clearing, and the introduction of foxes, rabbits, cats, and sheep, which soon drove several species of kangaroos and bandicoots to extinction.",
              "Many others, including the koala and the Tasmanian devil, were driven close to the same fate.",
              "Marsupials share with other mammals the presence of hair and mammary glands.",
              "In the female reproductive tract, however, there are twin vaginae that open into a common cavity (the urogenital sinus).",
              "That cavity empties into a short cloaca that is shared with the intestinal tract.",
              "In the male, the testes are in front of the penis.",
              "Other marsupial features include certain skull bone patterns, the usual large openings (fenestrae) in the palate, and the inturning of the bone around the angle of the jaw (gonial inflection), forming a shelf.",
              "Differences also exist in the teeth and in the arrangement of toes.",
              "The other body systems are similar to those of placentals.",
              "The major divisions among marsupials are similar to those among placentals, an idea first presented in 1964.",
              "As a result, the order Marsupialia was later raised to the rank of infraclass under the name Metatheria and divided into two superorders, Ameridelphia and Australidelphia."

Furthermore, the applicability of management strategies across different pest populations may depend on whether the same resistance mechanisms are evolving in each case.",

              "However, pesticide use exerts an exceptionally specific selective pressure, especially in cases of target\u2010site resistance where selection acts not just on a single trait but often on a single molecular target and even specific pesticide\u2010binding residues, with further constraints imposed by the need to maintain the original function of the target protein (Cools, Hawkins & Fraaije, 2013).",

In the case of interspecific gene transfer, introgression from a known source such as a herbicide\u2010resistant crop would be more repeatable than independent evolution of resistance within pest species, whereas introgression from a wider pool of wild relatives, or HGT from more distantly related species, would be less repeatable.",

              "In the case of interspecific transfer from an intrinsically resistant species, the longer timescales over which resistance has evolved in the source species also allow rare or multiple genetic changes to occur, but wider genomic co\u2010adaptation may be lost with crossing or with the horizontal transfer of a small genetic region.",
              "A de novo mutation with a single origin may spread through the movement of insects, seeds and pollen, or spores, whereas an allele present in standing variation may already be present throughout the range of a pest if it arose prior to the spread of the pest species to different regions.",
