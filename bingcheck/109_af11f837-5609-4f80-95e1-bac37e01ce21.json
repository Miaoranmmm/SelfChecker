              "Several NLP tasks break down human text and voice data in ways that help the computer make sense of what it's ingesting.",
              "Some of these tasks include the following: See the blog post \u201cNLP vs. NLU vs. NLG: the differences between three natural language processing concepts\u201d for a deeper look into how these concepts relate.",

              "For example, by transcribing and categorizing the call content, you can gather rich, actionable insights.",
              "The second area is about creating the data you don\u2019t have.",
              "This involves a different and much more strategic approach.",
              "One way to start is by experimenting.",

              "In particular, homogeneous clusters can be built from the agreement and disagreement values: the ontologies O1, O2, O3, O4, O5, O6, O7, O11, O12, O13, O16, O17, O18, O19, and O20 all fully agree with each other and, at the same time, partially agree and disagree with O14 and O15.",
              "O14 and O15 also form a cluster since they agree with each other, and consistently disagree with the same set of ontologies (the reason being that O14 and O15 are the ontologies considering that SeaFood is a subclass of Meat, but agree on all the other related statements).",
              "O21 is also particular, since it disagrees with most of the ontologies of the first cluster, sometimes fully.",

              "Another interesting piece of information that can be derived from the measures defined and from exploiting the collection of ontologies in Watson is the level to which particular statements are agreed with, that is, the level of consensus on a statement.",
              "Conversely, a related item of information concerns the level of controversy on the statement, that is, whether there is a clear-cut between agreement and disagreement.",

              "Thus, the measure of consensus is computed in a set of ontologies R upon a statement st as follows: The notion of controversy is then considered to be the inverse from the one of consensus: there is a high level of controversy on a given statement when there is no clear-cut between agreement and disagreement, that is, there is a low level of consensus.",
              "Therefore, the measure of controversy in a set of ontologies R upon a statement st can simply be computed in the following way: To illustrate these measures, nine statements concerning the class SeaFood in Watson are considered.",

              "As can be seen from these results, the first four statements are fully agreed with by ontologies in Watson, meaning that all the ontologies containing both entities of each statement express exactly the same relation as the one of the statement.",
              "The three next statements also have a very high level of agreement, and a very low level of disagreement.",
              "This is mainly due to a few ontologies containing the right entities, but not necessarily describing any relation between them.",
              "Hence, there is a high level of consensus on these statements.",
              "Finally, the last two statements are the ones for which there is the highest level of controversy.",

              "Using this property as a starting point, our main result rigorously establishes the performance guarantee of SVM-QKE for learning \\({\\mathcal{C}}\\), which also remains robust under small additive noise in the kernel entries.",
              "The concept class \\({\\mathcal{C}}\\) is efficiently learnable by SVM - QKE .",
              "More specifically, for any concept \\(f\\in \\,{\\mathcal{C}}\\) , the SVM - QKE algorithm returns a classifier with test accuracy at least 0.",
              "99 in polynomial time, with probability at least 2/3 over the choice of random training samples and over noise in QKE estimation.",
              "The main idea in our proof (Supplementary Sections IV and V) is to connect the large margin property to existing results on the generalization of soft margin classifiers32.",
              "In this way it is shown that, if the learning algorithm finds a hyperplane w that has a large margin on the training set, then the linear classifier \\(y={\\rm{sign}}\\left({\\langle {{\\varPhi }}(x),w\\rangle }_{{\\mathcal{H}}}\\right)\\) has high accuracy with high probability.",
              "To see how we can apply these results, recall that, in the large margin property, we have established that there exists a hyperplane w* with a large margin on the training set.",
              "Therefore, as the SVM program optimizes for the hyperplane with largest margin, it is guaranteed to find a good hyperplane w, although not necessarily the same as w*.",
              "Applying the generalization bounds to this w gives us the desired result.",
              "As discussed previously, the missing piece in the proof sketch is to show that the performance of SVM-QKE remains robust with additive noise in the kernel.",
              "In the following, we prove noise robustness by introducing two additional results.",
              "First, we show that the dual SVM program (equation (2)) is robust;",
              "that is, when the kernel used in equation (2) has a small additive perturbation, then the solution returned by the program also has a small perturbation.",
              "This follows from the strong convexity of equation (2) and standard perturbation analysis of positive definite quadratic programs43.",
              "This result implies that the hyperplane \\(w^{\\prime}\\) obtained by the noisy kernel is close to the noiseless solution w with high probability.",
              "Second, we show that when \\(w^{\\prime}\\) is close to w, the linear classifier obtained by \\(w^{\\prime}\\) has high accuracy.",
              "This seemingly simple statement is not trivial, as the sign function is sensitive to noise.",
              "That is, if \\({\\langle {{\\varPhi }}(x),w\\rangle }_{{\\mathcal{H}}}\\) is very close to 0, then a small perturbation in w could change its sign.",
              "We provide a solution to this problem by proving a stronger generalization bound.",
              "We show that if a hyperplane w has a large margin on the training set, then not only does \\({\\langle {{\\varPhi }}(x),w\\rangle }_{{\\mathcal{H}}}\\) have the correct sign, it is also bounded away from 0 with high probability.",
              "Therefore, when the noisy solution \\(w^{\\prime}\\) is close to w, \\({\\langle {{\\varPhi }}(x),w^{\\prime} \\rangle }_{{\\mathcal{H}}}\\) also has the correct sign with high probability.",
              "Combining these two results with the proof sketch, we have the full proof of Theorem 2.",
              "We show that learning with quantum feature maps provides a way to harness the computational power of quantum mechanics in machine learning problems. This idea leads to a simple quantum machine learning algorithm that makes no additional assumptions on data access and has rigorous and robust performance guarantees.",
              "Although the learning problem we have presented here, which demonstrates an exponential quantum speed-up, is not practically motivated, our result sets a positive theoretical foundation for the search of practical quantum advantage in machine learning.",
              "An important future direction is to construct quantum feature maps that can be applied to practical machine learning problems that are classically challenging.",
              "The results we have established here can be useful for the theoretical analysis of such proposals.",
              "An important advantage of the SVM-QKE algorithm, which only uses quantum computers to estimate kernel entries, is that error-mitigation techniques can be applied44,45,46 when the feature map circuit is sufficiently shallow.",
              "Our robustness analysis gives hope that an error-mitigated quantum feature map can still maintain its computational power.",
              "Recent experiments have shown the feasibility of the implementation of quantum kernel methods on near-term hardware, and moreover demonstrated the efficacy of error-mitigation techniques, as well as robustness to noise in the kernel entries29,47,48,49.",

              "In collaboration with DeepMind, we have overcome the complexity hurdle with classical machine-learning techniques, in particular making use of Gaussian processes.",

              "[284] Finally, following the 'property as the law of things' identification as supported by Thomas Merrill and Henry E Smith, location-based augmentation is naturally identified as a 'thing', and, while the non-rivalrous and ephemeral nature of digital objects presents difficulties to the excludeability prong of the definition, the article argues that this is not insurmountable.",

              "Because AR/VR adoption is still in its early stages, many educators have not even been exposed to the technology in other contexts, such as training or personal entertainment.",
              "[100] As discussed in this report, many educators are enthusiastic about deploying these technologies in their classrooms. The Department of Education should build on this enthusiasm by offering educators training and resources for using immersive technologies.",
              "For example, the department should provide state education agencies with funding to train educators on how to use different AR/VR devices and applications and identify the best ways to integrate AR/VR technologies to meet state-level standards for classroom and distance learning.",
              "In addition, the department should provide funding for educators to enroll in courses to learn how to create basic immersive content so they can create their own materials to meet specific learning objectives.",

              "[102] The Department of Education should integrate key AR/VR skills into existing digital literacy resources and initiatives for both K-12 and adult learners, including health and safety measures, participant conduct in multiuser experiences, and the fundamentals of content development.",
              "Educational AR/VR content remains in a chicken-and-egg cycle.",
              "Although quantity is expanding, there is still a relative dearth of quality, relevant, age-appropriate content.",

              "[104] Government investment in immersive educational content could break this cycle.",
              "[105] There are three key channels through which this could be achieved.",
              "First, federal government bodies that already produce educational content, such as NASA and the Smithsonian Institution, should invest in developing web-based immersive content.",
              "By increasing the amount of quality and relevant immersive educational content available, these investments could encourage more educators and institutions to invest in the devices necessary to fully experience it.",
              "Further, the Department of Education should include AR/VR solutions as a priority in its investment and grantmaking activities.",
              "This could incentivize innovation both in content development and the use of these technologies in different educational contexts and subjects.",
              "Finally, the federal government should encourage colleges and universities to establish AR/VR labs and resources on their campuses.",
              "As discussed in this report, these spaces could spark interest in immersive technologies as educational tools (thereby increasing demand for content), and also encourage students and faculty to develop innovative uses of these technologies across disciplines, which would increase the range of content available.",
              "Although the cost of immersive solutions is going down, it is still prohibitive for many, particularly districts and institutions with limited resources.",
              "Schools that do have the budget for new technology solutions will likely prioritize established, proven technologies such as laptops and tablets over newer devices and applications\u2014such as AR/VR\u2014that carry higher uncertainty and unfamiliarity.",
              "Fortunately, schools do not necessarily need hundreds of high-end headsets to take advantage of the benefits AR/VR educational tools offer.",
              "Many of the tools highlighted in this report are accessible on web-enabled devices including computers, tablets, and mobile phones.",
              "Funding for technology-access initiatives should prioritize proposals that include provisions for using these devices as immersive educational tools.",
              "In addition, to accelerate adoption of more advanced solutions (e.",
              "g., heads-up AR and MR displays or VR headsets) in educational settings and ensure these technologies are accessible to as many learners as possible, the Department of Education should provide funding for public schools and community colleges to establish AR/VR labs that can provide immersive technology resources to students, educators, and community members.",
              "Initially, the department should provide funding for a small number of pilot centers, with preference given to rural and low-income districts where learners stand to benefit most from the opportunities these technologies present for distance and experiential learning.",
              "These preliminary initiatives could inform guidance and best practices for additional funding and encourage state and local governments to implement similar resources.",
              "The use cases highlighted in this report represent only a sample of the ever-expanding field of immersive education.",
              "As the technology continues to advance and gain more widespread adoption, new possibilities will undoubtedly emerge.",
              "Going forward, it will be important to ensure instructors have the necessary skills and knowledge to implement AR/VR solutions in their lesson plans and create opportunities to develop necessary content, including equipping students and educators with the skills to do so.",
