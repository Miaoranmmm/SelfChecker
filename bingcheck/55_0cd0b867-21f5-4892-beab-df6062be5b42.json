              "He did, however, say that it was \"unthinkable\" that it wouldn't be a hit.",
              "[65] The most positive review came from Sounds, which called it \"impossibly disjointed and complex, but a dazzlingly clever epic from the fevered mind of Freddie Mercury\".",
              "[66] Cash Box called it \"a softly sung ode to the prospect of moving on from staid ways\" with \"good singing\" and \"good production.\"",
              "[67] Record World called it \"a majestic vocal performance that takes on operatic proportions.\"",
              "[68] In 1976, when asked for his opinion on \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson praised the song as \"the most competitive thing that's come along in ages\" and \"a fulfillment and an answer to a teenage prayer\u2014of artistic music\".",
              "[69] Producer Steve Levine said the track broke \"all sonic production barriers\" in a fashion similar to the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" (1966), which also consisted of disparate music sections recorded separately,[70] Phil Spector's \"Be My Baby\" (1963), and 10cc's \"I'm Not in Love\" (1975).",
              "[71] Greg Lake, whose song \"I Believe in Father Christmas\" was kept from number one in the UK by \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" when it was released in 1975, acknowledged that he was \"beaten by one of the greatest records ever made\", describing it as \"a once-in-a-lifetime recording\".",
              "[72] Addressing the song's enduring popularity, author and music lecturer Jochen Eisentraut wrote in 2012: \"A year before punk made it unfashionable, progressive rock had an astounding success with the theoretically over-length (nearly 6-minute) single 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which bore many of the hallmarks of the 'prog' genre\".",
              "He said it was \"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\", it was \"more accessible than other music of the genre\" and was \"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\".",
              "[6] Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \"remarkable\" single and said it \"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\", suggesting the song \"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\".",
              "[62] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide described it as \"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted novelty song ever recorded\".",
              "[73] Writing for the BBC in 2015, the Chicago Tribune's music critic Greg Kot called it a \"prog-rock pocket operetta\" and said the song's \"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude\u2014one that has resonated across generations\".",
              "[26] In 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\": The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975.",
              "That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense.",
              "It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart.",
              "And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.",
              "[5] A comparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist.",
              "They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\".",
              "They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".",
              "[28] In 2015, The Economist described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".",
              "It wrote \"though Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and the Beatles' Paul McCartney had experimented with symphonic elements, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Pete Townshend of the Who had created narrative albums with distinct 'movements', none had had the audacity to import a miniature opera into rock music.\"",
              "[29] In 1992, the song enjoyed renewed popularity in the United States after being featured in a scene in the film Wayne's World, in which the titular character and his friends headbang in a car to the rock part near the end of the song.",
              "[74] The film's director, Penelope Spheeris, was hesitant to use the song, as it did not entirely fit with the lead characters, who were fans of less flamboyant hard rock and heavy metal.",
              "Mike Myers insisted that the song fit the scene.",
              "[75] According to music scholar Theodore Gracyk, by 1992, when the film was released, even \"classic rock\" stations had stopped playing the almost six-minute song.",

              "[76] Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.",
              "[77] In connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band.",
              "Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from Wayne's World with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band.",
              "He said, \"they've just whizzed on a Picasso.\"",
              "He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea and that he apologised to them.",
              "The band, though, sent a reply simply saying, \"Thank you for using our song.\"",
              "This astonished Myers, who responded, \"Thank you for even letting me touch the hem of your garments!\"",
              "[78] The Wayne's World video version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" won Queen its only MTV Video Music Award for \"Best Video from a Film\".",

              "In the 2018 Queen biopic feature film Bohemian Rhapsody, Myers makes a cameo as a fictional record executive who pans the song and refuses to release it as a single, proclaiming that it is too long for radio and that it is not a song that \"teenagers can crank up the volume in their car and bang their heads to\", a reference to the aforementioned scene in Wayne's World.",

              "[26] In 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\": The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975.",
              "That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense.",
              "It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart.",
              "And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.",
              "[5] A comparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist.",
              "They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\".",
              "They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".",

              "[65] The most positive review came from Sounds, which called it \"impossibly disjointed and complex, but a dazzlingly clever epic from the fevered mind of Freddie Mercury\".",
              "[66] Cash Box called it \"a softly sung ode to the prospect of moving on from staid ways\" with \"good singing\" and \"good production.\"",
              "[67] Record World called it \"a majestic vocal performance that takes on operatic proportions.\"",
              "[68] In 1976, when asked for his opinion on \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson praised the song as \"the most competitive thing that's come along in ages\" and \"a fulfillment and an answer to a teenage prayer\u2014of artistic music\".",
              "[69] Producer Steve Levine said the track broke \"all sonic production barriers\" in a fashion similar to the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" (1966), which also consisted of disparate music sections recorded separately,[70] Phil Spector's \"Be My Baby\" (1963), and 10cc's \"I'm Not in Love\" (1975).",
              "[71] Greg Lake, whose song \"I Believe in Father Christmas\" was kept from number one in the UK by \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" when it was released in 1975, acknowledged that he was \"beaten by one of the greatest records ever made\", describing it as \"a once-in-a-lifetime recording\".",
              "[72] Addressing the song's enduring popularity, author and music lecturer Jochen Eisentraut wrote in 2012: \"A year before punk made it unfashionable, progressive rock had an astounding success with the theoretically over-length (nearly 6-minute) single 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which bore many of the hallmarks of the 'prog' genre\".",
              "He said it was \"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\", it was \"more accessible than other music of the genre\" and was \"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\".",
              "[6] Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \"remarkable\" single and said it \"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\", suggesting the song \"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\".",
              "[62] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide described it as \"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted novelty song ever recorded\".",
              "[73] Writing for the BBC in 2015, the Chicago Tribune's music critic Greg Kot called it a \"prog-rock pocket operetta\" and said the song's \"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude\u2014one that has resonated across generations\".",
              "[26] In 2009, The Guardian's music critic, Tom Service, examined the song's relationship with the traditions of classical music, describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\": The precedents of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of Schumann or Chopin or the tone-poems of Strauss or Liszt\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975.",
              "That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense.",
              "It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of Beethoven or the operas of Mozart.",
              "And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.",
              "[5] A comparison was also made between the song and Led Zeppelin's 1971 epic \"Stairway to Heaven\" by music writers Pete Prown and HP Newquist.",
              "They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed folk influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\".",
              "They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".",
              "[28] In 2015, The Economist described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".",
              "It wrote \"though Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and the Beatles' Paul McCartney had experimented with symphonic elements, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Pete Townshend of the Who had created narrative albums with distinct 'movements', none had had the audacity to import a miniature opera into rock music.\"",
              "[29] In 1992, the song enjoyed renewed popularity in the United States after being featured in a scene in the film Wayne's World, in which the titular character and his friends headbang in a car to the rock part near the end of the song.",
              "[74] The film's director, Penelope Spheeris, was hesitant to use the song, as it did not entirely fit with the lead characters, who were fans of less flamboyant hard rock and heavy metal.",
              "Mike Myers insisted that the song fit the scene.",
              "[75] According to music scholar Theodore Gracyk, by 1992, when the film was released, even \"classic rock\" stations had stopped playing the almost six-minute song.",
              "Gracyk suggests that beginning the tape in the middle of the song after \"the lyrics which provide the song's narrative .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "forces the film's audience to respond to its presence in the scene without the 'commentary' of the lyrics\".",
              "[76] Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.",
              "[77] In connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band.",
              "Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from Wayne's World with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band.",
              "He said, \"they've just whizzed on a Picasso.\"",
              "He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea and that he apologised to them.",
              "The band, though, sent a reply simply saying, \"Thank you for using our song.\"",
              "This astonished Myers, who responded, \"Thank you for even letting me touch the hem of your garments!\"",
              "[78] The Wayne's World video version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" won Queen its only MTV Video Music Award for \"Best Video from a Film\".",
              "[79] When remaining members Brian May and Roger Taylor took the stage to accept the award, Brian May was overcome with emotion and said that \"Freddie would be tickled.\"",
              "In the final scene of the video, a pose of the band from the video from the original \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" clip morphs into an identically posed 1985 photo, first featured in the \"One Vision\" video.",
              "In the 2018 Queen biopic feature film Bohemian Rhapsody, Myers makes a cameo as a fictional record executive who pans the song and refuses to release it as a single, proclaiming that it is too long for radio and that it is not a song that \"teenagers can crank up the volume in their car and bang their heads to\", a reference to the aforementioned scene in Wayne's World.",
              "[80] The song has won numerous awards and has been covered and parodied by many artists.",
              "At the 19th Annual Grammy Awards in February 1977, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus and Best Arrangement for Voices.",
              "[81][82] In October 1977, only two years after its release, the British Phonographic Industry named \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as the best British single of the period 1952\u201377.",

              "[108] Initially following the song's release, the operatic middle section proved a problem for the band.",
              "Because of extensive multi-tracking, it could not be performed on stage.",
              "[109] The band did not have enough of a break between the Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night.",
              "The opening and closing ballads were played as part of a medley, with \"Killer Queen\" and \"March of the Black Queen\" taking the place of the operatic and hard rock sections.",
              "In 1976 concerts where the same medley was played, the operatic section from the album would be played from tape as the introduction to the setlist.",
              "During this playback, Mercury would appear briefly to sing live for the line, \"I see a little sillhouetto of a man\".",
              "[110] As the song segued into the hard rock section, the band would emerge on the smoke-filled stage\u2014the playback would end at this point, and the hard rock section would be performed live (without the final ballad section, which appeared later in the set).",
              "Starting with the A Day at the Races Tour in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live.",
              "The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section.",
              "[109] Most playings of the opera section from the tape would often be accompanied by a portion of the song's music video containing the footage used for the operatic portion of the song.",
