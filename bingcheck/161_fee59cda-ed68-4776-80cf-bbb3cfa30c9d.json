    "response": "The first electric guitar was invented in the early 1930s by **George Beauchamp**, with the help of **Adolph Rickenbacker**, for the **Electro String Instrument Corporation**[^2^]. It was adopted by jazz guitar players, who wanted to play single-note guitar solos in large big band ensembles. Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include **Les Paul**, **Eddie Durham**, **George Barnes**, **Lonnie Johnson**, **Sister Rosetta Tharpe**, **T-Bone Walker**, and **Charlie Christian**[^1^].\n\nThe electric guitar revolutionized the music industry by allowing guitarists to produce louder and more distorted sounds, as well as to experiment with new playing techniques and effects. The electric guitar became the most important instrument in popular music during the 1950s and 1960s, and influenced genres such as rock and roll, blues, rock, heavy metal, and many others[^1^].",

              "Lastly, but equally importantly, consider your budget.",
              "Remember that while a high-end expensive guitar will probably offer you a superior sound and build quality, there are many affordable options available that offer great value and are perfect for beginners and intermediate level musicians.",
              "Always judge a guitar based on its sound, feel and how well it suits your personal style rather than its price tag.",
              "In essence, the best electric guitar for Jazz will largely depend on the style, preference, and needs of the individual musician.",
              "Whether you are a veteran Jazz musician, or a budding enthusiast, the right Jazz guitar is out there waiting for you to discover.",
              "You just need to invest some time, a bit of research, and a lot of heart into finding that perfect match.",
              "The understanding of what makes a guitar ideal for jazz music begins with the appreciation for the music itself.",
              "The genre is characterized by rich textures, complex chords, and a range of dynamics that requires a versatile instrument.",
              "One of the defining features of a jazz guitar is the ability to produce clean and smooth tones that are integral to the genre.",
              "The construction and material of the guitar play a crucial part in this, with the woods used in making the guitar affecting how clean and warm the tone is.",
              "The tone produced by mahogany, for instance, is deeper and darker compared to that produced by maple, which is a more commonly used wood for jazz guitars.",
              "The wood for the guitar\u2019s neck, be it maple or mahogany, plays a key role in influencing the tone and can also affect the guitar\u2019s playability and sustain.",
              "Furthermore, the presence of a hollow body can also profoundly influence the tone by producing deep and resonant sounds perfect for jazz music.",
              "Aside from the materials and construction, the design of the electric guitar also matters.",
              "A thicker neck profile is often preferred by jazz guitarists, as it can alter the feel, comfort, and ultimately the player\u2019s technique.",
              "Moreover, the pickups of the electric guitar significantly shape the overall sound \u2013 a major consideration when looking for an electric guitar suitable for jazz.",
              "The most commonly used pickups for jazz are humbucker pickups because they deliver a fat, thick, and warm tone that mitigates the hum or noise usually associated with single-coil pickups.",
              "Adjusting the pickup height can also create distinct tonal variations, making the guitar more adaptable to varying jazz styles.",
              "The criteria for a good jazz electric guitar aren\u2019t just limited to physical characteristics.",
              "The electric guitar\u2019s ability to stay in tune is also a key factor, as it ensures reliable performance during long practices or performances.",
              "The configuration of the bridge and the nut greatly contributes to keeping the guitar in tune, especially when bending strings.",
              "Lastly, the amplifier used also plays a fundamental part in defining the tone, character, and overall audibility of the jazz guitar.",
              "A jazz guitarist needs an amplifier that provides clear and warm tones, and with enough headroom to handle the guitar\u2019s dynamic range.",
              "Despite these points, it\u2019s important to remember that the \u2018right\u2019 guitar for jazz music may vary from one player to another.",
              "However, these elements collectively provide a guideline on what to look for when searching for an electric guitar designed for jazz music.",
              "Indeed, the exploration of these aspects can offer insights into the relationship between the guitar\u2019s design and jazz music, ultimately aiding one\u2019s journey in mastering the genre.",
              "Choosing the right materials for constructing a jazz electric guitar dramatically impacts its two critical aspects \u2013 the tone and durability.",
              "If you want a guitar that can produce a warm, smooth, and full-bodied tone, which is characteristically associated with jazz music, then look for guitars constructed with high-quality tonewoods.",
              "In many notable guitars used for jazz music, the essential primary component has always been woods like mahogany, maple, and rosewood.",
              "The key reason is that these woods possess unique acoustic properties that help create smooth and warm tones, which most jazz musicians prefer.",
              "Maple, for instance, is a preferred choice for a guitar\u2019s body and neck as it delivers a clear, well-rounded tone, and it\u2019s highly resilient to wear and tear.",
              "It\u2019s important to note that both body and neck significantly affect the guitar\u2019s tone and sustain.",
              "The sustain refers to the amount of time a guitar\u2019s tone lingers and the strength of the lingered tone, critical factors in jazz music that heavily relies on instrumental solos.",
              "An electric guitar manufactured from mahogany produces a warm sound with good sustain, and high durability, making it an excellent choice for jazz music.",
              "The rosewood, another excellent material choice, is often used for creating the fingerboard due to its high density, resulting in a rich, full-bodied sound with smooth highs and robust lows.",
              "These wood types also excel in durability, with strong resistance against typical wear-tear due to their dense nature.",
              "Aside from the wood, another integral component is the strings used in the electric guitar.",
              "While each musician can have their own preference, flat wound strings are widely preferred in jazz electric guitars due to their smoother feel and the warm, mellow tone they produce.",
              "The flat wound strings lack the ribbing of round wound strings, which mitigates the finger noise when playing, allowing a cleaner, more defined sound suitable for jazz.",
              "Lastly, the choice of fret material also plays a vital role in the guitar\u2019s sound quality, playability, and longevity.",
              "Guitars with nickel frets are a popular choice for jazz as they are softer and allow for a warmer and mellower tone, which complements the genre\u2019s subtle intricacies.",
              "However, it\u2019s essential to note that the materials used in constructing the guitar only form part of the sum that determines the quality and suitability of an electric guitar for jazz music.",
              "Other aspects like the guitar\u2019s design, hardware, and the musician\u2019s skill level play a vital role too.",
              "Though it\u2019s critical to examine the materials closely used in constructing an electric guitar, it\u2019s equally important not to overlook other factors that together contribute towards creating that jazz desired sound and playability.",
              "Electric guitars, despite all painting a similar image to the untrained eye, vary significantly in their design, quality, and sound output, with some brands being more suitable for jazz music than others.",
              "Recognizing how brands influence the guitar\u2019s quality and sound is crucial when selecting the perfect instrument for playing jazz.",
              "Firstly, it\u2019s worth noting that established brands like Gibson, Fender, and Ibanez have a rich history of creating high-quality instruments that are loved by many jazz musicians, both professionals and beginners.",
              "Gibson, for instance, is renowned worldwide for their solid wood guitars that offer a warm, rounded tone which is commonly associated with classic jazz music.",
              "On the other hand, the Fender Stratocaster, popular for its bright and clear tone, is ideal for musicians seeking to incorporate modern jazz sounds into their performances.",
              "Ibanez guitars are also quite popular in the jazz community.",
              "They are known for their thinner, more agile guitar necks and diverse tone range, making them great for creating melodic jazz tunes.",
              "The reputation of a brand does not solely rest on the quality of instruments they produce, but also extends to their customer service and warranty offerings.",
              "These come into play before and after the purchase, assuring players that their investment is protected.",
              "When discussing the role of different guitar brands in jazz, one must also consider the contribution of smaller, boutique makers.",
              "While they may not be as well-known as the earlier mentioned brands, they often manufacture high-quality, custom electric guitars that cater specifically to the needs of jazz musicians.",
              "Often, these specialized instruments can bring unique tonal qualities and playing experiences that help jazz musicians find their unique voice.",
              "It\u2019s also noteworthy that well-known guitar brands have versatile product lines, providing a range of guitars catering to different budgets.",
              "This is important for jazz musicians at different stages of their journey, ensuring everyone has access to a quality instrument.",
              "For example, the Gibson Les Paul Standard may be out of reach for many beginners and intermediate players.",
              "At the same, these players can find a more affordable alternative in the Gibson Les Paul Studio or Gibson\u2019s subsidiary brand, Epiphone, without compromising much on the quality and iconic tone that Gibson guitars are known for.",
              "Similarly, Fender offers the American Professional Stratocaster for high-end needs, while providing budget-friendly alternatives like the Player Series Stratocaster or guitars from their subsidiary Squier.",
              "What makes certain brands stand out in the jazz domain is their enduring commitment to quality control.",
              "This ensures that every instrument that goes out to a customer, no matter the price point, meets a certain standard of quality that the brand is known for.",
              "Lastly, while the selection of the brand is an important factor to consider, it is crucial to remember that the player\u2019s skill and feel for the instrument ultimately make the most significant difference.",
              "A highly skilled jazz guitarist can make a mediocre guitar sound excellent, and a beginner might not yet be able to coax the best sound out of a high-end jazz guitar.",
              "Hence, the assessment of whether certain brands make better jazz electric guitars is subjective.",
              "The perfect guitar is one that brings out the musician\u2019s best performance, responds well to their touch and style, and suits their specific aesthetic and ergonomic preferences.",
              "When we think about electric guitars for jazz music, the pickup often doesn\u2019t come to mind immediately as one of the first considerations.",
              "However, the pickup plays an integral role in defining the sound of the guitar, particularly when playing jazz music.",
              "The pickup is essentially the heart of an electric guitar as it \u201cpicks up\u201d the vibrations of the strings and converts them into an electrical signal that can be amplified.",
              "The importance of the pickup becomes clear when you consider that the qualities of this signal \u2013 its richness, clarity, and overall tone \u2013 can make or break the sound of your jazz guitar.",
              "Different types of pickups offer different sound characteristics.",
              "For example, a single-coil pickup is generally said to produce a bright, clear tone, while a humbucker (double-coil) pickup is often described as creating a warmer, fuller sound.",
              "These characteristics are vital to take into account as jazz is known for its complex and often subtle tonal nuances.",
              "The nature of the pickup in your electric guitar will not only affect how these nuances are translated but also how effectively they can be expressed.",
              "In addition to the type of pickup, the position of the pickup is also consequential.",
              "A pickup located near the neck will generally provide a smooth and mellow tone \u2013 ideal for playing jazz chords and rhythm parts.",
              "However, a pickup placed closer to the bridge will tend to offer a sharper, brighter tone which might be perfect for jazz leads or solos.",
              "All these aspects need to be considered when selecting an electric guitar for jazz.",
              "In many cases a blend of different pickup types and positions might be the perfect compromise to cater to the diverse tonal requirements of jazz music.",
              "Many professional jazz guitarists go for a combination of single-coil and humbucker pickups or multiple pickups in varying positions to achieve desired tones.",
              "Beyond the type and position, the quality of the pickup is another aspect to consider.",
              "High-quality pickups will likely provide greater clarity and definition in the sound, allowing you to express subtleties and nuances more effectively during your jazz performances.",
              "Conversely, lower-quality pickups might not fully capture all the complexities of your playing, making your sound seem flat or less dynamic.",
              "As a result, investing in a worthwhile pickup can be just as important as investing in the guitar itself, particularly for jazz music.",
              "It\u2019s essential to remember that the best pickup for jazz music can be a deeply personal choice, depending upon a guitarist\u2019s specific playing style, tone preferences, and the kind of jazz they\u2019re into.",
              "The impact of scale length on the sound of a jazz guitar is a multifaceted subject that needs to be unpacked with proper understanding.",
              "The scale length on a guitar is essentially the length of the guitar strings from the bridge to the nut.",
              "This scale length holistically determines the tension required to get the strings to a certain pitch.",
              "In jazz, where a warm and mellow tone is often desired, a short scale length works wonders because of the lower tension required, hence creating a softer sound.",
              "On the contrary, a guitar with a longer scale length will produce a brighter tone with more sustain, due to the higher tension required for the strings.",
              "It\u2019s worth noting that the scale length has an effect on the \u2018feel\u2019 of the guitar, especially in the left hand;",
              "a guitar with a long scale length will have wider spacing between the frets compared to a short scale length, impacting playability for the jazz musician.",
              "This also means that string bending techniques, popular among some jazz guitarists, might be easier to execute on a shorter scale length guitar due to less string tension.",
              "However, a longer scale length might offer more room for articulate fingering of complex jazz chords, due to the wider spacing between frets.",
              "The impact of the scale length touches not only the tonality but also physical aspects of playing the guitar, influencing the player\u2019s speed, comfort, and style.",
              "Understanding this, it can be said that the selection of the scale length when choosing an electric guitar for jazz music is mostly a matter of personal preference and playing style.",
              "It\u2019s critical to try out different guitars with varied scale lengths to feel the difference and decide what compliments your playing style and the tone you are trying to achieve.",
              "Inevitably, the scale length will also interact with other factors like the material of the guitar, body type, type of strings and pickups, to create the final sound output.",
              "So, the scale length should not be considered in isolation but should be viewed in conjunction with these other factors when choosing a jazz electric guitar.",
              "Moreover, the importance of the scale length extends to the maintenance of your guitar too.",
              "For instance, a change in string gauge may require a truss rod adjustment, especially in guitars with a short scale length, to maintain intonation and playability.",
              "With these insights, it becomes clear that scale length is an often-overlooked yet crucial factor that affects the playability, tone, and maintenance of a jazz electric guitar.",
              "Thus, it is prominent that the sound and feel of a jazz guitar, or any guitar for that matter, are significantly influenced by its scale length.",
              "It is, however, important for each guitarist to experiment and discover their own sweet spot between tone, comfort, and playability when it comes to scale length.",
              "The selection of the right strings for jazz electric guitars holds paramount importance when it comes to achieving the desired sound.",
              "There\u2019s a wide range of strings available in the market, which makes the selection process quite a challenge for many.",
              "However, it is crucial to remember that jazz music is characterized by a warm, smooth, and complex tone, and the strings can significantly contribute to that.",
              "To perfectly mimic that iconic jazz sound, flatwound strings emerge as the top choice for many jazz guitarists.",
              "Flatwound strings are manufactured by wrapping a flat strip of metal around the core.",
              "This results in a smooth and flat surface which is not only comfortable to the touch but also reduces finger slide noise significantly.",
              "When it comes to richness and warmth, nothing beats flatwound strings as they produce a deep tone, ideal for jazz music.",
              "These strings may seem high on the budget, but they are worth the investment considering they last longer and maintain tuning better than other types of strings.",
              "If flatwound strings are not within your budget range, consider the halfwound, or groundwound, strings.",
              "They provide a midway sonically between roundwound and flatwound strings, capturing the warmer tones of jazz while still maintaining a bright edge.",
              "If you are seeking a brighter tone for fusion jazz or jazz-rock, you may consider roundwound strings.",
              "These strings are wrapped with round wire, providing a brighter and more resonant tone that cuts through other instruments.",
              "Increased finger noise may be a concern with this type of strings, but the brightness makes them suitable for certain styles in jazz.",
              "For string gauges, thicker sets are often preferred by jazz musicians as they contribute to the warm and full tone associated with jazz music.",
              "But this is not a rule, and the decision often rests on a player\u2019s personal taste and comfort.",
              "Note that string gauge can also affect the playability of the guitar.",
              "While thicker strings contribute to a richer tone, they require more strength to fret and bend, making them potentially uncomfortable for some players.",
              "Lastly, the choice of string materials also weighs in heavily in achieving the right jazz sound.",
              "Stronger materials like steel or bronze are well-suited for jazz due to their bright, clear, and cutting quality.",
              "The balance between the playability, tone, and durability of the guitar strings greatly influence the performance in jazz music.",
              "While understanding the various factors that contribute to string choice is important, it ultimately boils down to personal preference and the kind of sound that the guitarist is aiming to produce.",
              "Therefore, it\u2019s advisable for jazz players to experiment with different string types, gauges, and materials, to find the perfect blend that suits their style and sound.",
              "When discussing the vital aspects of a jazz guitar, the guitar\u2019s neck often flies under the radar whilst other components steal the spotlight.",
              "However, the neck is just as integral to curating that quintessential jazz sound and should not be underestimated.",
              "In truth, the construction of the neck directly affects the overall feel and playability of your instrument.",
              "If the neck of your guitar isn\u2019t comfortable in your hand, you\u2019ll have difficulty playing smoothly and consequently, the quality of your sound will suffer.",
              "The aspect of neck shape is what primarily determines a guitar\u2019s playability.",
              "Generally, jazz musicians prefer a thicker neck shape called a \u201cD\u201d shape because it traditionally offers a warmer sound indicative of jazz music.",
              "On the other hand, a faster, thinner neck or a \u201cC\u201d shape neck, is typically preferred by rock or metal players for quicker movements, but it\u2019s all down to individual preferences.",
              "Another major role that the neck plays involves the action of the strings.",
              "The action, or the space between the strings and the fretboard, can have a significant impact on sound and playability.",
              "A neck that is too straight or too bowed can cause high action, making the guitar difficult to play, especially for intricate jazz chord changes and improvisations.",
              "Conversely, a neck that is perfectly straight might result in low action, allowing the strings to buzz against the frets, potentially disrupting the clean, smooth sound that jazz requires.",
              "A good balance that many professional jazz guitarists use is to have the action set at a medium height, creating ease of playability without sacrificing tone.",
              "In addition, the neck\u2019s truss rod, a metal rod that runs along the inside of the neck, is also a key factor to consider.",
              "The job of the truss rod is to combat the tension from the strings and keep the neck of the guitar straight.",
              "You can adjust the truss rod to fine-tune the curvature of the neck, affecting the guitar\u2019s action and consequently the overall performance of the guitar.",
              "Moreover, the material of the neck also plays a huge role in how your jazz guitar will sound.",
              "Generally, most jazz guitar necks are made from mahogany or maple which are known to provide a rich, warm sound ideal for jazz music.",
              "Jazz guitarists will often find maple necks more appealing due to its brighter tonality, compared to mahogany which has a more muted, darker tone.",
              "Of course, this all comes down to personal choice as everyone\u2019s hands are different and every player has their own distinct style.",
              "Therefore, when making the decision, it\u2019s always important to physically try out different guitar necks and see which one feels right to you.",
              "In general, the comfort and ease of playability is a key factor when considering the guitar\u2019s neck for jazz music as it directly impacts your performance.",
              "Remember, your ability to effectively express your musical ideas is influenced by how well the guitar responds to your touch.",
              "Thus, the importance of the guitar\u2019s neck in jazz music cannot be overstated, and merits careful consideration when selecting the right jazz guitar for you.",
              "The right electric guitar can make all the difference in your Jazz music experience.",
              "A few key factors to consider are the type of sound you want, the guitar\u2019s design, and how comfortable you are when you play it.",
              "From researching various models, brands, and guitar player reviews, some of the best electric guitars for Jazz music are from Gibson, Fender, and Ibanez.",
              "These brands have been around for many years and have refined their guitars to deliver top-notch sound quality.",
              "No matter what type or brand of guitar you choose, remember that the best jazz guitar is the one that resonates with you.",

              "Published on By Even the very best jazz guitarists rarely receive the attention and plaudits that the genre\u2019s horn blowers \u2013 saxophonists and trumpeters, in particular \u2013 receive.",
              "Perhaps that\u2019s because, traditionally, the guitar, which superseded the banjo in jazz rhythm sections, was primarily perceived as a supporting and accompanying instrument rather than a viable vehicle for solo improvisation.",
              "Another reason why the spotlight didn\u2019t fall on jazz guitar players in the music\u2019s formative years was that their instrument was acoustic and didn\u2019t have the ability to cut through the rest of the ensemble like brass and woodwind instruments could.",
              "So while the horns basked in the limelight, guitarists had to make do strumming chords and comping in the background.",
              "But electric amplification changed everything for the role of the guitar in jazz.",
              "Introduced in 1931, the hollow-bodied electric guitar was immediately sought-after by guitarists struggling to be heard in the swing era of brass-heavy big bands.",
              "Now, though, not only could their percussive rhythm work be clearly audible in relation to the rest of the ensemble, but the possibility of playing solo passages had also become a tangible reality.",
              "Even so, due to the propulsive nature of big band swing and its emphasis on the interplay of the horns, the best jazz guitarists of the era \u2013 like the Count Basie band\u2019s Freddie Green, one of the pre-eminent swing-era axe men \u2013 were rarely granted, or even desired, solo passages.",

              "I have been teaching at the University level for 36 years now, and have tried many approaches with my students.",
              "Teaching scale and mode relationships to chords has had decent results with some students.",
              "A few years ago I switched my approach from that and my students have really taken off in terms of facility and creativity.",
              "What I now teach is what I call a \u201ctarget note\u201d system.",
              "The first step to this is to learn and master as many extended chord shapes and inversions as possible.",
              "I do that by using both straight rhythm charts and chord melody arrangements of standard tunes.",
              "Once the student becomes conversant with a lot of locations of chord shapes, then we discuss chord substitutions and movement of various progressions.",
              "We then change the standard harmonies and develop new directions of chord movement, and work from there in starting to play improvised single note solos.",
              "The basic principle is that the student plays around the tonality and shape of the chord that is happening in the music.",
              "This means keeping a close watch on the music and knowing what chord is being played at all times.",
              "Many students try to rely too much on good ears, and forget the importance of always knowing what chord is going on and playing accurately with it.",
              "As the present chord prepares to change to the next one, a target note in that next shape is selected to land on exactly when it falls, and the phrase is either ended or continued from there.",
              "What this does is give the player pretty much unlimited options in terms of direction of his or her improvised lines.",
              "A single target note can be moved into from above or below.",
              "The more inversions of the chord utilized offer many more choices.",
              "Add to that the possible substitutions and harmonic reconstruction that is possible, and the player should very seldom have a problem keeping their lines different and fresh.",
              "We start by using slow straight 8th note phrases and hearing how the selected notes match up with the chords.",
              "Then we work on more melodic and rhythmic phrases and become more musical and less metronomic in the single note lines.",
              "It does not take long for the student to gain confidence that \u201cgood\u201d notes will be more and more frequent.",
              "This also gives them a terrific start to experimenting with playing a little more outside the standard chord progressions and being more comfortable doing that.",
              "Knowing how to get back into the correct tonality and harmony is guaranteed when superior chord knowledge is the base of their experimentation.",
              "The shape and target note approach really works far better than anything else I have ever used in my teaching.",
              "This is so much better from my way of thinking than simply matching scales and modes with chords and playing through them somewhat mechanically.",

              "Lester William Polsfuss (June 9, 1915 \u2013 August 12, 2009), known as Les Paul, was an American jazz, country, and blues guitarist, songwriter, luthier, and inventor.",
              "He was one of the pioneers of the solid-body electric guitar, and his prototype, called the Log, served as inspiration for the Gibson Les Paul.",
              "Paul taught himself how to play guitar, and while he is mainly known for jazz and popular music, he had an early career in country music.",
              "[1] In the 1950s, he and his wife, singer and guitarist Mary Ford, recorded numerous records, selling millions of copies.",
              "Paul is credited with many recording innovations.",
              "His early experiments with overdubbing (also known as sound on sound),[2] delay effects such as tape delay, phasing, and multitrack recording were among the first to attract widespread attention.",
              "[3] His licks, trills, chording sequences, fretting techniques, and timing set him apart from his contemporaries and inspired many guitarists of the present day.",
              "[4][5][6][7] Among his many honors, Paul is one of a handful of artists with a permanent exhibit in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",
              "[8] He is prominently named by the music museum on its website as an \"architect\" and a \"key inductee\" with Sam Phillips and Alan Freed.",
              "[9] Paul is the only inductee in both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the National Inventors Hall of Fame.",
              "[10] Paul was born Lester William Polsfuss[11] in Waukesha, Wisconsin, to George[10] and Evelyn (Stutz) Polsfuss, both of German ancestry.",
              "[12] His only sibling, Ralph, was seven years older.",
              "Paul's mother was related to the founders of Milwaukee's Valentin Blatz Brewing Company and the makers of the Stutz automobile.",
              "[13] His parents divorced when he was a child.",
              "[14] His mother simplified their Prussian family name first to Polfuss, then to Polfus, although Les Paul never legally changed his name.",
              "Before taking the stage name Les Paul, he performed as Red Hot Red[15] and Rhubarb Red.",
              "[16] At the age of eight, Paul began playing the harmonica.",
              "After learning the piano, he switched to the banjo and guitar.",
              "During this time, Paul invented a neck-worn harmonica holder, which allowed him to play both sides of the harmonica, hands-free, while performing on the banjo and guitar.",
              "Les Paul\u2019s hands-free design is still widely manufactured today.",
              "[17] By age thirteen, Paul was performing semi-professionally as a country-music singer, guitarist, and harmonica player.",
              "While playing at Waukesha area drive-ins and roadhouses, Paul began his first experiment with sound.",
              "Wanting to make his acoustic guitar heard by more people at the local venues, he wired a phonograph needle to his guitar and connected it to a radio speaker.",
              "[18] As a teen Paul experimented with sustain by using a 2-foot piece of rail from a nearby train line.",
              "[19] At age seventeen, Paul played with Rube Tronson's Texas Cowboys, and soon after he dropped out of high school to team up with Sunny Joe Wolverton's Radio Band in St.",
              "Louis, Missouri, on KMOX.",
              "Paul and Wolverton moved to Chicago in 1934, where they continued to perform country music on radio station WBBM and at the 1934 Chicago World's Fair.",
              "While in Chicago, Paul learned jazz from the great performers on Chicago's Southside.",
              "During the day, he played country music as Rhubarb Red on the radio.",
              "At night, he was Les Paul, playing jazz.",
              "He met pianist Art Tatum, whose playing influenced him to continue with the guitar rather than play jazz on the piano.",
              "[20] His first two records were released in 1936, credited to \"Rhubarb Red\", Paul's hillbilly alter ego.",
              "He also served as an accompanist for other bands signed to Decca.",
              "During this time, he began adding different sounds and adopted his stage name of Les Paul.",
              "[21] Paul's guitar style was strongly influenced by the music of Django Reinhardt, whom he greatly admired.",
              "[22] Following World War II, Paul sought out and made friends with Reinhardt.",
              "When Reinhardt died in 1953, Paul paid for part of the funeral's cost.",
              "[23] One of Paul's prized possessions was a Selmer acoustic guitar given to him by Reinhardt's widow.",
              "[15] Paul formed a trio in 1937 with rhythm guitarist Jim Atkins[24][25] (older half-brother of guitarist Chet Atkins) and bassist[25]/percussionist Ernie \"Darius\" Newton.",
              "They left Chicago for New York in 1938,[26] landing a featured spot with Fred Waring's radio show.",
              "Chet Atkins later wrote that his brother, home on a family visit, presented him with an expensive Gibson archtop guitar that Les Paul had given to Jim.",
              "Chet recalled that it was the first professional-quality instrument he ever owned.",
              "[27] While jamming in his apartment basement in 1941,[26] Paul nearly succumbed to electrocution.",
              "During two years of recuperation, he moved to Chicago where he was the music director for radio stations WJJD and WIND.",
              "In 1943, he moved to Hollywood where he performed on radio and formed a new trio.",
              "He was drafted into the U.",
              "S.",
              "Army in 1943,[26] where he served in the Armed Forces Radio Network, backing such artists as Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters, and performing in his own right.",
              "[28] As a last-minute replacement for Oscar Moore, Paul played with Nat King Cole and other artists in the inaugural Jazz at the Philharmonic concert in Los Angeles, California, on July 2, 1944.",
              "His solo on \"Body and Soul\" is a demonstration of his admiration for and emulation of Django Reinhardt, as well as his development of original lines.",
              "Also that year, Paul's trio appeared on Bing Crosby's radio show.",
              "Crosby sponsored Paul's recordings.",
              "They recorded together several times, including \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\", which was a No.",
              "1 hit[25] in 1945.",
              "Paul recorded several albums for Decca in the 1940s.",
              "The Andrews Sisters hired his trio to open for them during a tour in 1946.",
              "Their manager, Lou Levy, said watching Paul's fingers while he played guitar was like watching a train go by.",
              "[29] Their conductor, Vic Schoen, said his playing was always original.",
              "[29] Maxine Andrews said, \"He'd tune into the passages we were singing and lightly play the melody, sometimes in harmony.",
              "We'd sing these fancy licks and he'd keep up with us note for note in exactly the same rhythm.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "almost contributing a fourth voice.",
              "But he never once took the attention away from what we were doing.",
              "He did everything he could to make us sound better.\"",
              "[29] In the 1950s, when he recorded Mary Ford's vocals on multiple tracks, he created music that sounded like the Andrews Sisters.",
              "[29] In January 1948, Paul shattered his right arm and elbow among multiple injuries in a near-fatal automobile accident on an icy Route 66 west of Davenport, Oklahoma.",
              "Mary Ford was driving the Buick convertible, which plunged off the side of a railroad overpass and dropped twenty feet into a ravine.",
              "They were returning from Wisconsin to Los Angeles after visiting family.",
              "[26] Doctors at Oklahoma City's Wesley Hospital told Paul that they could not rebuild his elbow.",
              "Their other option was amputation.",
              "Paul was flown to Los Angeles, where his arm was set at an angle\u2014just under 90 degrees\u2014that allowed him to cradle and pick the guitar.",
              "It took him nearly a year and a half to recover.",
              "[30] In 1940, Les Paul revisited his experiments with the train rail.",
              "This time he created a similar prototype instrument, a one-off solid-body electric guitar known as \"The Log\", which was manufactured utilizing a common construction material often referred as a \u201c4x4 stud post\u201d, which provided a unique neck-thru design.",
              "The \u201cstud post\u201d (a 4\u201d x 4\u201d section of Douglas Fir) was then equipped with a crude bridge and an electromagnetic pickup, neck and strings.",
              "The Log was constructed by Paul after-hours in the New York City Epiphone guitar factory, and is one of the first solid-body electric guitars.",
              "[31][32] For the sake of appearance, he attached the body of an Epiphone hollow-body guitar sawn lengthwise with The Log in the middle.",
              "This solved his two main problems: feedback, as the acoustic body no longer resonated with the amplified sound, and sustain, as the energy of the strings was not dissipated in generating sound through the guitar body.",
              "These instruments were constantly being improved and modified over the years, and Paul continued to use them in his recordings even after the development of his eponymous Gibson model.",
              "Paul approached the Gibson Guitar Corporation with his idea of a solid-body electric guitar in 1941,[26] but Gibson showed no interest until Fender began marketing its Esquire and Broadcaster guitars in 1950 (the Broadcaster was renamed the Telecaster in 1952).",
              "Gibson's Ted McCarty was the chief designer of the guitar, which was based on Paul's drawings and later dubbed the Gibson Les Paul.",
              "Gibson entered into a promotional and financial arrangement with Les Paul, paying him a royalty on sales.",
              "[33] The guitar went on sale in 1952.",
              "Paul continued to make design suggestions.",
              "In 1960, sales of the original Les Paul model had dropped, so a more modernistic model was introduced (today called the SG), but then still bearing the Les Paul name.",
              "Not liking the new look and severe problems with the strength of the body and neck, made Paul dissatisfied with this new Gibson guitar.",
              "This, and a pending divorce from Mary Ford, led to Paul ending his endorsement and use of his name on Gibson guitars from 1964 until 1966, by which time his divorce was completed.",
              "[34] Paul continued to suggest technical improvements, although they were not always successful commercially.",
              "In 1962, Paul was issued U.",
              "S.",
              "Patent 3,018,680, for a pickup in which the coil was integrated into the bridge.",
              "[35] In the mid-1940s, he introduced an aluminum guitar with the tuning mechanisms below the bridge.",
              "As it had no headstock, and the string attachments were at the nut, it was the first \"headless\" guitar.",
              "Unfortunately, Paul's guitar was so sensitive to the heat from stage lights that it would not keep tune.",
              "However, he used it for several of his hit recordings.",
              "This style was further developed by others, most successfully Ned Steinberger.",
              "[36] A less-expensive version of the Les Paul guitar is manufactured for Gibson's Epiphone brand.",
              "[37] Paul first experimented with sound on sound while in elementary school when he punched holes in the piano roll for his mother's player piano.",
              "In 1946, his mother complimented him on a song she had heard on the radio, when in fact she had heard George Barnes, not Paul.",
              "[38] This motivated Paul to spend two years in his Hollywood garage recording studio, creating his unique sound, his New Sound.",
              "Paul stunned the music industry with his New Sound in 1948.",
              "Paul recorded several songs with Bing Crosby, most notably \"It's Been a Long, Long Time,\" which was a number-one single in 1945.",
              "[39][25] After a recording session, Bing Crosby suggested that Paul build a recording studio so he could produce the sound he wanted.",
              "Paul started his studio in the garage of his home on North Curson Street in Hollywood.",
              "The studio drew many vocalists and musicians who wanted the benefit of his expertise.",
              "His experiments included microphone placement, track speed, and recording overdubs.",
              "These methods resulted in a clarity previously unheard in this type of multitrack recording.",
              "People began to consider his recording techniques as instruments\u2014as important to production as a guitar, bass, or drums.[40] Capitol Records released \"Lover (When You're Near Me)\", on which Paul played eight different parts on electric guitar,[25] some recorded at half-speed, hence \"double-fast\" when played back at normal speed for the master.",
              "This was the first time he used multitracking in a recording.",
              "His early multitrack recordings, including \"Lover\" and \"Brazil\" were made with acetate discs.",
              "He recorded a track onto a disk, then recorded himself playing another part with the first.",
              "He built the multitrack recording with overlaid tracks rather than parallel ones as he did later.",
              "By the time he had a result that satisfied him, he had discarded some five hundred recording disks.",
              "As a teen he had built a disc-cutter assembly using the flywheel from a Cadillac, a dental belt and other parts from his father's car repair shop.",
              "Years later in his Hollywood garage, he used the acetate disc setup to record parts at different speeds and with delay, resulting in his signature sound with echoes and birdsong-like guitar riffs.",
              "In 1949, Crosby gave Paul one of the first Ampex Model 200A reel to reel tape recorders.",
              "[26] Paul invented sound on sound recording using this machine by placing an additional playback head, located before the conventional erase/record/playback heads.",
              "This allowed Paul to play along with a previously recorded track, both of which were mixed together onto a new track.",
              "The Ampex was a monophonic tape recorder with only one track across the entire width of quarter-inch tape, and therefore, the recording was \"destructive\" in the sense that the original recording was permanently replaced with the new, mixed recording.",
              "He eventually enhanced this by using one tape machine to play back the original recording and a second to record the combined track.",
              "This preserved the original recording.",
              "[41] In 1952, Paul invented the flange effect, where a sound phases in and out in harmonic tone.",
              "The first example of this can be heard on his song \"Mammy's Boogie\".",
              "[42][43] Observing film recordings inspired Paul to design the stacking of eight tape recorders.",
              "He worked with Ross Snyder on the design of the first eight-track recording deck built for him by Ampex for his home studio.",
              "[44][45][41] Rein Narma built a custom 8-channel mixing console for him.",
              "[46] The mixing board included in-line equalization and vibrato effects.",
              "He named the recorder \"The Octopus\" and the mixing console \"The Monster\".",
              "[47] The name \"octopus\" was inspired by comedian W.",
              "C.",
              "Fields who was the first person to hear Paul play his multi-tracked guitar experiments.",
              "\"He came to my garage to make a little record (in 1946),\" Les recalled.",
              "\"I played him the acetate of 'Lover' that I'd done.",
              "When he heard it, he said, 'My boy, you sound like an octopus.'",
              "\"[48] In the summer of 1945, Paul met country-western singer Iris Colleen Summers.",
              "They began working together on Paul's radio show, as Rhubarb Red and The Ozark Apple Knockers with Mary Lou.",
              "Later Paul suggested the stage name Mary Ford.",
              "They married in Milwaukee in 1949.",
              "Their hits included \"How High the Moon\", \"Bye Bye Blues\", \"Song in Blue\", \"Don'cha Hear Them Bells\", \"The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise\", and \"Vaya con Dios\".",
              "The songs were recorded with multiple tracks where Ford harmonized with herself and Paul played multiple layers of guitars.",
              "They used the recording technique known as close miking[44] where the microphone is less than 6 inches (15 cm) from the singer's mouth.",
              "This produces a more intimate, less reverberant sound than when a singer is 1 foot (30 cm) or more from the microphone.",
              "When using a pressure-gradient (uni- or bi-directional) microphone, it emphasizes low-frequency sounds in the voice due to the microphone's proximity effect and gives a more relaxed feel because the performer is not working as hard.",
              "The result is a singing style which diverged from the unamplified theater style of the musical comedies of the 1930s and 1940s.",
              "They also performed music-hall style semi-comic routines with Mary mimicking whatever line Les decided to improvise.",
              "[49] Paul hosted a 15-minute radio program, The Les Paul Show, on NBC Radio in 1950, featuring his trio (himself, Ford and rhythm player Eddie Stapleton) and his electronics.",
              "The program was recorded from their home and with gentle humor between Paul and Ford bridging musical selections, some of which had already been successful on records, some of which anticipated the couple's recordings, and many of which presented re-interpretations of such jazz and pop selections as \"In the Mood\", \"Little Rock Getaway\", \"Brazil\", and \"Tiger Rag\".",
              "Many of these shows survive and are available from various sources.",
              "[50] When Paul used magnetic tape, he could take his recording equipment on tour, making episodes for his fifteen-minute radio show in a hotel room.",
              "The show appeared on television a few years later with the same format, but excluding the trio and retitled 'Les Paul & Mary Ford at Home with \"Vaya Con Dios\" as the theme song.",
              "Sponsored by Warner\u2013Lambert's Listerine mouthwash, it was aired on NBC television during 1954\u20131955, and then was syndicated until 1960.",
              "The five-minute show, consisting of the performance of only one or two songs, aired five times a day, five days a week, and therefore was used as a brief interlude or fill-in for programming schedules.",
              "Since Paul created the entire show himself, including audio and video, he maintained the original recordings and was in the process of restoring them to current quality standards until his death.",
              "[51] During his radio shows, Paul introduced the fictional \"Les Paulverizer\" device, which multiplies anything fed into it, such as a guitar sound or a voice.",
              "It was Paul's way of explaining how his single guitar could be multiplied to become a group of guitars.",
              "The device even became the subject of comedy, with Ford multiplying herself and her vacuum cleaner with it so she could finish the housework faster.",
              "Later, Paul created a real Les Paulverizer that he attached to his guitar.",
              "The invention allowed Paul to access pre-recorded layers of songs during live performances so he could replicate his recorded sound on stage.",
              "[52] In 1965, Paul went into semi-retirement, although he did return to his studio occasionally.",
              "He and Ford had divorced at the end of 1964 after she became tired of touring.",
              "[53] One of Paul's most recognizable recordings from then through the mid-1970s was an album for London Records/Phase 4 Stereo, Les Paul Now (1968), on which he updated some of his earlier hits.",
              "Paul played the initial guitar track, and George Barnes laid down the additional tracks while Paul engineered in his home studio.",
              "He also recorded two albums, Chester and Lester (1976) and Guitar Monsters (1978), for RCA Victor, comprising a meld of jazz and country improvisation with guitar virtuoso Chet Atkins, backed by some of Nashville's celebrated studio musicians.",
              "In 1969 Paul produced the album Poe Through the Glass Prism for RCA.",
              "The album featured songs based on Edgar Allan Poe's writing by the northeastern Pennsylvania band the Glass Prism.",

              "An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be heard at typical performance volumes, unlike a standard acoustic guitar.",
              "It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers.",
              "The sound is sometimes shaped or electronically altered to achieve different timbres or tonal qualities from that of an acoustic guitar via amplifier settings or knobs on the guitar.",
              "Often, this is done through the use of effects such as reverb, distortion and \"overdrive\";",
              "the latter is considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and jazz, rock and heavy- metal guitar playing.",
              "Designs also exist combining attributes of the electric and acoustic guitars: the semi-acoustic and acoustic-electric guitars.",
              "Invented in 1932, the electric guitar was adopted by jazz guitar players, who wanted to play single-note guitar solos in large big band ensembles.",

              "During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in popular music.",
              "[1] It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles in genres ranging from pop and rock to folk to country music, blues and jazz.",
              "It served as a major component in the development of electric blues, rock and roll, rock music, heavy metal music and many other genres of music.",
              "Electric guitar design and construction varies greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups.",
              "Guitars may have a fixed bridge or a spring-loaded hinged bridge, which lets players \"bend\" the pitch of notes or chords up or down, or perform vibrato effects.",
              "The sound of an electric guitar can be modified by new playing techniques such as string bending, tapping, and hammering-on, using audio feedback, or slide guitar playing.",
              "There are several types of electric guitar.",
              "Early forms were hollow-body semi-acoustic guitars, while solid body guitars developed later.",

              "In the case of Gibson and PRS, these are called chambered bodies.",
              "The motivation for this may be to reduce weight, to achieve a semi-acoustic tone (see below) or both.",
              "[28][29][30] Semi-acoustic guitars have a hollow body similar to an acoustic guitar and electromagnetic pickups mounted directly into the body.",
              "They work in a similar way to solid-body electric guitars except that because the hollow body also vibrates, the pickups convert a combination of string and body vibration into an electrical signal.",
              "Many models have a solid block running through the middle of the soundbox designed to reduce acoustic feedback, known as semi-hollow bodies.",
              "They do not provide enough acoustic volume for live performance, but they can be used unplugged for quiet practice.",
              "Semi-acoustic guitars are noted for being able to provide a sweet, plaintive, or funky tone.",
              "They are used in many genres, including jazz, blues, funk, sixties pop, and indie rock.",
              "They generally have cello-style F-shaped sound holes, which can be blocked off to further reduce feedback.",
              "Whereas chambered guitars are made, like solid-body guitars, from a single block of wood, semi-acoustic guitar bodies are made from multiple pieces of wood in an archtop form, a method of construction different from the typical steel string acoustic guitar): the top is formed from a moderately thick (1 inch (2.",

              "They may also be fitted with a piezoelectric pickup under the bridge, attached to the bridge mounting plate, or with a low-mass microphone (usually a condenser mic) inside the body of the guitar that converts the vibrations in the body into electronic signals.",
              "Combinations of these types of pickups may be used, with an integral mixer/preamp/graphic equalizer.",
              "Such instruments are called electric acoustic guitars.",
              "They are regarded as acoustic guitars rather than electric guitars because the pickups do not produce a signal directly from the vibration of the strings, but rather from the vibration of the guitar top or body, and the amplification of the sound merely increases volume, not alters tone.",

              "Here\u2019s how it works.",
              "The story of the Gibson-toting guitarist who lit the fire on a six-string revolution that paved the way for rock \u2019n\u2019 roll Rosetta Nubin was born on 20 March 1915 in Cotton Plant, Arkansas, a small town sandwiched between the Midwestern and Southern states.",
              "Both parents were cotton workers, although Rosetta didn\u2019t know much of her father except that he sang in his spare time.",
              "Her mother, Katie, was deeply ensconced in the local church as both deaconess, vocalist and mandolinist.",
              "Clearly a child prodigy, by the age of six Rosetta was performing with her mother, singing and playing guitar under the name Little Rosetta Nubin as part of a travelling evangelical group.",
              "Even at this early stage Rosetta was spoken of as a formidable talent on the guitar.",
              "Throughout the 1920s, she further honed her skills after relocating with her mother to Chicago, performing in gospel music ensembles locally alongside the occasional nationwide tour.",
              "It was around this time that Rosetta started to hear the first recordings of such blues queens as Ma Rainey and the trio of Smiths \u2013 Bessie, Trixie and Mamie.",
              "This was the era when blues was dominated by female artists shortly before the first Delta, or country blues, recordings were made.",
              "Rosetta was right in the thick of it, absorbing the music of her church roots and mixing in a dose of the blues \u2013 a controversial pursuit at the time.",
              "In 1934, aged just 19, Rosetta married for the first time.",
              "His name was Thomas Thorpe, a preacher who was part of the touring troupe that Rosetta and Katie were involved with.",
              "The marriage lasted just four years, but in that time Rosetta Nubin became Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a slight deviation from her husband\u2019s name.",
              "Big Band leader Lucky Millinder led an orchestra from the mid-1920s to the mid-\u201950s that served as a breeding ground for many future stars of jazz and blues.",
              "Bull Moose Jackson, Wynonie Harris and Ruth Brown were among those who later found fame as R&B took hold into the 1940s.",
              "Tharpe joined Millinder\u2019s orchestra for her first recordings at the end of October 1938 waxing four sides for Decca.",
              "That\u2019s All and My Man And I feature just Tharpe\u2019s voice and Delta-infused National guitar.",
              "Sounding for all the world like a female Robert Johnson, Rosetta\u2019s sparkling voice soared over her accompaniment, demonstrating her mastery of the country blues style perfectly.",
              "The Lonesome Road \u2013 an evergreen jazz standard with a gospel-leaning lyric later recorded by the likes of Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole \u2013 sees Rosetta performing solely as vocalist, her church-influenced yet blues-drenched voice perfect for this material.",
              "It\u2019s with Rock Me, however, that we hear Tharpe\u2019s electric guitar for the first time and, significantly, this is the very record that had such a profound influence on future rock \u2019n\u2019 rollers such as Elvis, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis.",
              "It\u2019s a typical 16-bar blues sequence, for the time, where Rosetta\u2019s now patent bluesy-gospel vocal blends effortlessly with Millinder\u2019s standard swing-era big band arrangement.",
              "But it\u2019s the opening 16-bar guitar solo that caused such a stir and is nothing short of revolutionary.",
              "Big Bill Broonzy\u2019s It\u2019s A Low Down Dirty Shame featured the first electric guitar sounds on a blues recording courtesy of the legendary George Barnes and was recorded a mere seven months before Tharpe\u2019s Rock Me solo.",
              "In turn, both recordings are almost a year before the first records by Charlie Christian were issued.",
              "Sister Rosetta truly was a force and highly influential in the electric guitar\u2019s early days, a fact so often overlooked.",
              "It\u2019s a beautifully melodic solo full of subtle slides and string bends, and sounds as though it\u2019s taken as much from country music as it has blues.",
              "The song was a huge hit and made Rosetta a star despite the controversy surrounding the recording, which, effectively, is a gospel song performed in a secular style.",
              "It was a full 16 years before Ray Charles got the credit for mixing sacred with secular with his seminal I Got a Woman record from 1955.",
              "But it was Rosetta who was the true pioneer.",
              "A stream of historically important recordings followed.",
              "This Train, Trouble In Mind, Shout Sister Shout, Nobody\u2019s Fault But Mine and Strange Things Happening Every Day, her biggest hit, are just some of her recordings that are now acknowledged as groundbreaking and influential in those proto-rock \u2019n\u2019 roll days.",
              "On these, and many other finely crafted records throughout the 1940s, Tharpe plays acoustically in a classic Delta style \u2013 each track allowing her guitar and voice to soar.",
              "Rosetta also made several traditional gospel records in tandem with her more R&B-flavoured output, a clear sign that she felt some degree of guilt over becoming so well known as a secular pop star.",
              "After all, gospel was where her heart and musical roots lay.",
              "Regardless, she maintained this musical balancing act for the remainder of her career by which time it had become perfectly acceptable to combine the two.",
              "As the \u201950s dawned, Tharpe, like so many of her trailblazing contemporaries, found her career on somewhat of a downturn as a new generation appeared and proceeded to convert her innovations into rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.",
              "Similarly, on the gospel scene, the rise of Mahalia Jackson had a similar effect in making Rosetta sound old-fashioned, almost overnight.",
              "Tharpe continued to perform in nightclubs and on tour, but the hit records had dried up.",
              "By 1957, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Little Richard, Elvis Presley and a host of others had firmly established rock \u2019n\u2019 roll as the music of choice for \u2018the kids\u2019.",
              "In the UK, however, something else was going on in parallel with the new music emanating from across the pond: a vibrant and healthy scene for traditional jazz.",
              "One of its leading lights was trombonist Chris Barber who had led a band that included Lonnie Donegan since the late \u201940s.",
              "During Barber\u2019s concerts, Donegan would play what became known as a \u2018skiffle break\u2019 where he\u2019d perform songs by the likes of Woody Guthrie and Lead Belly.",
              "These interval sets kicked off a whole movement in British music that directly led to the \u2018blues boom\u2019 of the 1960s.",
              "Aside from this, Barber took it upon himself to bring over many blues and jazz musicians from the States to perform with his band, therefore introducing UK and European audiences to heroes that had only been heard on record before.",
              "It was tours featuring the likes of Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee, Muddy Waters and, in 1957, Sister Rosetta Tharpe that had such a profound impact on young British musicians who are now household names such as Peter Green, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck.",
              "The list is endless \u2013 and the rest is history!",
              "The 1957 tour was a huge success and put Rosetta firmly back on top.",
              "She came to the UK again in 1958 and in 1964 she toured as part of the Blues & Gospel Caravan, which also featured Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee, Muddy Waters, Otis Spann, Rev Gary Davis and Mississippi John Hurt.",
              "It\u2019s from the late \u201950s through the \u201960s that we are blessed with some incredible live footage of Rosetta singing and playing.",
              "By this time, she\u2019d gone fully electric and was playing the guitar with a ferocity that foreshadows Townshend, Clapton, Beck, Page and Hendrix.",
              "Her signature licks are full of clever use of chromatics, doublestops and triplets, all delivered with such ease.",
              "Tharpe favoured a thumbpick for single lines and rhythm, freeing up her other fingers to pick out those Delta licks at which she was also a master They\u2019re fluid and melodic with a rhythmic drive that can only be described as being \u2018in the pocket\u2019.",
              "Her sound and approach was quite unlike the bulk of blues guitarists at the time and actually allow one to see the beginnings of the path the music was to take as it strived to see itself beyond the pentatonic box.",
              "Tharpe favoured a thumbpick for single lines and rhythm, freeing up her other fingers to pick out those Delta licks at which she was also a master.",
              "She played through Gibson tube amps in her early electric days, simply because they were the only ones available, and had no problem turning them up full!",
              "In fact, Rosetta is often cited as one of the first guitarists to fully embrace valve overdrive.",
              "In later footage, Tharpe is plugged into either a 15-watt Gibson Falcon or a Vox AC30.",

              "Unfortunately, some of the musicians who helped shape rock music simply faded into obscurity with little fanfare.",
              "But luckily people are once again rejoicing for Tharpe: A gospel singer with a rock-and-roll heart.",
              "She was popular from the 1930s through the 1960s, and uniquely paired rhythmic accompaniment with spiritual lyrics.",
              "On April 14, 2018, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an Early Influence \u2013 and, indeed, her influence is felt.",

              "One of the first women to play electric guitar, she slung a Gibson SG and embraced distortion long before Jimi Hendrix.",
              "At a time when few women played guitar, Tharpe (and blues legend Memphis Minnie) achieved national fame.",
              "For mid-century musicians, life on the road wasn\u2019t simple.",

              "When motels denied Tharpe accommodation, she stayed on the sleeper bus.",
              "Her white bandmates (like the Jordanaires) would bring her meals so she wouldn\u2019t have to pick up food at the back of restaurants.",
              "On stage you\u2019d never suspect her challenges.",
              "After a blistering solo, she\u2019d say, \u201cPretty good for a woman, ain\u2019t it?",
              "\u201d Tharpe knew what she was facing, but her voice, her guitar, and that spirit in the sky led her.",
              "Tharpe\u2019s early musicality began with her mother (a church singer and mandolin player).",
              "She first picked up the guitar at age four, and by six was on the road with her mother and a southern evangelist troupe.",

              "Tharpe became known as a musical prodigy, billed as a \u201cguitar-playing miracle.",
              "\u201d In the 1930s and 1940s, she recorded several gospel albums. At 23, her first single, \u201cRock Me,\u201d fused gospel and rock-and-roll, and three other gospel songs followed: \u201cMy Man and I,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s All\u201d and \u201cLonesome Road\u201d (all on Decca Records).",

              "Her accomplishments kept coming.",
              "She was one of two gospel artists who recorded V-discs for World War II troops overseas (during the recording ban by the American Federation of Musicians 1942-44).",
              "In 1944, she released the classic \u201cDown by the Riverside.",
              "\u201d Then her 1945 hit \u201cStrange Things Happening Every Day\u201d was the first gospel record cross-over hit, which rose to number two on the Billboard \u201crace records\u201d (now called the R&B chart).",
              "Her music became more accessible and her tone beefier.",
              "In a floral-print dress, she kickstarted rock-and-roll playing the same guitar hooks and boogie-blues rhythms that Chuck Berry would eventually employ.",
              "Later, she would delve deeper into Delta blues and New Orleans jazz styles of music.",
              "As far as her legacy, not much has been taught about her influence on rock/blues music.",
              "Historians and critics have long acknowledged the influence that blues musicians have had on British and American rockers.",
              "But what they left out was that a woman was alongside blues greats T-Bone Walker, John Lee Hooker, and Muddy Waters.",
              "Still, she was called the \u201coriginal soul sister\u201d and \u201cGodmother of rock and roll.",
              "\u201d Tharpe clearly predated rock music influencing everyone from Little Richard and Chuck Berry to Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash.",
              "She was one of the few artists at the time to play electric guitar aggressively as a lead instrument.",
              "Even today she stands out as a top performer for her vocal range, intricate fingerpicking and quick slides.",
              "Respected by her fellow musicians, she shared the stage with many legendary performers such as jazz great Cab Calloway at Harlem\u2019s Cotton Club.",
              "In fact, her European tour with Muddy Waters in 1963 and 1964 would prove a notable inspiration for legendary British guitarists Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, and Keith Richards.",
              "Even with the honorable mentions, she was somewhat forgotten after the 1960s.",
              "The reason why is unclear;",
              "although, in general, female musicians were not covered much in technical publications.",
              "However, some feel the gospel community were unhappy with Tharpe\u2019s secular leanings;",
              "others cite the times and young listeners seeking different forms of music.",
              "Whatever the case, it was a dying shame.",
              "According to playwright George Brant who wrote the musical \u201cMarie and Rosetta\u201d about Tharpe: \u201cChuck Berry borrowed her guitar stylings, and Little Richard said she was responsible for his career.",
              "Elvis Presley counted her as an influence, and even Jimi Hendrix once said he just wanted to play like Rosetta,\u201d Brant told the Daily Beast.",
              "\u201cJerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, and Johnny Cash have all cited her as influences \u2013 which makes it even more frustrating that she fell out of fashion.",
              "\u201d Overseas audiences never forgot her as she was still touring Europe close to the end of her life.",
              "The guitarist had several health issues but remained passionate about playing.",
              "In 1970, she suffered a stroke;",
              "and after complications from diabetes, her leg was amputated.",
              "She kept going.",
              "In 1973 the night before a scheduled recording session, she had another stroke and sadly passed away.",
              "Tharpe was laid to rest in Northwood Cemetery in Philadelphia and had a small service at a Baptist church.",
              "[One can speculate that the latter part of her career and legacy was also mismanaged.]",

              "It garnered renewed interest in Tharpe and bolstered her legacy.",
              "Finally, in 2009, a beautiful rose-colored monument adorned her grave site.",
              "The headstone was partially funded by a benefit concert at the Keswick Theatre including performances from gospel and spiritual music legends.",
              "Her epitaph reads, \u201cShe would sing until you cried and then she would sing until you danced for joy.",
              "She helped to keep the church alive and the saints rejoicing.",
              "\u201d Sister Rosetta Tharpe is a revolutionary woman in music.",
              "She pushed religious and racial boundaries and crossed musical genres \u2013 surely a soul to be reckoned with.",

              "Around 1931, Simpson instructed guitarist \"Bigfoot\" Ralph Hamilton to secretly school the younger Charles in jazz.",
              "Hamilton taught him to solo on three songs, \"Rose Room\", \"Tea for Two\", and \"Sweet Georgia Brown\".",
              "When the time was right he took Charles to one of the many after-hours jam sessions along \"Deep Deuce\" in Oklahoma City where Edward's band was performing, and after some encouragement, Edward allowed Charles to play.",
              "Edward was surprised that Charles knew the tunes, which were well received by the club.",
              "[4] Charles soon was performing locally and on the road throughout the Midwest, including states as far away as North Dakota and Minnesota.",
              "By 1936 he was playing electric guitar and had become a regional attraction.",
              "According to the record producer John Hammond, Christian jammed with many of the big-name performers traveling through Oklahoma City, including Teddy Wilson , Art Tatum, and Mary Lou Williams, the pianist for Andy Kirk and His Clouds of Joy.",
              "[5] In 1939, Christian auditioned for John Hammond, who recommended him to bandleader Benny Goodman, who was only the fourth white bandleader to feature Black musicians in his live band.",
              "Goodman had previously heard electric guitarists Leonard Ware and Floyd Smith, among others, and he unsuccessfully tried to buy Smith's contract from bandleader Andy Kirk.",
              "[4] There are multiple accounts of Christian and Goodman's first meeting.",
              "The former recalled in a 1940 article in Metronome magazine, \"I guess neither one of us liked what I played.\"",
              "Despite this, Christian claimed that Goodman invited him to a show that evening.",
              "According to another account, Hammond decided to install Christian as the band's guitarist without consulting Goodman.",
              "[6] Goodman's band, including Christian on guitar, played that night at Victor Hugo restaurant in Los Angeles.",
              "The bandleader called \"Rose Room\", a tune he assumed Christian did not know.",
              "However, Christian knew the tune and took an unprecedented twenty choruses of improvisation;",
              "Goodman hired him as a member of the band as a result.",
              "In the course of a few days, Christian went from making $2.",
              "50 a night to $150 a week.",
              "[7] Christian joined the newly formed Goodman Sextet in September 1939, which included Lionel Hampton, Fletcher Henderson, Artie Bernstein and Nick Fatool.",
              "[8] Amateur recordings made in September 1939 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, by Jerry Newhouse, a Goodman aficionado, capture the newly hired Christian while on the road with Goodman and feature Goodman's tenor sax player Jerry Jerome and then-local bassist Oscar Pettiford.",
              "Taking multiple solos, Christian shows much the same improvisational skills later captured on the Minton's and Monroe's recordings in 1941, suggesting that he had already matured as a musician.",
              "[7] The Minneapolis recordings include \"Stardust\", \"Tea for Two\", and \"I've Got Rhythm\", the latter a favorite of bop composers and jammers.",
              "[9] By February 1940 Christian dominated the jazz and swing guitar polls and was elected to the Metronome All Stars.",
              "In the spring of 1940, Goodman laid off most of his band, but he retained Christian, and in the fall of that year Goodman led a sextet with Christian, Count Basie, longtime Duke Ellington trumpeter Cootie Williams, former Artie Shaw tenor saxophonist Georgie Auld and later drummer Dave Tough.",
              "This all-star band dominated the jazz polls in 1941, including another election to the Metronome All Stars for Christian.",
              "[citation needed] His work on the Goodman sextet sides \"Soft Winds\", \"Till Tom Special\", and \"A Smo-o-o-oth One\" show his use of few well-placed melodic notes.",
              "His work on the Sextet's recordings of the ballads \"Stardust\", \"Memories of You\", \"Poor Butterfly\", \"I Surrender Dear\" and \"On the Alamo\" and his work on \"Profoundly Blue\" with the Edmond Hall Celeste Quartet (1941) show hints of what was later called cool jazz.",
              "[10][11] Although credited for very few, Christian composed many of the original tunes recorded by the Benny Goodman Sextet.",
              "[12] Christian was an important contributor to the music that became known as bop, or bebop.",
              "Some of the participants in early after-hours affairs at Minton's Playhouse, an after-hours club located in the Hotel Cecil at 210 West 118th Street in Harlem where bebop was born, credit Christian with the name bebop, citing his humming of phrases as the onomatopoetic origin of the term.",
              "[13] Examples of Christian's bebop playing can be heard in a series of recordings made at Minton's Playhouse by Jerry Newman, a student at Columbia University, on a portable disk recorder in 1941, in which Christian was accompanied by Joe Guy on trumpet, Kenny Kersey on piano and Kenny Clarke on drums.[14] Christian's use of tension and release, a technique employed by Lester Young, Count Basie and later bop musicians,[10] is also present on Newman's recording of \"Stompin' at the Savoy.\"",
              "[14] Further recordings were made in 1941, shortly before Christian's illness and death, at Clark Monroe's Uptown House, another late-night jazz haunt in Harlem, with Oran \"Hot Lips\" Page.",
              "Other recordings include the tenor sax player Don Byas.",
              "Beboppers \"Dizzy\" Gillespie and Thelonious Monk were regulars at the jam sessions, with Monk a regular in the Minton's house band.",
              "[15] Kenny Clarke claimed that \"Epistrophy\" and \"Rhythm-a-Ning\" were compositions by Christian, which Christian played with Clarke and Thelonious Monk at Minton's jam sessions.",
              "[16] The \"Rhythm-a-Ning\" line is heard on \"Down on Teddy's Hill\" and behind the introduction on \"Guy's Got to Go\" from the Newman recordings.",
              "It is also a line from Mary Lou Williams's \"Walkin' and Swingin'\".",
              "[17] Clarke further commented that Christian first showed him the chords to \"Epistrophy\" on a ukulele.",
              "[18] The Minton's and Uptown House recordings have been packaged under a number of different titles, including After Hours and The Immortal Charlie Christian.",
              "On the recordings, Christian can be heard taking multiple choruses on a single tune, playing long stretches of melodic ideas with ease.",
              "[19] Charles fathered a daughter, Billie Jean Christian (December 23, 1932 \u2013 July 19, 2004) by Margretta Lorraine Downey of Oklahoma City.",
              "[4] In the late 1930s Christian contracted tuberculosis,[20] and in early 1940 he was hospitalized for a short period in which the Goodman group was on hiatus because of Goodman's back trouble.",
              "Goodman was hospitalized in the summer of 1940 after a brief stay at Santa Catalina Island, California, where the band stayed when they were on the West Coast.",
              "[18] Christian returned home to Oklahoma City in late July 1940 and returned to New York City in September 1940.",
              "In early 1941, Christian resumed his hectic lifestyle, heading to Harlem for late-night jam sessions after finishing gigs with the Goodman Sextet and Orchestra in New York City.",
              "In June 1941 he was admitted to Seaview Hospital, a tuberculosis sanatorium on Staten Island in New York City.",
              "He was reported to be making progress, and DownBeat magazine reported in February 1942 that he and Cootie Williams were starting a band.",
              "[21] After a visit to the hospital that same month by the tap dancer and drummer Marion Joseph \"Taps\" Miller, Christian declined in health.",
              "He died of tuberculosis on March 2, 1942, at the age of 25.",
              "He was buried in an unmarked grave in Bonham, Texas.",
              "A Texas State Historical Commission Marker and headstone were placed in Gates Hill Cemetery in 1994.",
              "The location of the historical marker and headstone was disputed, and in March 2013, Fannin County, Texas recognized that the marker was in the wrong spot and that Christian is buried under the concrete slab.",
              "[22] Christian is widely regarded as one of the most influential pioneers of jazz guitar.",
              "His solos are frequently described as \"horn-like\", and in that sense, he was more influenced by horn players such as Lester Young and Herschel Evans[23] than by early arch-top guitarists like Eddie Lang and the jazz- and bluesman Lonnie Johnson, although they both had contributed to the expansion of the guitar's role from the rhythm section to a solo instrument.",
              "Christian stated he wanted his guitar to sound like a tenor saxophone.",
              "[24] The French gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt had little influence on him, but Christian was obviously familiar with some of his recordings.",
              "[25] The guitarist Mary Osborne recalled hearing him play Django's solo on \"St.",
              "Louis Blues\" note for note, but then following it with his own ideas.",

              "King, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana and Jimi Hendrix.",
              "For this reason Christian was inducted in 1990 into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",
              "[26] Christian's exposure was so great in the brief period he played with Goodman that he influenced not only guitarists but other musicians as well.",
              "The influence he had on \"Dizzy\" Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk and Don Byas can be heard on their early bop recordings \"Blue 'n' Boogie\" and \"Salt Peanuts\".",
              "Other musicians, such as the trumpeter Miles Davis, cited Christian as an early influence.",
              "Indeed, Christian's \"new\" sound influenced jazz as a whole.",
              "He reigned supreme in the jazz guitar polls up to two years after his death.",

              "There, during the early 1920s, Charlie attended elementary grades in Douglass School, which had an extensive music program.",
              "Interestingly, this coincided with the first known experiments of amplified \"electric\" guitar.",

              "A couple of years later he briefly took up the trumpet to play in the school band.",
              "Charlie's interest in the guitar was revived in 1928, and it is thought that his earliest jazz influence was instilled a year later when tenor saxophonist Lester Young arrived in Kansas City.",
              "Young's linear style had a strong effect on Christian, who remained a permanent \"addict\" to his music and was known to scat sing his solos throughout his life.",
              "Charlie Christian's first public performance as a guitarist was in 1930 at around age 14 when he sat in with the Don Redman Orchestra at Honey Murphy's Club in Oklahoma City.",
              "He took solos on \"Sweet Georgia Brown,\" \"Tea For Two,\" and \"Rose Room\"-most likely holding his acoustic guitar up to a microphone.",

              "He learned to read music and some basic music theory.",
              "Christian introduced his boyhood friend, T-Bone Walker, to Hamilton, who taught them together.",
              "Hamilton played in the typical chordal style of the period, and it is doubtful that he had any influence on either Christian's or Walker's single-note solo approach.",
              "During this time, Walker and Christian, while learning together, played shows as a duo alternating on bass and guitar.",
              "In 1934, Charlie secured his first professional music job, as a bassist, with the Alphonso Trent band.",

              "Back in Oklahoma City, he was playing piano and met Count Basie's guitarist Eddie Durham, who is credited with having recorded one of the earliest amplified guitar solos.",
              "Christian was immediately enamoured with the electric guitar and sought Durham out for some basic pointers.",
              "Durham later remarked,\" I never saw anyone learn so fast, nor have I seen anyone rise to the top so quickly.\"",
              "Soon after the meeting, Christian bought his first electric guitar, probably a Gibson ES-150, and began to assemble the components of his horn-like approach.",
              "By 1938, Charlie was touring as an electric guitarist with Alphonso Trent's Septet, and worked at The Dome in Bismarck, North Dakota.",
              "There, he was heard by jazz guitarist Mary Osborne.",
              "She recalled that it was \"the most startling thing\" she ever heard, a sound like a distorted saxophone.",
              "Osborne further recalled that Christian played Django Rheinhardt's difficult \"St.",
              "Louis Blues\" note for note, and that many of the figures he worked into his solos evolved later into Benny Goodman tunes like \"Seven Come Eleven\" and \"Gone With 'What' Wind.\"",
              "At that time, a local music store displayed the Gibson ES-150 with a sign reading \"As featured by Charlie Christian.\"",
              "Christian was by this point a regional hero.",
              "In July, 1939, jazz and blues impresario and producer John Hammond became aware of Charlie Christian.",
              "Acting on a tip from singer Mary Lou Williams, Hammond flew to Oklahoma to hear the guitarist.",
              "He then arranged a fortuitous audition in Los Angeles for swing clarinetist Benny Goodman, who was becoming interested in the electric guitar as an ensemble instrument.",
              "Goodman was initially unimpressed when he heard Christian comp unamplified rhythm guitar behind \"Tea For Two,\" and further dubbed him \"an impossible rube.\"",
              "Later Hammond sneaked Christian on the bandstand for an impromptu jam session with the Benny Goodman Quintet at the Victor Hugo Restaurant.",
              "The group played an extended jam on \"Rose Room\" during which Christian matched Goodman riff for riff and improvised over 20 choruses.",

              "Not content to rest on his laurels and enjoy the fruits of his newfound stardom and accolades, he pushed the musical envelope further.",
              "In 1940, Charlie was part of the milieu at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem, and as such foreshadowed the arrival of the bebop idiom along with early luminaries of the genre Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke.",
              "Christian went so far as to purchase an amplifier to be kept on the premises for his regular after-hours jams. Plagued with respiratory problems his entire life and unwilling to scale down his intensive lifestyle, Christian succumbed to tuberculosis and died on March 2, 1942.",
              "In a period of less than three years, Charlie Christian had emerged from total obscurity to produce a copious body of material which forever altered the course of music.",
              "Like jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong before him, Charlie Christian was the principal role model for electric guitarists worldwide.",
              "Elements of his style were copied and appropriated by countless players-solos were learned note for note, his tone quality, phrasing and articulation were emulated and appeared in mutated and varied forms in the work of his successors.",
              "His licks became the lingua franca of the first phase of electric guitar music.",
              "The diverse lineage of players who descended from Charlie Christian's musical paternity is extensive.",
              "Before Christian guitarists were predominately unamplified acoustic musicians who were relegated to strict rhythm-guitar roles in an ensemble.",
              "With Christian the electric guitar became a distinct solo voice;",
              "equivalent to a saxophone, trumpet or clarinet and capable of the same levels of expressiveness and intensity.",
              "It can be said without qualification that his pioneering efforts with the electric guitar resulted in a liberating of the instrument, in jazz specifically and in music generally.",
              "From Christian it is possible to draw a comprehensive and well-defined time line connecting the subsequent contributions of Barney Kessell, Oscar Moore, Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis, Chuck Wayne, Johnny Smith, Howard Roberts, Kenny Burrell, Jim Hall, Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, Grant Green, George Benson, Pat Martino, Joe Diorio and Pat Metheny.",
              "Furthermore, his electric guitar playing proved highly influential to important blues, pop and early rock players such as T-Bone Walker, B.",
              "B.",
              "King, Chuck Berry, and Scotty Moore.",
              "Christian's actual physical technique on the guitar was observed and described in detail by jazz guitarist Barney Kessell, an ardent admirer and one of his most notable stylistic disciples.",
              "Kessell recalled, \"He played probably 95 percent downstrokes, and held a very stiff, big triangular pick very tightly between his thumb and 1st finger.",
              "He rested his 2nd, 3rd and 4th fingers very firmly on the pickguard.",
              "He almost never used the 4th finger of his left hand.\"",
              "Charlie Christian introduced and established what we commonly call today the classic \"jazz guitar sound.\"",
              "The distinctive tone quality is produced by an arch-top hollow-body guitar, generally with f-holes, equipped with built-in electromagnetic pickups.",
              "This remains the standard into the 1990s;",
              "with contemporary players such as George Benson, Pat Metheny, Jimmy Bruno, Tuck Andress, Mark Whitfield and many others employing a similar type of instrument.",
              "Though there are sketchy accounts of Christian using Harmony, Vega and National guitars, his primary guitars were Gibson ES (Electric Spanish) models manufactured in the late 1930s and early 1940s.",
              "Charlie Christian chose the Gibson ES-150 for most of his playing.",
              "Originally announced in 1936, and shipped in quantites in 1937, the ES-150 became immortalized as the \"Charlie Christian model.\"",
              "Christian is known to have played at least three different, perhaps more, ES-150s from 1937-1942.",
              "The ES-150 was essentially a 16-inch L-50 non-cutaway acoustic with a carved spruce arch top and maple back and sides.",
              "It had a mahogany neck with a very triangular \"V shape,\" a rosewood fingerboard with dot inlays, and an ebony bridge.",
              "It was not considered to be a \"top of the line\" instrument.",
              "The ES-150 led inevitably to the development of the cutaway ES-175 which remains the most popular and versatile arch-top hollow-body electric guitar in the Gibson line.",
              "Had he lived Charlie surely would have played one when it was introduced in 1949.",
              "The ES-150 was fitted with a single bar pickup, now generically known as a \"Charlie Christian pickup,\" which was adjustable for height and a slight tilt in relation to the strings via three screws mounted on the top of the body between the pickup and the bridge.",
              "The pickup itself was close to the fingerboard and this factor no doubt contributed to the deeper bassy tone of the guitar.",
              "An output jack was located in the recessed base of the tailpiece.",
              "Christian adjusted the pickup closer to the body, away from the strings.",
              "This resulted in a warmer, more mellow \"stringy\" tone quality with less output.",
              "Christian also played the fancier Gibson ES-250 guitar.",
              "Introduced in late 1939, this was basically an L-7 type with a larger, superior-grade 17-inch body, \"open book\" inlays on the fingerboard, and a modified \"Christian pickup\" with a deeply notched blade to better balance the string response.",
              "Christian is thought to have played at least four of these models between 1939 and 1942.",
              "The ES-250 was also favored by his friend and colleague T-Bone Walker in the early 1940s.",
              "Christian plugged his ES-150s and ES-250s into Gibson EH (Electric Hawaiian) amplifiers.",
              "Of these, he used two models: the EH-150 and the EH-185.",
              "The smaller EH-150 was offered as a matched set with the ES-150 guitar for a total price of $150.",
              "It had a 10-inch speaker, 6 tubes and an output of 15 watts.",
              "The 150 had two controls: volume and a two-position tone change switch for bass or treble sound.",
              "The larger EH-185 was an early \"piggyback\" style with the electronics of the amplifier mounted in a metal case under its \"flip top\" lid.",
              "The case could be separated from the cabinet to form a two-piece amp head and speaker box unit.",
              "The 185 had a 12-inch speaker, 7 tubes and an output of 18 watts.",
              "The controls again consisted of only volume and tone, but included a variable tone change control.",
              "What did it sound like?",
              "The combination of the bar magnet pickup in the neck position, the resonant hollow body and the small underpowered amps resulted in a thick, semi-clean tone ideal for the horn-like, single-note lines that characterized the Christian solo style.",
              "Though the amount of sustain and gain produced by the equipment would be considered minimal by today's technical stanadards, the sound was quite revolutionary at the time and a radical departure from the acoustic guitar sounds heard in jazz previously.",
              "This basic tone Christian pioneered in the 1930s remains the classic \"jazz guitar sound\" to the present.",

              "His recording career, tragically brief though it was, helped raise the guitar from an accompanying to a dominant solo instrument.",
              "Reared in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Christian studied music with his father, a blind guitarist and trumpet player.",
              "During the 1930s, Christian studied with guitarist Eddie Durham, who had pioneered the electric guitar while a member of the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra and who inspired Christian to start using an amplified instrument in 1937.",
              "He soon won a reputation as a guitarist of rare talent and was heard by legendary jazz producer and talent scout John Hammond in 1939.",
              "Thinking that Christian would be an ideal addition to Benny Goodman\u2019s small jazz groups, Hammond arranged in that year for a meeting between Christian and Goodman.",
              "Goodman, however, was reluctant to hire a young, unknown musician playing an obscure electric instrument and paid scant attention to Christian\u2019s audition, not even allowing the guitarist time to plug in his amplifier.",
              "The same night, Hammond surreptitiously maneuvered Christian onstage during a Goodman performance;",
              "angered, Goodman launched into \u201cRose Room,\u201d a demanding number he thought the young guitar player would either not know or have trouble following.",
              "Christian was instead a sensation, breezing through a difficult and lengthy solo.",
              "This overwhelming tour de force compelled Goodman to hire Christian on the spot as a permanent member of his small group.",
              "Before Christian, the guitar had been considered primarily a rhythm instrument;",
              "the sound of an acoustic guitar in a big-band setting was something \u201cfelt\u201d rather than heard.",
              "Although not the first electric guitarist, Christian was the first to realize the instrument\u2019s potential for single-line solos, characterized by use of sustain and \u201cbent\u201d notes.",
              "The strong influence of tenor saxophonist Lester Young is also evident in Christian\u2019s playing.",
              "Outstanding recordings made by Christian with Goodman sextets and septets include \u201cAir Mail Special,\u201d \u201cSeven Come Eleven,\u201d \u201cAC-DC Current,\u201d and \u201cShivers,\u201d all of which were cowritten by Christian.",
              "Christian was also one of the first musicians whose style heralded the bebop movement of the late 1940s.",
              "He often jammed at Minton\u2019s Playhouse, a New York nightclub, with musicians such as Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, and Kenny Clarke.",
              "Recordings made of these informal sessions reveal a level of technique and harmonic sophistication in Christian\u2019s playing that would be unsurpassed by guitarists for decades to come.",
              "Christian, who suffered from ill health throughout his life, was hospitalized with tuberculosis in 1941 and died the following March.",
              "The roughly 100 individual recordings that feature Christian are a testament to his genius and lasting influence."

              "Rock 'n' Roll is an industry that\u2019s continually pushing musical, social and cultural boundaries, and the electric guitar is its iconic instrument.",
              "The acoustic version has been around since at least the 16th century.",
              "So when I first started working with co-curator Gary Sturm on an exhibition about the invention of the electric guitar at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History, our driving question was: Why electrify this centuries-old instrument?",
              "The simplest answer: Guitarists wanted more volume.",
              "Through the 19th century, guitars were part of a musical ensemble.",
              "As performance spaces increased in size, stringed instruments like guitars were hard to hear over other instruments, especially horns.",
              "As a result, the traditional Spanish-style acoustic guitar\u2014wooden with a flat top, a symmetrical hollow body, a sound hole in the center, and gut strings\u2014began to change in size, shape and construction.",
              "For example, in the late 1890s, Orville Gibson, founder of the Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company, designed a guitar with an arched (or curved) top that was stronger and louder than the earlier flat-top design.",
              "During the first three decades of the 20th century, with the rising popularity of Hawaiian and big band music in America, guitar makers built larger-bodied instruments, using steel instead of gut strings, and metal instead of wood for the guitar body.",
              "Around 1925, John Dopyera designed a guitar with metal resonating cones built into the top that amplified the instrument\u2019s sound.",
              "That suited twangy Hawaiian and blues music but not other genres.",
              "Then, in the 1920s, innovations in microphones and speakers, radio broadcasting, and the infant recording industry made electronic amplification for guitars possible.",
              "The volume was suddenly able to go up, way up.",
              "The electric guitar was essentially born in 1929\u2014long before the advent of Rock 'n' Roll music.",
              "The first commercially advertised electric guitar was offered that year by the Stromberg-Voisinet company of Chicago, though it was not a smash hit.",
              "The first commercially successful electric, Rickenbacker\u2019s \u201cFrying Pan\u201d guitar, didn\u2019t kick off Rock 'n' Roll yet either, but it did inspire competitors to jump into the electric guitar market.",
              "Invented in 1931, the Frying Pan had an electromagnetic pickup made out of a pair of horseshoe magnets placed end-to-end to create an oval around the guitar\u2019s strings, with a coil placed underneath the strings.",
              "The pickup, a device that converts the strings\u2019 vibrations into electrical signals that can be amplified, was bulky and unattractive.",
              "But it worked.",
              "The commercial version of the Frying Pan was a hollow cast-aluminum lap-steel guitar, and wasn\u2019t an immediate hit beyond some Hawaiian, country and blues musicians.",
              "It differs from the traditional Spanish-style guitar in that it is played horizontally, on a stand or in the player\u2019s lap, and has a sliding steel bar that can be moved along the frets for a gliding effect.",
              "Spanish-style electrics, which you could sling in front of you while standing and singing, proved to be much more versatile for many different musical genres.",
              "Gibson\u2019s 1936 ES-150 (E for Electric and S for Spanish) had a sleek bar-shaped electronic pickup that was mounted into the guitar\u2019s hollow body for a more streamlined look.",
              "The pickup earned the nickname \u201cThe Charlie Christian\u201d thanks to the jazz virtuoso who is generally credited with introducing the electric guitar solo.",
              "In 1939, Christian stepped out in front of Benny Goodman\u2019s band and performed long, complicated passages imitating the style of horn playing.",
              "He explained, \u201cGuitar players have long needed a champion, someone to explain to the world that a guitarist is something more than a robot pluckin\u2019 on a gadget to keep the rhythm going.",
              "\u201d There was a lot of tinkering with the Spanish-style electric guitar in the 1930s and 40s since the electronics in a hollow-body instrument caused distortion, overtone and feedback\u2014especially problematic for recording sessions.",
              "Historians and guitar enthusiasts enjoy debating over who really developed the first solid-body Spanish-style guitar to resolve these sound issues.",
              "The American History Museum owns a rare Slingerland Songster made in or before 1939.",
              "This model is possibly the earliest commercially marketed solid-body Spanish-style electric guitar.",
              "Regardless of the invention debate, it is clear that former radio repairman Leo Fender was the first to mass-produce and sell a successful solid-body Spanish-style electric guitar.",
              "His company\u2019s simply constructed 1950 Fender Broadcaster (renamed Telecaster as the result of a trademark dispute), with its flat body and a neck bolted onto it, was initially derided by competitors as too simple and lacking in craftsmanship.",
              "Gibson\u2019s president Ted McCarty dismissed it as a \u201cplank guitar.",
              "\u201d Yet everything about its patented, practical design was optimal for mass-producing an inexpensive solid-body guitar, earning Fender the moniker \u201cthe Henry Ford of the electric guitar.",
              "\u201d A rivalry sprang up between Fender and Gibson, creating some of the solid-body electrics most coveted by musicians and collectors, including the 1952 Gibson \u201cLes Paul\u201d model with a curved top and a combination bridge-tailpiece (the guitar was designed primarily by McCarty, with input by the famous guitarist who endorsed it), the 1954 Fender Stratocaster, and a 1958 version of the Gibson Les Paul with a new \u201chumbucking\u201d pickup that transmitted less background interference from electrical equipment.",
              "The Fender Stratocaster may be the most widely recognizable electric guitar and the one most associated with the rise of rock and roll music.",
              "It featured a distinctive double-cutaway design that allowed musicians to play higher notes by reaching higher on the fingerboard, three pickups (which allowed for a greater range of sounds since previous guitars which had two pickups at most), and a patented tremolo system that allowed players to raise or lower the pitch of the strings.",
              "In the hands of guitarists like Buddy Holly, Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt and many others, the Stratocaster became an icon of American Rock 'n' Roll that took the world by storm.",
              "The Stratocaster, the Gibson Les Paul, and other solid-body electrics were nothing if not versatile, and rock guitarists were obsessed with versatility.",
              "Guitarists could not only change the tone, volume and pitch, but they also could manipulate the sound by playing close to the amplifier, grinding the strings against things, and using special effects accessories like the wah-wah pedal.",
              "Jimi Hendrix was this instrument\u2019s master of manipulation, influencing generations of guitarists to experiment creatively with their playing techniques and equipment.",
              "In the 1970s and \u201980s the sound of the electric guitar was stretched in heavy metal music.",
              "As one of its leading practitioners, Van Halen pushed his self-built \u201cFrankenstein\u201d (based on a Stratocaster but with a mish-mash of other guitar parts) to the limit, experimenting, for instance, with \u201cdive-bombing,\u201d which uses the tremolo arm to drive the guitar\u2019s lowest note ever lower.",
              "Hendrix had done this but forced the guitar out of tune as a result.",
              "However, by the mid-1980s, inventor Floyd Rose had improved the tremolo system, allowing players like Van Halen to dive-bomb repeatedly.",
              "The guitar sound was now not only loud but also really raucous, flashy and a bit dirty\u2014just the way musicians, and their fans, wanted it.",
              "It\u2019s ironic that Leo Fender, the creator of the most influential instrument in rock music, wasn\u2019t actually a fan of Rock 'n' Roll;",
              "he preferred country and western.",
              "But it goes to show you that once something new is out there, you can\u2019t stop makers and players from reinventing it, adapting it for new purposes, taking it apart and putting it back together in new ways.",
              "The electric guitar is a prime example of unintended consequences.",
              "Initially, it just wanted to be a bit louder, but it ended up taking over and reinventing popular music and culture.",
              "Will we even recognize the sound of the electric guitar 10 or 20 years from now?",

              "\u201d Was Richards oversimplifying the electric guitar?",
              "Yes and no.",
              "Obviously, one of the most important musical innovations of the past century didn\u2019t come about by simply shoving a telephone into the sound-hole of an acoustic guitar, and that certainly isn\u2019t the case today;",
              "but, a few modern conveniences aside, the electric guitar functions more or less the same as an acoustic guitar.",
              "That said, it was these very \u201cmod cons\u201d that were responsible for cementing the electric guitar\u2019s place in music history and making it the culture and design icon it is today.",
              "Although inventors like George Breed had been experimenting with strings and electric currents to produce sound as far back as the 1890s, it wasn\u2019t until the 1920s that the first iterations of the electric guitar proper appeared.",
              "\u201cThe origins of the [electric] guitar were in country and big band, and then early forms of rock and roll,\u201d says Andy Mooney, chief executive of Fender Musical Instruments.",
              "You might also like: Acoustic guitars were used for both country and big band music, but it was particularly in the case of the latter that they posed a problem.",
              "Simply put, they weren\u2019t loud enough to be clearly heard above the other myriad instruments.",
              "In response to this problem, various individuals began looking at ways to amplify the sound of the guitar.",
              "In 1928, instrument makers Stromberg-Voisinet created the first commercially produced electric guitar, four years after Gibson fitted an electromagnetic device to violas and basses that picked up vibrations from the bridges of the instruments and converted them into electrical signals.",
              "Inventors had tried to amplify the sound from acoustic guitars, with varying success (Credit: Getty Images) The Stromberg-Voisinet guitar also made use of this device \u2013 known, as the description suggests, as a \u201cpickup\u201d \u2013 although in this case, it captured vibrations from the soundboard of the guitar, which were converted into electric signals that could be sent to an amplifier and speaker.",
              "While the Stromberg-Voisinet increased the volume of the guitar, the sound it produced still left much to be desired.",
              "A solution to the lacklustre pickup of the day arrived in the early 1930s.",
              "As with big-band players, Adolph Rickenbacker \u2013 a Hawaiian guitar player \u2013 was frustrated by the guitar\u2019s low volume compared to that of other instruments in an ensemble.",
              "At first, he co-designed in the late 1920s a \u201cresonator\u201d, an acoustic guitar that naturally amplified sound via one or more metal cones on the soundboard and sometimes even a body made entirely of metal.",
              "He then decided to take the idea further with what, on account of its shape, became known as the \u201cFrying Pan\u201d.",
              "What was special about this electric guitar (albeit a Hawaiian one) was that, unlike Gibson's creations and the Stromberg-Voisinet, its pickups captured vibrations from the strings themselves.",
              "Unlike acoustic guitars, electric examples don't even have to be made from wood (Credit: Getty Images) The innovation was a success amongst Hawaiian guitar players, but acoustic players weren\u2019t quick to adopt the idea of an electric guitar initially.",
              "Attitudes shifted in the late 1930s and, soon enough, Les Paul \u2014 another notable guitarist \u2014 got it in his head to tinker around with pickups, as well as see how he could improve the sound quality of the instrument overall.",
              "The problem with acoustic guitars fitted with pickups (the sort jazz musicians played) was that they produced large amounts of feedback and unwanted noise.",
              "As such, Paul devised the first solid-body electric guitar \u2013 the \u201cLog\u201d \u2013 in 1939.",
              "This however, was laughed at by Gibson, the premier manufacturer at the time, and the humble Log never went into production.",
              "Things changed in 1950, however, when Leo Fender, a self-taught electronics enthusiast, created the Esquire, the first mass-produced solid-body guitar.",
              "Taking note of Fender\u2019s successes, Gibson ate humble pie, introducing its own solid-body model, the Les Paul.",
              "By 1954, with the advent of Fender\u2019s three-pickup, solid-body Stratocaster, the three most iconic electric guitars of all time were all released.",
              "Music would never be the same again.",
              "Whether hollow or solid-bodied, it\u2019s through pickups that electric guitars create their sound.",
              "That\u2019s why electric guitars don\u2019t need to be as big as acoustic ones, or even have sound holes, for that matter.",
              "They also don\u2019t need to be made of wood \u2013 almost every possible material has been used in their construction, from plastic to aluminium \u2013 although wood is typically used for its resonant qualities.",
              "Essentially, when a string, typically made from nickel and steel (and much thinner in diameter than an acoustic one), is struck, the magnetised pickups underneath catch its vibrations through the electromagnetic field they create (and that partially magnetises the string) and send signals to a connected amplifier, which often contains a built-in speaker.",
              "A pickup typically contains a number of magnetic pole pieces (although some consist of a singular magnet) wrapped around many times with fine wire.",
              "One type of pickup, popularised by Fender and now largely associated with it, consists of a single coil of wire.",
              "Known for their bright, snappy, and sharp tones, they\u2019re ideal for genres like country and funk.",
              "The only issue with these is that, along with the string vibrations, they also produce feedback in the form of an unpleasant hum when not strummed, especially in the presence of electrical equipment.",
              "The use of amplifying technology means an eletric guitar no longer needs a sound hole to create resonance (Credit: Getty Images) To combat this, Gibson developed the \u201chumbucker\u201d \u2013 double-coiled pickups wired in reverse in terms of coil and magnetic direction \u2013 that not only significantly reduced feedback, but also resulted in a fuller, richer tone.",
              "While a number of other kinds exist \u2014 such as the P90, a warmer-sounding single-coil produced by Gibson, and the mini humbucker \u2014 the single coil and humbucker still continue to be the most prevalent.",
              "While electric guitars can produce an almost infinite array of sounds, they\u2019ve become \u2013 at least in popular culture \u2013 most associated with a dirty, distorted one.",
              "Think of the growling introduction to T Rex\u2019s Twentieth-Century Boy or The Kinks\u2019 menacing riff to You Really Got Me.",
              "Guitarists nowadays strive to emulate these sounds, and \u201cdistortion\u201d is a standard feature on most amplifiers.",
              "This, however, wasn\u2019t always the case.",
              "As with hi-fi amplifiers, the first guitar amplifiers, produced in the early 1930s, strove to simply increase the sonic output of the instrument.",
              "Like the early pickups, though, they weren\u2019t loud enough for onstage use.",
              "With the advent of Fender\u2019s 18-watt Super Amp in the late 1940s, some guitarists were pleased to find that, when they turned the volume all the way up, the sound became crunchy and distorted.",
              "In other words, the signals, as a result of an unintended technical shortcoming, were too much for the overdriven amplifier to handle.",
              "What happened when amplifiers were pushed into overdrive was that the signals would become \u201cclipped\u201d: that is, their highs and lows would disappear.",
              "This resulted in a compressed tone laden with harmonics.",
              "\u201cAll [musicians] would do was turn the amplifier up as loud as they could,\u201d says Roger Mayer, a pioneer in creating distorted tones in the 1960s.",
              "\u201cThe amplified sound produced quite a musical type of distortion.",
              "\u201d Today, effects pedals such as those that Mayer still makes can produce such overdriven tones at lower volumes, but, as he points out, only certain types of distortion actually sound good.",

              "Other companies, like Electro-Harmonix, Boss, Maxon, Ibanez, Strymon and TC Electronic, along with boutique brands like Keeley, Empress, Wampler, JHS, Catalinbread and Chase Bliss Audio replied with superb analog delay offerings as well, and with many of them having tap tempo integration.",
              "Even more fascinating was the rise of TC Electronic in the stompbox market, starting with their groundbreaking TonePrint technology, where the user was able to beam from their smartphone an artist preset sound into their pedal.",
              "Soon after, TC released the Ditto Looper, a one-knob operation mini-looping pedal that surpassed almost every type of pedal in sales, and started a looping pedal revolution that still continues to this day, with companies like Electro-Harmonix, Boss, and MXR having their own looper with a unique stamp.",
              "You could say the past few years have seen the overwhelming surge of mini-pedals in the market.",
              "Just about every effects manufacturer has a mini-pedal version of their most popular stompbox in a mini-chassis form, and it seems this trend will not go away any time soon.",
              "Another company that has had a meteoric rise has been Akron, Ohio\u2019s EarthQuaker Devices.",
              "This boutique effects brand still builds pedals by hand and specializes in fuzz, delays, filters and cavernous reverbs (ya know, shoegazer-approved sounds), where all or some have been combined into their very hip pedals emblazoned with eye-catching graphic artwork.",
              "Strymon has swiftly become another successful company that push the limit of multi-effect stompboxes, with studio-quality sound that is jaw-droppingly authentic.",
              "Electro-Harmonix never falter, and remain popular by continually releasing effects that resonate with guitarists.",
              "In fact, their most revolutionary pedals have been their keyboard and synthesizer ones, with the B9, C9, Key9, Mel9 and Synth9 stompboxes allowing guitarists to ape almost every legendary keyboard sound convincingly without any external pickups or hardware.",
              "Boss, on the other hand, went back to their roots by introducing their Waza Craft pedals, a sublime revision of their most well-known and renowned pedals, imbued with the original sounds and refined new ones.",
              "Also, fascinating were pedals that mimicked artist tones, like Wampler\u2019s Paisley Drive, or YouTube influencer collaborations like the Keeley D&M Drive, and amp-in-a-box pedals that sounded as good as the amps they were based on from companies like Bogner, EHX, Tech 21, Friedman, Boss and Supro.",
              "One can not overlook Eventide\u2019s splash into the stompbox arena.",
              "Long-known as a giant in the recording and broadcast industry, primarily for their harmonizers and studio gear, Eventide rolled out the H9 - essentially combining Eventide\u2019s greatest effects hits like pitch-shifting, chorus, delays, reverbs, modulations and so much more into one compact stompbox.",
              "Even more groundbreaking was the ability to transmit and control your presets and settings via Bluetooth from your smartphone or tablet app into the H9.",
              "Another all-in-one game-changer has been Tech 21\u2019s successful Fly Rig series of floorboards, integrating their SansAmp analog circuitry with popular effects.",
              "Guitarists no longer had to bring massive rigs on fly dates and could simply recreate their guitar sound by plugging directly into a PA system, mixer, or amplifier to get their tone in a sliver-thin floorboard the size of cigarette carton.",
              "Line 6, not to be overlooked, was able to integrate their acclaimed Helix technology in a compact line of floorboards for amp modeling and effects.",
              "Worth mentioning is Metallica\u2019s Kirk Hammett throwing his hat into the pedal ring with his own brand of fuzzes and distortions with his own company, KHDK Electronics, and (FWIW) they were pretty cool.",
              "One last pedal that can\u2019t go unnoticed and deserves a great deal of credit has been Singular Sound\u2019s BeatBuddy.",
              "Essentially, it\u2019s a drum machine in a stompbox that was incredibly intuitive to use on the fly, and came loaded with more than 200 musical styles and 10 different drum sets.",
              "We have sort of a love/hate relationship with innovations in guitar hardware and accessories.",
              "Although it seems like most of these necessities were perfected long ago, on rare occasions a handful of truly genius ideas emerge that completely blow our minds.",
              "However, for every great invention that comes along, there are probably a thousand ill-conceived, half-baked products developed by genuinely insane inventors who show up en masse at every NAMM Show and hunt us down to make pitches, staring at us with the crazed, glazed-over gaze of a rabid raccoon.",
              "While we thought it was highly probable that no one was ever going to invent a better pick, capo or strap than what we already have, it seems companies like Dunlop and D\u2019Addario proved us wrong.",
              "Dunlop introduced Ultex picks, which redefined speed and clarity in a new material for picks.",
              "And when it came to accessories, the D\u2019Addario/Planet Waves care and maintenance tools made everything from changing your strings to using a capo a far more efficient and elegant affair.",
              "Over the last decade we discovered some very useful hardware and accessory innovations, particularly ones that may have finally solved guitarists\u2019 battles with staying in tune.",
              "One of the most practical hardware innovations we\u2019ve seen in ages is the EverTune bridge, which boasts an ingenious design that maintains tension to consistently keep strings in tune.",
              "The CSL Sophia tremolo system\u2019s innovative stabilization solves many nagging issues of previous floating tremolo designs, allowing players to bend strings without other strings going out of pitch, play double stops and perform extreme pitch rises and drops without going out of tune (and without a locking nut).",
              "Other companies like FU-Tone concentrated on enhanced hardware upgrades for tremolos - specifically Floyd Rose - with titanium and stainless locks, and by introducing brass, titanium and copper tremolo blocks to increase sustain and tone.",
              "Tuner technology also improved significantly.",
              "Snark was among the first to introduce a headstock-mounted tuner, and this style of tuner quickly surpassed pedal tuners in popularity.",
              "The TC Electronic Polytune impressed us with its ability to instantly indicate which strings were in and out of tune.",
              "One of the most exciting pickup innovations of the last decade was Fishman\u2019s Fluence with its revolutionary Fluence Core design and ability to provide multiple, truly distinct tones.",
              "We also enjoyed several innovations that were simple but incredibly effective, like Vibramate\u2019s kits that enable noninvasive installation of Bigsby vibratos on various guitars and Music Nomad\u2019s Humitar, which humidifies acoustic guitars in a simple and safe manner.",
              "Before you begin to question or dismiss what could possibly be innovative here, you should know never has there been more varieties of string manufacturers, and almost every one of the most popular tried-and-true brands launched new technology, materials and improvements to their string lines.",
              "Just when you thought XLs were doing just fine, D\u2019Addario came out strong with their NYXL strings, which allowed you to stretch toward the sky while staying in tune with a brighter tone.",
              "In addition, they introduced their XT Nickel line, which has enhanced break resistance and longer life with their extended lifespan treatment.",
              "They also flipped the traditional gauge norm by introducing D\u2019Addario Balanced Tension XL strings, with each string in the set having a slightly heavier or lighter gauge in order to balance between proper resistance and feel for more efficiency.",
              "Ernie Ball never sits tight;",
              "in addition to releasing a slew of custom-gauged Slinkys, the company introduced their new line of Paradigm strings for electric and acoustic.",
              "Paradigm claim to be nearly unbreakable with superior durability and the much-loved Slinky-like tone.",
              "EB also played with heavy metal - We're talking alloys here!",
              "- with their Cobalt and M-Steel strings offering more dynamics and low end response.",
              "And just in case you\u2019re wondering, yes, both D\u2019Addario and Ernie Ball introduced a plethora of coated strings in their lines.",
              "Coated strings have always been favored for acoustics with their bright tone and corrosion-free durability, but without a doubt, coated electric guitar strings have risen in popularity.",
              "Companies like Cleartone and Elixir have been flying the coated flag for a while now, but Elixir has doubled down on electric players, with the introduction of three different sets that address the amount of coating and tone with their Optiweb, Nanoweb and Polyweb coatings.",
              "DR Strings also make a boatload of strings, but had some fun by introducing its Neon multi-color strings that actually glowed in the dark.",
              "Dunlop also went full speed ahead with their string line and made some impressive strings - most notably their Heavy Core strings, zeroing in on players who laid low with drop tunings, and optimized for extended range and baritone guitars.",
              "Martin Guitars invested in rebranding and reimagining their whole line of superb acoustic strings.",
              "String companies have become more tuned in to not only address the feel, sound and durability of their strings, but also for the kind of music the strings will be used for.",
              "Technology advanced at such a rapid pace over the last decade that we could fill this entire story - or this entire issue of Guitar World - with an overview of all the breakthroughs.",
              "Fortunately, one of the biggest recent trends in recording technology is the development of numerous products designed specifically for guitarists, which has helped players (and guitar journalists) narrow down their options to gear that fits their needs and preferences.",
              "Although hundreds of USB audio interfaces are available, products like IK Multimedia\u2019s Axe and the Apogee GiO helped eliminate some of the confusion over which interface to choose, thanks to their guitar-friendly designs and features.",
              "The Orange OMEC Teleport even provided a helpful link between traditional analog guitar gear and digital computer/mobile devices in a compact pedal format.",
              "The other welcome trend was that several companies previously known for high-end pro audio (i.",
              "e. expensive) gear started offering highly affordable products that maintained their standards of excellence, like the Focusrite Scarlett and Apogee Duet.",
              "Universal Audio products have consistently provided stellar bang-for-the-buck for home recording enthusiasts and professionals alike.",
              "Their Apollo Twin USB and Thunderbolt audio interfaces proved to be excellent choices for guitarists thanks to UA\u2019s extensive selection of guitar-oriented plug-ins, which includes amp models like Diezel, Engl, Friedman, Suhr, various Marshalls and even the timeless tweed Fender Deluxe plus studio favorites like Neve and SSL preamps and EQs and the 1176 compressor.",
              "In addition, UA\u2019s OX combined a reactive load box and a guitar recording system to get studio quality sound from tube amplifiers at any volume, making it one of the finest guitar attenuators combined with UA\u2019s built-in emulations for recording.",
              "For more traditional analog enthusiasts, several highly useful products made it easier to adapt favorite items of gear to the digital world.",
              "Radial Engineering always impress us with products that solve specific, specialized challenges in the studio.",
              "Their EXTC 500 particularly stood out for providing an easy way to use guitar pedals with line level studio gear for mixing and reamping applications.",
              "Speaker cabinet simulator/load boxes like the Two Notes Torpedo Live and Mesa Cab Clone were a revelation for guitarists who want to direct record the true tone of their favorite tube amps without the hassles of setting up mics and dealing with excess volume levels.",
              "The first iPhone and Android smart phones may have made their debut in 2008, but the real game-changer for musicians was the introduction of tablet devices like the iPad a few years later in 2010.",
              "What truly made these powerful portable devices so essential was the avalanche of awesome apps that allowed us to carry a versatile performance rig, virtual recording studio and much more in our pockets or gig bags.",
              "Some of our favorite apps from the last decade were virtual amp and effect packages like Agile Partners\u2019 Amp-Kit, IK Multimedia\u2019s various AmpliTube apps (including extremely cool in-app purchases like their Brian May and Dimebag Darrell collections) and Positive Grid\u2019s Bias Amp and Bias FX, with an honorable mention to Line 6\u2019s Mobile Pod, which unfortunately hasn\u2019t been updated in a while.",
              "We also loved apps like Eventide\u2019s H9 Control that made it easier to program and operate \u201creal world\u201d hardware.",

              "\u201d Was Richards oversimplifying the electric guitar?",
              "Yes and no.",
              "Obviously, one of the most important musical innovations of the past century didn\u2019t come about by simply shoving a telephone into the sound-hole of an acoustic guitar, and that certainly isn\u2019t the case today;",
              "but, a few modern conveniences aside, the electric guitar functions more or less the same as an acoustic guitar.",
              "That said, it was these very \u201cmod cons\u201d that were responsible for cementing the electric guitar\u2019s place in music history and making it the culture and design icon it is today.",
              "Although inventors like George Breed had been experimenting with strings and electric currents to produce sound as far back as the 1890s, it wasn\u2019t until the 1920s that the first iterations of the electric guitar proper appeared.",
              "\u201cThe origins of the [electric] guitar were in country and big band, and then early forms of rock and roll,\u201d says Andy Mooney, chief executive of Fender Musical Instruments.",
              "You might also like: Acoustic guitars were used for both country and big band music, but it was particularly in the case of the latter that they posed a problem.",
              "Simply put, they weren\u2019t loud enough to be clearly heard above the other myriad instruments.",
              "In response to this problem, various individuals began looking at ways to amplify the sound of the guitar.",
              "In 1928, instrument makers Stromberg-Voisinet created the first commercially produced electric guitar, four years after Gibson fitted an electromagnetic device to violas and basses that picked up vibrations from the bridges of the instruments and converted them into electrical signals.",
              "Inventors had tried to amplify the sound from acoustic guitars, with varying success (Credit: Getty Images) The Stromberg-Voisinet guitar also made use of this device \u2013 known, as the description suggests, as a \u201cpickup\u201d \u2013 although in this case, it captured vibrations from the soundboard of the guitar, which were converted into electric signals that could be sent to an amplifier and speaker.",
              "While the Stromberg-Voisinet increased the volume of the guitar, the sound it produced still left much to be desired.",
              "A solution to the lacklustre pickup of the day arrived in the early 1930s.",
              "As with big-band players, Adolph Rickenbacker \u2013 a Hawaiian guitar player \u2013 was frustrated by the guitar\u2019s low volume compared to that of other instruments in an ensemble.",
              "At first, he co-designed in the late 1920s a \u201cresonator\u201d, an acoustic guitar that naturally amplified sound via one or more metal cones on the soundboard and sometimes even a body made entirely of metal.",
              "He then decided to take the idea further with what, on account of its shape, became known as the \u201cFrying Pan\u201d.",
              "What was special about this electric guitar (albeit a Hawaiian one) was that, unlike Gibson's creations and the Stromberg-Voisinet, its pickups captured vibrations from the strings themselves.",
              "Unlike acoustic guitars, electric examples don't even have to be made from wood (Credit: Getty Images) The innovation was a success amongst Hawaiian guitar players, but acoustic players weren\u2019t quick to adopt the idea of an electric guitar initially.",
              "Attitudes shifted in the late 1930s and, soon enough, Les Paul \u2014 another notable guitarist \u2014 got it in his head to tinker around with pickups, as well as see how he could improve the sound quality of the instrument overall.",
              "The problem with acoustic guitars fitted with pickups (the sort jazz musicians played) was that they produced large amounts of feedback and unwanted noise.",
              "As such, Paul devised the first solid-body electric guitar \u2013 the \u201cLog\u201d \u2013 in 1939.",
              "This however, was laughed at by Gibson, the premier manufacturer at the time, and the humble Log never went into production.",
              "Things changed in 1950, however, when Leo Fender, a self-taught electronics enthusiast, created the Esquire, the first mass-produced solid-body guitar.",
              "Taking note of Fender\u2019s successes, Gibson ate humble pie, introducing its own solid-body model, the Les Paul.",
              "By 1954, with the advent of Fender\u2019s three-pickup, solid-body Stratocaster, the three most iconic electric guitars of all time were all released.",
              "Music would never be the same again.",
              "Whether hollow or solid-bodied, it\u2019s through pickups that electric guitars create their sound.",
              "That\u2019s why electric guitars don\u2019t need to be as big as acoustic ones, or even have sound holes, for that matter.",
              "They also don\u2019t need to be made of wood \u2013 almost every possible material has been used in their construction, from plastic to aluminium \u2013 although wood is typically used for its resonant qualities.",
              "Essentially, when a string, typically made from nickel and steel (and much thinner in diameter than an acoustic one), is struck, the magnetised pickups underneath catch its vibrations through the electromagnetic field they create (and that partially magnetises the string) and send signals to a connected amplifier, which often contains a built-in speaker.",
              "A pickup typically contains a number of magnetic pole pieces (although some consist of a singular magnet) wrapped around many times with fine wire.",
              "One type of pickup, popularised by Fender and now largely associated with it, consists of a single coil of wire.",
              "Known for their bright, snappy, and sharp tones, they\u2019re ideal for genres like country and funk.",
              "The only issue with these is that, along with the string vibrations, they also produce feedback in the form of an unpleasant hum when not strummed, especially in the presence of electrical equipment.",
              "The use of amplifying technology means an eletric guitar no longer needs a sound hole to create resonance (Credit: Getty Images) To combat this, Gibson developed the \u201chumbucker\u201d \u2013 double-coiled pickups wired in reverse in terms of coil and magnetic direction \u2013 that not only significantly reduced feedback, but also resulted in a fuller, richer tone.",
              "While a number of other kinds exist \u2014 such as the P90, a warmer-sounding single-coil produced by Gibson, and the mini humbucker \u2014 the single coil and humbucker still continue to be the most prevalent.",
              "While electric guitars can produce an almost infinite array of sounds, they\u2019ve become \u2013 at least in popular culture \u2013 most associated with a dirty, distorted one.",
              "Think of the growling introduction to T Rex\u2019s Twentieth-Century Boy or The Kinks\u2019 menacing riff to You Really Got Me.",
              "Guitarists nowadays strive to emulate these sounds, and \u201cdistortion\u201d is a standard feature on most amplifiers.",
              "This, however, wasn\u2019t always the case.",
              "As with hi-fi amplifiers, the first guitar amplifiers, produced in the early 1930s, strove to simply increase the sonic output of the instrument.",
              "Like the early pickups, though, they weren\u2019t loud enough for onstage use.",
              "With the advent of Fender\u2019s 18-watt Super Amp in the late 1940s, some guitarists were pleased to find that, when they turned the volume all the way up, the sound became crunchy and distorted.",
              "In other words, the signals, as a result of an unintended technical shortcoming, were too much for the overdriven amplifier to handle.",
              "What happened when amplifiers were pushed into overdrive was that the signals would become \u201cclipped\u201d: that is, their highs and lows would disappear.",
              "This resulted in a compressed tone laden with harmonics.",
              "\u201cAll [musicians] would do was turn the amplifier up as loud as they could,\u201d says Roger Mayer, a pioneer in creating distorted tones in the 1960s.",
              "\u201cThe amplified sound produced quite a musical type of distortion.",
              "\u201d Today, effects pedals such as those that Mayer still makes can produce such overdriven tones at lower volumes, but, as he points out, only certain types of distortion actually sound good.",
              "\u201cThe golden rule, basically is, if you modify a wave form in such a way that the harmonics and the end result do not obey natural laws that occur in nature, it\u2019s not going to sound very good .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "A series of odd harmonics is not as musical as the even harmonics are.",
              "It sounds discordant.",

              "Five Ways in Which the Electric Guitar Changed the World",
              "If there is one single musical instrument that can be conceivably argued as truly world-changing, it has to be the electric guitar, to which just about every artist performing today owes a huge debt.",
              "Its rebellious sound and the iconic performers that favored it would provide the soundtrack of the 1960s and would usher in a whole new world of musical expression never deemed possible previously.",
              "Since the electric guitar is such an important innovation in modern human history, we thought we\u2019d show you just how the amplified axe has been influential for both music and wider society over the near-century since it was first dreamt up.",
              "Killed the Big Band Interestingly, the impetus for the electric guitar\u2019s very creation was the first victim of the electric guitar\u2019s rise to prominence in popular music.",
              "In the 1920s and \u201930s, the \u201cbig band\u201d was all the rage.",
              "The problem was that the acoustic guitars of the day had literally zero chance of competing with the vast horn sections leading the melody.",
              "Designers of the day wanted to make the guitar a prominent lead instrument of its own, but this would prove to be impossible without some form of technological breakthrough.",
              "The invention of the electric pickup in 1924 and a more refined version in 1931 allowed the guitar to stand out in the crowd, and a lot of people started taking notice!",
              "Suddenly, the \u201cbig band\u201d was much less popular, with people enjoying rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, jazz, and blues live combos in its place.",
              "Transformed How Music Was Enjoyed After the electric guitar was invented, suddenly a range of possibilities opened up.",
              "Bands didn\u2019t need 20 members anymore.",
              "Four would do instead.",
              "Stages could be smaller and music could be enjoyed outside of the large concert halls needed to house big bands.",
              "Nowadays, three or four-piece bands can perform to fans in just about any place with power.",
              "Basements, backstreet bars, house parties, and even takeaways are all in the cards, making music performance much more accessible for both attendees and performers alike.",
              "Electric guitar genres of music such as blues and jazz also had a huge impact on the gambling industry.",
              "Additionally, the recording technology in the early days of the electric guitar\u2019s life favored loud noise rather than the softer ones synonymous with acoustic guitars.",
              "Electric guitars lent themselves much more to the recording process.",
              "After the first electric guitars were distributed widely, new musical expressions could be enjoyed from people\u2019s homes too!",
              "New Genres of Music With the new instrument came even more possibilities for experimentation.",
              "Traditional acoustic blues was amplified and fed into the creation of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.",
              "In turn, artists such as Chuck Berry and other legends influenced the likes of the Beatles, giving birth to pop music as we know it today, and Led Zeppelin, paving the way for harder rock sounds.",
              "Bands like Black Sabbath took their cues from Led Zep\u2019s harder tracks and gave birth to heavy metal.",
              "Later, rebellious working-class youths would reject the then-dominant sounds in alternative music for a much simpler way of writing songs.",
              "The anti-establishment wave of punk rock would also not have been at all possible without the electric guitar.",
              "Think about the range of guitar-driven genres that have evolved since the invention of the electric guitar.",
              "In fact, think about any popular genre of music from the 1950s until EDM first reared its ugly head in the 1990s, and you\u2019re sure to find an electric guitar.",
              "Disparate styles have all embraced the instrument including funk, jazz, soul, R&B, all kinds of metal (death, black, power, hair, etc.)",
              ", punk rock and its many subgenres (hardcore, grindcore, ska, and everything in between), and reggae all owe a lot to the iconic instrument.",
              "Expanded the Guitar Player\u2019s Arsenal Apart from the practicalities of the electric guitar (it was louder and more versatile than the acoustic), the popularity of the instrument owes a lot to the creativity of its early players.",
              "The electric guitar made so many different techniques possible, which made the music produced in the 1950s and \u201960s truly inspirational.",
              "People couldn\u2019t believe it when Hendrix played with his teeth and made use of feedback to produce an LSD-laden sound of pure psychedelia!",
              "Such versatility made the guitar even more alluring and allowed those playing it to dazzle audiences with an array of flashy tricks, mind-bending sounds, and stage shows that would have barely been possible with the cumbersome and quiet acoustic.",
              "Although not really world-changing in itself, the breadth of expression made possible by new models, new features (like a tremolo arm), and breakthroughs in digital effects, meant the list of electric guitars was constantly reinventing itself and staying right at the forefront of popular culture.",
              "Soundtrack of a Revolution!",
              "By making music performance more accessible and allowing for more rebellious music, the electric guitar provided much of the soundtrack for the societal revolution of the 1960s.",
              "Artists like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and others all sang about radically new concepts not often heard on the radio at the time.",
              "Free love and substance use were the order of the day and parents hated those even more than they hated the rambunctious dress sense and haircuts of the rebellious teen idols at the time.",
              "Of course, this only made the early rock bands more alluring.",
              "These bands gave young people a voice that could be broadcast far and wide for the first time, well, ever.",
              "They used it to question the status quo, advocate for civil rights, equality, and greater freedom of expression.",
              "Of course, these ideas found a lot of traction at the time thanks to the electric guitar\u2019s ability to cut above other noise.",
              "Modern day feminism, civil rights, and the anti-war movement would look very different had it not been for the electric guitar.",

              "An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be heard at typical performance volumes, unlike a standard acoustic guitar.",
              "It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers.",
              "The sound is sometimes shaped or electronically altered to achieve different timbres or tonal qualities from that of an acoustic guitar via amplifier settings or knobs on the guitar.",
              "Often, this is done through the use of effects such as reverb, distortion and \"overdrive\";",
              "the latter is considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and jazz, rock and heavy- metal guitar playing.",
              "Designs also exist combining attributes of the electric and acoustic guitars: the semi-acoustic and acoustic-electric guitars.",
              "Invented in 1932, the electric guitar was adopted by jazz guitar players, who wanted to play single-note guitar solos in large big band ensembles.",
              "Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include Les Paul, Eddie Durham, George Barnes, Lonnie Johnson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, T-Bone Walker, and Charlie Christian.",
              "During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in popular music.",
              "[1] It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles in genres ranging from pop and rock to folk to country music, blues and jazz.",
              "It served as a major component in the development of electric blues, rock and roll, rock music, heavy metal music and many other genres of music.",
              "Electric guitar design and construction varies greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups.",
              "Guitars may have a fixed bridge or a spring-loaded hinged bridge, which lets players \"bend\" the pitch of notes or chords up or down, or perform vibrato effects.",
              "The sound of an electric guitar can be modified by new playing techniques such as string bending, tapping, and hammering-on, using audio feedback, or slide guitar playing.",
              "There are several types of electric guitar.",
              "Early forms were hollow-body semi-acoustic guitars, while solid body guitars developed later.",
              "String configurations include the six-string guitar (the most common type), which is usually tuned E, A, D, G, B, E, from lowest to highest strings;",
              "the seven-string guitar, which typically adds a low B string below the low E;",
              "the eight-string guitar, which typically adds a low E or F# string below the low B;",
              "and the twelve-string guitar, which has six two-string courses similar to a mandolin.",
              "In rock, the electric guitar is often used in two roles: as a rhythm guitar, which plays the chord sequences or progressions, and riffs, and sets the beat (as part of a rhythm section);",
              "and as a lead guitar, which provides instrumental melody lines, melodic instrumental fill passages, and solos.",
              "In a small group, such as a power trio, one guitarist may switch between both roles;",
              "in larger groups there is often a rhythm guitarist and a lead guitarist.",
              "Many experiments with electrically amplifying the vibrations of a string instrument were made dating back to the early part of the 20th century.",
              "Patents from the 1910s show telephone transmitters were adapted and placed inside violins and banjos to amplify the sound.",
              "Hobbyists in the 1920s used carbon button microphones attached to the bridge;",
              "however, these detected vibrations from the bridge on top of the instrument, resulting in a weak signal.",
              "[2] Electric guitars were originally designed by acoustic guitar makers and instrument manufacturers.",
              "The demand for amplified guitars began during the big band era;",
              "as orchestras increased in size, guitar players soon realized the necessity in guitar amplification and electrification.",
              "[3] The first electric guitars used in jazz were hollow archtop acoustic guitar bodies with electromagnetic transducers.",
              "The first electrically amplified stringed instrument to be marketed commercially was a cast aluminium lap steel guitar nicknamed the \"Frying Pan\" designed in 1931 by George Beauchamp, the general manager of the National Stringed Instrument Corporation, with Paul Barth, who was vice president.",
              "[4] George Beauchamp, along with Adolph Rickenbacker, invented the electromagnetic pickups.",
              "[5] Coils that were wrapped around a magnet would create an electromagnetic field that converted the vibrations of the guitar strings into electrical signals, which could then be amplified.",
              "Commercial production began in late summer of 1932 by the Ro-Pat-In Corporation (Electro-Patent-Instrument Company), in Los Angeles,[6][7] a partnership of Beauchamp, Adolph Rickenbacker (originally Rickenbacher), and Paul Barth.",
              "[8] In 1934, the company was renamed the Rickenbacker Electro Stringed Instrument Company.",

              "[14][9][10][11][12] The Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts was revolutionary for its time, providing players a full 25-inch scale, with easy access to 17 frets free of the body.",
              "[15] Unlike other lap-steel electrified instruments produced during the time, the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts was designed to play while standing upright with the guitar on a strap, as with acoustic guitars.",
              "[15] The Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts was also the first instrument to feature a hand-operated vibrato as a standard arrangement,[15] a device called the \"Vibrola\", invented by Doc Kauffman.",
              "[15] [16] It is estimated that fewer than 50 Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts were constructed between 1933 and 1937;",

              "[2] Unlike acoustic guitars, solid-body electric guitars have no vibrating soundboard to amplify string vibration.",
              "Instead, solid-body instruments depend on electric pickups, and an amplifier (\"amp\") and speaker.",
              "The solid body ensures that the amplified sound reproduces the string vibration alone, thus avoiding the wolf tones and unwanted feedback[19] associated with amplified acoustic guitars.",
              "These guitars are generally made of hardwood covered with a hard polymer finish, often polyester or lacquer.",
              "In large production facilities, the wood is stored for three to six months in a wood-drying kiln before being cut to shape.",
              "Premium custom-built guitars are frequently made with much older, hand-selected wood.",
              "One of the first solid-body guitars was invented by Les Paul.",
              "Gibson did not present their Gibson Les Paul guitar prototypes to the public, as they did not believe the solid-body style would catch on.",
              "Another early solid-body Spanish style guitar, resembling what would become Gibson's Les Paul guitar a decade later, was developed in 1941 by O.",

              "[21] In 1946, Merle Travis commissioned steel guitar builder Paul Bigsby to build him a solid-body Spanish-style electric.",
              "[22] Bigsby delivered the guitar in 1948.",
              "The first mass-produced solid-body guitar was Fender Esquire and Fender Broadcaster (later to become the Fender Telecaster), first made in 1950, five years after Les Paul made his prototype.",
              "The Gibson Les Paul appeared soon after to compete with the Broadcaster.",
              "[23] Another notable solid-body design is the Fender Stratocaster, which was introduced in 1954 and became extremely popular among musicians in the 1960s and 1970s for its wide tonal capabilities and more comfortable ergonomics than other models.",
              "Different styles of guitar have different pick-up styles, the main being 2 or 3 \"single-coil\" pick-ups or a double humbucker, with the Stratocaster being a triple single-coil guitar.",
              "The history of electric guitars has been summarized by Guitar World magazine, and the earliest electric guitar on their top 10 list is the Ro-Pat-In Electro A-25 \"Frying Pan\" (1932) described as \"The first-fully functioning solid-body electric guitar to be manufactured and sold\".",

              "[24] Electric guitar designs eventually became culturally important and visually iconic, with various model companies selling miniature model versions of particularly famous electric guitars, for example, the Gibson SG used by Angus Young from the group AC/DC.",
              "Some otherwise solid-bodied guitars, such as the Gibson Les Paul Supreme, the PRS Singlecut, and the Fender Telecaster Thinline, are built with hollow chambers in the body.",

              "In the case of Gibson and PRS, these are called chambered bodies.",
              "The motivation for this may be to reduce weight, to achieve a semi-acoustic tone (see below) or both.",
              "[28][29][30] Semi-acoustic guitars have a hollow body similar to an acoustic guitar and electromagnetic pickups mounted directly into the body.",
              "They work in a similar way to solid-body electric guitars except that because the hollow body also vibrates, the pickups convert a combination of string and body vibration into an electrical signal.",
              "Many models have a solid block running through the middle of the soundbox designed to reduce acoustic feedback, known as semi-hollow bodies.",
              "They do not provide enough acoustic volume for live performance, but they can be used unplugged for quiet practice.",
              "Semi-acoustic guitars are noted for being able to provide a sweet, plaintive, or funky tone.",
              "They are used in many genres, including jazz, blues, funk, sixties pop, and indie rock.",
              "They generally have cello-style F-shaped sound holes, which can be blocked off to further reduce feedback.",
              "Whereas chambered guitars are made, like solid-body guitars, from a single block of wood, semi-acoustic guitar bodies are made from multiple pieces of wood in an archtop form, a method of construction different from the typical steel string acoustic guitar): the top is formed from a moderately thick (1 inch (2.",
              "5 cm)) piece of wood, which is then carved into a thin (0.",
              "1 inches (0.",

              "Some steel-string acoustic guitars are fitted with pickups purely as an alternative to using a separate microphone.",
              "They may also be fitted with a piezoelectric pickup under the bridge, attached to the bridge mounting plate, or with a low-mass microphone (usually a condenser mic) inside the body of the guitar that converts the vibrations in the body into electronic signals.",
              "Combinations of these types of pickups may be used, with an integral mixer/preamp/graphic equalizer.",
              "Such instruments are called electric acoustic guitars.",
              "They are regarded as acoustic guitars rather than electric guitars because the pickups do not produce a signal directly from the vibration of the strings, but rather from the vibration of the guitar top or body, and the amplification of the sound merely increases volume, not alters tone.",
              "Electric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups.",

              "The degree to which the choice of woods and other materials in the solid-guitar body (3) affects the sonic character of the amplified signal is disputed.",
              "Many believe it is highly significant, while others think the difference between woods is subtle.",
              "In acoustic and archtop guitars, wood choices more clearly affect tone.",
              "Woods typically used in solid-body electric guitars include alder (brighter, but well rounded), swamp ash (similar to alder, but with more pronounced highs and lows), mahogany (dark, bassy, warm), poplar (similar to alder), and basswood (very neutral).",

              "Many guitars with active electronics use a jack with an extra contact normally used for stereo.",
              "These guitars use the extra contact to break the ground connection to the on-board battery to preserve battery life when the guitar is unplugged.",
              "These guitars require a mono plug to close the internal switch and connect the battery to ground.",

              "Within these four types are many variants.",
              "A hard-tail guitar bridge anchors the strings at or directly behind the bridge and is fastened securely to the top of the instrument.",
              "[35] These are common on carved-top guitars, such as the Gibson Les Paul and the Paul Reed Smith models, and on slab-body guitars, such as the Music Man Albert Lee and Fender guitars that are not equipped with a vibrato arm.",
              "A floating or trapeze tailpiece (similar to a violin's) fastens to the body at the base of the guitar.",

              "It uses a lever (\"vibrato arm\") attached to the bridge that can temporarily slacken or tighten the strings to alter the pitch.",
              "A player can use this to create a vibrato or a portamento effect.",
              "Early vibrato systems were often unreliable and made the guitar go out of tune easily.",
              "They also had a limited pitch range.",
              "Later Fender designs were better, but Fender held the patent on these, so other companies used older designs for many years.",

              "Floyd Rose introduced one of the first improvements on the vibrato system in many years when, in the late 1970s, he experimented with \"locking\" nuts and bridges that prevent the guitar from losing tuning, even under heavy vibrato bar use.",
              "The fourth type of system employs string-through body anchoring.",
              "The strings pass over the bridge saddles, then through holes through the top of the guitar body to the back.",
              "The strings are typically anchored in place at the back of the guitar by metal ferrules.",

              "Compared to an acoustic guitar, which has a hollow body, electric guitars make much less audible sound when their strings are plucked, so electric guitars are normally plugged into a guitar amplifier and speaker.",
              "When an electric guitar is played, string movement produces a signal by generating (i.",
              "e., inducing) a small electric current in the magnetic pickups, which are magnets wound with coils of very fine wire.",
              "The signal passes through the tone and volume circuits to the output jack, and through a cable to an amplifier.",
              "[37] The current induced is proportional to such factors as string density and the amount of movement over the pickups.",
              "Because of their natural qualities, magnetic pickups tend to pick up ambient, usually unwanted electromagnetic interference or EMI.",
              "[38] This mains hum results in a tone of 50 or 60 cycles per second depending on the powerline frequency of the local alternating current supply.",
              "The resulting hum is particularly strong with single-coil pickups.",
              "Double-coil or \"humbucker\" pickups were invented as a way to reduce or counter the sound, as they are designed to \"buck\" (in the verb sense of oppose or resist) the hum, hence their name.",
              "The high combined inductance of the two coils also leads to the richer, \"fatter\" tone associated with humbucking pickups.",
              "Electric guitar necks vary in composition and shape.",
              "The primary metric of guitar necks is the scale length, which is the vibrating length of the strings from nut to bridge.",

              "[39] Frets are positioned proportionally to scale length\u2014the shorter the scale length, the closer the fret spacing.",
              "Opinions vary regarding the effect of scale length on tone and feel.",
              "Popular opinion holds that longer scale length contributes to greater amplitude.",
              "Reports of playing feel are greatly complicated by the many factors involved in this perception.",
              "String gauge and design, neck construction and relief, guitar setup, playing style, and other factors contribute to the subjective impression of playability or feel.",
              "Necks are described as bolt-on, set-in, or neck-through, depending on how they attach to the body.",
              "Set-in necks are glued to the body at the factory.",
              "This is the traditional type of joint.",
              "Leo Fender pioneered bolt-on necks on electric guitars to facilitate easy adjustment and replacement.",
              "Neck-through instruments extend the neck to the length of the instrument so that it forms the center of the body.",
              "While a set-in neck can be carefully unglued by a skilled luthier, and a bolt-on neck can simply be unscrewed, a neck-through design is difficult or even impossible to repair, depending on the damage.",
              "Historically, the bolt-on style has been more popular for ease of installation and adjustment.",
              "Since bolt-on necks can be easily removed, there is an after-market in replacement bolt-on necks from companies such as Warmoth and Mighty Mite.",
              "Some instruments\u2014notably most Gibson models\u2014continue to use set-in glued necks.",
              "Neck-through bodies are somewhat more common in bass guitars.",
              "Materials for necks are selected for dimensional stability and rigidity,[40] and some allege that they influence tone.",

              "Aside from possible engineering advantages, some feel that with the rising cost of rare tonewoods, man-made materials may be economically preferable and more ecologically sensitive.",
              "However, wood remains popular in production instruments, though sometimes in conjunction with new materials.",
              "Vigier guitars, for example, use a wooden neck reinforced by embedding a light, carbon fiber rod in place of the usual heavier steel bar or adjustable steel truss rod.",
              "After-market necks made entirely from carbon fiber fit existing bolt-on instruments.",
              "Few, if any, extensive formal investigations have been widely published that confirm or refute claims over the effects of different woods or materials on the electric guitar sound.",

              "Its limited dynamic range typically relegated it to a supporting role in ensemble performance.",
              "Surrounded on the bandstand by horns, drums and other stringed instruments, the sound of an acoustic guitar was barely audible.",
              "In the early 1930s, as advances in microphone technology raised the volume of the singer, the invention of the electromagnetic \u201cpickup\u201d allowed guitar players to turn up the volume as well.",
              "Situated on the body of the instrument just below the strings, the pickup created magnetic fields that converted the vibrations of the strings into electrical signals.",
              "Sent from the guitar through a cable, these signals were transmitted to an amplified loudspeaker (the \u201camplifier\u201d), and the guitar became substantially louder.",
              "In 1936, Gibson introduced the ES-150 model, a mass-produced guitar that included a mounted electromagnetic pickup.",
              "As guitarists embraced the electrified instrument, the perception and uses of the guitar began to change dramatically.",
              "For instance, Oklahoma musician Charlie Christian adapted the language of jazz soloing, previously performed mostly on woodwinds, brass and piano, to the electric guitar\u2019s fretboard, moving the instrument to a featured spot on the bandstand.",
              "As the electric guitar\u2019s popularity increased in the 1940s and 50s, new musical styles emerged, including the Urban Blues performed by southern musicians who came north to industrial cities during the Great Migration.",
              "These musicians left rural regions such as the Mississippi Delta to seek better working conditions in large, northern metropolitan areas.",
              "Once in the North, musicians performed to larger and louder audiences, and the electric guitar helped them to be heard above the crowd.",
