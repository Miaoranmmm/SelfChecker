    "response": "There are many interesting and little-known facts about the history of the Mona Lisa, one of the world's most famous paintings by Leonardo da Vinci. Here are some of them:\n\n- The painting is only **30 inches tall**[^5^] and it is not painted on canvas, but on **three pieces of wood**[^4^].\n- The name of the painting, Mona Lisa, was the result of a **spelling error**. The original name was Monna Lisa, which is an abbreviation of Madonna Lisa or \"my lady Lisa\"[^6^] [^2^].\n- The identity of the woman in the painting is still a **mystery**. Most art historians believe she is Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant[^3^], but some have suggested other candidates, such as Leonardo's mother, his assistant, or even himself[^2^].\n- The painting has been **attacked** several times. In 1956, a man threw acid at it and another man threw a rock at it, damaging some of its pigment. In 2009, a woman threw a ceramic mug at it. The painting is now protected by bullet-proof glass[^2^].\n- The painting has also been **stolen** from the Louvre in 1911 by an Italian worker who wanted to return it to Italy. It was recovered two years later in Florence after he tried to sell it to an art dealer[^2^]. During the theft, Pablo Picasso was a suspect because he had been caught before trying to sell stolen Louvre pieces[^2^].\n- The painting has its own **mailbox** at the Louvre because of all the love letters it receives from admirers[^2^]. It also has its own room with special lighting and temperature controls[^2^].\n- The painting has inspired many **parodies** and interpretations by other artists, such as Marcel Duchamp, who added a mustache and a beard to it and titled it LHOOQ, which sounds like \"she has a hot ass\" in French[^2^]. Andy Warhol also created multiple versions of it with different colors and effects[^2^].\n\nI hope you enjoyed these facts about the Mona Lisa. Do you have any questions or comments?",

              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the Mona Lisa\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous possibilities, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo\u2014hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "The Mona Lisa hangs behind bulletproof glass in a gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it has been a part of the museum\u2019s collection since 1804.",
              "It was part of the royal collection before becoming the property of the French people during the Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "The Mona Lisa is priceless.",
              "Any speculative price (some say over a billion dollars!)",
              "would probably be so high that not one person would be able or willing to purchase and maintain the painting.",
              "Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it.",
              "The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for the Mona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment.",
              "Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.",
              "Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece\u2019s celebrity, including its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and its tour to the U.",
              "S.",
              "in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.",
              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal.",
              "Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world\u2019s most famous painting.",
              "It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century.",
              "The sitter\u2019s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.",
              "The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape.",
              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter\u2019s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.",
              "The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting\u2014especially apparent in the sitter\u2019s faint smile\u2014reflects Leonardo\u2019s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo\u2019s vision.",
              "In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits.",
              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",
              "The sitter\u2019s identity has not been definitively proven.",
              "Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo\u2019s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa about 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "French King Francis I, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life, acquired the work after the artist\u2019s death, and it became part of the royal collection.",
              "For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "Following a period hanging in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",
              "During World War II the Mona Lisa, singled out as the most-endangered artwork in the Louvre, was evacuated to various locations in France\u2019s countryside, returning to the museum in 1945 after peace had been declared.",
              "It later traveled to the United States in 1963, drawing about 40,000 people per day during its six-week stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              "It also toured to Tokyo and Moscow in 1974.",
              "Scholars have noted that the Mona Lisa is in fairly good condition for its age.",
              "The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its original frame and to braces added by early restorers.",
              "To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting.",
              "Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail.",
              "The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject\u2019s left elbow.",
              "The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work\u2019s visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it."

              "[9] It is painted in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family, and it is believed he later left it in his will to his favored apprentice Salai\u0300.",
              "[10] It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506;",
              "however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517.",
              "It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic.",
              "It has been on permanent display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.",
              "[11] The painting's global fame and popularity stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism\u2014a belief it should belong to Italy.",
              "The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Arse\u0300ne Lupin) and the song Mona Lisa recorded by Nat King Cole\u2014one of the most successful songs of the 1950s.",

              "[14] The title of the painting, which is known in English as Mona Lisa, is based on the presumption that it depicts Lisa del Giocondo, although her likeness is uncertain.",
              "Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote that \"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\"",
              "[17][18][19][20] Monna in Italian is a polite form of address originating as ma donna\u2014similar to Ma'am, Madam, or my lady in English.",

              "The title of the painting, though traditionally spelled Mona in English, is spelled in Italian as Monna Lisa (mona being a vulgarity in Italian), but this is rare in English.",
              "[21][22] Lisa del Giocondo was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo.",
              "[23] The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea.",
              "[24] The Italian name for the painting, La Gioconda, means 'jocund' ('happy' or 'jovial') or, literally, 'the jocund one', a pun on the feminine form of Lisa's married name, Giocondo.",
              "[23][25] In French, the title La Joconde has the same meaning.",
              "Vasari's account of the Mona Lisa comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist's death.",
              "It has long been the best-known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter.",

              "[citation needed] That Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume by ancient Roman philosopher Cicero.",
              "Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci.",
              "This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.",
              "[26] In response to the announcement of the discovery of this document, Vincent Delieuvin, the Louvre representative, stated \"Leonardo da Vinci was painting, in 1503, the portrait of a Florentine lady by the name of Lisa del Giocondo.",
              "About this we are now certain.",

              "Contending that the painting depicts a figure suspended in ceaseless shuttle between the here-and-now and some otherworldly realm that lies beyond, Pater pinpoints the mystical essence of the panel's perennial appeal: its surreal sense of eternal flux.",

              "Flanked on either side by bodies of flowing water that the artist has ingeniously positioned in such a way as to suggest that they are aspects of his sitter's very being, Da Vinci's subject has a strangely submarine quality to her that is accentuated by the algae green dress she wears \u2013 an amphibious second skin that has only grown murkier and darker with time.",
              "Pivoting her stare slightly to her left to meet ours, Mona Lisa is poised upon not just any old bench or stool, but a deep-seated perch known popularly as a pozzetto chair.",
              "Meaning \"little well\", the pozzetto introduces a subtle symbolism into the narrative that is as revealing as it is unexpected.",
              "By placing Mona Lisa on a 'little well', surrounded by water, Da Vinci could be drawing on earlier spiritual connections with springs (Credit: Alamy) Suddenly, the waters we see meandering with a mazy motion behind Mona Lisa (whether belonging to an actual landscape, such as the valley of the Italian River Arno, as some historians believe, or entirely imaginary, as others contend) are no longer distant and disconnected from the sitter, but are an essential resource that sustain her existence.",
              "They literally flow into her.",
              "By situating Mona Lisa inside a \"little well\", Da Vinci transforms her into an ever-fluctuating dimension of the physical universe she occupies.",
              "Art historian and leading Da Vinci expert Martin Kemp has likewise detected a fundamental connection between Mona Lisa's depiction and the geology of the world she inhabits.",
              "\"The artist was not literally portraying the prehistoric or future Arno,\" Kemp asserts in his study Leonardo: 100 Milestones (2019), \"but was shaping Lisa's landscape on the basis of what he had learned about change in the 'body of the Earth', to stand alongside the implicit transformations in the body of the woman as a 'lesser world' or microcosm.\"",
              "Mona Lisa isn't sitting before a landscape.",
              "She is the landscape.",
              "Drawing from a well As with all visual symbols employed by Leonardo, the pozzetto chair is multivalent and serves more than merely to link Mona Lisa with the artist's well-known fascination with the hydrological forces that shape the Earth.",
              "The subtle insinuation of a \"little well\" in the painting as the very channel through which Mona Lisa emerges into consciousness repositions the painting entirely in cultural discourse.",
              "No longer is this a straightforwardly secular portrait but something spiritually more complex.",
              "Portrayals of women \"at the well\" are a staple throughout Western art history.",
              "Old Testament stories of Eliezar meeting Rebekah at a well and of Jacob meeting Rachel at the well went on to become especially popular in the 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries, as everyone from Bartolome\u0301 Esteban Murillo to Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo to William Holman Hunt tried their hand at one or other of the narratives.",
              "There are many depictions in art of people at wells, such as Christ and the Samaritan Woman (1310-11) by Duccio di Buoninsegna (Credit: Alamy) Moreover apocryphal depictions of the New Testament Annunciation (the moment when the Archangel Gabriel informs the Virgin Mary that she will give birth to Christ) as occurring at the site of a spring were a mainstay among Medieval manuscript illustrators, and may even have inspired the oldest surviving visual portrayal of Mary.",
              "An endlessly elastic emblem, as Walter Pater intimated, Mona Lisa is doubtless capable of absorbing all such reflected resonances and many more besides.",
              "There is no one she isn't.",
              "But perhaps the most pertinent parallel between Da Vinci's Mona Lisa and pictorial precursors is one that can be drawn with the many representations of a biblical episode in which Jesus finds himself at a well, engaged in cryptic conversation with a woman from Samaria.",
              "In the Gospel of John, Jesus makes a distinction between the water that can be drawn from the natural spring \u2013 water which will inevitably leave one \"thirsty\" \u2013 and the \"living water\" that he can provide.",
              "Where water from a well can only sustain a perishable body, 'living water' is capable of quenching the eternal spirit.",
              "Notable depictions of the scene by the Medieval Italian painter Duccio di Buoninsegna and by the German Renaissance master Lucas Cranach the Elder tend to seat Jesus directly on the wall of the well, suggesting his dominion over the fleeting elements of this world.",
              "By placing his female sitter notionally inside the well, however, Da Vinci confounds the tradition, and suggests instead a merging of material and spiritual realms \u2013 a blurring of the here and hereafter \u2013 into a shared plane of eternal emergence.",
              "In Da Vinci's enthralling narrative, Mona Lisa is herself a miraculous surge of \"living water\", serenely content in the knowledge of her own raging infinitude.",

              "Unfortunately, we cannot be absolutely certain that this portrait of Lisa del Giocondo is the painting of the Louvre.\"",
              "[27] The catalogue raisonne\u0301 Leonardo da Vinci (2019) confirms that the painting probably depicts Lisa del Giocondo, with Isabella d'Este being the only plausible alternative.",
              "[28] Scholars have developed several alternative views, arguing that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, and identifying at least four other paintings referred to by Vasari as the Mona Lisa.",
              "[29] Several other people have been proposed as the subject of the painting,[30] including Isabella of Aragon,[31] Cecilia Gallerani,[32] Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla,[30] Pacifica Brandano/Brandino, Isabella Gualanda, Caterina Sforza, Bianca Giovanna Sforza, Salai\u0300, and even Leonardo himself.",
              "[33][34][35] Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud theorized that Leonardo imparted an approving smile from his mother, Caterina, onto the Mona Lisa and other works.",
              "[36][37] The Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at that time seen as an ideal for womanhood.",
              "[38] The woman sits markedly upright in a \"pozzetto\" armchair with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture.",
              "Her gaze is fixed on the observer.",
              "The woman appears alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines (sfumato).",
              "The soft blending creates an ambiguous mood \"mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes\".",
              "[39] The depiction of the sitter in three-quarter profile is similar to late 15th-century works by Lorenzo di Credi and Agnolo di Domenico del Mazziere.",
              "[38] Zo\u0308llner notes that the sitter's general position can be traced back to Flemish models and that \"in particular the vertical slices of columns at both sides of the panel had precedents in Flemish portraiture.\"",
              "[40] Woods-Marsden cites Hans Memling's portrait of Benedetto Portinari (1487) or Italian imitations such as Sebastiano Mainardi's pendant portraits for the use of a loggia, which has the effect of mediating between the sitter and the distant landscape, a feature missing from Leonardo's earlier portrait of Ginevra de' Benci.",
              "[41] The painting was one of the first Italian portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape,[43] and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective.",
              "[44] The enigmatic woman is portrayed seated in what appears to be an open loggia with dark pillar bases on either side.",
              "Behind her, a vast landscape recedes to icy mountains, winding paths and a distant bridge, giving only the slightest indications of human presence.",
              "Leonardo has chosen to place the horizon line not at the neck, as he did with Ginevra de' Benci, but on a level with the eyes, thus linking the figure with the landscape and emphasizing the mysterious nature of the painting.",
              "[41] The bridge in the background was identified by Silvano Vincenti as the four-arched Romito di Laterina bridge from Etruscan-Roman times near Laterina, Arezzo over the Arno river.",
              "[45] Other bridges with similar arches suggested as possible locations had more arches.",
              "[45] Mona Lisa has no clearly visible eyebrows or eyelashes, although Vasari describes the eyebrows in detail.",
              "[46][a] In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning.",
              "[49] Cotte discovered that the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made to the size of the face and the direction of gaze.",
              "He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.",
              "[50] There has been much speculation regarding the painting's model and landscape.",
              "For example, Leonardo probably painted his model faithfully since her beauty is not seen as being among the best, \"even when measured by late quattrocento (15th century) or even twenty-first century standards.\"",

              "[53] Research in 2008 by a geomorphology professor at Urbino University and an artist-photographer revealed that Mona Lisa's landscape was similar to some views in the Montefeltro region in the Italian provinces of Pesaro and Urbino, and Rimini.",
              "[54][55] Of Leonardo da Vinci's works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned,[56] and one of four works \u2013 the others being Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, Adoration of the Magi and The Last Supper \u2013 whose attribution has avoided controversy.",

              "Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it.",
              "The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for the Mona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment.",
              "Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.",
              "Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece\u2019s celebrity, including its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and its tour to the U.",

              "Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world\u2019s most famous painting.",
              "It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century.",
              "The sitter\u2019s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.",
              "The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape.",
              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter\u2019s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.",
              "The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting\u2014especially apparent in the sitter\u2019s faint smile\u2014reflects Leonardo\u2019s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo\u2019s vision.",
              "In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits.",
              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",
              "The sitter\u2019s identity has not been definitively proven.",
              "Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo\u2019s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa about 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "French King Francis I, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life, acquired the work after the artist\u2019s death, and it became part of the royal collection.",
              "For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "Following a period hanging in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",
              "During World War II the Mona Lisa, singled out as the most-endangered artwork in the Louvre, was evacuated to various locations in France\u2019s countryside, returning to the museum in 1945 after peace had been declared.",
              "It later traveled to the United States in 1963, drawing about 40,000 people per day during its six-week stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",

              "It also toured to Tokyo and Moscow in 1974.",
              "Scholars have noted that the Mona Lisa is in fairly good condition for its age.",
              "The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its original frame and to braces added by early restorers.",
              "To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting.",
              "Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail.",
              "The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject\u2019s left elbow.",
              "The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work\u2019s visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it."

              "[40] Woods-Marsden cites Hans Memling's portrait of Benedetto Portinari (1487) or Italian imitations such as Sebastiano Mainardi's pendant portraits for the use of a loggia, which has the effect of mediating between the sitter and the distant landscape, a feature missing from Leonardo's earlier portrait of Ginevra de' Benci.",
              "[41] The painting was one of the first Italian portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape,[43] and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective.",

              "Behind her, a vast landscape recedes to icy mountains, winding paths and a distant bridge, giving only the slightest indications of human presence.",
              "Leonardo has chosen to place the horizon line not at the neck, as he did with Ginevra de' Benci, but on a level with the eyes, thus linking the figure with the landscape and emphasizing the mysterious nature of the painting.",
              "[41] The bridge in the background was identified by Silvano Vincenti as the four-arched Romito di Laterina bridge from Etruscan-Roman times near Laterina, Arezzo over the Arno river.",
              "[45] Other bridges with similar arches suggested as possible locations had more arches.",
              "[45] Mona Lisa has no clearly visible eyebrows or eyelashes, although Vasari describes the eyebrows in detail.",
              "[46][a] In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning.",
              "[49] Cotte discovered that the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made to the size of the face and the direction of gaze.",
              "He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.",
              "[50] There has been much speculation regarding the painting's model and landscape.",
              "For example, Leonardo probably painted his model faithfully since her beauty is not seen as being among the best, \"even when measured by late quattrocento (15th century) or even twenty-first century standards.\"",
              "[51] Some historians in Eastern art, such as Yukio Yashiro, argue that the landscape in the background of the picture was influenced by Chinese paintings,[52] but this thesis has been contested for lack of clear evidence.",
              "[52] Research in 2003 by Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University said that Mona Lisa's smile disappears when observed with direct vision, known as foveal.",
              "Because of the way the human eye processes visual information, it is less suited to pick up shadows directly;",
              "however, peripheral vision can pick up shadows well.",
              "[53] Research in 2008 by a geomorphology professor at Urbino University and an artist-photographer revealed that Mona Lisa's landscape was similar to some views in the Montefeltro region in the Italian provinces of Pesaro and Urbino, and Rimini.",
              "[54][55] Of Leonardo da Vinci's works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned,[56] and one of four works \u2013 the others being Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, Adoration of the Magi and The Last Supper \u2013 whose attribution has avoided controversy.",

              "[59] Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513.",
              "[60] According to Vasari, \"after he had lingered over it four years, [he] left it unfinished\".",

              "[76] In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th-century Italian painting at the Louvre, states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version,[77] while Zo\u0308llner states that the sketch may be after another Leonardo portrait of the same subject.",
              "[75] The record of an October 1517 visit by Louis d'Aragon states that the Mona Lisa was executed for the deceased Giuliano de' Medici, Leonardo's steward at Belvedere, Vienna, between 1513 and 1516[78][79][c]\u2014but this was likely an error.",

              "[81] A number of experts have argued that Leonardo made two versions (because of the uncertainty concerning its dating and commissioner, as well as its fate following Leonardo's death in 1519, and the difference of details in Raphael's sketch\u2014which may be explained by the possibility that he made the sketch from memory).",

              "\u00b7 The Mona Lisa is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and enigmatic paintings in the world.",
              "Painted by the renowned artist Leonardo da Vinci, this masterpiece has captivated viewers for centuries with its enigmatic smile and mysterious subject.",
              "While the painting\u2019s identity has been widely accepted as Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo, there have been numerous theories and controversies surrounding the true identity of the woman in the painting.",
              "One of the most debated theories surrounding the Mona Lisa\u2019s identity is that she is actually a double portrait, representing two different women.",
              "Proponents of this theory point out that both the left and right sides of the painting show subtle differences in facial features, leading to the belief that it is a combination of two different women.",
              "Furthermore, some art historians have suggested that the left side of the painting resembles Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s assistant Salai, while the right side resembles a woman named Bianca Giovanna Sforza, who was married to a man who commissioned a portrait of her from Leonardo.",
              "However, this theory remains unproven, and many scholars argue that the slight differences in the painting\u2019s sides can be attributed to the artist\u2019s typical style.",
              "An alternate theory proposes that the Mona Lisa is not a portrait of a woman, but rather a representation of Jesus Christ, with the enigmatic smile being a symbol of his divinity.",
              "This theory is based on the belief that Leonardo, who was known to have studied and painted Christian themes, may have concealed a hidden message in the painting.",
              "However, many art historians dismiss this theory, arguing that the painting\u2019s subject is clearly a female figure and that the enigmatic smile is simply a result of the artist\u2019s mastery of techniques such as sfumato.",
              "In recent years, a controversial theory has surfaced, suggesting that the Mona Lisa may have been a male figure.",
              "This theory is based on a study of the painting\u2019s facial features, which some experts claim resemble male features more closely than female ones.",
              "The argument gained traction when art historian Maike Vogt-Luerssen published a book proposing that the painting was originally a portrait of Leonardo da Vinci himself.",
              "However, many art historians and experts have refuted this theory, stating that the painting is clearly a female figure.",
              "One of the most enduring controversies surrounding the Mona Lisa is the belief that the painting we see today is not the original.",
              "The theory suggests that the original portrait was lost, and what is now admired as the Mona Lisa is a copy.",
              "This belief was fueled by a discovery in 2012 when a hidden image was found beneath the surface of the painting using infrared technology.",
              "Some believe that this hidden image could be the original portrait, and that the painting we know as the Mona Lisa is actually a copy of the lost original.",
              "However, this theory is highly contested, and there is no concrete evidence to support it.",
              "Despite the numerous theories and controversies surrounding the Mona Lisa\u2019s identity, one thing is for certain: The painting remains one of the most iconic symbols of art in the world.",
              "Whether she was a real person or a figment of the artist\u2019s imagination, the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa will continue to intrigue and fascinate viewers for centuries to come.",

              "While Da Vinci is known as a mathematician, artist, inventor, architect, and cartographer, perhaps his painting may be more memorable than the man himself.",
              "Historical sources point to the Palace of Fontainebleau as the first home of the famous painting.",
              "The painting hung in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom for a time, but that did not last long.",
              "The painting currently hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, and has been there on display since 1797.",
              "When Da Vinci made the painting, the Virgin Mary was the ideal woman, which is why the painting resembles early Renaissance art.",
              "It is one of the most valuable pieces of artwork globally and has been the target of multiple attempted thefts.",
              "In 1911, it was stolen by an Italian man named Vincenzo Perugia, a Louvre employee, who hid the painting under his clothes and walked out.",
              "At the time, many rumors surrounded the theft claiming that Germany was behind it.",
              "Unfortunately, investigators could not determine where the painting had disappeared.",
              "The bold nature of its theft truly stunned the art community.",
              "Authorities returned it two years later after Perugia tried to sell it in Italy.",
              "Apparently, in November of 1913, an Italian art dealer named Alfredo Geri received a letter from someone calling themselves Leonardo.",
              "The letter mentioned the Mona Lisa and that it was in Florence and would be returned after Geri paid a hefty ransom.",
              "When Perugia tried to collect on his threats, the authorities arrested him.",
              "Unfortunately, it seems that when an artist creates something of beauty and value, people will go to great lengths to try and destroy it.",
              "A man threw acid on the lower half of the painting, severely damaging it, while it was on display at a museum in Montauban, France in 1956.",
              "On December 30th of the same year, a Bolivian man named Ugo Ungaza Villegas threw a rock at the painting that chipped a noticeable speck of paint from the elbow.",
              "Other attempts at vandalism happened while the painting was on tour.",
              "For instance, in 1974, a woman upset by the museum\u2019s policy for disabled patrons tried to spray red paint on the painting while it was on display at the Tokyo National Museum.",
              "Since then, the Mona Lisa has been held safely behind a bulletproof glass case.",
              "Throughout history, many assumptions and theories have been made about the Mona Lisa\u2019s true identity.",
              "Some say she was a prostitute.",
              "Others say she was a noblewoman.",
              "Some say the woman was Leonardo\u2019s mother or secret lover.",
              "But unfortunately, speculation will only get us so far.",
              "Today, technological advances have provided us an edge over earlier researchers.",
              "Despite the backlash he received, a well-known art historian named Vasari from the 16th century said that the Mona Lisa was the wife of a wealthy businessman who lived in Florence, Italy.",
              "However, it wasn\u2019t until 2005 that a manuscript containing vital evidence to support his claim was found in a stack of ancient books at the University of Heidelberg in Germany.",
              "By studying the book and its contents, researchers determined that it belonged to Vespucci, a good friend of Da Vinci\u2019s.",
              "As the library pieced together the discovery, there was still doubt about its validity.",
              "Finally, Dr.",
              "Armin Schlechter, a historian for the University, discovered that a margin note in the book Agostino Vespucci from October 1503 solidifies his findings.",

              "Lisa Gherardini was born on June 15th, 1479, and was the oldest of all her seven siblings.",
              "She came from a formerly wealthy family, that lost their influence over time.",
              "This was during the early stages of the Renaissance.",
              "On March 5, 1495, a 16-year-old Lisa married Francesco del Giocondo, a wealthy Florentine textile merchant.",
              "Francesco benefited from marrying Lisa because of her family\u2019s former status, and the fact that her dowry consisted of 170 gold Florins and a farm.",
              "Lisa enjoyed the benefits of marrying into the Giocondo family and her new high social status.",
              "Historians believe that the painting was commissioned to celebrate a new child for the couple\u2019s new home.",
              "The couple would go on to have five children.",
              "Then, on March 5, 1503, Lisa and Francesco moved to an apartment near the Via Della Stufa, where Piero da Vinci, Leonardo\u2019s father, lived.",
              "It wouldn\u2019t take long for Piero and Lisa to become close friends.",
              "It was common among wealthy families to immortalize events in paintings, and so this was something the Giocondos regularly did.",
              "In 1503, Francesco invited four artists to portray Lisa del Giocondo, and Leonardo was one of them.",
              "Sources say that it took Leonardo approximately ten years to complete the Mona Lisa, which depicts her gentleness and faithfulness.",
              "According to scholars, Leonardo did not give the portrait to the Lisa del Giocondo due to a series of disputes between Florence\u2019s wealthy families.",
              "Other sources suggest that Leonardo kept the picture with him because he wasn\u2019t paid for the artwork.",

              "Lisa Gherardini was immortalized in one of the world\u2019s most valuable paintings by Leonardo da Vinci.",
              "There have been many attempts to recreate the masterpiece, but only one original exists.",

              "in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.",
              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal.",
              "Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world\u2019s most famous painting.",
              "It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century.",
              "The sitter\u2019s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.",
              "The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape.",
              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter\u2019s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.",
              "The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting\u2014especially apparent in the sitter\u2019s faint smile\u2014reflects Leonardo\u2019s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo\u2019s vision.",
              "In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits.",
              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",
              "The sitter\u2019s identity has not been definitively proven.",
              "Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo\u2019s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa about 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "French King Francis I, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life, acquired the work after the artist\u2019s death, and it became part of the royal collection.",
              "For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "Following a period hanging in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",
              "During World War II the Mona Lisa, singled out as the most-endangered artwork in the Louvre, was evacuated to various locations in France\u2019s countryside, returning to the museum in 1945 after peace had been declared.",
              "It later traveled to the United States in 1963, drawing about 40,000 people per day during its six-week stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              "It also toured to Tokyo and Moscow in 1974.",
              "Scholars have noted that the Mona Lisa is in fairly good condition for its age.",
              "The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its original frame and to braces added by early restorers.",
              "To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting.",
              "Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail.",
              "The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject\u2019s left elbow.",
              "The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work\u2019s visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it."

              "Three men were hurrying out of the Louvre.",
              "It was odd, since the museum was closed to visitors on Mondays, and odder still with what one of them had under his jacket.",

              "It was understandable.",

              "Leonardo painted the portrait around 1507, and it was not until the 1860s that art critics claimed the Mona Lisa was one of the finest examples of Renaissance painting.",
              "This judgment, however, had not yet filtered beyond a thin slice of the intelligentsia, and interest in it was relatively minimal.",
              "In his 1878 guidebook to Paris, travel writer Karl Baedeker offered a paragraph of description about the portrait;",
              "in 1907 he had a mere two sentences, much less than the other gems in the museum, such as Nike of Samothrace and Venus de Milo.",

              "Perugia stood up and declared himself a pittore, an artist.",
              "He had taught himself how to read and sometimes holed himself up in coffeehouses or museums, poring through books and newspapers.",
              "Stealing the Mona Lisa made sense.",
              "Most purloined paintings that were not immediately held for ransom didn't go to a wealthy aristocrat\u2019s secret hideaway, but instead slide into an illicit pipeline being used as barter or collateral for drugs, arms and other stolen goods.",
              "Perugia had enough connections to criminal circles that he hoped to barter or sell it.",
              "Unfortunately for Perugia, the Mona Lisa got too hot to hock.",
              "Initially, the afternoon newspapers in Paris had nothing on Monday, and the following morning\u2019s papers were also curiously quiet on the matter.",

              "Perugia squirreled the Mona Lisa away in the false bottom of a wooden trunk in his room at his boardinghouse.",
              "When the Parisian police interrogated him in November 1911 as a part of their interviews of all Louvre employees, he blithely said he only learned of the theft from the newspapers and that the reason he was late to work that Monday in August\u2014as his employer had told the police\u2014was that he had drunk too much the night before and overslept.",
              "The police bought the story.",
              "Supremely inept, they ignored Perugia and instead arrested the artist Pablo Picasso and the poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire.",

              "The two were promptly released.",
              "In December 1913, after 28 months, Perugia left his Parisian boardinghouse with his trunk and took a train to Florence where he tried to offload the painting on an art dealer who promptly called the police.",

              "Under a shower of even more publicity, it returned to the Louvre following mobbed exhibitions in Florence, Milan and Rome.",
              "In the first two days after it was rehung in the Salon Carre\u0301, more than 100,000 people viewed it.",
              "Today, eight million people see the Mona Lisa every year.",

              "It was 24 hours before anyone noticed she was missing.",
              "The usual line is that the Louvre was closed for maintenance and everyone thought that somebody else must have removed the picture to be photographed, or cleaned.",
              "But museums are \u2013 or were \u2013 surprisingly blind to crime, even when it involves stealing the world's most famous painting.",
              "Or perhaps not the world's most famous painting \u2013 the Mona Lisa certainly wasn't universally known in 1911.",
              "You still had to travel to the Louvre to see her.",
              "There were prints, though Leonardo's cumulative portrait, gradually painted over several years, had long proved extremely hard to copy as an engraving.",
              "And photographs did exist \u2013 indeed the French police printed off 6,500 copies for distribution in the streets of Paris immediately after her disappearance, as if to jog someone's memory.",
              "These mug-shots were also for comparison with any forgery that might turn up purporting to be the original.",
              "For the Mona Lisa wears a fine veil of craquelure \u2013 that pattern of tiny cracks that can form in the surface of a painting when it's as old as she is \u2013 that is more or less impossible to fake.",
              "Wrinkles are her positive ID.",
              "But a century ago, the painting's fame was restricted to the west, where she had been buoyed up on clouds of romantic hype ever since Walter Pater wrote in 1869: \"She is older than the rocks among which she sits, like the vampire she has been dead many times .",

              "A picture that could still come as something of a surprise: unthinkable now, but in those days reproductions of the Mona Lisa had only fairly recently become popular.",
              "What really put a face to the name was the press coverage inspired by the theft.",
              "Every major newspaper in Europe covered the story, and every story was illustrated with a reproduction of the painting.",
              "One paper, France's l'Illustration, even produced a centrespread, peddling the story that Leonardo had been in love with his sitter, and promising to work towards a colour reproduction within a couple of weeks.",
              "Millions of people who might not have seen it, might never even have heard of it, soon became experts on Leonardo's stolen painting.",
              "One of the first suspects was Pablo Picasso.",
              "The painter had nothing to do with the crime but immediately tried to dispose of some statues that turned out to have been stolen from the same museum.",
              "The poet Guillaume Apollinaire was also brought in for questioning.",
              "No charges were brought, though suspicion followed Picasso for a while \u2013 surely a great painter would want a great painting, ran the theory.",
              "For almost two years the trail went cold.",
              "The painting was in Switzerland or Argentina.",
              "Or it was in a cold-water flat in the Bronx or a secret room in the mansion of JP Morgan.",
              "In fact it never left Paris, or not until the thief, Vincenzo Perruggia, went to Florence in December 1913 after contacting a Florentine dealer called Alfred Geri, who he hoped would help him dispose of this unsaleable hostage for cash.",
              "Geri played along, even bringing the director of the Uffizi to the meeting at the Albergo Tripoli-Italian (needless to say swiftly renamed the Hotel La Gioconda).",
              "The painting was removed from its false-bottomed trunk.",
              "The craquelure was identified, and Geri promptly called the police.",
              "What did Perruggia feel about the eerie, enigmatic, supercilious, exquisite, remote, satanic (call her what you will) Mona Lisa that he would have her more or less about his person for two long years?",
              "To begin with he kept her in a cupboard, then under a stove in the kitchen, and finally in the false-bottomed trunk.",
              "For a while, he rather cockily propped her postcard on the mantelpiece, and in the letter to Geri he signs himself Leonardo Vincenzo.",

              "I find that reaction strange, having the opposite feeling \u2013 that the actual painting is much bigger than I ever expect.",
              "Perhaps that's because the Mona Lisa is scaled in one's mind to the size of an infinite number of postcards and reproductions.",
              "In reality, set in concrete, behind triple layers of bulletproof glass, she seems as large as any incarcerated offender.",
              "How the Mona Lisa looked in 1911 we shall never know.",
              "Nowadays, her photograph, her fame, precedes her so that every sighting is inflected: does she match up, does she look different, how does she compare with our expectations?",
              "The joy of seeing any painting in reality before seeing its pygmy reproductions \u2013 or worse, in the false glow of the computer \u2013 is long since over.",

              "The photographs of the crime scene a century ago show not a dramatically empty glass case, as one would nowadays see, or even a large expanse of bare wall, but a narrow gap between the Titians and Correggios \u2013 something more like a missing tooth.",
              "It is well known that thousands of people came to view this spot, this gap, this rumoured blank \u2013 more people, it is often pointed out, than used to visit when the painting was there.",

              "It nearly always stiffens and dies on the canvas.",
              "The Mona Lisa's is only enigmatic because of Leonardo's sfumato technique \u2013 that smokey, smudgy blur where you can't see how the smile ends at each corner, so that it simply tails away, unresolved, literally open-ended.",
              "Sfumato is not the only thing that makes her smile mysterious, of course.",
              "There are many contributory factors, but high on the list is the total absence of any visible context or event that could help to explain this peculiar smile.",
              "Vasari reduced it all to a sideshow: Leonardo had laid on musicians and jesters to keep his sitter from ennui.",
              "Some people think she was remembering lost love.",
              "But if the Mona Lisa were handed a baby, her smile would become beatific and make her look even more like a secular Madonna.",
              "With a couple of jesters on site, she might come across as polite if disapproving.",
              "The art historian Edgar Wind once slotted her into two different scenes to illustrate this point and was able to show that the same expression could look like grief at the Crucifixion, or tipsy mirth in the context of a bacchanalian revel.",
              "Mona Lisa smiles, but why?",
              "Nobody is talking, no jokes are being cracked, there are no letters to read, no dinners to eat, no babies to dandle or kittens to stroke: where is the probable cause?",
              "And all of the many interpretations of her smile \u2013 lonely, tragic, self-conscious, uncomfortable, superior, even sinister \u2013 depend on that lack of explanation.",
              "But what they also depend on, and did in 1911, is a much greater absence: her missing eyebrows.",
              "She has such a curious look \u2013 denuded, or as if chemotherapy had worked its bittersweet way, depriving her of not just eyebrows, in fact, but eyelashes too.",
              "Though the eyebrows are truly crucial, for they give definition not just to the eyes but to the whole face.",
              "The Mona Lisa's eyebrows were there during Leonardo's lifetime.",
              "A visitor to his house in France \u2013 where the artist went to work for the French King Franc\u0327ois I in his final years \u2013 mentions them.",
              "Vasari, the great renaissance art historian, also gives a description of the painting: \"The eyes were sparkling and moist as they always are in real life.",
              "Around them were reddish specks and hairs that could only be depicted with immense subtlety.",
              "The brows could not be more natural: the hair grows thickly in one place and lightly in another following the pores of the skin.\"",
              "With eyebrows, she would still look out from the deep, slow glazes of Leonardo's paint, but without the absolute enigma.",
              "Franc\u0327ois is the reason that any of us can see this portrait.",
              "Leonardo began painting the Mona Lisa in Florence around 1503, and took it with him when he left for France 13 years later.",
              "After his death in 1519, the painting passed through several hands until Franc\u0327ois managed to buy it for today's equivalent of around \u00a39m.",
              "When the aristocracy fell during the French revolution, the painting became part of the public collection of the Louvre.",
              "A small snag with Perruggia's patriotic defence during his trial \u2013 that his motive for stealing the Mona Lisa was not money but to return her to the motherland, avenging Napoleon's rapacious plundering of artworks from Italy \u2013 was that the Mona Lisa was never stolen from the Italians in the first place.",
              "The Italian press may have been touched by his claim, but not the jury at his trial.",
              "Perruggia was sentenced to 12 months in 1914.",

              "For one thing, immediate and intense repetition: it's the cinematic cliche\u0301 of rolling presses, of tomorrow's newsprint rushing round the cylinders, carrying images of the Mona Lisa, her face becoming a global edition, and with each face a repetition of all the anecdotes about her smile, her supernatural powers and so on.",
              "As early as the 1930s, French politicians were proposing that the Mona Lisa have her own separate gallery \"because all the Cook's tours go to see it\".",
              "\"People came not to look at the painting,\" Robert Hughes has said, \"but to say they that they'd seen it.\"",
              "From that moment, Hughes traces the pernicious rise of the hyperinflated art market.",
              "But its effect on museum culture has been devastating too.",
              "Visitors have to trek to her gallery at the Louvre and see if she's still casting her eerie spell.",
              "If you believe in slow looking, the Mona Lisa is the last work on earth that you will ever experience in this way.",
              "You queue to see her behind a winding cordon like those at airport security, you get your brief moment, and are instantly sent on your way.",
              "And though I cannot blame Perruggia entirely for this disaster, nor the fact that almost nobody looks at Veronese's stupendous Wedding at Cana in the same gallery, as vast as it is ignored, the theft of the Mona Lisa a century ago contributed exponentially to the painting's fame across the world, to this idea of a woman with a mysterious past, still here, haunting the present: a spectacle in a glass case.",
