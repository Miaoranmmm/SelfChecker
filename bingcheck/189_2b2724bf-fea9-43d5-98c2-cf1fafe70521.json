    "query": "Can you provide a brief overview of the history and development of artificial intelligence, including its current applications and potential future implications for society?",
    "response": "Artificial intelligence is a broad and fascinating field that explores the possibility of creating machines that can perform tasks that require human intelligence. The history and development of artificial intelligence can be traced back to the ancient philosophers who attempted to describe human thinking as a symbolic system[^5^]. However, the modern era of AI began in the mid-20th century with the work of Alan Turing, a British mathematician and computer scientist who proposed a test to determine whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior[^5^]. The term \"artificial intelligence\" was coined by John McCarthy, an American computer scientist, in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College, where he invited other researchers to discuss the potential and challenges of creating intelligent machines[^2^] [^4^]. The conference is considered as the birthplace of AI as a distinct field of study.\n\nSince then, AI has gone through many ups and downs, with periods of rapid progress followed by setbacks and disappointments. Some of the notable achievements in AI include the development of logic-based programs that can solve problems and prove theorems[^2^], the creation of expert systems that can provide advice and diagnosis in specific domains[^2^], the invention of neural networks that can learn from data and mimic biological brains[^2^], the design of natural language processing systems that can understand and generate human languages[^2^], the advancement of computer vision systems that can recognize and manipulate images[^2^], and the emergence of machine learning systems that can improve their performance with experience and data[^2^].\n\nAI has also found many applications in various fields and industries, such as education, entertainment, health care, manufacturing, finance, security, transportation, and more. AI systems can help humans perform tasks faster, cheaper, safer, and more accurately.

Some of the questions that AI raises are: How can we ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and goals? How can we prevent AI systems from harming humans or other beings? How can we regulate and control AI systems? How can we distribute the benefits and costs of AI among different groups and individuals? How can we cope with the possible displacement of human workers by AI systems? How can we prevent AI systems from becoming hostile or surpassing human intelligence?\n\nThese are some of the topics that AI researchers, philosophers, policymakers, and other stakeholders are currently debating and exploring.

              "Artificial intelligence - Alan Turing, AI Beginnings | Britannica",
              "The earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the British logician and computer pioneer Alan Mathison Turing.",
              "In 1935 Turing described an abstract computing machine consisting of a limitless memory and a scanner that moves back and forth through the memory, symbol by symbol, reading what it finds and writing further symbols.",
              "The actions of the scanner are dictated by a program of instructions that also is stored in the memory in the form of symbols.",
              "This is Turing\u2019s stored-program concept, and implicit in it is the possibility of the machine operating on, and so modifying or improving, its own program.",
              "Turing\u2019s conception is now known simply as the universal Turing machine.",
              "All modern computers are in essence universal Turing machines.",
              "During World War II, Turing was a leading cryptanalyst at the Government Code and Cypher School in Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, England.",
              "Turing could not turn to the project of building a stored-program electronic computing machine until the cessation of hostilities in Europe in 1945.",
              "Nevertheless, during the war he gave considerable thought to the issue of machine intelligence.",
              "One of Turing\u2019s colleagues at Bletchley Park, Donald Michie (who later founded the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception at the University of Edinburgh), later recalled that Turing often discussed how computers could learn from experience as well as solve new problems through the use of guiding principles\u2014a process now known as heuristic problem solving.",
              "Turing gave quite possibly the earliest public lecture (London, 1947) to mention computer intelligence, saying, \u201cWhat we want is a machine that can learn from experience,\u201d and that the \u201cpossibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions provides the mechanism for this.",
              "\u201d In 1948 he introduced many of the central concepts of AI in a report entitled \u201cIntelligent Machinery.",
              "\u201d However, Turing did not publish this paper, and many of his ideas were later reinvented by others.",
              "For instance, one of Turing\u2019s original ideas was to train a network of artificial neurons to perform specific tasks, an approach described in the section Connectionism.",
              "At Bletchley Park, Turing illustrated his ideas on machine intelligence by reference to chess\u2014a useful source of challenging and clearly defined problems against which proposed methods for problem solving could be tested.",
              "In principle, a chess-playing computer could play by searching exhaustively through all the available moves, but in practice this is impossible because it would involve examining an astronomically large number of moves.",
              "Heuristics are necessary to guide a narrower, more discriminative search.",
              "Although Turing experimented with designing chess programs, he had to content himself with theory in the absence of a computer to run his chess program.",
              "The first true AI programs had to await the arrival of stored-program electronic digital computers.",
              "In 1945 Turing predicted that computers would one day play very good chess, and just over 50 years later, in 1997, Deep Blue, a chess computer built by IBM (International Business Machines Corporation), beat the reigning world champion, Garry Kasparov, in a six-game match.",
              "While Turing\u2019s prediction came true, his expectation that chess programming would contribute to the understanding of how human beings think did not.",
              "The huge improvement in computer chess since Turing\u2019s day is attributable to advances in computer engineering rather than advances in AI: Deep Blue\u2019s 256 parallel processors enabled it to examine 200 million possible moves per second and to look ahead as many as 14 turns of play.",
              "Many agree with Noam Chomsky, a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who opined that a computer beating a grandmaster at chess is about as interesting as a bulldozer winning an Olympic weightlifting competition."

              "By the 1950s, we had a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers with the concept of artificial intelligence (or AI) culturally assimilated in their minds.",
              "One such person was Alan Turing, a young British polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of artificial intelligence.",
              "Turing suggested that humans use available information as well as reason in order to solve problems and make decisions, so why can\u2019t machines do the same thing?",
              "This was the logical framework of his 1950 paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence in which he discussed how to build intelligent machines and how to test their intelligence.",

              "First, computers needed to fundamentally change.",
              "Before 1949 computers lacked a key prerequisite for intelligence: they couldn\u2019t store commands, only execute them.",
              "In other words, computers could be told what to do but couldn\u2019t remember what they did.",
              "Second, computing was extremely expensive.",
              "In the early 1950s, the cost of leasing a computer ran up to $200,000 a month.",
              "Only prestigious universities and big technology companies could afford to dillydally in these uncharted waters.",
              "A proof of concept as well as advocacy from high profile people were needed to persuade funding sources that machine intelligence was worth pursuing.",

              "In this historic conference, McCarthy, imagining a great collaborative effort, brought together top researchers from various fields for an open ended discussion on artificial intelligence, the term which he coined at the very event.",
              "Sadly, the conference fell short of McCarthy\u2019s expectations;",
              "people came and went as they pleased, and there was failure to agree on standard methods for the field.",

              "Computers could store more information and became faster, cheaper, and more accessible.",

              "Early demonstrations such as Newell and Simon\u2019s General Problem Solver and Joseph Weizenbaum\u2019s ELIZA showed promise toward the goals of problem solving and the interpretation of spoken language respectively.",
              "These successes, as well as the advocacy of leading researchers (namely the attendees of the DSRPAI) convinced government agencies such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to fund AI research at several institutions.",
              "The government was particularly interested in a machine that could transcribe and translate spoken language as well as high throughput data processing.",
              "Optimism was high and expectations were even higher.",
              "In 1970 Marvin Minsky told Life Magazine, \u201cfrom three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.",
              "\u201d However, while the basic proof of principle was there, there was still a long way to go before the end goals of natural language processing, abstract thinking, and self-recognition could be achieved.",
              "Breaching the initial fog of AI revealed a mountain of obstacles.",
              "The biggest was the lack of computational power to do anything substantial: computers simply couldn\u2019t store enough information or process it fast enough.",
              "In order to communicate, for example, one needs to know the meanings of many words and understand them in many combinations.",
              "Hans Moravec, a doctoral student of McCarthy at the time, stated that \u201ccomputers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence.",
              "\u201d As patience dwindled so did the funding, and research came to a slow roll for ten years.",
              "In the 1980\u2019s, AI was reignited by two sources: an expansion of the algorithmic toolkit, and a boost of funds.",
              "John Hopfield and David Rumelhart popularized \u201cdeep learning\u201d techniques which allowed computers to learn using experience.",
              "On the other hand Edward Feigenbaum introduced expert systems which mimicked the decision making process of a human expert.",
              "The program would ask an expert in a field how to respond in a given situation, and once this was learned for virtually every situation, non-experts could receive advice from that program.",
              "Expert systems were widely used in industries.",
              "The Japanese government heavily funded expert systems and other AI related endeavors as part of their Fifth Generation Computer Project (FGCP).",
              "From 1982-1990, they invested $400 million dollars with the goals of revolutionizing computer processing, implementing logic programming, and improving artificial intelligence.",
              "Unfortunately, most of the ambitious goals were not met.",
              "However, it could be argued that the indirect effects of the FGCP inspired a talented young generation of engineers and scientists.",
              "Regardless, funding of the FGCP ceased, and AI fell out of the limelight.",
              "Ironically, in the absence of government funding and public hype, AI thrived.",

              "In 1997, reigning world chess champion and grand master Gary Kasparov was defeated by IBM\u2019s Deep Blue, a chess playing computer program.",
              "This highly publicized match was the first time a reigning world chess champion loss to a computer and served as a huge step towards an artificially intelligent decision making program.",
              "In the same year, speech recognition software, developed by Dragon Systems, was implemented on Windows.",
              "This was another great step forward but in the direction of the spoken language interpretation endeavor.",
              "It seemed that there wasn\u2019t a problem machines couldn\u2019t handle.",

              "We haven\u2019t gotten any smarter about how we are coding artificial intelligence, so what changed?",
              "It turns out, the fundamental limit of computer storage that was holding us back 30 years ago was no longer a problem.",
              "Moore\u2019s Law, which estimates that the memory and speed of computers doubles every year, had finally caught up and in many cases, surpassed our needs.",
              "This is precisely how Deep Blue was able to defeat Gary Kasparov in 1997, and how Google\u2019s Alpha Go was able to defeat Chinese Go champion, Ke Jie, only a few months ago.",
              "It offers a bit of an explanation to the roller coaster of AI research;",
              "we saturate the capabilities of AI to the level of our current computational power (computer storage and processing speed), and then wait for Moore\u2019s Law to catch up again.",

              "Breakthroughs in computer science, mathematics, or neuroscience all serve as potential outs through the ceiling of Moore\u2019s Law.",
              "So what is in store for the future?",

              "We can also expect to see driverless cars on the road in the next twenty years (and that is conservative).",
              "In the long term, the goal is general intelligence, that is a machine that surpasses human cognitive abilities in all tasks.",
              "This is along the lines of the sentient robot we are used to seeing in movies.",
              "To me, it seems inconceivable that this would be accomplished in the next 50 years.",
              "Even if the capability is there, the ethical questions would serve as a strong barrier against fruition.",
              "When that time comes (but better even before the time comes), we will need to have a serious conversation about machine policy and ethics (ironically both fundamentally human subjects), but for now, we\u2019ll allow AI to steadily improve and run amok in society.",

              "Simon speculated in 1963 that the answers to both these questions was \"yes\".",
              "His evidence was the performance of programs he had co-written, such as Logic Theorist and the General Problem Solver, and his psychological research on human problem solving.",
              "[4] AI research in the 1950s and 60s had an enormous influence on intellectual history: it inspired the cognitive revolution, led to the founding of the academic field of cognitive science, and was the essential example in the philosophical theories of computationalism, functionalism and cognitivism in ethics and the psychological theories of cognitivism and cognitive psychology.",
              "The specific aspect of AI research that led to this revolution was what Haugeland called \"GOFAI\".",

              "This assumption is present in Plato and Aristotle, in Shakespeare, Hobbes, Hume and Locke, it was central to the Enlightenment, to the logical positivists of the 1930s and to the computationalists and cognitivists of the 1960s.",

              "Energy supplied by the dream of engineering a computer that can pass TT, or by controversy surrounding claims that it has already been passed, is if anything stronger than ever, and the reader has only to do an internet search via the string turing test passed to find up-to-the-minute attempts at reaching this dream, and attempts (sometimes made by philosophers) to debunk claims that some such attempt has succeeded.",
              "Returning to the issue of the historical record, even if one bolsters the claim that AI started at the 1956 conference by adding the proviso that \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 refers to a nuts-and-bolts engineering pursuit (in which case Turing\u2019s philosophical discussion, despite calls for a child machine, wouldn\u2019t exactly count as AI per se), one must confront the fact that Turing, and indeed many predecessors, did attempt to build intelligent artifacts.",
              "In Turing\u2019s case, such building was surprisingly well-understood before the advent of programmable computers: Turing wrote a program for playing chess before there were computers to run such programs on, by slavishly following the code himself.",
              "He did this well before 1950, and long before Newell (1973) gave thought in print to the possibility of a sustained, serious attempt at building a good chess-playing computer.",

              "[8] Turing predicted that his test would be passed by 2000, but the fireworks across the globe at the start of the new millennium have long since died down, and the most articulate of computers still can\u2019t meaningfully debate a sharp toddler.",

              "One reason is that while chess is generally considered to be well-understood from the formal-computational perspective (after all, it\u2019s well-known that there exists a perfect strategy for playing chess), in open-domain question-answering (QA), as in any significant natural-language processing task, there is no consensus as to what problem, formally speaking, one is trying to solve.",
              "Briefly, question-answering (QA) is what the reader would think it is: one asks a question of a machine, and gets an answer, where the answer has to be produced via some \u201csignificant\u201d computational process.",

              "It should be said that a common attitude among proponents of \u201cStrong\u201d AI is that CRA is not only unsound, but silly, based as it is on a fanciful story (CR) far removed from the practice of AI \u2013 practice which is year by year moving ineluctably toward sophisticated robots that will once and for all silence CRA and its proponents.",
              "For example, John Pollock (as we\u2019ve noted, philosopher and practitioner of AI) writes: To wrap up discussion of CRA, we make two quick points, to wit: Readers may wonder if there are philosophical debates that AI researchers engage in, in the course of working in their field (as opposed to when they might attend a philosophy conference).",
              "Surely, AI researchers have philosophical discussions amongst themselves, right?",
              "Generally, one finds that AI researchers do discuss among themselves topics in philosophy of AI, and these topics are usually the very same ones that occupy philosophers of AI.",
              "However, the attitude reflected in the quote from Pollock immediately above is by far the dominant one.",
              "That is, in general, the attitude of AI researchers is that philosophizing is sometimes fun, but the upward march of AI engineering cannot be stopped, will not fail, and will eventually render such philosophizing otiose.",

              "One of Lucas\u2019 indefatigable defenders is the physicist Roger Penrose, whose first attempt to vindicate Lucas was a Go\u0308delian attack on \u201cStrong\u201d AI articulated in his The Emperor\u2019s New Mind (1989).",
              "This first attempt fell short, and Penrose published a more elaborate and more fastidious Go\u0308delian case, expressed in Chapters 2 and 3 of his Shadows of the Mind (1994).",

              "Put crudely, the core idea in this attack is that human expertise is not based on the explicit, disembodied, mechanical manipulation of symbolic information (such as formulae in some logic, or probabilities in some Bayesian network), and that AI\u2019s efforts to build machines with such expertise are doomed if based on the symbolic paradigm.",

              "Needless to say, Philosophy of AI today involves much more than the three well-known arguments discussed above, and, inevitably, Philosophy of AI tomorrow will include new debates and problems we can\u2019t see now.",

              "Yet the origins of AI can also be traced to the contributions of researchers in previous years.",

              "It was at that time that the idea of \u200b\u200bthe human-machine analogy was born, that human intelligence could be simulated through the use of machines, an essential condition for the development of AI.",

              "If in previous centuries the conditions for the study of human intelligence and its possible artificializations were created with scientific and mathematical studies, it was only with the advent of the first electronic computers in the 1940s that this interest took a concrete path.",

              "In fact, Turing made a fundamental contribution to the success of the allies in Second World War: thanks to his collaboration with the British government, the code behind the Enigma device and the German military transmissions were cracked.",
              "With \u201cOn Computable Numbers, With An Application To The Entscheidungsproblem\u201d, written in 1936, he laid the foundation for concepts such as calculability, computability and the Turing machine.",

              "For the first time in history, today\u2019s concept of software was introduced.",
              "In 1950, Turing wrote the article \u201cComputing machinery and intelligence\u201d, in which he described what would become known as the \u201cTuring Test\u201d.",

              "Before the emergence of big data, AI was limited by the amount and quality of data that was available for training and testing machine learning algorithms. Natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision were two areas of AI that saw significant progress in the 1990s, but they were still limited by the amount of data that was available.",
              "For example, early NLP systems were based on hand-crafted rules, which were limited in their ability to handle the complexity and variability of natural language.",

              "These networks are made up of layers of interconnected nodes, each of which performs a specific mathematical function on the input data.",
              "The output of one layer serves as the input to the next, allowing the network to extract increasingly complex features from the data.",
              "One of the key advantages of deep learning is its ability to learn hierarchical representations of data.",
