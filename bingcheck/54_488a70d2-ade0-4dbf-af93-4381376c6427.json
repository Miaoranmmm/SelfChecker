              "Having the rendezvous radar on (so it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort) should have been irrelevant to the computer, but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions, depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up.",
              "The extra spurious cycle stealing, as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter, caused the computer alarms.[123] When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300-foot-diameter (91 m) crater (later determined to be West crater), so he took semi-automatic control.",
              "[124][125] Armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it, but could not since their horizontal velocity was too high.",

              "In other words, precision is a description of random errors, a measure of statistical variability.",
              "Accuracy has two definitions: In the first, more common definition of \"accuracy\" above, the concept is independent of \"precision\", so a particular set of data can be said to be accurate, precise, both, or neither.",
              "In simpler terms, given a statistical sample or set of data points from repeated measurements of the same quantity, the sample or set can be said to be accurate if their average is close to the true value of the quantity being measured, while the set can be said to be precise if their standard deviation is relatively small.",
              "In the fields of science and engineering, the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity's true value.",
              "[2] The precision of a measurement system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results.",
              "[2][3] Although the two words precision and accuracy can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.",
              "The field of statistics, where the interpretation of measurements plays a central role, prefers to use the terms bias and variability instead of accuracy and precision: bias is the amount of inaccuracy and variability is the amount of imprecision.",
              "A measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both.",
              "For example, if an experiment contains a systematic error, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy.",
