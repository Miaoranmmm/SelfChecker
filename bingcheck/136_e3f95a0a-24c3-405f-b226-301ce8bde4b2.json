    "query": "What is the evidence for extraterrestrial life, both in our own solar system and beyond, and how close are we to discovering it?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and complex question. The evidence for extraterrestrial life is not conclusive, but there are some intriguing findings that suggest the possibility of life beyond Earth. Some of the evidence includes:\n\n- The detection of **phosphine**, a gas that is associated with living organisms on Earth, in the upper clouds of **Venus**[^2^] [^1^]. This could indicate the presence of microbial life in the harsh environment of our neighboring planet.\n- The discovery of **exoplanets**, planets that orbit other stars, especially those that are in the **habitable zone**, where liquid water could exist on the surface[^3^]. Some of these planets, such as **Proxima Centauri b** and **TRAPPIST-1 e**, are similar in size and temperature to Earth and could potentially host life[^2^].\n- The observation of a mysterious **radio signal** coming from **Proxima Centauri**, the closest star to our own[^2^]. The signal shifted slightly while it was being observed, which could indicate the movement of a planet or an artificial source. However, this signal has not been confirmed or explained yet and could have a natural or human origin.\n- The exploration of **Mars**, which has shown evidence of past and present **water activity**, such as dried-up riverbeds, ice caps, and salty brines[^3^]. Water is essential for life as we know it, so Mars could have been or still be habitable for some forms of life.\n- The investigation of other **solar system bodies**, such as **Europa**, **Enceladus**, and **Titan**, which have subsurface oceans or lakes that could provide a suitable environment for life[^3^]. These icy moons are heated by tidal forces from their giant planets and could harbor hydrothermal vents or organic molecules that are conducive to life.\n\nHowever, none of these findings have proven the existence of extraterrestrial life beyond any doubt. There is still a lot of uncertainty and controversy about the interpretation and validity of these evidence. NASA and other space agencies are continuing to search for signs of life in the universe, using various methods such as telescopes, rovers, probes, and satellites[^5^]. They are also looking for possible signs of **intelligent life**, such as radio transmissions or megastructures, using projects like **SETI** (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)[^3^]. However, so far, no extraterrestrial life has been conclusively detected[^6^].\n\nThe question of how close we are to discovering extraterrestrial life is hard to answer, because it depends on many factors, such as how common life is in the universe, how diverse and detectable it is, how advanced our technology and methods are, and how much resources and time we devote to the search. Some scientists estimate that we could find evidence of microbial life within the next decade or two, while others think that we might never find it or that it might take centuries or millennia[^3^]. The discovery of intelligent life is even more uncertain and speculative, because it involves additional assumptions about the evolution and behavior of other civilizations[^3^].\n\nIn summary, there is some evidence for extraterrestrial life, but it is not conclusive or widely accepted. The search for extraterrestrial life is ongoing and challenging, but also exciting and rewarding. We don't know how close we are to discovering it, but we can hope that someday we will find out if we are alone in this vast universe or not.\ud83d\udc7d",

              "She typically focuses her attention on distant newborn planetary systems but wanted to test her molecular identification abilities on worlds within our cosmic backyard.",
              "In 2017 Greaves observed Venus with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, searching for bar code\u2013like patterns of lines in the planet\u2019s spectrum that would indicate the presence of different chemicals.",
              "While doing so, she noticed a line associated with phosphine.",
              "The data suggested the molecule was present at around 20 parts per billion in the planet\u2019s atmosphere, a concentration between 1,000 and a million times greater than that in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
              "\u201cI was stunned,\u201d Greaves says.",
              "Phosphine is a relatively simple molecule containing one phosphorus atom and three hydrogen atoms. It is known to reek of garlic or rotting fish, though by the time it reaches concentrations where humans can smell it, it is likely to cause lung damage.",
              "In the pilot episode of the series Breaking Bad, the character Walter White prepares phosphine gas to knock out two assailants who are threatening him.",
              "Yet making the substance is not as easy as seen on TV.",
              "Phosphorus and hydrogen \u201chate each other,\u201d says Clara Sousa-Silva, a molecular astrophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author of a study reporting the phosphine finding.",
              "\u201cHydrogen has much better stuff to do, and phosphorus would rather bond with oxygen.",
              "But if you throw enough energy at them, they can come together and be stable in some environments.",
              "\u201d The gas giants Jupiter and Saturn contain phosphine because they have hot interiors where it can be energetically favorable to produce the molecule.",
              "Venus\u2019s runaway greenhouse atmosphere, by contrast, is full of oxygen-containing chemicals such as carbon dioxide that would normally soak up phosphine\u2019s phosphorus.",
              "For the molecule to be present at any level, let alone the amounts Greaves was seeing, was a genuine head-scratcher.",
              "Meanwhile Sousa-Silva has built her career around studying phosphine\u2014she goes by the handle @DrPhosphine on Twitter\u2014predicting how it might appear in the atmosphere of a distant alien exoplanet.",
              "\u201cI was considering these exotic worlds light-years away\u2014super-Earths, tropical planets, sewage planets,\u201d she says.",
              "\u201cAnd the whole time, it was just here next door.",
              "\u201d The researchers and their colleagues made follow-up observations of Venus with the more powerful Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile last year, again detecting the atmospheric signature of phosphine.",
              "They then tried to come up with every possible reason for the strange molecule\u2019s existence, including volcanic activity, lightning strikes and even meteorites breaking up in the planet\u2019s atmosphere.",
              "\u201cI think the best routes we could find fell short by a factor of about 10,000,\u201d Greaves says.",
              "Of course, there might be additional pathways to making phosphine the team has not yet considered.",
              "But after exhausting their imaginations seeking out abiotic explanations, the researchers felt forced to acknowledge one other possibility in their paper, which appeared today in Nature Astronomy: the molecule could be made by life on Venus, just as life is the main way it manifests on Earth.",
              "Astrobiologists have long been enamored with Mars, a dry, rocky planet with conditions not all that dissimilar to those of Earth.",
              "More recently, they have become moonstruck by icy, potentially habitable worlds in the outer solar system, such as Saturn\u2019s geyser-spewing satellite Enceladus and Jupiter\u2019s oceanic moon Europa.",
              "But despite its drawbacks, Venus has not been entirely neglected by scientists speculating about life\u2019s extraterrestrial abodes.",
              "From 50 to 60 kilometers above the Venusian surface, there is an atmospheric layer with pressure equal to that of sea level on Earth and temperatures between zero and 50 degrees Celsius.",
              "If not for the sulfuric acid clouds, one might call this layer \u201chospitable.",
              "\u201d Even so, there are terrestrial organisms that will happily tolerate such extremely acidic conditions in hot springs or other environments.",
              "This relatively clement region is precisely the place where the phosphine has been found.",
              "Since the 1960s, astronomers have also noticed that Venus\u2019s clouds are not reflecting as much of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light as they should be: an unknown something in the atmosphere seems to be preferentially absorbing that light instead.",
              "This observation led the late astrobiologists Harold Morowitz and Carl Sagan to propose that energy-hungry photosynthetic organisms might be the culprit.",
              "Meanwhile other researchers have never stopped searching for alternative abiotic explanations.",
              "Recent evidence suggests that the planet is still geologically active.",
              "And a model released earlier this year showed that Venus might have had an ocean for nearly three billion years\u2014one that only disappeared a few hundred million years ago.",
              "Conceivably, life could have arisen on Venus when our sister world was much more Earth-like, only becoming airborne as the runaway greenhouse effect rendered the planet\u2019s surface uninhabitable.",
              "\u201cI\u2019ve always thought it\u2019s as plausible to have life in the clouds of Venus as to find it in the subsurface of Mars,\u201d says David Grinspoon, an astrobiologist at the Planetary Science Institute, who was not involved with the study.",
              "\u201cEach is an environment that could be habitable but isn\u2019t guaranteed to be.",
              "\u201d Yet an almost equally good case can be made for Venus\u2019s clouds being inimical to life as we know it.",
              "Microbes have been found floating around in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, but none are known to exclusively spend their entire life cycle there.",
              "All of them have to land eventually, and Venus\u2019s surface seems too inhospitable a place to make for a good reservoir.",
              "The Venusian area under consideration is also 50 times more arid than Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert, the driest place on our planet.",
              "And although it is true that living things have found good ways to thrive in aqueous environments tinged with traces of sulfuric acid, conditions on Earth\u2019s evil twin essentially reverse that formula: its cloud layer is mainly sulfuric acid with just a bit of water.",
              "Venus remains an underexplored place.",
              "\u201cDespite it being literally the planet next door, there are many mysteries that still need to be solved,\u201d Wong says.",
              "In order to rule out all nonliving explanations for the creation of phosphine, researchers will have to learn a great deal more about the planet itself, including its chemistry, geology and atmospheric physics, he adds.",
              "Another issue might be the detection of phosphine itself.",
              "Noisy ripples that make resolving any particular line somewhat challenging are superimposed on Venus\u2019s spectrum in the team\u2019s data.",
              "These wavy structures could mimic a phosphine signature, says Bruno Be\u0301zard, a spectroscopist at the Paris Observatory.",
              "\u201cI don\u2019t see a strong argument to say it\u2019s not a ripple,\u201d he says.",
              "Greaves counters that the odds of finding the same signal using two separate facilities, JCMT and ALMA, is statistically small.",
              "Nevertheless, she and her colleagues are hoping to do additional observations at other wavelengths, such as infrared, to further test their initial results.",
              "Making higher-resolution maps of where the phosphine appears and seeing if it exhibits any kind of seasonal variation could also help tie it to biological processes.",
              "In many ways, the unexpected finding appears analogous to the 1996 announcement of potential microscopic life in an ancient Martian meteorite designated Allan Hills 84001.",
              "Along with structures that looked like fossil bacteria, the sample contained an unusual form of iron crystals that appeared identical to those produced by microbial creatures on Earth.",
              "It took many years before researchers were able to figure out an inorganic explanation for those crystals.",
              "Although life did not pan out as an explanation in that case, \u201cit got everybody thinking, \u2018Well, why not?",
              "\u2019\u201d Grinspoon says.",
              "\u201cEverything we know about Mars is consistent with that possibility.",
              "That led to a huge movement and catalyzed astrobiology as a field.",
              "\u201d The phosphine finding might play a similar role in getting planetary scientists to pay more attention to Venus.",
              "In recent years, there has already been a contingent of researchers clamoring for more missions to our sister planet.",
              "Russia has proposed sending its Venera-D mission, which would include an orbiter and lander, to Venus as early as 2026.",
              "The European Space Agency similarly has the EnVision spacecraft on its drawing board, and it could reach its target in the next decade.",
              "NASA is currently considering proposals for two different Venus missions for funding under its Discovery Program: the orbiting VERITAS and DAVINCI+.",
              "The latter would fly the first probe through Venus\u2019s atmosphere since the Soviet Vega balloons in 1985.",
              "A selection is expected sometime next year.",
              "Any of these efforts, along with additional observations using telescopes on Earth, could help bolster or weaken the case for phosphine on Venus.",
              "Until then, many in the field are likely to reserve their full judgment.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s very speculative to say that there is life on Venus,\u201d Wong says.",
              "\u201cBut it\u2019s also speculative to say there definitely can\u2019t be life on Venus.",
              "\u201d For her part, Sousa-Silva is hoping the rest of the scientific community will subject her and her colleagues\u2019 methods and conclusions in the study to rigorous scrutiny.",
              "\u201cI\u2019m confident our models and data reduction are good, but I\u2019m still skeptical,\u201d she says.",
              "\u201cI expect the world to come and point out the mistakes I\u2019ve made.",
              "\u201d Such debates are important for science because similar conundrums are going to unfold every time someone claims evidence for life on a planet in our solar system or beyond, Sousa-Silva says.",
              "\u201cI think it\u2019s very hard to prove something like this,\u201d she adds.",
              "\u201cWe have an innate desire to find life, and then we have our own rational minds that say, \u2018None of this is sufficient evidence.",

              "New class of habitable exoplanets represent a big step forward in the ...",
              "A new class of exoplanet very different to our own, but which could support life, has been identified by astronomers, which could greatly accelerate the search for life outside our Solar System.",
              "In the search for life elsewhere, astronomers have mostly looked for planets of a similar size, mass, temperature and atmospheric composition to Earth.",
              "However, astronomers from the University of Cambridge believe there are more promising possibilities out there.",
              "The researchers have identified a new class of habitable planets, dubbed 'Hycean' planets -- hot, ocean-covered planets with hydrogen-rich atmospheres -- which are more numerous and observable than Earth-like planets.",
              "The researchers say the results, reported in The Astrophysical Journal, could mean that finding biosignatures of life outside our Solar System within the next two or three years is a real possibility.",
              "\"Hycean planets open a whole new avenue in our search for life elsewhere,\" said Dr Nikku Madhusudhan from Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy, who led the research.",
              "Many of the prime Hycean candidates identified by the researchers are bigger and hotter than Earth, but still have the characteristics to host large oceans that could support microbial life similar to that found in some of Earth's most extreme aquatic environments.",
              "These planets also allow for a far wider habitable zone, or 'Goldilocks zone', compared to Earth-like planets.",
              "This means that they could still support life even though they lie outside the range where a planet similar to Earth would need to be in order to be habitable.",
              "Thousands of planets outside our Solar System have been discovered since the first exoplanet was identified nearly 30 years ago.",
              "The vast majority are planets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune and are often referred to as 'super-Earths' or 'mini-Neptunes': they can be predominantly rocky or ice giants with hydrogen-rich atmospheres, or something in between.",
              "Most mini-Neptunes are over 1.",
              "6 times the size of Earth: smaller than Neptune but too big to have rocky interiors like Earth.",
              "Earlier studies of such planets have found that the pressure and temperature beneath their hydrogen-rich atmospheres would be too high to support life.",
              "However, a recent study on the mini-Neptune K2-18b by Madhusudhan's team found that in certain conditions these planets could support life.",
              "The result led to a detailed investigation into the full range of planetary and stellar properties for which these conditions are possible, which known exoplanets may satisfy those conditions, and whether their biosignatures may be observable.",
              "The investigation led the researchers to identify a new class of planets, Hycean planets, with massive planet-wide oceans beneath hydrogen-rich atmospheres.",
              "Hycean planets can be up to 2.",
              "6 times larger than Earth and have atmospheric temperatures up to nearly 200 degrees Celsius, but their oceanic conditions could be similar to those conducive for microbial life in Earth's oceans.",
              "Such planets also include tidally locked 'dark' Hycean worlds that may have habitable conditions only on their permanent night sides, and 'cold' Hycean worlds that receive little radiation from their stars.",
              "Planets of this size dominate the known exoplanet population, although they have not been studied in nearly as much detail as super-Earths.",
              "Hycean worlds are likely quite common, meaning that the most promising places to look for life elsewhere in the Galaxy may have been hiding in plain sight.",
              "However, size alone is not enough to confirm whether a planet is Hycean: other aspects such as mass, temperature and atmospheric properties are required for confirmation.",
              "When trying to determine what the conditions are like on a planet many light years away, astronomers first need to determine whether the planet lies in the habitable zone of its star, and then look for molecular signatures to infer the planet's atmospheric and internal structure, which govern the surface conditions, presence of oceans and potential for life.",
              "Astronomers also look for certain biosignatures which could indicate the possibility of life.",
              "Most often, these are oxygen, ozone, methane and nitrous oxide, which are all present on Earth.",
              "There are also a number of other biomarkers, such as methyl chloride and dimethyl sulphide, that are less abundant on Earth but can be promising indicators of life on planets with hydrogen-rich atmospheres where oxygen or ozone may not be as abundant.",
              "\"Essentially, when we've been looking for these various molecular signatures, we have been focusing on planets similar to Earth, which is a reasonable place to start,\" said Madhusudhan.",
              "\"But we think Hycean planets offer a better chance of finding several trace biosignatures.\"",
              "\"It's exciting that habitable conditions could exist on planets so different from Earth,\" said co-author Anjali Piette, also from Cambridge.",
              "Madhusudhan and his team found that a number of trace terrestrial biomarkers expected to be present in Hycean atmospheres would be readily detectable with spectroscopic observations in the near future.",
              "The larger sizes, higher temperatures and hydrogen-rich atmospheres of Hycean planets make their atmospheric signatures much more detectable than Earth-like planets.",
              "The Cambridge team identified a sizeable sample of potential Hycean worlds which are prime candidates for detailed study with next-generation telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which is due to be launched later this year.",
              "These planets all orbit red dwarf stars between 35-150 light years away: close by astronomical standards.",
              "Planned JWST observations of the most promising candidate, K2-18b, could lead to the detection of one or more biosignature molecules.",
              "\"A biosignature detection would transform our understanding of life in the universe,\" said Madhusudhan.",
              "\"We need to be open about where we expect to find life and what form that life could take, as nature continues to surprise us in often unimaginable ways.\"",

              "However, upon subsequent analysis, the vast majority of such hits usually turned out to be emissions from human technology here at Earth.",
              "Specifically, the researchers looked for radio signals that may have come from Proxima Centauri based on two main criteria.",
              "First, they looked at whether the signal was changing steadily in frequency over time.",
              "A transmitter on a distant planet is expected to move with respect to whatever telescope on Earth detects it, leading to a Doppler shift in frequency (akin to how ambulance sirens sound higher-pitched as the vehicle drives toward you and lower-pitched as it moves away).",
              "Rejecting hits with no such hints of motion reduced the number of hits from about 4.",
              "1 million to about 1 million.",
              "Second, the researchers determined whether the remaining hits appeared to come from the direction of Proxima Centauri.",
              "To determine this, the telescope pointed in the direction of the star and then pointed away, repeating this \"on-off\" pattern several times.",
              "A candidate technosignature should appear only in the \"on\" observation, when the telescope was looking toward the star, whereas local sources are expected to have both \"on\" and \"off\" observations.",
              "After scientists applied both these filters, they next visually inspected the remaining 5,160 candidates to weed out common mistakes.",
              "For example, sometimes a faint signal was actually visible in the \"off\" observations but was not quite strong enough for the automated data analysis software to detect.",
              "\"Searching for technosignatures is a rigorous and deliberative scientific endeavor that demands attention to detail and a high degree of skepticism,\" astrophysicist Andrew Siemion at the University of California, Berkeley, the principal investigator of Breakthrough Listen, told Space.",

              "This suggests BLC1 is similarly not a genuine technosignature.",
              "The scientists think BLC1 \"is most likely an extreme example of local interference, in the sense that its properties are very different from other interference and it thus could mimic a bonafide technosignature,\" Siemion said.",
              "\"The fact that it took us a number of months to conduct all the analysis necessary to allow us to draw a conclusion is evidence of the challenge this signal presented.\"",
              "Specifically, when it comes to BLC1 and its roughly 60 brethren, the signals are spaced at regular frequency intervals in the data, and these intervals appear to correspond to multiples of frequencies used by oscillators that are commonly used in various electronic devices, Sheikh explained.",
              "This suggests these signals come from human technology, although the scientists were unable to identify their precise source.",

              "[1][2][3] The apparent shift in its frequency, consistent with the Doppler effect, was suggested to be inconsistent with what would be caused by the movement of Proxima b, a planet of Proxima Centauri.",
              "[4][5] The Doppler shift in the signal was the opposite of what would be expected from the Earth's spin, in that the signal was observed to increase in frequency rather than decrease.",
              "[6] Although the signal was detected by Parkes Radio Telescope during observations of Proxima Centauri, due to the beam angle of Parkes Radio telescope, the signal would be more accurately described as having come from within a circle roughly 16 arcminutes (approximately 1/4 of a degree, half the angular width of Earth's moon) in angular diameter, containing Proxima Centauri,[6] so the signal could have originated elsewhere in the Alpha Centauri system.",
              "[7] The signal had a frequency of 982.",
              "002 MHz.",
              "[4] The radio signal was detected during 30 hours of observations conducted by Breakthrough Listen through the Parkes Observatory in Australia in April and May 2019.",
              "[8][9] As of December 2020, follow-up observations had failed to detect the signal again, a step necessary to confirm that the signal was a technosignature.",
              "[10] A paper by other astronomers released 10 days before the news report about BLC1 reports the detection of \"a bright, long-duration optical flare, accompanied by a series of intense, coherent radio bursts\" from Proxima Centauri also in April and May 2019.",
              "Their finding has not been put in direct relation to the BLC1 signal by scientists or media outlets as of January 2021 but implies that planets around Proxima Centauri and other red dwarfs are uninhabitable for humans and other currently known organisms.[11][12][13] In February 2021, a new study proposed that, as the probability of a radio-transmitting civilization emerging on the Sun's closest stellar neighbour was calculated to be approximately 10\u22128, the Copernican principle made BLC1 very unlikely to be a technological radio signal from the Alpha Centauri System.",

              "Where did Mars&#39;s liquid water go? A new theory holds fresh clues.",
              "Oceans\u2019 worth of ancient water may have been locked up in minerals in Mars's crust, increasing estimates for the total amount of that once flowed on the red planet.",
              "Today, Mars is a frigid desert.",
              "But dried up deltas and riverbanks reveal that water once flowed over the plant\u2019s surface.",
              "Where did it all go?",
              "Scientists have been trying to answer this question for decades, hoping to understand how Mars became an arid wasteland while its neighbor, Earth, kept hold of its water and became a biological paradise.",
              "Now, by plugging observations of the red planet into new models, a team of geologists and atmospheric scientists has come up with a new picture of Mars\u2019s past: Much of the planet\u2019s ancient water could have been trapped within minerals in the crust, where it remains to this day.",
              "Prior research suggested that most of Mars\u2019s water escaped into space as its atmosphere was stripped away by the sun\u2019s radiation.",
              "But this new study, published today in the journal Science and virtually presented at this year\u2019s Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, concludes that Mars\u2019s water experienced both an atmospheric exodus and a geologic entrapment.",
              "Depending on how much water you start with, the new model estimates that anywhere between 30 and 99 percent of it was incorporated into minerals in the planet\u2019s crust, while the remaining fraction escaped into space.",
              "It\u2019s a big range, and both processes likely played a role, so \u201csomewhere in there, the reality lies,\u201d says Briony Horgan, a planetary scientist at Purdue University who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
              "If the new model is accurate, then the story of the planet\u2019s adolescence needs a rewrite.",
              "All of the water thought to be trapped in the Martian crust today means that the planet had far more surface water in its youth than previous models had estimated\u2014and that early epoch may have been even more amiable to microbial life than previously thought.",
              "\u201cThis paper allows for the possibility of a once-blue Mars, even for a short period of time,\u201d says Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at North Carolina State University who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
              "A multitude of dried up riverbeds, deltas, lake basins, and inland seas make it clear that Mars once had a lot of water on its surface.",
              "It may have even had one or several different oceans in its northern hemisphere, although that\u2019s a matter of intense debate.",
              "Today, aside from a possible series of briny underground lakes and aquifers, most of Mars\u2019s water is locked up in the polar caps or in ice buried below the surface.",
              "By looking at the chemistry of Martian meteorites of various ages, and by using NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover to study ancient rocks and measure the current Martian atmosphere, scientists have been able to estimate how much surface water\u2014as ice, liquid water, or water vapor\u2014would have been present at various points throughout Mars\u2019s history.",
              "They think that during its earliest epochs, if all that water were in liquid form, it could cover the whole planet in a shallow ocean 150 to 800 feet deep.",
              "Mars had a more substantial atmosphere in the past, and its pressure allowed liquid water to exist on the surface.",
              "But work using NASA\u2019s MAVEN orbiter found that much the planet\u2019s atmosphere was stripped away by the solar wind\u2014charged particles streaming from the sun\u2014perhaps just 500 million years after Mars formed.",
              "The reasons why are not clear, although the early loss of the planet\u2019s protective magnetic field probably played a critical role.",
              "Either way, this atmospheric annihilation vaporized around 90 percent of Mars\u2019s surface water, leaving the water vapor to be broken up by ultraviolet radiation and making Mars a dehydrated wasteland.",
              "At least, that\u2019s how the story goes.",
              "But it has some plot holes.",
              "The fate of the planet\u2019s ancient water was previously estimated based on the types of hydrogen found in Mars\u2019s present atmosphere.",
              "As water vapor in the air is bombarded by ultraviolet radiation from the sun, hydrogen gets stripped away from the oxygen in water molecules.",
              "Being a light gas, that free hydrogen easily escapes into space.",
              "Some of the water vapor, however, contains a heavier version of hydrogen called deuterium, which is more likely to remain in the atmosphere.",
              "Scientists know what the natural ratio of hydrogen and deuterium should be on Mars, so the amount of deuterium left behind can be used to determine how much of the lighter version was once present on the planet.",
              "Deuterium therefore acts as a ghostly fingerprint that reveals the amount of past water that ultimately escaped into space.",
              "Hydrogen is still escaping from Mars today, and scientists can measure the rate to work out how much water is being permanently lost.",
              "If this rate held steady over the past 4.",
              "5 billion years, it would be nowhere near enough to explain the disappearance of so much surface water, says lead author of the new study Eva Linghan Scheller, a doctoral student at Caltech.",
              "Another clue came courtesy of all the orbiters and rovers examining Mars\u2019s rocks.",
              "Over the past two decades, a lot of water-bearing minerals have been discovered, including plenty of clays.",
              "At first, only patches were found here and there.",
              "But today, \u201cwe see evidence for a huge volume of hydrated minerals on the surface,\u201d Horgan says.",
              "All those extremely old hydrated minerals suggest that, long ago, plenty of water was flowing across the ancient Martian soil\u2014much more than the atmospheric deuterium signal indicated.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s taken a while to find all the hydrated mineral exposures that we have found, and then to fully acknowledge their importance on a global scale,\u201d says Kirsten Siebach, a planetary scientist at Rice University who wasn\u2019t involved with the work.",
              "One problem was that previous models didn\u2019t adequately take into account the crust\u2019s ability to lock up water inside minerals, Scheller says.",
              "She and her colleagues decided to make a new model to estimate where Mars\u2019s water went over its entire 4.",
              "5-billion-year lifetime.",
              "The model makes some assumptions, such as how much water Mars had to begin with, how much was delivered later by watery asteroids and icy comets, how much was lost to space over time, and how much volcanic activity deposited more water onto the planet\u2019s surface.",
              "Depending on the values of those variables, the team found that Mars could once have had enough surface water to make a global ocean 330 to 4,900 feet deep.",
              "Between 4.",
              "1 and 3.",
              "7 billion years ago, the amount of surface water decreased significantly as it was soaked up by minerals in the crust and as it escaped into space.",
              "None of the hydrated minerals found so far have been younger than three billion years, Scheller says, which implies that Mars has been an arid wasteland for most of its lifetime.",
              "The new model has its limits, with some key details remaining fuzzy.",
              "But it is an important step that \u201cwill surely assist many future investigations about the history of water on Mars,\u201d says Geronimo Villanueva, a planetary scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
              "For one thing, it helps address a discrepancy between the amount of water estimated by the deuterium measurements and the myriad water features that have been left on the surface.",
              "It wasn\u2019t clear how so many rivers and lakes could emerge from so little water, Siebach says, but this new model offers a solution to that mystery by identifying additional water that could have been present on Mars.",
              "However, the research doesn\u2019t change how much water scientists think is available on Mars today\u2014which isn\u2019t much at all.",
              "Astronauts may one day bake hydrated minerals on Mars to unleash their water, Horgan says, but that would be an energy-intensive process.",
              "\u201cWhat this study does is that it says you have more water to play with early in Mars\u2019s history, and that\u2019s when Mars was most habitable,\u201d Siebach says.",
              "Microbes, if they ever existed, may have spread through all that available water, but they would have struggled to survive by the time most of it vanished three billion years ago.",
              "The idea that a significant volume of water can vanish into the crust also has implications for other rocky worlds, says Byrne of North Carolina State University.",
              "Water binds to Earth\u2019s minerals, too.",
              "But on our planet, plate tectonics recycles these minerals, constantly unleashing their water through volcanic eruptions, Siebach says.",
              "By contrast, Mars\u2019s stagnant crust may have doomed the planet to become a bitterly cold desert.",
              "Did the same world-changing process happen on Venus?",
              "Does water end up locked in the crust of exoplanets far from our solar system?",
              "Scott King, a planetary scientist at Virginia Tech who wasn\u2019t involved with the work, says that the model paves the way for an even richer understanding of how Mars and other rocky worlds evolve through the ages.",
              "\u201cNow,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s a whole wealth of new questions that can be asked and thought about.",

              "Hope for present-day Martian groundwater dries up in new study",
              "Liquid water previously detected under Mars' ice-covered south pole is probably just a dusty mirage, according to a new study of the red planet led by researchers at The University of Texas at Austin.",
              "Scientists in 2018 had thought they were looking at liquid water when they saw bright radar reflections under the polar cap.",
              "However, the new study published Jan.",
              "24 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found that the reflections matched those of volcanic plains found all over the red planet's surface.",
              "The researchers think their conclusion -- volcanic rock buried under ice -- is a more plausible explanation for the 2018 discovery, which was already in question after scientists calculated the unlikely conditions needed to keep water in a liquid state at Mars' cold, arid south pole.",
              "\"For water to be sustained this close to the surface, you need both a very salty environment and a strong, locally generated heat source, but that doesn't match what we know of this region,\" said the study's lead author, Cyril Grima, a planetary scientist at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG).",
              "The south polar mirage dissolved when Grima added an imaginary global ice sheet across a radar map of Mars.",
              "The imaginary ice showed how Mars' terrains would appear when looked at through a mile of ice, allowing scientists to compare features across the entire planet with those under the polar cap.",
              "Grima noticed bright reflections, just like those seen in the south pole but scattered across all latitudes.",
              "In as many as could be confirmed, they matched the location of volcanic plains.",
              "On Earth, iron-rich lava flows can leave behind rocks that reflect radar in a similar way.",
              "Other possibilities include mineral deposits in dried riverbeds.",
              "Either way, Grima said, figuring out what they are could answer important questions about Mars' history.",
              "Although there may not be liquid water trapped under the southern polar cap, there is plenty of water ice on Mars, including in the thick polar caps.",
              "In fact, the new study hints at Mars' wetter past.",
              "Isaac Smith, a Mars geophysicist at York University, believes the bright radar signatures are a kind of clay made when rock erodes in water.",
              "In 2021, Smith, who was not part of either study, found that Earth-based clays reflected radar brightly, just like the bright spots in the 2018 south pole study.",
              "\"I think the beauty of Grima's finding is that while it knocks down the idea there might be liquid water under the planet's south pole today, it also gives us really precise places to go look for evidence of ancient lakes and riverbeds and test hypotheses about the wider drying out of Mars' climate over billions of years,\" he said.",
              "Grima's map is based on three years of data from MARSIS, a radar instrument launched in 2005 aboard the European Space Agency's Mars Express that has accumulated tremendous amounts of information about Mars.",
              "Grima and co-author Je\u0301re\u0301mie Mouginot, a research scientist at the Institute of Environmental Geosciences in Grenoble, France, plan to dig further into the data to see what else MARSIS can turn up about Mars.",
              "For Smith, the study is a sobering lesson on the scientific process that is as relevant to Earth as it is to Mars.",
              "\"Science isn't foolproof on the first try,\" said Smith, who is an alumnus of the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT Austin.",
              "\"That's especially true in planetary science where we're looking at places no one's ever visited and relying on instruments that sense everything remotely.\"",
              "Grima and Smith are now working on proposed missions to find water on Mars with radar, both as a resource for future human landing sites and to search for signs of past life.",
              "The current study was partially funded by NASA and CNES, the French national space agency.",

              "8 min read Astronomers searching the atmospheres of alien worlds for gases that might be produced by life can\u2019t rely on the detection of just one type, such as oxygen, ozone, or methane, because in some cases these gases can be produced non-biologically, according to extensive simulations by researchers in the NASA Astrobiology Institute\u2019s Virtual Planetary Laboratory.",
              "The researchers carefully simulated the atmospheric chemistry of alien worlds devoid of life thousands of times over a period of more than four years, varying the atmospheric compositions and star types.",
              "\u201cWhen we ran these calculations, we found that in some cases, there was a significant amount of ozone that built up in the atmosphere, despite there not being any oxygen flowing into the atmosphere,\u201d said Shawn Domagal-Goldman of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.",
              "\u201cThis has important implications for our future plans to look for life beyond Earth.",
              "\u201d Methane is a carbon atom bound to four hydrogen atoms. On Earth, much of it is produced biologically (flatulent cows are a classic example), but it can also be made inorganically;",
              "for example, volcanoes at the bottom of the ocean can release the gas after it is produced by reactions of rocks with seawater.",
              "Ozone and oxygen were previously thought to be stronger biosignatures on their own.",
              "Ozone is three atoms of oxygen bound together.",
              "On Earth, it is produced when molecular oxygen (two oxygen atoms) and atomic oxygen (a single oxygen atom) combine, after the atomic oxygen is created by other reactions powered by sunlight or lightning.",
              "Life is the dominant source of the molecular oxygen on our planet, as the gas is produced by photosynthesis in plants and microscopic, single-cell organisms. Because life dominates the production of oxygen, and oxygen is needed for ozone, both gases were thought to be relatively strong biosignatures.",
              "But this study demonstrated that both molecular oxygen and ozone can be made without life when ultraviolet light breaks apart carbon dioxide (a carbon atom bound to two oxygen atoms).",
              "Their research suggests this non-biological process could create enough ozone for it to be detectable across space, so the detection of ozone by itself would not be a definitive sign of life.",
              "\u201cHowever, our research strengthens the argument that methane and oxygen together, or methane and ozone together, are still strong signatures of life,\u201d said Domagal-Goldman.",
              "\u201cWe tried really, really hard to make false-positive signals for life, and we did find some, but only for oxygen, ozone, or methane by themselves.",

              "The same goes for methane and oxygen.",
              "If both are seen together in an atmosphere, the methane was freshly delivered because the oxygen will be part of a network of reactions that will consume the methane.",
              "You know the methane is being replenished.",
              "The best way to replenish methane in the presence of oxygen is with life.",
              "The opposite is true, as well.",
              "In order to keep the oxygen around in an atmosphere that has a lot of methane, you have to replenish the oxygen, and the best way to do that is with life.",
              "\u201d Scientists have used computer models to simulate the atmospheric chemistry on planets beyond our solar system (exoplanets) before, and the team used a similar model in its research.",
              "However, the researchers also developed a program to automatically compute the calculations thousands of times, so they could see the results with a wider range of atmospheric compositions and star types.",
              "In doing these simulations, the team made sure they balanced the reactions that could put oxygen molecules in the atmosphere with the reactions that might remove them from the atmosphere.",
              "For example, oxygen can react with iron on the surface of a planet to make iron oxides;",
              "this is what gives most red rocks their color.",
              "A similar process has colored the dust on Mars, giving the Red Planet its distinctive hue.",
              "Calculating the appearance of a balanced atmosphere is important because this balance would allow the atmosphere to persist for geological time scales.",
              "Given that planetary lifetimes are measured in billions of years, it\u2019s unlikely astronomers will happen by chance to be observing a planet during a temporary surge of oxygen or methane lasting just thousands or even millions of years.",
              "It was important to make the calculations for a wide variety of cases, because the non-biological production of oxygen is subject to both the atmospheric and stellar environment of the planet.",
              "If there are a lot of gases that consume oxygen, such as methane or hydrogen, then any oxygen or ozone produced will be destroyed in the atmosphere.",
              "However, if the amount of oxygen-consuming gases is vanishingly small, the oxygen and the ozone might stick around for a while.",
              "Likewise, the production and destruction of oxygen, ozone, and methane is driven by chemical reactions powered by light, making the type of star important to consider as well.",
              "Different types of stars produce the majority of their light at specific colors.",
              "For example, massive, hot stars or stars with frequent explosive activity produce more ultraviolet light.",
              "\u201cIf there is more ultraviolet light hitting the atmosphere, it will drive these photochemical reactions more efficiently,\u201d said Domagal-Goldman.",
              "\u201cMore specifically, different colors (or wavelengths) of ultraviolet light can affect oxygen and ozone production and destruction in different ways.",
              "\u201d Astronomers detect molecules in exoplanet atmospheres by measuring the colors of light from the star the exoplanet is orbiting.",
              "As this light passes through the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, some of it is absorbed by atmospheric molecules.",
              "Different molecules absorb different colors of light, so astronomers use these absorption features as unique \u201csignatures\u201d of the type and quantity of molecules present.",
              "\u201cOne of the main challenges in identifying life signatures is to distinguish between the products of life and those compounds generated by geological processes or chemical reactions in the atmosphere.",
              "For that we need to understand not only how life may change a planet but how planets work and the characteristics of the stars that host such worlds\u201d, said Segura.",
              "The team plans to use this research to make recommendations about the requirements for future space telescopes designed to search exoplanet atmospheres for signs of alien life.",
              "\u201cContext is key \u2013 we can\u2019t just look for oxygen, ozone, or methane alone,\u201d says Domagal-Goldman.",
              "\u201cTo confirm life is making oxygen or ozone, you need to expand your wavelength range to include methane absorption features.",
              "Ideally, you\u2019d also measure other gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide [a molecule with one carbon atom and one oxygen atom].",
              "So we\u2019re thinking very carefully about the issues that could trip us up and give a false-positive signal, and the good news is by identifying them, we can create a good path to avoid the issues false positives could cause.",

              "Sometimes even life on Earth can seem alien, such as \u201cextremophile\u201d organisms. This is a class of organism, mostly microbes, that live in extremely harsh environments where life is impossible for other living creatures.",

              "These stars have much longer lifetimes, so there is more time for life to start up and evolution has more time to develop complicated life forms. The first project for JWST is to look at an exoplanet system called TRAPPIST-1, which is 40 light years away from us.",
              "This consists of seven rocky Earth-sized planets in orbit around a cool red dwarf star.",

              "Such missions could conceivably find evidence of extraterrestrial in the not-too-distant future.",
              "NASA Relatively soon, some prominent astrobiologists say, we will most likely have either found compelling evidence for extraterrestrial life or banished its possible existence to the ever shrinking edges of the cosmos beyond the rapidly expanding reach of our observations.",
              "Such answers could come by the end of the 2030s from any of a number of initiatives ardently seeking alien life.",
              "By then, samples from Mars will have arrived back on Earth, perhaps containing concrete proof that the Red Planet once harbored organisms or still does today.",
              "Spacecraft at Jupiter\u2019s Europa and Saturn\u2019s Titan will be scouring both moons for signs of life residing in each world\u2019s subsurface ocean or, in the case of Titan, on the surface itself.",
              "And advanced telescopes on the ground and in space should be probing the atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets around nearby stars, looking for any that share the same biology-infused cocktail of gases as our own living Earth.",
              "As confident as astrobiologists may be that their quest will soon bear fruit, however, they are far less certain of how to communicate that success if and when it occurs.",
              "How should they go about informing the world that we are truly not alone in this universe\u2014especially given their field\u2019s long, troubled history of dubious claims and false alarms?",
              "They have been fooled before, after all.",
              "In an October 2021 article published in Nature, a group of scientists came to grips with the problem.",
              "Led by NASA\u2019s chief scientist James Green, the researchers proposed a new framework to help verify and then communicate the detection of biosignatures beyond Earth, like the Torino scale for assessing the danger of asteroids.",
              "Their idea is to use a scale, from level 1 to level 7, that will allow confidence in any given case to be gradually increased.",
              "Known as the \u201cconfidence of life detection,\u201d or CoLD, scale, it calls initially for simple confirmation that a result is not linked to contamination or some obviously abiotic origin, whereas its final levels would represent robust follow-up observations solidifying a link to life.",
              "\u201cThese things are complex,\u201d Green says.",
              "\u201cBut we really need to be able to communicate it simply.",

              "\u201c[It\u2019s] all the more reason to communicate effectively.",
              "\u201d More recently, the supposed detection on Venus of atmospheric phosphine, a possible biosignature gas, had many suggesting a biological origin, but that detection has itself since been called into question.",
              "More outlandish ideas, such as the suggestion that the interstellar object \u2018Oumuamua found in our solar system in 2017 may have been an alien spacecraft rather than an asteroid or comet, have been met with widespread disdain from scientists and have the potential to dampen confidence in genuine detections of life.",
              "The CoLD scale could prevent scientists from \u201ccrying wolf\u201d in this manner, Green says, because any overly cavalier claims would not pass the more stringent tests required to progress up the scale.",
              "\u201cLife-detection measurements can be sensationalized,\u201d he says.",
              "Deciding how to approach actual detections of biosignatures is a topic other scientists have been considering, too.",

              "Hundreds of scientists took part, with many in favor of more rigorous communications protocols.",
              "\u201cThe potential for us to actually have some sort of interesting life-detection event on another world is becoming greater,\u201d says the workshop\u2019s co-chair Heather Graham of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.",

              "\u201d If scientists were to adopt the CoLD scale, the first of its seven steps, or levels, would be the actual detection of a potential biosignature.",
              "Next, scientists would need to rule out contamination before demonstrating how the signal could be biological in origin.",
              "Nonbiological sources would then need to be ruled out, followed by an independent additional detection of a similar biosignature.",
              "Further observations would need to rule out nonbiological ideas before, finally, follow-up observations showed other examples of biological activity in the same environment, making a detection a level 7\u2014essentially, proof of alien life.",
              "Part of the hope is that the scientific community at large would agree to use such a scale.",
              "Agencies such as NASA might also agree to do so, which would also help dictate future missions.",
              "\u201cIf we\u2019re stuck at level 4, and we think we can go to level 6 with a mission, I want to fund that,\u201d Green says.",
              "Ultimately, once use of a scale such as CoLD became ubiquitous, reviewers of journal papers could require authors to include it in any claim of biosignature detection.",
              "\u201cOne of the things we discussed at the workshop was: How do we incentivize people to use this?",

              "\u201cThe bottom line is that if we don\u2019t have such a scale, then people won\u2019t use it.",
              "\u201d The call for such a step-based approach is driven by the unescapable likelihood that any initial detection of alien life is likely to be ambiguous rather than a smoking gun: any glaringly obvious indication of alien life would have been clear by now, decades into the hunt.",
              "So more subtle searches based on circumstantial evidence are coming to the fore.",

              "Previous missions\u2014as well as telescopes on Earth\u2014have found evidence for occasional bursts of the gas suffusing Mars\u2019s atmosphere.",
              "On our planet, methane is replenished by biological activity, and Perseverance\u2019s samples could reveal such activity if the same is true on Mars.",
              "Currently on the CoLD scale, methane on Mars would rank at \u201cabout a [level] 4,\u201d Green says.",
              "But if Perseverance\u2019s sample is found to contain not only methane but methane rich in an isotope called carbon 12, that could change.",
              "\u201cLife loves carbon 12,\u201d Green says.",
              "\u201cIf all the methane in this tube is carbon 12, we just increased our CoLD level by one.",
              "\u201d The next step would be to fly across the surface\u2014with a drone like Perseverance\u2019s Ingenuity but bigger\u2014to localize the methane to a source that could be directly investigated.",
              "Outside of Mars, both Europa and Titan are promising locations to look for life because of their extensive subsurface oceans and, in the case of the latter, a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid hydrocarbons.",
              "But any evidence found at the two moons is also likely to require careful analysis.",
              "Europa will be studied by NASA\u2019s Europa Clipper mission from 2030 and the European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA\u2019s) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission in 2031, while Titan will play host to a robotic drone\u2014NASA\u2019s Dragonfly\u2014by the mid-2030s.",
              "Madeline Garner, a graduate student at Montana State University, is currently investigating whether an instrument could be designed for robotic spaceflight that could identify the existence of DNA and RNA on these and other alien worlds.",
              "\u201cCurrently there\u2019s no known abiotic source\u201d for DNA and RNA, Garner says.",
              "Her research into solid-state nanopore technology, now in use on the International Space Station to sequence DNA, could provide a conclusive detection capability for space probes.",

              "Beyond our solar system, scientists are preparing for a new era of exoplanet studies that could reveal tentative evidence for life on other worlds.",

              "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a clear detection of a rocky planet in the so-called habitable zone of a solarlike star,\u201d says Heike Rauer, head of the Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center.",
              "PLATO will aim to address that.",
              "\u201cThe best case will be a real Earth twin: a planet like Earth\u2019s mass and size the same distance from a star like our sun,\u201d Rauer says.",
              "If or when such worlds are found, sophisticated orbital observatories now being discussed\u2014beyond the realm of NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, which launched in December 2021\u2014could lavish them with deeper scrutiny.",
              "Such telescopes could include a multibillion-dollar project being considered by NASA, perhaps launching in the 2040s, that could directly image Earth-like planets around sunlike stars, crudely sniffing their atmospheres for signs of habitability and life and even mapping their surfaces.",
              "\u201cWe could see when the oceans are underneath us versus the continents and potentially a forest signature on the land surfaces,\u201d says Shawn Domagal-Goldman, supervisor of the Planetary Environments Laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.",
