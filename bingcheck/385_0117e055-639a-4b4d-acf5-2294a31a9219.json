    "query": "What is the most significant breakthrough in medicine or medical technology that has the potential to revolutionize healthcare in the next decade, and how could it impact patient outcomes and the healthcare industry as a whole?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and broad question. There are many potential breakthroughs in medicine or medical technology that could have a huge impact on healthcare in the next decade, but here are some of the most promising ones according to various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^]:\n\n- **Single cell analysis**: This technology will allow scientists to study individual cells in their normal environment for the first time, revealing how they interact with each other and respond to different stimuli. This could lead to new insights into how diseases develop and spread, as well as how to target them more effectively with personalized therapies[^2^].\n- **Brain mapping**: The human brain is still largely a mystery, but advances in neuroimaging and neurotechnology will enable researchers to map the circuits responsible for various functions and behaviors, such as motor control, vision, memory and emotion. This could open up new possibilities for treating neurological disorders, enhancing cognitive abilities and understanding human nature[^2^].\n- **Regenerative medicine**: This field aims to repair or replace damaged or diseased tissues and organs using stem cells, gene editing, tissue engineering and artificial organs. This could revolutionize transplantation, wound healing, organ function and lifespan[^1^] [^2^].\n- **Precision medicine**: This approach tailors medical treatments to the individual characteristics of each patient, such as their genes, environment and lifestyle. This could improve the effectiveness and safety of therapies, reduce side effects and costs, and prevent diseases before they occur[^1^] [^2^] [^4^].\n- **Immunotherapy**: This type of therapy harnesses the power of the body's own immune system to fight cancer and other diseases. It involves stimulating or modifying immune cells to recognize and attack abnormal cells, or introducing synthetic antibodies or immune cells that can do the same. This could offer a more targeted and less toxic alternative to chemotherapy and radiation[^1^] [^2^].\n- **Artificial intelligence**: AI is transforming healthcare by enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis, analysis, prediction and decision making. It can also assist doctors and patients with tasks such as monitoring, treatment planning, drug discovery and personalized care. AI could improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare, reduce errors and costs, and discover new insights from massive amounts of data[^1^] [^3^] [^4^].\n- **Digital health**: This term encompasses various technologies that use digital platforms to deliver or enhance healthcare services, such as telemedicine, mobile health apps, wearable devices, remote monitoring and online consultations. These technologies could increase the convenience, efficiency and affordability of healthcare, especially for people who live in remote areas or have limited access to healthcare facilities[^1^] [^3^].\n- **Smart pills**: These are pills that contain sensors or microchips that can communicate with external devices or systems. They can be used to monitor medication adherence, track vital signs, deliver drugs at specific times or locations in the body, or stimulate nerves or muscles. They could improve patient compliance, outcomes and safety[^1^].\n\nThese are just some examples of the medical breakthroughs that could change healthcare in the next decade. Of course, there are many challenges and uncertainties involved in developing and implementing these technologies, such as ethical issues, regulatory hurdles, social acceptance and cost-effectiveness. However, if these breakthroughs can overcome these barriers and reach their full potential, they could have a profound impact on patient outcomes and the healthcare industry as a whole.",

              "Before the discovery of heterogeneity, single-cell analysis mainly referred to the analysis or manipulation of an individual cell in a bulk population of cells at a particular condition using optical or electronic microscope.",
              "[5] To date, due to the heterogeneity seen in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell populations, analyzing a single cell makes it possible to discover mechanisms not seen when studying a bulk population of cells.",
              "[6] Technologies such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) allow the precise isolation of selected single cells from complex samples, while high throughput single cell partitioning technologies,[7][8][9] enable the simultaneous molecular analysis of hundreds or thousands of single unsorted cells;",
              "this is particularly useful for the analysis of transcriptome variation in genotypically identical cells, allowing the definition of otherwise undetectable cell subtypes.",

              "Single-cell genomics is heavily dependent on increasing the copies of DNA found in the cell so there is enough to be sequenced.",
              "This has led to the development of strategies for whole genome amplification (WGA).",
              "Currently WGA strategies can be grouped into three categories: The Adapter Linker PCR WGA is reported in many comparative studies to be best performing for diploid single cell mutation analysis, thanks to its very low Allelic Dropout effect,[24][25][26] and for copy number variation profiling due to its low noise, both with aCGH and with NGS low Pass Sequencing.",
              "[27][28] This method is only applicable to human cells, both fixed and unfixed.",
              "One widely adopted WGA techniques is called degenerate oligonucleotide\u2013primed polymerase chain reaction (DOP-PCR).",
              "This method uses the well established DNA amplification method PCR to try and amplify the entire genome using a large set of primers.",
              "Although simple, this method has been shown to have very low genome coverage.",
              "An improvement on DOP-PCR is Multiple displacement amplification (MDA), which uses random primers and a high fidelity enzyme, usually \u03a629 DNA polymerase, to accomplish the amplification of larger fragments and greater genome coverage than DOP-PCR.",
              "Despite these improvement MDA still has a sequence dependent bias (certain parts of the genome are amplified more than others because of their sequence).",
              "The method shown to largely avoid the bias seen in DOP-PCR and MDA is Multiple Annealing and Looping\u2013Based Amplification Cycles (MALBAC).",
              "Bias in this system is reduced by only copying off the original DNA strand instead of making copies of copies.",
              "The main draw backs to using MALBA, is it has reduced accuracy compared to DOP-PCR and MDA due to the enzyme used to copy the DNA.",
              "[11] Once amplified using any of the above techniques, the DNA can be sequenced using Sanger or next-generation sequencing (NGS).",
              "There are two major applications to studying the genome at the single cell level.",
              "One application is to track the changes that occur in bacterial populations, where phenotypic differences are often seen.",
              "These differences are missed by bulk sequencing of a population, but can be observed in single cell sequencing.",
              "[29] The second major application is to study the genetic evolution of cancer.",
              "Since cancer cells are constantly mutating it is of great interest to see how cancers evolve at the genetic level.",
              "These patterns of somatic mutations and copy number aberration can be observed using single cell sequencing.",
              "[2] Single-cell transcriptomics uses sequencing techniques similar to single cell genomics or direct detection using fluorescence in situ hybridization.",
              "The first step in quantifying the transcriptome is to convert RNA to cDNA using reverse transcriptase so that the contents of the cell can be sequenced using NGS methods as was done in genomics.",
              "Once converted, there is not enough cDNA to be sequenced so the same DNA amplification techniques discussed in single cell genomics are applied to the cDNA to make sequencing possible.",
              "[2] Alternately, fluorescent compounds attached to RNA hybridization probes are used to identify specific sequences and sequential application of different RNA probes will build up a comprehensive transcriptome.",
              "[30][31] The purpose of single cell transcriptomics is to determine what genes are being expressed in each cell.",
              "The transcriptome is often used to quantify the gene expression instead of the proteome because of the difficulty currently associated with amplifying protein levels.",
              "[2] There are three major reasons gene expression has been studied using this technique: to study gene dynamics, RNA splicing, and cell typing.",
              "Gene dynamics are usually studied to determine what changes in gene expression affect different cell characteristics.",
              "For example, this type of transcriptomic analysis has often been used to study embryonic development.",

              "Third, the literature indicates that Mu\u0308ller glial cells are the major glial component of the retina, which is one of the last retinal cell types to be born during development [67, 68].",
              "Mu\u0308ller glia are the only cells to span all retinal layers and have processes that contact neighboring neurons and form part of the outer and inner limiting membranes.",

              "for instance, work by Weber et al.",
              "found that simply filtering for \u201ccomplete\u201d EHRs, a common strategy for managing missing data, introduced a bias toward older patients who were more likely female (50).",

              "With respect to modeling mechanics, the non-linearities, extensive interactions among variables, and difficulties interpreting how ML models arrived at their results, ML also presents many new challenges to addressing sources of inadvertent bias that differ from classifiers that enforce linear models of independent variables in smaller, more manageable datasets.",

              "Similarly, understanding principles of normal variants of anatomy and physiology, followed by an examination of pathophysiologic variants, presents students with a model-based rubric in which to incorporate each new wave of information learned through personal experience as well as throughout the medical literature.",
              "This paradigm has also permitted physicians to extrapolate previous understanding by logic and experience to novel diagnostic reasoning and therapeutic approaches by extension of previous models.",

              "In an extremely busy curriculum and at a time of numerous other considerations, such as climate change (58), incorporating AI will present challenges.",
              "Many of the AI subfields such as ML and deep learning use complex algorithms that generate outputs from seemingly opaque non-linear functions that most physicians likely find difficult to understand or incorporate into their existing approaches to evidence-based medicine.",
              "Subsequently, this black-box phenomena (10) will be difficult for physicians to trust, and it will also be a challenge for the doctor-patient relationship since many physicians will find themselves unable to explain the diagnosis, prediction, or therapy (59).",

              "for instance, outcome assessments involving the withdrawal of care may pose heightened anxiety regardless of the model's accuracy.",
              "Therefore, physicians will need to develop a basic understanding of how input data are aggregated, analyzed, and generated into specific pathways of care for individualized patients.",
              "Furthermore, these algorithms will require physicians to have a better understanding of calculus and linear algebra, manipulation of data sets (curation, provenance, quality, integration, and governance), and model performance metrics fundamental in grading AI algorithmic decision-making.",
              "This knowledge will allow physicians to recognize when AI algorithms are being used on inappropriate patient populations, when AI tools have become outdated and need updating, or when aggregated data is biased.",
              "These new AI clinical decision-support systems have limitations in their application to patient populations, contextual changes, and therapeutic variances that will require a stronger appreciation of probabilities and confidence ratings (59).",
              "It will also be important to understand when physicians are justified in deviating from AI-inspired treatment protocols.",
              "Physicians will need to update their understanding of evidence-based medicine principles to include modern approaches to analyzing and assessing causality to ensure a robust understanding of how patients, social determinants of health, and healthcare systems interact to inform health-related outcomes.",

              "Compounding this resurgence of social skills requisition for medical practice will be the application of cognitive psychology principles.",
              "Understanding this need for social skills will help identify biases and heuristics that impact decision-making as well as help physicians frame choices, understand context, and have neutral but meaningful conversations with patients (55).",
              "The ubiquitous adoption of EHRs in healthcare systems around the world has created vast repositories of personalized data sets that are perfectly fitted for AI to examine, develop, and predict upon.",

AI capabilities will aide physicians in weighing competing healthcare goals and numerous risks by facilitating multiple outcome optimization of outcomes that are too difficult to recognize and navigate on an individual and isolated basis.",

              "The transfer of adherence data depends on the version of the electronic pill bottle device.",
              "Some old versions of the MEMS often require manual download of the stored patient medication adherence data from the MEMS cap into the MEMS software through a small reader device [8-10,27,28].",
              "Some newer versions of electronic pill bottle technologies, such as the GlowCap and AdhereTech devices, possess the ability to wirelessly transmit patient medication adherence data, providing opportunities to assess and monitor patient medication adherence in real time [1,15,18,29-31].",
              "Electronic pill bottle technologies are commonly reported to have advantages including their discrete design and small size [10,16,32,33], objective medication adherence monitoring ability [1,8,11,14,34,35], and acceptance among patients [1,30,31].",
              "However, as the pill bottle design is only capable of storing 1 type of medication at a time, these devices are not suitable for patients with complex multidrug regimens [1,4,8,9,18,30,32].",
              "In addition, because the opening of the pill bottle is used as a proxy measure for adherence, patient actions such as failing to ingest removed medications, pocket dosing (taking out multiple doses of medications at one time), and curiosity openings (opening the device but not removing medications) can lead to inaccurate estimates of patient medication adherence [1,2,4,5,9-11,14-16,27,28,30,33,36,37].",
              "Similar to the electronic pill bottle technology, electronic pill boxes or bags record a date-and-time stamp whenever they are opened.",
              "However, unlike electronic pill bottles, these technologies can often store multiple types or strengths of medication in various compartments within the device.",
              "The size and storage capacity vary among the different types of available electronic pill boxes or bags.",
              "Most of the identified electronic pill boxes or bags possessed the ability to transmit patient medication adherence data in real time via existing cellular networks [1,9,26-28,38-43,100], wireless Bluetooth [1,44,45], or general packet radio service [27,46,101,102].",
              "One device required manual uploading of patient adherence data during clinic visits [47].",
              "Although the capability of these devices to store multiple medications makes them better suited for complex multidrug regimens, this advantage is dependent on the device, as they can vary drastically in size and pill storage capacity.",
              "This was evident when examining the Wisepill device\u2019s storage capacity of 60 small-sized pills [1,27,39,41,46] compared with MedTracker\u2019s storage capacity of a week\u2019s worth of medication [44].",
              "However, larger-sized devices are often described as obtrusive [10,40,48] and have increased risks to patient privacy [1,39,40,49], thus limiting the acceptability of the device for patient populations, particularly for those who do not wish to disclose their health status (eg, HIV positive) to others [39].",
              "Furthermore, these devices cannot directly confirm ingestion of medications, raising concerns toward their medication adherence monitoring accuracy because potential patient behaviors, including pocket dosing and curiosity events, may impede medication adherence rate estimates [1,10,15,16,26,27,30,38-40,44,48-50,101] All but 3 blister pack technology applications identified included an attachable adhesive label that contained a microchip and conductive wire pattern [4,36,51].",
              "Removing medication from the blister pack created a break in the label circuit and was recorded by the microchip with a date-and-time stamp.",
              "Patient medication adherence data are wirelessly transmitted to central servers and are often accessible to HCPs, allowing for real-time adherence monitoring [1,6,51-55].",
              "As the design of blister packs stores the appropriate dose of medication in singular pockets, each removed dose is registered as an individual event, thereby eliminating the potential for patient pocket dosing and curiosity openings [56].",
              "However, currently within these devices, the action of removing a dose has been found to break the conductive tracks of the surrounding doses occasionally and accidentally, leading to the registration of multiple removal events, which decreases the accuracy of monitoring with these technologies [56,57].",
              "Moreover, this method of medication adherence monitoring is a proxy measure and cannot confirm patient ingestion of medication, further limiting the accuracy of patient medication adherence estimates [1,4,52,55].",
              "Ingestible sensors, otherwise known as digital pills [12] or digital ingestion monitoring [50], consist of a technological system that includes microsensors, an adhesive external monitor worn on the abdomen, and a mobile app.",
              "The microingestible sensors are coencapsulated with medication and ingested into the body, where stomach gastric fluids dissolve the capsule containing the medication and sensor.",
              "Activation of the sensor upon contact with gastric fluid transmits a unique signal to the external monitor.",
              "The detected ingestion event is transferred to a mobile app that uploads the event\u2019s date-and-time stamp, along with other recorded physiological measures (eg, heartbeat), to a central server.",
              "These technological systems possess the advantage of direct observation of medication ingestion [3,13,15,16,30,37,58-65], as well as real-time adherence monitoring [1,3,9,12,30,37,49,58,61-66,103].",
              "By directly identifying individual ingestion events of medication, these technologies can detect multiple ingestion events at a given time, thereby improving the accuracy of measuring patient medication adherence rates [60,61,65,103].",
              "In addition, the ingestion event detection accuracy of ingestible sensors is high, with rates of 95% to 99.",
              "1% observed experimentally [3,58,65,103].",
              "However, owing to the direct ingestion of technological sensors, concerns over patient privacy and autonomy are prominent because of the invasive nature of these devices [9,13,20].",
              "Patient reports of skin irritation caused by the external monitor [1,12,40,59,61,63,64] and the possibility of sensor retention within the body [15,60,64] are considerable limitations of these technologies, as well as potential risks to patient health and safety.",
              "The devices identified within the category of Electronic Medication Management System (EMMS) vary in their functionalities, with reported advantages and limitations;",
              "however, all systems possess similar features that focus on aiding patients in their medication management and documenting their medication adherence patterns.",
              "Three novel EMMS devices that presented interesting functionality characteristics included the radio frequency identification (RFID)-based medication adherence intelligence system [44,67], ReX (DosentRx Ltd) [68], and the Medication Behavior Monitoring System (MBMS) [69].",
              "The RFID-based medication adherence intelligence system (RMAIS) is composed of an RFID reader, scale, microcontroller, liquid crystal display panel, and a motorized rotation platform [44,67].",
              "The patient\u2019s pill bottles are labeled with an RFID tag that stores the medication\u2019s information, such as the medication name and appropriate dose [67].",
              "At a scheduled medication administration time, the RMAIS generates audio medication reminders and rotates the correct pill bottle in front of the patient [44,67].",
              "The scale underneath the rotation platform weighs the pill bottle, and the medication information is displayed using an RFID reader [44,67].",
              "After the patient has removed the medication from the pill bottle, the scale measures the weight of the bottle and uses the difference in weight to determine the number of doses removed [44,67].",
              "If the system detects events of nonadherence, an HCP is alerted [44,67].",
              "An advantage of this system is that it provides guidance to patients who must navigate complex multidrug regimens by eliminating the need for patient decision-making concerning what medication to take, how much, and at what time [67].",
              "However, because this system is also a proxy monitor of medication adherence and cannot confirm the actual ingestion of medication, its accuracy is consequently limited [44].",
              "ReX is a recently developed device composed of a reusable drug dispensing unit, disposable cassette, mobile app, and a Dose-E Analytics cloud system [68].",
              "The patient\u2019s medication is stored inside the device and can only be released at the appropriate time, at the correct dose, and directly into the patient\u2019s mouth [68].",
              "The mobile app transfers patient medication adherence data from the drug dispensing unit to the Dose-E Analytics cloud system, which is accessible to HCPs, allowing real-time medication adherence monitoring [68].",
              "A critical advantage of the device is the dispenser mechanism that prevents patient medication overadherence and administration of medication at incorrect time intervals [68].",
              "However, even though the device can monitor the medication up until delivery into the patient\u2019s mouth, it cannot confirm the actual ingestion of the medication, thereby inhibiting the accuracy of its medication adherence estimates.",
              "Finally, MBMS devices use newly emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things, deep learning, and artificial intelligence [67].",
              "The MBMS is unique in that it combines the following three categories of medication adherence monitoring technologies: electronic pillboxes, motion sensor technology, and video-based monitoring technology [67].",
              "The device uses a set alarm to remind patients to take their medication [67].",
              "As the patient approaches the device, motion sensors placed around the patient\u2019s home detect the movement and signal the MBMS device to begin recording a video of the patient\u2019s medication behavior [67].",
              "Once the device recognizes the patient\u2019s act of raising an arm to drink water, the internal pillbox that stores the medication releases the appropriate medication and quantity onto a platform with a scale [67].",
              "The MBMS determines whether the patient takes the dispensed medication based on whether the scale converges to zero [67].",
              "HCPs receive weekly adherence reports from the MBMS.",
              "Roh et al [69] found that when an MBMS device was used, medication adherence was higher than in patients who did not use the device.",
              "However, similar to RMAIS and ReX, the inability of the system to detect actual medication ingestion inhibits its potential accuracy in monitoring patient medication adherence.",
              "Similar to DOT, where patients administer their medication in the presence of an HCP, most video-based adherence monitoring technologies use video cameras for patients to self-record medication ingestion event videos for retrospective analysis by HCPs or, in 2 unique cases, by artificial intelligence [70-72].",
              "Video-DOT (VDOT) was the most common technological method for this category of technology.",
              "Patients either ingest their medication during a synchronous video call with their HCP or upload an asynchronous video for the HCP to review [16,18,48,73,74].",
              "Real-time medication adherence monitoring is facilitated by the direct and continuous use of medication ingestion event observation by HCPs [49,74].",
              "An additional advantage of VDOT is that, compared with DOT, VDOT is considered more flexible, cheaper, and less intrusive to HCPs and patients [16,49,73].",
              "However, several potential limitations to VDOT include technical difficulties, such as poor video quality [73], trouble uploading ingestion event videos [16], and complications with video camera devices [74].",
              "There is also a potential risk of patients forgetting to self-record as they ingest their medication, which may lead to inaccurate reports of medication adherence [16].",
              "Currently, the medication adherence monitoring motion sensor technologies that we have identified are still under development.",
              "Three individual adherence-monitoring motion sensor devices were found, yet all their functionalities were similar.",
              "These devices were worn on wrists and resembled the size of a wristwatch [13,75,76].",
              "The wrist-worn devices were triaxial accelerometers that identified the medication administration movements of patients [13,75,76].",
              "Patient medication adherence data were then stored and uploaded to an HCP-accessible database in real time [75].",
              "Wang et al [13] reported a correct ingestion event detection rate of 84.",
              "17%.",
              "Given that the action of administering medication closely resembles other everyday actions such as eating, drinking, or wiping one\u2019s mouth, the accuracy of these technological systems is currently limited [75].",
              "Despite these limitations, motion sensor technologies possess the advantages of being noninvasive [75] and nonintrusive [76] methods of medication adherence monitoring.",
              "Similar to EMMS, patient self-report technologies vary in their specific functionalities, yet they all gather subjective medication adherence data by interacting with the patient via phone calls [16,18,26,38,49,53,77-80], smart buttons [55], eDiaries [81], web-based platforms [82,83], and mobile apps [84].",
              "Patient adherence is available in real time for most self-reported devices [18,49,53,78-80,82-84].",
              "Compared with objective adherence monitoring technologies, patient self-report technologies are lower in cost [26,53] and less stigmatizing [16].",
              "Nevertheless, because this technological method of adherence monitoring is subjective, there is a high potential for inaccurate medication adherence reporting by patients, negatively impacting the accuracy of these technologies [16,38,78,79].",

              "Overall, there were 8 types of medication adherence monitoring technologies, dominated by electronic pill bottles, electronic pill boxes or bags, and ingestible sensors.",
              "Although technical features varied by technology type, there were common expectations regarding the advantages of using these technologies for accurately monitoring medication adherence and increasing the adoption of these technologies in patients\u2019 daily lives.",
              "All current medication adherence monitoring technologies have varying degrees of technological restriction.",
              "The most commonly reported technology types, electronic pill boxes or bags and electronic pill bottles that use opening events as a proxy for medication ingestion, face undesired patient behaviors such as pocket dosing and curiosity openings, which are obstacles to the device\u2019s accuracy for patient adherence estimates [2,9,11,14,16,27,30,33,37,41,48-50].",
              "Despite this limitation, the popularity of developing and using pill monitoring devices remains, which may be due to their unobtrusiveness and convenience of use in patients\u2019 everyday routines, suggesting an increasing adoption of objective measurement and monitoring of medication adherence through technological approaches.",
              "Although electronic pill bottles possess extensive histories of being used in both clinical and research settings, the presence of many other medication adherence monitoring technology studies in the pilot and feasibility phase implies that the integration of newer technologies, such as motion sensor\u2013based technologies and ingestible sensors, is still relatively new and ongoing [1,4,15,18,60,64,76].",
              "Overall, technologies capable of monitoring patient medication adherence provide significant advantages, including real-time medication adherence data reporting, yet questions concerning the accuracy of these devices prohibit them from becoming a gold standard in clinical and research standings.",
              "Thus, until further developments in medication adherence monitoring technologies occur, multiple methods for patient medication adherence assessment must be used to evaluate patient medication adherence rates and behaviors [1].",
              "Many medication adherence monitoring technologies possess software to organize patient medication adherence data to an extent;",
              "however, most of these devices require separate analysis and quantification of the data by HCPs or researchers [1], creating a significant burden of time consumption and the concern of further data integration with other technology applications.",
              "The development of a patient medication adherence data management software that can construct automatic visualizations of patient medication adherence estimates should be considered to provide an easy interpretation of patient medication adherence patterns.",

              "In addition to variances in technical features, current medication monitoring technologies differ in their data capture methods and the subsequent use of such data in relation to patients\u2019 medication adherence assessment.",
              "The ability of most medication adherence monitoring technologies to provide real-time observations of patient medication adherence behaviors is beneficial to HCPs and researchers to prevent nonadherence and facilitate appropriate interventions [1,15,36,37,79].",
              "However, most of these technologies rely on proxy measures of medication adherence, such as device opening events, thereby limiting their data accuracy [2,9,11,14,16,27,30,33,37,41,48-50].",
              "Furthermore, successful implementation of these technologies in clinical settings or the integration of patient medication adherence monitoring data into clinical practice has rarely been reported.",

              "To facilitate the adoption of medication adherence monitoring technologies in clinical systems to improve patient care, the method of adherence data capture must be feasible for targeted patients and the acquired data must be easily integrated into standard electronic health record systems. The medication adherence data capture methods and data use presented in this review can help guide HCPs and researchers toward the appropriate selection of medication adherence monitoring technology.",
