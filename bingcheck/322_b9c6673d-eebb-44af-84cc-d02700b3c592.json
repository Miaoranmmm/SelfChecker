    "query": "What is the historical and cultural significance behind the traditional Indian festival of Holi, and how has it evolved over time to become a widely celebrated event worldwide?",
    "response": "Holi is a festival of colours, joy and love that celebrates the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. It has a rich history and culture that dates back to ancient times and is rooted in Hindu mythology and traditions. According to Wikipedia[^1^], Holi is an ancient Hindu festival with its cultural rituals that finds colour in numerous scriptures, such as in works like Jaimini's Purva Mimamsa Sutras and Kathaka-Grhya-Sutras with even detailed descriptions in ancient texts like the Narad Purana and Bhavishyad Purana.\n\nOne of the most popular stories behind Holi is the legend of Krishna and Radha, who are considered to be the divine couple in Hinduism. Krishna, who had a dark complexion, was jealous of Radha's fair skin and complained to his mother Yashoda. She playfully suggested him to smear Radha's face with colours and make her look like him. Krishna followed her advice and thus began the tradition of playing with colours on Holi. This also symbolizes the celebration of divine love of Radha Krishna.\n\nAnother story behind Holi is the tale of Prahlada, a devotee of Vishnu, and his evil father Hiranyakashipu, who wanted to be worshipped as a god. Hiranyakashipu tried to kill Prahlada several times but failed due to Vishnu's protection. He then asked his sister Holika, who had a boon of being immune to fire, to sit on a pyre with Prahlada on her lap. However, Holika's boon was reversed due to her evil intentions and she was burnt to ashes while Prahlada emerged unharmed. This signifies the triumph of good over evil and faith over tyranny. On the eve of Holi, people light bonfires to commemorate this event and also to purify themselves from negative energies.\n\nHoli also marks the end of winter and the beginning of spring, a season of renewal and rebirth. It is a time to forgive and forget past grievances, to mend relationships and to express gratitude for life's blessings. People celebrate Holi by throwing coloured water and powders on each other, dancing, singing, eating festive delicacies and visiting friends and relatives. They also reverse the usual norms of caste, gender, status and age for a day and enjoy a sense of equality and freedom.\n\nHoli has evolved over time to become a widely celebrated event worldwide, especially among the Indian diaspora and other communities who appreciate its cultural significance and festive spirit. Holi has also inspired many artistic expressions such as paintings, poems, songs, films and literature that capture its essence and beauty.",

              "He subjected Prahlada to cruel punishments, none of which affected the boy or his resolve to do what he thought was right.",
              "Finally, Holika, Prahlada's evil aunt, tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her.",
              "[5] Holika was wearing a cloak that made her immune to injury from fire, while Prahlada was not.",

              "Vishnu, the god who appears as an avatar to restore Dharma in Hindu beliefs, took the form of Narasimha \u2013 half human and half lion (which is neither a human nor an animal), at dusk (when it was neither day nor night), took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep (which was neither indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which was neither land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and killed the king with his lion claws (which were neither a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon).",
              "[50] The Holika bonfire and Holi signifies the celebration of the symbolic victory of good over evil, of Prahlada over Hiranyakashipu, and of the fire that burned Holika.",

              "the restricted diet left the cows thin and malnourished.",
              "Within 30 years or so of that letter, the trade in Indian yellow stopped completely, partly because of tougher rules about animal cruelty and partly because new, more stable paints were available, and there just wasn\u2019t the demand.",

              "It wasn\u2019t until 1921 that a team of archaeologists did a thorough excavation and, among the artifacts, discovered a fragment of cotton fiber stuck to an ancient silver vase.",
