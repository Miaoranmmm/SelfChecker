    "query": "What is the history and science behind the phenomenon of optical illusions, and how do they trick our brains into perceiving something that is not actually there?",
    "response": "Optical illusions are images that deceive our eyes and brains into perceiving something that is not actually there. They have been used throughout history to amaze, entertain, trick and even scare us[^2^] [^3^]. But they are also a fascinating way to study how our brain senses our world[^1^].\n\nThe science behind optical illusions is complex and involves many aspects of perception, attention, context and interpretation. Different types of optical illusions may have different explanations, but generally they involve some kind of mismatch between what our eyes see and what our brain interprets.\n\nSome philosophers and scientists have tried to explain optical illusions by blaming either our senses or our mind for the distortions. For example, Epicharmus, a Greek philosopher in the 5th century B.C., thought that our senses deceive us, while Protagoras, another Greek philosopher, thought that optical illusions depend on the environment in which they are viewed[^2^] [^3^]. Aristotle, on the other hand, thought that both our senses and our mind play a role in creating optical illusions[^2^] [^3^].\n\nModern research has shown that Plato was right: our mind and our eyes work together to establish the world, including optical illusions[^2^]. Our brain does not sense the world in absolutes; instead, it compares the sum of all parts of what it perceives and filters out information it doesn't think is important[^1^]. Sometimes, this process leads to errors or illusions.\n\nFor example, in the Hering illusion[^4^], two straight and parallel lines look as if they bow outwards because our brain overestimates the angle made at the points of intersection between the radiating lines and the red ones. In the jellybean and the cup illusion[^1^], we miss many changes in the scene because our brain focuses on the moving jellybean and ignores other details.\n\nOptical illusions can help us understand how our brain creates reality based on the input it receives from our senses[^1^]. They can also reveal some of the limitations and biases of our perception and cognition. Optical illusions are not only fun and intriguing, but also informative and enlightening.",

              "Finally, we experience clear visual information, seemingly in the same quality as the one which mirrors physical perception\u2014in the end, the \u201cphysical perception\u201d and the \u201cconstructed perception\u201d, are of the same quality, also because the \u201cphysical perception\u201d is neither a depiction of physical reality, but is also constructed by top-down processes based on best guess heuristic as a kind of hypothesis testing or problem solving (Gregory, 1970).",

              "If the hypotheses are misleading because the underlying mental model of the situation and its further genesis is incorrect, we face an essential problem: what we then perceive (or fail to perceive) is incompatible with the current situation, and so will mislead our upcoming action.",
              "In most extreme cases, this could lead to fatal decisions: for instance: if the model does not construct a specific interfering object in our movement axis, we might miss information essential to changing our current trajectory resulting in a collision course.",

              "We can, however, illustrate this mechanism very easily by just observing our eye movements in a mirror: when executing fast eye movements, we cannot observe them by directly inspecting our face in the mirror\u2014we can only perceive our fixations and the slow movements of the eyes.",

              "Protagoras - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy",
              "Protagoras (490\u2013420 BCE ca) was one of the most important sophists and exerted considerable influence in fifth-century intellectual debates.",
              "His teaching had a practical and concrete goal, and many of the surviving testimonies and fragments suggest that it was mainly devoted to the development of argumentative techniques.",
              "But some of his views also raise important philosophical problems, which were going to be discussed in details by Plato, Aristotle, and many other philosophers.",
              "His famous thesis according to which \u201cman is the measure of all things\u201d has been interpreted as a first stance in favour of relativism, and his claim on the gods introduces the problem of agnosticism.",
              "Besides, his conventionalist notion of justice marks a break with the traditional account of divine justice;",
              "as it has been rightly claimed, it also seems to provide a theoretical foundation for democracy based on direct participation.",
              "By claiming a direct link with the great poets and thinkers of the past but also by appropriating and transforming their tenets, Protagoras presented himself as an heir to Greek paideia, as one of the great masters, or better, as the educator capable of imparting teachings suited to the needs of the new world of the polis.",
              "We do not know much about Protagoras\u2019 life, and even less about his death: as the most famous sophist, he became the object of many, often unreliable, anecdotes.",
              "He was born in Abdera in Thrace, in the north coast of the Aegean Sea.",
              "In Plato\u2019s Protagoras (317c) he says that he is old enough to be the father of anyone present, including Hippias and Prodicus.",
              "This confirms that he was one of the earliest sophists and suggests the 490s BCE as his birth year.",
              "According to an anecdote in Diogenes Laertius (IX.",
              "53) he was a porter until Democritus taught him.",
              "Democritus was also from Abdera, but was younger by about thirty years and criticised Protagoras\u2019 thesis of the \u201cMan measure\u201d (see below) on the charge of being self-refuting.",
              "It is therefore highly improbable that Protagoras was one of his pupils.",
              "The anecdote, probably derived from some comic poets (such as Eupolis or Hermippus) due to possible connections between their epistemological theories, also served to point to Protagoras\u2019 humble origins;",
              "an alternative testimony from Philostratus (Lives of the Sophist I.",
              "10.",
              "1\u20132) about his family hosting Xerxes at the time of the Persian wars goes in the opposite direction.",
              "This testimony also reports that Xerxes granted Protagoras\u2019 family the rare privilege of having their son Protagoras educated by the Magi (this anecdote was also used to explain his agnosticism, as if it was impossible for a Greek to endorse similar ideas, see below).",
              "Even if we regard this story as spurious, it still seems to confirm the contacts between Protagoras and the culture of the Ionian colonies and of the Near East.",
              "As Plato repeatedly reports, he later travelled around Greece as a teacher and a \u201csophist\u201d (most importantly, again according to Plato, he was the first to explicitly present himself as such, Protagoras 316c\u2013317b), earning great fame and amassing considerable riches.",
              "It is equally certain that Protagoras sojourned at least twice in Athens in Pericles\u2019 time, establishing with him personal ties.",
              "It is more difficult to tell whether these contacts also led to a direct involvement in the democratic politics of the great statesman.",
              "Evidence in this direction is apparently provided not just by some of the sophist\u2019s surviving fragments, but also by the fact that in 444 BCE, Pericles entrusted him with drafting the constitution of the new pan-Hellenic colony of Thurii in South Italy (clearly, an appointment of this sort implies that the two men shared the same political outlook).",
              "This connection with Pericles can also be confirmed by the upheavals that marked the last years of Protagoras\u2019 life: the crisis of Periclean politics seems to find a counterpart in the downfall of Protagoras, who\u2014like other personalities close to the statesman\u2014was put on trial.",
              "By the same account, the sophist died in a shipwreck during his flight.",
              "However, this is very questionable.",
              "First, that he had a trial seems to be confirmed also by other sources;",
              "but these sources (in particular Aristotle, see Diogenes Laertius IX.",
              "54) do not seem to relate the trial to political issues (Diogenes actually relates the trial to the charge of impiety, which would justify the story about the shipwreck as divine punishment);",
              "at stake was rather a controversy with a pupil.",
              "Moreover, it cannot be excluded that the trial with the student was also a fiction.",
              "Second, the story of the trial and flight from Athens differs from what Plato writes in his dialogues, where he speaks of Protagoras as though he had died as a universally esteemed figure in old age.",
              "From Plato we know that Protagoras lived approximately 70 years (Meno 91e;",
              "other sources state 90 years), which would place his death at around 420 BCE.",
              "Protagoras' pupils include Antimoerus of Mende, Carmidas and Euathlus of Athens, and Theodore of Cyrene.",
              "Protagoras\u2019 influence has also been posited in relation to Prodicus and the Dissoi Logoi, although it is difficult to measure its extent.",
              "Diogenes Laertius (IX 55 = 80A1 DK) attributes many works to Protagoras, but a comparison with other sources reveals that his list is incomplete.",
              "Still worse, what is missing from Diogenes\u2019 list are precisely the most important and controversial works, such as Truth and On the Gods.",
              "One possible explanation is that these two texts constituted individual sections of the Antilogiae (Opposing Arguments, mentioned by Diogenes), which were possibly known also as Kataballontes logoi (The Overthrower Arguments or, better, The Knockdown Arguments;",
              "in M VII 60 Sextus Empiricus attributes to this text the \u201cMan measure\u201d sentence, which other sources refer to Truth;",
              "see Decleva Caizzi 1999: 317;",
              "Lee 2005: 24\u201329).",
              "Intriguing as it is, the hypothesis is difficult to prove.",
              "The title suggests that the Antilogiai were structured upon some sort of oppositions (an interesting parallel are the Dissoi logoi);",
              "but there is no indication of oppositions in the surviving fragments from Truth and On the Gods.",
              "Again, any attempt at reconstruction is destined to remain speculative, given the dearth of available fragments.",
              "Other titles such as The Art of Eristic, On Wrestling, On Sciences, On Love of Honours, On the Constitution show the breadth of Protagoras\u2019 interests.",
              "Apart from these titles, unfortunately, all we have are a few (less than ten in Diels-Kranz\u2019s edition) authentic fragments and many interpretations.",
              "Ever since Antiquity, his provocative theses have elicited interest and criticism from his readers.",
              "As a result, different reconstructions of his thought are available, which are not always reliable and are often clearly shaped by disparaging intentions.",
              "The first and most important tradition stretches back to Plato, who devoted two dialogues to the theses of the sophist of Abdera, the Protagoras and the Theaetetus.",
              "Many of the later testimonies, starting with Aristotle\u2019s, would appear to depend on Plato\u2019s discussions, and this must be taken into account when examining the information from our sources.",
              "Alongside the Platonic, another tradition proved rather influential in Antiquity, namely the one that highlighted the sceptical implications of Protagoras\u2019 thought (the most interesting testimony, not in DK, comes from the Commentary on the Psalms by Didymus the Blind, see PToura V 222.",
              "18-29;",
              "this testimony, absent in DK, can be read in the recent edition by Laks and Most 2016, vol.",
              "VIII.",
              "1, 109\u2013111).",
              "However, little is known about this interpretation because sceptics such as Sextus Empiricus explicitly refused to be associated with Protagoras, whom they regarded as a dogmatist.",
              "This kind of reading certainly served polemical purposes.",
              "Another tradition that was hostile to Protagoras, and which was possibly connected to the sceptical interpretation, was the Epicurean one, which is responsible for the emphasis on the link between Protagoras and Democritus, on the ground of their epistemologies\u2014in all likelihood, an unfounded idea.",
              "All in all, we must note that many\u2014if not all\u2014the testimonies we have about Protagoras are vitiated by underlying polemical attitudes of some sort, which in some cases lead to actual distortions of his thought.",
              "In Plato\u2019s Protagoras Protagoras claims that he teaches euboulia, good deliberation: The object of my instruction is good deliberation about household matters, to know how to manage one\u2019s own household in the best way possible, and about those of the city, so as to be most capable of acting and speaking in the city\u2019s interest.",
              "(318e\u2013319a = 80A5 DK) Protagoras\u2019 teaching had a practical and concrete goal, and many of the surviving testimonies and fragments suggest that it was mainly devoted to the development of argumentative techniques (which were probably investigated in texts such as the already mentioned Antilogiai and The Art of Eristics).",
              "Unfortunately, we have little evidence of what these actually were.",
              "In all probability, assertions such as that on every matter there are two logoi opposed to one another (80A1, B6a DK) or that it is impossible to contradict (80A19 DK), along with the claim to make the weaker logos (the) stronger (80B6b DK), belong to this context.",
              "Part of his teaching was also devoted to grammatical or linguistic issues and poetry analysis.",
              "More in general, it is also unclear the relation between his teachings and the apparent relativism of his famous thesis that the man is the measure of all things.",
              "Ancient sources report that this sentence opened Truth, a public declamation (epideixis) with which he presented himself to the public to potential pupils.",
              "Truth is one of Protagoras\u2019 most famous books.",
              "Ancient books were not necessarily given their titles by their authors;",
              "but Plato and Aristotle continuously refer to Protagoras\u2019 text as Aletheia and also make puns, confirming that Protagoras himself gave this title.",
              "The notion of \u201ctruth\u201d played a prominent role among the Presocratics: in choosing this title, Protagoras clearly wanted to present himself as an heir to this long-established tradition;",
              "and by questioning the existence of one single truth, as we will see, he sought to challenge it.",
              "The first sentence of the treatise fully confirms its author\u2019s provocative intentions: \u201cOf all things the measure is man: of those that are, that they are;",
              "and of those that are not, that they are not\u201d (80B1 DK;",
              "for the sake of convenience, this sentence will be abbreviated as MM).",
              "MM is one of the few authentic Protagoras fragments to have been preserved and many ancient sources confirm that the statement was originally formulated precisely in these terms. The problem, however, is its opacity: ancient readers debated what Protagoras really meant, and modern interpretations have only increased doubt.",
              "As a matter of fact, it cannot be ruled out that a certain degree of ambiguity was intentional.",
              "Truth was not a scientific treatise but an epideixis, the text of public performance, which was meant \u201cto demonstrate one\u2019s virtuoso skill in argumentation\u201d (Lee 2005: 27, after Lloyd 1987: 96).",
              "In opening his speech, Protagoras sought to capture the attention of his audience (or reader) by making a striking and allusive claim.",
              "There is nothing odd in all of this, since a desire to capture the audience\u2019s attention was quite typical of the sophists, and is confirmed by many other sources (the sentence introducing the treatise on the gods was just as provocative, see \u00a74).",
              "This is not to say that MM had no specific meaning.",
              "Simply, it is a matter of dealing with potentially ambiguous elements.",
              "In particular, it is necessary to clarify the notion of man, i.",
              "e., whether \u201cman\u201d refers to each individual or to humanity in general: in discussing this issue, the meaning of the other terms that make up the sentence will also become clearer.",
              "In turn, this will help us assess the underlying meaning of Protagoras\u2019 thesis and its field of applicability, so as to determine whether it is only an epistemological thesis or whether it also carries practical or political implications.",
              "As it will turn out, the sentence can be read on different levels, in accordance with the archaic logic which says there is no need to clearly distinguish the different meanings possessed by a term.",
              "There are three main sources for MM: Plato, our most important source, Aristotle, and Sextus Empiricus.",
              "All three understand the phrase\u2014at any rate at a first level\u2014as though \u201cman\u201d referred to \u201ceach individual\u201d.",
              "In the Theaetetus MM is equated with the claim that \u201cknowledge is sensation\u201d and paraphrased as follows: \u201cjust as each thing appears to me, so too it is for me, and just as it appears to you, so too again for you\u201d (Theaetetus 152a).",
              "Thus, if the wind appears warm to me, it is warm for me;",

              "Some interpreters have denied that Protagoras is doubting the existence of the gods in this passage on the ground of a parallel with the use of hos in this statement and in the MM: in the latter case, as we have seen, the preposition clearly has a modal meaning;",
              "if we assume that it was used in the same sense in the former passage, we must conclude that, according to this line of interpretation, Protagoras was chiefly interested in the way in which the gods are and present themselves, rather than in their presumed existence or non-existence.",
              "Protagoras would thus be claiming that we do not know \u201chow\u201d the gods are or are not, and the words that follow (\u201cnor of what kind they are in form\u201d) would have an almost epexegetic function (or would more concretely refer to the problem of their visible appearance: see Kerferd 1981a: 165\u2013168).",
              "This would imply, then, that Protagoras never raised any doubts as to the existence of the gods (and a different translation of the first clause would follow: \u201cI am able to know neither how they exist nor how they do not exist\u201d).",
              "The merit of this reading is that it explains the otherwise inappropriate order of the two clauses: since the first statement argues for agnosticism, it makes no sense to discuss the problem of the gods\u2019 form.",
              "Against it, however, it must be noted that all the ancient sources, from Plato onwards (see Theaetetus, 162d), unanimously present Protagoras\u2019 thesis as though it concerned the existence of the gods.",
              "As there are no reasons to go against such a solid tradition, it is better to interpret the text as discussing both the existence of the gods (\u201cneither that they exist nor that they do not exist\u201d) and their form (\u201cnor of what kind they are in form\u201d).",
              "As for the order of the two clauses, the most reasonable explanation is that, like in the MM fragment, these opening statements, whose primary aim was to attract the attention of the audience, were not meant to be too rigorous.",
              "To be sure, to begin by professing one\u2019s own ignorance is an unconventional choice.",
              "Incidentally, it is worth noting that the statement possibly presents the first recorded use of the verb \u201cto be\u201d in an existential sense (Kahn 1973: 302).",
              "The reasons which Protagoras reportedly adduced in support of his thesis\u2014the obscurity of the problem and the brevity of human life\u2014have been regarded as too banal, or at any rate not particularly relevant.",
              "However, they acquire greater significance when viewed in relation to a concept the importance of which has already been stressed in relation to the MM, namely personal experience: this is the only legitimate criterion to verify our knowledge (Mansfeld 1981).",
              "Therefore it seems that also in this case by highlighting the limits of human experience, Protagoras was engaging in a polemic with those Presocratic thinkers, such as Parmenides and Heraclitus, who had repeatedly claimed to be able to transcend the limits of human knowledge, as well as the poets, who had based their authority on a privileged contact with the divine world.",
              "In this respect, some interesting similarities are to be found between Protagoras and Xenophanes of Elea (21B34 DK), who also reportedly criticised human claims to know the truth about the gods (significantly, for Xenophanes too, obscurity is an obstacle to knowledge).",
              "The analogies with Xenophanes become even more striking when we consider the second segment of the first statement, concerning the presumed appearance of the gods.",
              "In raising this problem, Protagoras was in all likelihood referring to the anthropomorphic conception, which Xenophanes had already repeatedly censured (see also Herodotus Histories II 53,1;",

              "One intriguing problem for scholars has been to reconstruct the follow-up to this text.",
              "It is difficult to imagine that, after a statement of this sort, Protagoras continued to speak at length about the gods.",
              "The structure of the sentence (and in particular the presence of the particle men, which implies a contrasting de) suggests that the author shifted his attention onto man: for the Greeks, the notions of god and man were mutually defining.",
              "It is likely, therefore, that in the continuation of the text, Protagoras discussed not the problem of the gods in itself, but rather the issue of what they represent for man, thereby inaugurating an anthropological and sociological approach that considers religion in terms of its function for human civilisation and society (Jaeger 1947: 176).",
              "This hypothesis is no doubt more persuasive than the alternative hypothesis that the text was then devoted to a critique of religious beliefs or, on the contrary, that the acknowledgement of human weakness was intended to pave the way to an expression of piety and reverence for the unknowable nature of the gods.",
              "What is less convincing is the way in which this hypothesis has been developed.",
              "From Jaeger onwards, scholars have believed that, while leaving the problem of the actual existence of the gods open, Protagoras celebrated their importance for human civilisation in the sense that religious beliefs and sentiments played a decisive role in the development of human civilisation.",
              "Given the silence of this fragment, this hypothesis is based on the myth that Protagoras relates in the dialogue named after him, where mention is made of these beliefs.",
              "Yet what may be inferred from the myth is rather the very opposite (see \u00a75, for a detailed analysis of this testimony).",
              "In the myth, Protagoras acknowledges the importance of belief in the gods as something specifically and universally human;",
              "but the very moment he acknowledges the presence of the religious dimension, he de facto limits its importance by implying that this belief (or fear) is not enough to provide a foundation for human society.",
              "What ensures that men can live together in cities is rather politics.",
              "Protagoras\u2019 agnosticism is therefore instrumental towards his radical humanism, which is also attested in the MM fragment and in the myth of Prometheus.",
              "The last important testimony on Protagoras comes from the first part of Plato\u2019s Protagoras, where the sophist tells Socrates and the rest of the audience his own version of the myth of Prometheus (Protagoras 320c\u2013322d = 80C1 DK).",

              "This is not a fragment, but it is a reasonable and widely shared assumption that it conveys some Protagorean ideas.",
              "The problem is how to interpret it.",

              "What is more controversial is how the apparent relativism of the \u201cApology\u201d can be read into the myth and how it can be reconciled with its emphasis on the \u201cnaturalistic\u201d notion of justice in the myth.",
              "But the tension is probably more apparent than real, for in the myth it is not said that justice can be developed in one sense only, and the notion of \u201cuseful\u201d, which plays an important role in both dialogues, paves the way for a consistent reading of the two testimonies.",
              "Indeed, nomos is not the result of arbitrary decisions but depends on objective situations.",

              "Secondly, also in the Athenian political discourse the emphasis on the community is used to justify another cornerstone of the democratic ideology, arguably the most important one, namely the very close bond that must hold together the city\u2019s interest and the individual\u2019s, where the former is the precondition for the latter (for some interesting parallels, see Pericles in Thucydides History, II 40, 2 and 60, 2\u20134 and Herodotus Histories V 78).",
              "Thirdly, the parallel between the vindication of opinions implied by MM and another key motive of Athenian democracy, isegoria (everyone\u2019s right to express their idea in the assembly), need to be taken into account: the right for everyone to express their ideas seems to rely on the assumption that all opinions are legitimate, as indeed Protagoras argued.",
              "All in all, without having to posit that Protagoras\u2019 doctrines were developed precisely for this purpose, it is possible to note that they were far from irrelevant or foreign to the new political phase that Athens was experiencing.",
              "Protagoras\u2019 views provide a theoretical basis for participatory democracy (Kerferd 1981a: 144;",
              "particularly important is Farrar 1988).",
              "Protagoras emerges as a democratic political thinker: he is a political thinker because he has shown that the social (or political\u2014from polis) dimension is fundamental;",
              "he is democratic insofar as he suggests that political action is a collective and shared kind of action.",
              "It is hardly a coincidence that the main ancient reflections on democracy have often been set in relation to his ideas (see, e.",
              "g., Herodotus Histories III 80\u201382 or Dissoi logoi 7;",
              "Anonymous of Iamblichus, 90, 7 DK).",
              "Indeed, presenting democracy, the form of government of the new times, as the heir and culmination of the Greek political tradition is certainly a brilliant outcome which legitimises Protagoras\u2019 aspirations and ambitions.",
              "By claiming a direct link with the great poets and thinkers of the past but also by appropriating and transforming their tenets, Protagoras can present himself as an heir to Greek paideia, as one of the great masters, or, rather, as the great master, the only one who is capable of imparting a teaching that drew upon tradition but also meet the needs of the new times.",
              "In such a way, Protagoras could reinforce his claim to be the new teacher, the educator capable of imparting teachings suited to the needs of the new world of the polis.",
              "Plato\u2019s goal, in the Protagoras and in the Theaetetus, was to show that this was not correct\u2014if in the myth the sophist was implicitly identifying himself to Zeus, at the end he will turn out as Epimetheus.",
              "But for the time being, until this has been proven, one can well understand the enthusiasm of the Athenians when they heard that the great thinker had arrived in Athens (Protagoras 310b\u2013e).",

              "[21] That being an assertion that something that is, or appears for a single individual, is true or real for that individual.",
              "However, as described in Plato's Theaetetus, Protagoras's views allow that some views may result from an ill body or mind.",
              "He stressed that although all views may appear equally true, and perhaps, should be equally respected, they certainly are not of equal gravity.",
              "One view may be useful and advantageous to the person who has it, while the perception of another may prove harmful.",

              "Both Plato and Aristotle argue against some of Protagoras's claims regarding relativity;",

              "They claim that by asserting that truth is relative, Protagoras then could say that whatever further theory he proposed must be true.",
              "[22] Protagoras was a proponent of either agnosticism or, as Tim Whitmarsh claims, atheism, on the grounds that since he held that if something is not able to be known it does not exist.",
              "[23] Reportedly, in Protagoras's lost work, On the Gods, he wrote: \"Concerning the gods, I have no means of knowing whether they exist or not, nor of what sort they may be, because of the obscurity of the subject, and the brevity of human life.\"",
              "[24][25][26] According to Diogenes Lae\u0308rtius, the outspoken, agnostic position taken by Protagoras aroused anger, causing the Athenians to expel him from the city, and all copies of his book were collected and burned in the marketplace.",
              "The deliberate destruction of his works also is mentioned by Cicero.",
              "[27] The classicist John Burnet doubts this account, however, as both Diogenes Lae\u0308rtius and Cicero wrote hundreds of years later and as no such persecution of Protagoras is mentioned by contemporaries who make extensive references to this philosopher.",
              "[28] Burnet notes that even if some copies of the Protagoras books were burned, enough of them survived to be known and discussed in the following century.",
              "Nonetheless, very few fragments from Protagoras have survived, although he is known to have written several different works: Antilogiae and Truth.",

              "Protagoras is known primarily for three claims (1) that man is the measure of all things (which is often interpreted as a sort of radical relativism) (2) that he could make the \u201cworse (or weaker) argument appear the better (or stronger)\u201d and (3) that one could not tell if the gods existed or not.",
              "While some ancient sources claim that these positions led to his having been tried for impiety in Athens and his books burned, these stories may well have been later legends.",
              "Protagoras\u2019 notion that judgments and knowledge are in some way relative to the person judging or knowing has been very influential, and is still widely discussed in contemporary philosophy.",
              "Protagoras\u2019 influence on the history of philosophy has been significant.",
              "Historically, it was in response to Protagoras and his fellow sophists that Plato began the search for transcendent forms or knowledge which could somehow anchor moral judgment.",
              "Along with the other Older Sophists and Socrates, Protagoras was part of a shift in philosophical focus from the earlier Presocratic tradition of natural philosophy to an interest in human philosophy.",
              "He emphasized how human subjectivity determines the way we understand, or even construct, our world, a position which is still an essential part of the modern philosophic tradition.",

              "Our main sources of information concerning Protagoras are: The first step in understanding Protagoras is to define the general category of \u201csophist,\u201d a term often applied to Protagoras in antiquity.",
              "In the fifth century, the term referred mainly to people who were known for their knowledge (for example, Socrates, the seven sages) and those who earned money by teaching advanced pupils (for example, Protagoras, Prodicus) and seemed to be a somewhat neutral term, although sometimes used with pejorative overtones by those who disapproved of the new ideas of the so-called \u201cSophistic Enlightenment\u201d.",
              "By the fourth century the term becomes more specialized, limited to those who taught rhetoric, specifically the ability to speak in assemblies or law courts.",
              "Because sophistic skills could promote injustice (demagoguery in assemblies, winning unjust lawsuits) as well as justice (persuading the polis to act correctly, allowing the underprivileged to win justice for themselves), the term \u201csophist\u201d gradually acquired the negative connotation of cleverness not restrained by ethics.",
              "Conventionally, the term \u201cOlder Sophist\u201d is restricted to a small number of figures known from the Platonic dialogues (Protagoras, Gorgias, Prodicus, Hippias, Euthydemus, Thrasymachus and sometimes others).",
              "Whether these figures actually had some common body of doctrines is uncertain.",
              "At times scholars have tended to lump them together in a group, and attribute to them all a combination of religious skepticism, skill in argument, epistemological and moral relativism, and a certain degree of intellectual unscrupulousness.",
              "These characteristics, though, were probably more typical of their fourth century followers than of the Older Sophists themselves, who tended to agree with and follow generally accepted moral codes, even while their more abstract speculations undermined the epistemological foundations of traditional morality.",
              "When we separate Protagoras from general portraits of \u201csophistic\u201d, as most scholars (for example, the ones listed below in the bibliography) recommend, our information about him is relatively sparse.",

              "While this made the teachings of Protagoras extremely valuable, it also led a certain conservative faction (for example, the comic playwright Aristophanes) to distrust him, in the same way that people now might distrust a slick lawyer.",
              "Protagoras\u2019 doctrines can be divided into three groups: Perhaps because the practical side of his teaching was concerned with helping students learn to speak well in the courtroom, Protagoras was interested in \u201corthoepeia\u201d (the correct use of words).",
              "Later sources describe him as one of the first to write on grammar (in the modern sense of syntax) and he seems interested in the correct meaning of words, a specialty often associated with another sophist, Prodicus, as well.",

              "the measure may still be the individual person, but it is an unreliable one, like a broken ruler or unbalanced scale.",

              "Abstractions like truth, beauty, justice, and virtue are also qualities and it would seem that Protagoras\u2019 dictum would lead us to conclude that they too are relative to the individual observer, a conclusion which many conservative Athenians found alarming because of its potential social consequences.",

              "What will make a case triumph in court is not some inherent worth of one side, but the persuasive artistry of the orator.",
              "And so, Protagoras claims he is able to \u201cmake the worse case the better\u201d (DK80b6).",

              "While the pious might wish to look to the gods to provide absolute moral guidance in the relativistic universe of the Sophistic Enlightenment, that certainty also was cast into doubt by philosophic and sophistic thinkers, who pointed out the absurdity and immorality of the conventional epic accounts of the gods.",

              "\u201d (DK80b4) As a consequence of Protagoras\u2019 agnosticism and relativism, he may have considered that laws (legislative and judicial) were things which evolved gradually by agreement (brought about by debate in democratic assemblies) and thus could be changed by further debate.",
              "This position would imply that there was a difference between the laws of nature and the customs of humans.",
              "Although Protagoras himself seemed to respect, and even revere the customs of human justice (as a great achievement), some of the younger followers of Protagoras and the other Older Sophists concluded that the arbitrary nature of human laws and customs implies that they can be ignored at will, a position that was held to be one of the causes of the notorious amorality of such figures as Alcibiades.",
              "Protagoras himself was a fairly traditional and upright moralist.",
              "He may have viewed his form of relativism as essentially democratic \u2014 allowing people to revise unjust or obsolete laws, defend themselves in court, free themselves from false certainties \u2014 but he may equally well have considered rhetoric a way in which the elite could counter the tendencies towards mass rule in the assemblies.",
              "Our evidence on this matter is unfortunately minimal.",

              "The result is moral chaos \u2014 the main characters (Strepsiades and his son Pheidippides) in Clouds are portrayed as learning clever tricks to enable them to cheat their creditors and eventually abandoning all sense of conventional morality (illustrated by Pheidippides beating his father on stage and threatening to beat his mother).",
              "Although no one accused Protagoras himself of being anything other than honest \u2014 even Plato, who disapproved of his philosophical positions, portrays him as generous, courteous, and upright \u2014 his techniques were adopted by various unscrupulous characters in the following generation, giving sophistry the bad name it still has for clever (but fallacious) verbal trickery.",
              "Protagoras\u2019 influence on the history of philosophy has been significant.",

              "Most people report that they feel touched by two objects.",
              "I put forward and analyze a version of this illusion in which I move a pen between the fingertips.",
              "I lie down on my back and keep my left palm perpendicular with respect to my body, a few centimeters above it, with the thumb pointing towards the body, and with fingers 1 (index) and 2 (middle) crossed (finger 2 above finger 1).",
              "Then I touch, say, finger 2 first and then finger 1 with a pencil.",
              "To do this, I intend and move the pencil upwards, but when it makes the second touch, namely on finger 1, the movement seems as if it was not upwards but downwards.",
              "So the experience of the direction in which I move the pencil feels both upwards and downwards roughly at the same time.",
              "It is a paradoxical feeling.",
              "I go upwards, so I expect to touch the finger that is above, and yet I end up touching the finger that feels below.",
              "So it is like a tactile version of Escher\u2019s ascending-descending staircase.",
              "I analyze the contribution of the PNS activity in the fingertips when this puzzling experience occurs.",
              "What the original version of the illusion shows is that fingers have intrinsic felt location;",
              "each finger has an intrinsic interior and an intrinsic exterior, and they are aligned with the extrinsic (that is, physical) interiors and exteriors when the fingers are not crossed.",
              "When the fingers get crossed, there is a mismatch\u2013 the intrinsic interiors are now extrinsic exteriors, and vice versa.",
              "I am interested in the component of the total Escher type experience that is related to the phenomenology of the felt direction of motion of the active finger, and argue that the counterfactual that explains the contribution of the intrinsic locatedness of the touched fingers to this component of the experience is the following: Had the extrinsic interiors of the fingers not been intrinsic exteriors, everything else being equal, the upward motion of the active finger would not have been felt as also downward.",
              "However, empirical studies show that after long-term reversal (6 months of crossed fingers in Benedetti 1991), whether the fingers are crossed or not does not matter;",
              "the subjects are equally good at identifying and perceiving correctly with crossed and with uncrossed fingers (unlike in the visual case, when wearing inverting goggles generates a mere adaptation \u2014 I discuss inverting goggles in chapter 8).",
              "This means that the reason we feel intrinsic and extrinsic interiors of our fingers is a history of stimulation, which is very rich for the interiors (due to the shape of our hand and the regularities of our haptic environment), and quite poor for the exteriors (for the same reason \u2014 we rarely, if ever get touched simultaneously on the exteriors of a pair of fingers).",
              "The real cause of the Escher type motion illusion when I cross my fingers for the first time is an absence;",
              "the absence of a sufficiently long stimulation of the touch contacts.",
              "But the absence of such a history of stimulation is not the type of process that is present at the level of the contact points of the touch when I do have the illusion.",
              "The lack of stimulation is not a positive fact about the PNS when I am touched.",
              "So the positive fact about the PNS when I am touched, namely, that the nerve endings become activated, is not a causal contributor to my experience since the only one causal contributor, if we follow the counterfactual analysis, is the lack of sufficient past stimulation.",
              "Yet, it is pretty clear that the one-shot stimulation of those contacts, when I cross the fingers, is a contributor to my paradoxical experience.",
              "So we should understand these PNS processes as constitutive contributors to the experience.",
              "I make the following analogy in the book: \u201cTo change the famous story a bit, the Count of Monte Cristo, who is trapped in his prison cell, follows the Mad Priest\u2019s escape plan, and they start digging a tunnel through the thick stone walls of the prison fortress, having their spoons as their only usable tool.",
              "They need to dig for 10 years in order to complete the 5 meter long hole which would enable them to escape.",
              "Suppose we focus on the hole as it appears after 5 years of digging.",
              "Suppose the Mad Priest scrapes out half a spoonful of detritus from the wall.",
              "The scraping of the wall is a cause of the hole being, say 2 meters long, but, intuitively, why they are still trapped is because there has not been sufficient scraping yet.",

              "But what about the hole being 2 meters long?",
              "Intuitively, this is not a cause of their being trapped, but a constituent of this fact.",
              "To be trapped, in that situation, is partly constituted by the fact that the hole is not 5 meters long yet.",
              "Similarly, when the hole becomes 5 meters long, that fact will constitute their escape, although the hole becoming that long was caused by the constant scraping for 10 years.",
              "The scraping is a cause of the escape, but the length of the hole constitutes it.",
              "You can now replace the lengthy successive scraping above with the lengthy successive stimulation of the finger skin by external surfaces, and the length of the hole with the current activity of the PNS at the level of the fingers, and you get the way I think of the PNS as constitutive of the experience.",

              "New research has found that many visual illusions are caused by limits in how our eyes and visual neurons work instead of more complex psychological processes.",
              "Scientists examined illusions in which an object's surroundings affect how we see its color or pattern to evaluate whether these illusions are caused by neural processing in the eye and visual centers in the brain, or involve higher-level mental processes, such as context and prior knowledge.",
              "The human eye is an incredible feat of biology, intricately designed to absorb and transmit light through a series of components to the brain for interpretation.",
              "The cornea and lens work cohesively to bend and focus the incoming light as it enters the pupil.",
              "The iris, or the colorful part of the eye, regulates the amount of light let into the eye by controlling the size of the pupil.",
              "The light focuses directly onto the retina, a group of cells at the back of the eye responsible for transmitting signals to the brain.",
              "The retina contains two types of light-sensitive cells: rods and cones.",
              "Rods are highly sensitive and are responsible for detecting dim light, while cones respond best to bright light and are involved in color vision.",
              "As light enters the eye, it is absorbed by the rods and cones in the retina, where it is transformed into electrical signals that travel along the optic nerve to the brain.",
              "The brain then processes the signals into images we can see and interpret.",
              "While our eyes can take in an incredible amount of information, the brain can only process so much at once, leading to shortcuts that simplify what we see.",
              "This can result in situations where we perceive things that aren't there, such as optical illusions.",
              "The brain relies on previous experiences and knowledge to make assumptions about what we see, leading to perceptions that may not match reality.",
              "Or, that's what we thought was happening when we saw optical illusions, but new research suggests it may be more straightforward.",
              "Researchers from the University of Exeter developed a model that suggests limits to neural responses, not deeper psychological processes, explain how we process optical illusions.",
              "The model combines \"limited bandwidth\" with information on how humans perceive patterns at different scales.",
              "It was developed to predict how animals see color, but it can predict many visual illusions seen by humans correctly.",
              "The team developed a computational model based on efficient coding, and it considers the limited neural bandwidth and contrast sensitivity functions to predict color appearance.",
              "This simple and generalizable model could predict almost all visual phenomena and illusions without requiring high-level processes.",
              "This suggests that limited bandwidth and efficient coding can explain many complex visual phenomena.",
              "A comprehensive understanding of color appearance is crucial for accurate modeling and application in various fields.",
              "The visual system can efficiently encode images of natural scenes due to photoreceptor adaptation and lateral inhibition.",
              "This allows for the optimal use of limited neural bandwidth and metabolic energy, a fundamental principle in early visual processing.",
              "A Spatiochromatic Bandwidth Limited, or SBL, model of early vision has been developed, which uses luminance, the sense of light and darkness, and chromatic spatial filters to cover the detectable range of spatial frequencies, how the retina determines something's relative location.",
              "This model predicts color and lightness and offers a framework for understanding neural image processing.",
              "The SBL model is designed to simulate the human visual system's information processing.",
              "It achieves this through a series of steps.",
              "In the first step, the image is filtered with spatial filters.",
              "Then the signal power in each channel is normalized to the filter's response to a natural scene.",
              "The last step is where the filter outputs are summed to recover their representation of the original image.",
              "The model comprises three spectral classes of filter that correspond to those in human vision: achromatic/luminance, blue-yellow, and red-green.",
              "For the latter two, the model assumes that the filters are less orientation selective.",
              "With these steps and spectral classes, the SBL model comprehensively simulates visual information processing, incorporating multiple filters and thresholds.",
              "Its implementation includes parameters based on psychophysical measurements.",
              "The study by researchers at the University of Exeter tested the SBL model for its ability to account for 52 perceptual phenomena that visual mechanisms could explain.",
              "It correctly predicted the direction of almost all effects with no free parameters and can be adjusted to predict all effects.",
              "The SBL model is a feed-forward model, meaning it does not require feedback loops for normalization and can explain many visual phenomena without delay.",
              "The model does not invoke light adaptation or eye movements and implies that color constancy is mainly independent of the adaptation state of the photoreceptors.",
              "The study yields invaluable insights into the performance of the SBL model.",
              "The findings suggest that grasping the concepts of limited bandwidth and efficient coding may unlock the secrets behind complex visual phenomena.",
              "By investigating visual perception, we inch closer to unraveling the mystery of how the human eye perceives and comprehends the world around us.",
              "The study highlights the crucial role of neural responses in visual illusions.",
              "Given its feed-forward architecture devoid of feedback loops, the model's high accuracy in predicting visual effects demonstrates its significance in understanding perception.",

              "one reason for this is that in everyday life contexts the illusion of a plane works perfectly well to guide us in the planning and execution of our actions (Carbon, 2010b).",
              "The limitations of perception are even more far reaching: our perception is not only limited when we do not have access to the thing in itself, it is very practically limited to the quality of processing and the general specifications of our perceptual system.",
              "For instance, our acoustic sense can only register and process a very narrow band of frequencies ranging from about 16 Hz\u201320 kHz as a young adult\u2014this band gets narrower and narrower with increasing age.",

              "So even objectivity of perceptions in the sense of consensual experience is hardly achievable, even within one species, even within one individual\u2014just think of fashion phenomena (Carbon, 2011a), of changes in taste (Martindale, 1990) or the so-called cycle of preferences (Carbon, 2010a)!",
              "Clearly, so-called objective perception is impossible, it is an illusion.",
              "The problem with the idea of veridical perception of the world is further intensified when taking additional perceptual phenomena, which demonstrate highly constructive qualities of our perceptual system, into account.",
              "A very prominent example of this kind is the perceptual effect which arises when any visual information which we want to process falls on the area of the retina where the so-called blind spot is located (see Figure \u200bFigure11).",
              "Demonstration of the blind spot, the area on the retina where visual information cannot be processed due to a lack of photoreceptors.",

              "Interestingly, visual information that is mapped on the blind spot is not just dropped\u2014this would be the easiest solution for the visual apparatus.",
              "It is also not rigidly interpolated, for instance, by just doubling neighbor information, but intelligently complemented by analysing the meaning and Gestalt of the context.",
              "If we, for example, are exposed to a couple of lines, the perceptual system would complement the physically non-existing information of the blind spot by a best guess heuristic how the lines are interconnected in each case, mostly yielding a very close approximation to \u201creality\u201d as it uses most probable solutions.",
              "Finally, we experience clear visual information, seemingly in the same quality as the one which mirrors physical perception\u2014in the end, the \u201cphysical perception\u201d and the \u201cconstructed perception\u201d, are of the same quality, also because the \u201cphysical perception\u201d is neither a depiction of physical reality, but is also constructed by top-down processes based on best guess heuristic as a kind of hypothesis testing or problem solving (Gregory, 1970).",
              "Beside this prominent example which has become common knowledge up to now, a series of further phenomena exist where we can speak of full perceptual constructions of the world outside without any direct link to the physical realities.",
              "A very intriguing example of this kind will be described in more detail in the following: When we make fast eye movements (so-called saccades) our perceptual system is suppressed, with the result that we are functionally blind during such saccades.",
              "Actually, we do not perceive these blind moments of life although they are highly frequent and relatively long as such\u2014actually, Rayner et al.",
              "estimated that typical fixations last about 200\u2013250 ms and saccades last about 20\u201340 ms (Rayner et al.",
              ", 2001), so about 10% of our time when we are awake is susceptible to such suppression effects.",
              "In accordance with other filling-in phenomena, missing data is filled up with the most plausible information: Such a process needs hypotheses about what is going on in the current situation and how the situation will evolve (Gregory, 1970, 1990).",
              "If the hypotheses are misleading because the underlying mental model of the situation and its further genesis is incorrect, we face an essential problem: what we then perceive (or fail to perceive) is incompatible with the current situation, and so will mislead our upcoming action.",
              "In most extreme cases, this could lead to fatal decisions: for instance: if the model does not construct a specific interfering object in our movement axis, we might miss information essential to changing our current trajectory resulting in a collision course.",

              "The iris, or the colorful part of the eye, regulates the amount of light let into the eye by controlling the size of the pupil.",
              "The light focuses directly onto the retina, a group of cells at the back of the eye responsible for transmitting signals to the brain.",
              "The retina contains two types of light-sensitive cells: rods and cones.",
              "Rods are highly sensitive and are responsible for detecting dim light, while cones respond best to bright light and are involved in color vision.",

              "The brain then processes the signals into images we can see and interpret.",
              "While our eyes can take in an incredible amount of information, the brain can only process so much at once, leading to shortcuts that simplify what we see.",

              "The SBL model is designed to simulate the human visual system's information processing.",
              "It achieves this through a series of steps.",
              "In the first step, the image is filtered with spatial filters.",
              "Then the signal power in each channel is normalized to the filter's response to a natural scene.",
              "The last step is where the filter outputs are summed to recover their representation of the original image.",
              "The model comprises three spectral classes of filter that correspond to those in human vision: achromatic/luminance, blue-yellow, and red-green.",
              "For the latter two, the model assumes that the filters are less orientation selective.",
              "With these steps and spectral classes, the SBL model comprehensively simulates visual information processing, incorporating multiple filters and thresholds.",
              "Its implementation includes parameters based on psychophysical measurements.",
              "The study by researchers at the University of Exeter tested the SBL model for its ability to account for 52 perceptual phenomena that visual mechanisms could explain.",
              "It correctly predicted the direction of almost all effects with no free parameters and can be adjusted to predict all effects.",
              "The SBL model is a feed-forward model, meaning it does not require feedback loops for normalization and can explain many visual phenomena without delay.",
