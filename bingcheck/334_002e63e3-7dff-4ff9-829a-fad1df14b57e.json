    "response": "Graffiti is a form of visual communication, usually illegal, involving the unauthorized marking of public space by an individual or group[^2^]. Graffiti ranges from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings, and has existed since ancient times, with examples dating back to ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and the Roman Empire[^4^]. Graffiti can be understood as an expressive art form or as a form of antisocial behaviour[^2^].\n\nThe modern graffiti movement started in Philadelphia in the 1960s, when the first graffiti writers \u201cCornbread\u201d and \u201cCool Earl\u201d started to use their black markers to tag themselves on all public property[^1^]. Graffiti soon spread to New York City and other major urban centres, where it became associated with gangs, hip hop culture, and social protest. Graffiti artists developed various styles and techniques, such as spray paint, stencils, wheat paste posters, and stickers, to create their distinctive works on walls, subways, billboards, and other surfaces[^2^] [^3^].\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s, graffiti gained more recognition and acceptance as a legitimate art form, with some graffiti artists exhibiting their works in galleries and museums. Some graffiti artists also became famous and influential, such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Banksy. Graffiti also influenced other art movements, such as street art and pop art. Graffiti today is a global phenomenon, with artists from different countries and cultures expressing their views and identities through their unique styles and messages[^3^].",

              "As Lachmann notes, rather than submitting to the criteria of valuation upheld by the institutionalized art world, early graffiti writers developed an entirely new and separate art world, based on their own \"qualitative conception of style\" and the particular \"aesthetic standards\" developed within the community for judging writers' content and technique.",

              "One of the earliest known street artists to use stencils was John Fekner, who started using the technique in 1968 to stencil purely textual messages onto walls.",
              "Other well-known stencil artists include French artists Ernest Pignon-Ernest and Blek le Rat, British artists Nick Walker and Banksy, and American artists Shepard Fairey and Above.",
              "Wheat paste (also known as flour paste) is a gel or liquid adhesive made from combining wheat flour or starch with water.",
              "Many street artists use wheat paste to adhere paper posters to walls.",
              "Much like stencils, wheat paste posters are preferable for street artists as it allows them to do most of the preparation at home or in the studio, with only a few moments needed at the site of installation, pasting the poster to the desired surface.",
              "This is crucial for artists installing works in unsanctioned locations, as it lowers the risk of apprehension and arrest.",
              "Some street artists who use the wheat paste method include Italian duo Sten and Lex, French artists JR and Ludo, and American artist Swoon.",
              "Some street artists create three-dimensional sculptural interventions, which can be installed surreptitiously in public spaces, usually under the cover of darkness.",
              "This type of work differs from Public Art in that it is rebellious in nature and completed illegally, while Public Art is officially sanctioned/commissioned (and thus more palatable to a general audience).",
              "Unsanctioned Street Art interventions usually aim to shock viewers by presenting a visually realistic, yet simultaneously unbelievable situation.",
              "For instance, in his Third Man Series (2006), artist Dan Witz installs gloves on sewer grates to give the impression that a person is inside the sewer attempting to escape.",
              "Works like these often cause passers-by to do a \"double-take.\"",
              "Reverse graffiti (also known as clean tagging, dust tagging, grime writing, clean graffiti, green graffiti, or clean advertising) is a method by which artists create images on walls or other surfaces by removing dirt from a surface.",
              "According to British reverse graffiti artist Moose, \"Once you do this, you make people confront whether or not they like people cleaning walls or if they really have a problem with personal expression.\"",
              "This sort of work calls attention to environmental concerns in urban spaces, such as pollution.",
              "There are street artists who experiment with other media, such as Invader (Paris), who adheres ceramic tiles to city surfaces, recreating images from the popular Space Invaders video game of 1978.",
              "Invader says that tile is \"a perfect material because it is permanent.",
              "Even after years of being outside the colors don't fade.\"",
              "Many other artists use simple stickers, which they post on surfaces around the city.",
              "Often, these stickers are printed with the artist's tag or a simple graphic.",
              "Others invite participation from the audience, like Ji Lee who pastes empty comic speech-bubbles onto advertisements, allowing passers-by to write in their own captions.",
              "Others still use natural materials to beautify urban spaces.",
              "For instance, in 2005, Shannon Spanhake planted flowers in various potholes of the streets in Tijuana, Mexico.",
              "She says of the project, \"Adorning the streets of Tijuana are potholes, open wounds that mark the failure of man's Promethean Project to tame nature, and somehow surviving in the margins are abandoned buildings, entropic monuments celebrating a hyperrealistic vision of a modernist utopia linked to capitalist expansion gone awry.\"",
              "There are also artists who create Street Art interventions through the use of clay, chalk, charcoal, knitting, and projected photo/video.",
              "The possibilities for Street Art media are endless.",
              "Street Art continues to be a popular category of art all over the world, with many of its practitioners rising to fame and mainstream success (such as Bristol's Banksy, Paris' ZEVS, and L.",
              "A.'",
              "s Shepard Fairey).",
              "Street artists who experience commercial success are often criticized by their peers for \"selling out\" and becoming part of the system that they had formerly rebelled against by creating illegal public works.",
              "Communications professor Tracey Bowen sees the act of creating graffiti as both a \"celebration of existence\" and \"a declaration of resistance.\"",
              "Similarly, Slovenian Feminist author Tea Hvala views graffiti as \"the most accessible medium of resistance\" for oppressed people to use against dominant culture due to its tactical (non-institutional, decentralized) qualities.",
              "For both Bowen and Hvala these unique positive attributes of graffiti are heavily reliant on its location in urban public spaces.",
              "Art critic and curator Johannes Stahl argues that the public context is crucial for Street Art to be political, because \"it happens in places that are accessible to all [and] it employs a means of expression that is not controlled by the government.\"",
              "Street artist BOOKSIIII holds an opinion not uncommon of many of today's street artists, that it is not inherently wrong for young artists to try to make money from galleries and corporations for their works, \"as long as they do their job honestly, sell work, and represent careers,\" yet at the same time he notes that \"graffiti does not stay the same when transferred to the gallery from the street.",
              "A tag on canvas will never hold the same power as the exact same tag on the street.\"",
              "This movement from the street to the gallery also indicates a growing acceptance of graffiti and Street Art within the mainstream art world and art history.",
              "Some apply the label \"post-graffiti\" to the work of street artists that also participate in the mainstream art world, although this is somewhat of a misnomer, as many such artists continue to execute illegal public interventions at the same time as they participate in sanctioned exhibitions in galleries and museums. This phenomenon also presents difficulties for art historians, as the sheer number of street artists, as well as their tendency to maintain anonymity, makes it hard to engage with individual artists in any sort of profound way.",
              "Moreover, it is difficult to insert Street Art into the art historical canon, as it did not develop from any progression of artistic movements, but rather began independently, with early graffiti and street artists developing their own unique techniques and aesthetic styles.",
              "Today, street artists both inspire and are inspired by many other artistic movements and styles, with many artists' works bearing elements of wide-ranging movements, from Pop Art to Renaissance Art.",
              "Street Art's status as vandalism often eclipses its status as art.",
              "More recently, as mentioned above, many artists are finding more opportunities to create artworks in sanctioned situations, by showing in galleries and museums, or by partnering with organizations that offer outdoor public spaces in which street artists are permitted to execute works.",
              "However, many others continue to focus on unsanctioned illegal works.",
              "Part of the allure of working illegally has to do with the adrenaline rush that artists get from successfully executing a piece without being apprehended by the authorities.",
              "Moreover, carrying out illegal/unsanctioned attacks on privately owned surfaces (such as a billboard being rented out by an advertising agency, or a politically-charged surface such as border walls), serves as a direct confrontation with the owner of that space (be it a marketing firm, or a political entity).",
              "With the advent of the Internet and the development of various graphic software and technologies, street artists now have a multitude of tools at their fingertips to assist in the creation and dissemination of their works.",
              "Specialized computer programs allow artists (like San Francisco-born MOMO) to better plan for their graffiti pieces and prepare their stencils and wheat paste posters, while digital photography used in conjunction with the Internet and social media allows Street Art works to be documented, shared, and thus immortalized where previously, most pieces tended to disappear when they were removed by city authorities or painted over by other artists.",

              "His name became synonymous with graffiti, inspiring countless others to take up the spray can and leave their own marks on the walls of New York.",

              "Jean-Michel Basquiat: A Visionary Voice of the Streets Jean-Michel Basquiat, born on December 22, 1960, in Brooklyn, New York, was a prodigious artist whose immense talent and unique perspective left an indelible mark on the art world.",

              "His bold and cryptic messages, often accompanied by a crown symbol, appeared on walls across the city, engaging with the vibrant street art and hip-hop culture of the time.",
              "Basquiat's graffiti work caught the attention of the art world, and he transitioned from the streets to galleries in the early 1980s.",
              "He quickly garnered acclaim for his unique artistic style, characterised by a fusion of expressive brushwork, vibrant colours, and a distinct blend of text and image.",

              "Years after his retirement from the craft of writing on walls \u2014 which he did under the name DENSKE \u2014 Livingston found himself at a Drexel University-hosted screening of Henry Chalfant\u2019s classic film Style Wars.",
              "Vexed by the lack of acknowledgment of graffiti\u2019s Philly origins, Livingston challenged Chalfant and the film\u2019s New York-centric narrative during the screening\u2019s Q&A.",
              "\u201cI said \u2018it clearly states in the film that you say that graffiti started in New York in 1971 with a kid named Taki (famed Washington Heights graf writer TAKI 183) from Washington Heights.",

              "\u201d In the years since this happened, there has been widespread acceptance of graffiti\u2019s origins in Philly via origins, but in that moment that wasn\u2019t the case, so Livingston got to work telling the real story.",

              "Despite the strengths of this study, which is one of the first to assess the relationship between gang graffiti and gang violence in physical and temporal space, findings must be interpreted with potential limitations in mind.",
              "First, we relied on official police data to measure gang violence.",
              "Although this is common practice, it is widely known that police data are dependent on citizen reports and police behaviors, both of which vary systematically across neighborhoods.",
              "These data also may not accurately capture the gang status of the offender and victim.",
              "However, serious infractions such as those under investigation in this study likely are carefully vetted by the police gang bureau and other special investigations detectives who are knowledgeable about local gang activity and affiliations.",
              "Footnote 14 Moreover, comparisons of police gang records with other sources of gang data, including both probation records and surveys of law enforcement agencies, suggest high levels of congruence and accuracy (Decker and Pyrooz 2010;",
              "Katz et al.",
              "2000).",
              "Second are potential limitations associated with our reliance on a private company, Graffiti Tracker, for sampling and coding of graffiti data.",
              "Graffiti Tracker is alerted to graffiti incidents by the city abatement team, which consists of small crews responding to citizen reports and conducting proactive patrols during regular work hours.",
              "We do not know the proportion of information provided by each source, nor do we know the extent to which either was biased toward or away from graffiti in certain areas or places.",
              "The incidents of graffiti included in our data are those that were detected and of sufficient concern to be reported;",
              "graffiti in certain parts of the city, such as remote industrial areas, hidden spots under a bridge, or places and objects vandalized repeatedly, may not be captured as often or at all.",
              "However, given our exclusion of airport grid cells, what is known about the motives of graffiti writers and the spot selection process (Ferrell and Weide 2010), evidence from photos of a single instance of graffiti occurring over layers of older ones, and heat maps showing broad geographic coverage of graffiti incidents, we suspect graffiti of all types is rare in areas outside the purview of concerned citizens and members of the abatement team, whose efforts to canvas the city while responding to complaints are supported by volunteers and partner organizations with the mission of keeping the city clean and free of graffiti and litter.",
              "Of potentially greater concern, then, is the coding by Graffiti Tracker analysts.",
              "State and city gang databases cannot be consulted to verify gang identities and members because they are woefully inadequate, and it can be difficult to trace connections between all variants of graffiti used by the same gang and to accurately capture \u201clongitudinal dialog\u201d occurring over time between people who may not know one another and that feature cryptic symbols and meanings, cross-outs and add-ons, utterances distributed across multiple spots and times, \u201cturns\u201d or changes in the graffiti or graffiti writers, and writings left unfinished for any number of reasons, such as to avoid oncoming police (Adams and Winter 1997;",
              "Brighenti 2010).",
              "However, the list of local gangs and tagger crews maintained by Graffiti Tracker has been built over many years and analyses of hundreds of thousands of incidents of graffiti, and our analysis of a 5% sample of graffiti incidents revealed strong inter-rater reliability.",
              "In addition, although the difficulty of identifying gang turf\u2014both by locals and perhaps especially by analysts located in another state\u2014likely introduces an unknown amount of coding error, we suspect the majority of these errors involve a territorial boast or claim being coded incorrectly (but in the same \u201cnon-threatening\u201d gang graffiti category) as publicity.",
              "The risk of a territorial boast or claim written near or inside rival turf being coded as territorial (non-threatening) rather than as a graffiti threat or form of disrespect is negligible, as indicated by the infrequency of territorial graffiti in the data (2.",
              "2% of all gang graffiti).",
              "Third, despite the longitudinal nature of our data, we were unable to establish temporal order definitively because the exact date when graffiti was written could not be determined and so had to be approximated using date of removal.",
              "Still, given extensive and rapid coverage and abatement, differences between date of appearance and date of removal likely are minimal and shorter than the full duration of back-and-forth escalation and de-escalation of gang conflict.",
              "Moreover, while we have interpreted findings consistent with the group process perspective, the reverse causal process in which gang violence precedes gang graffiti is both plausible and theoretically interesting and expected as well (e.",
              "g., sympathetic graffiti following the murder of a homie and before violent retaliation).",
              "Fourth, while we control for the effects of known neighborhood covariates of gang activity and all unobserved time-stable differences between neighborhood grid cells, we are unable to prove that gang graffiti influences gang violence through a contagion process involving status threats and retaliatory actions, including additional status threats and violence escalation.",
              "However, even if graffiti merely is an indicator of gang density and geographic proximity, without retaliatory implications, it helps to know the risk of gang violence will be greatest in places with a higher density of gang graffiti.",
              "In supplementary analyses, we found gang violence to be significantly associated with both between- and within-neighborhood grid cell increases in gang graffiti (results available upon request).",
              "This suggests that, rather than being a spurious function of neighborhood differences in gang and gang member density, the association between gang graffiti and gang violence reflects a tendency for these two phenomena to trend together over time even within the same neighborhood and at a rate that would be difficult to explain solely in terms of neighborhood increases in the gang population.",
              "Finally, as with any geographic study, perfect correspondence cannot be expected between units of analysis and the neighborhoods they are intended to represent.",
              "After partitioning the city into symmetric and equally distributed micro-geographic areas allowing for calculation of spatial densities, we used interpolation models and inverse distance weighting to capture the socio-economic context and effects of individual units and surrounding areas.",
              "This approach enabled us to focus on micro-areas consistent with local understandings of gang territory, dealt directly with asymmetric street layouts, and \u201clargely solve[d] the problem of assigning the geocoded crimes to the correct unit\u201d (Stucky and Ottensman 2009, p.",
              "1261).",
              "Although there is a slight possibility of gang violence intersecting a grid cell boundary, this is unlikely to affect substantive conclusions given the small size of grid cells, smoothing of graffiti estimates over a half-mile radius, and controls for spatial autocorrelation.",
              "The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between gang graffiti and gang violence.",
              "Gang graffiti often is indistinguishable from general tags in form, style, and function, but it is unique in that it may involve turf marking and/or disrespect the status and identity of rival gangs and gang members.",
              "Consistent with the group process perspective, we hypothesized that gang graffiti would predict gang violence independently of neighborhood-level covariates, because gang graffiti is a subcultural means of communication that facilitates group processes associated with violence, such as identification of an out-group as a common enemy and existing threat.",
              "Analyzing a combination of data sources and employing a modeling strategy that addressed the effects of proximal spatial and temporal units, we found the spatial density of graffiti to be associated with statistically significant increases in rates of gang homicide, assault, and firearm offenses, net of the effects of a range of observed and unobserved neighborhood characteristics.",
              "Unlike these expressive forms of violence, which may align more closely with group processes leading to retaliatory violence, gang robbery involves an instrumental component and was unrelated to gang graffiti in our data.",
              "For the city under investigation in this study, the main predictors of gang robbery were high concentrations of commercial and high-risk establishments, where target victims may be particularly attractive (see Barnum et al.",
              "2017, for an analysis of city-level variation in spatial risk factors for robbery).",
              "Somewhat unexpectedly, the relationship with both gang homicide and gang assault was stronger for non-threatening gang graffiti than gang graffiti involving explicit threats or disrespect.",
              "This may due to a higher proportion of these cases capturing intra-gang violence, such as would occur if increased hanging and drinking are associated with more non-threatening graffiti (e.",
              "g., publicity and roll call) and physical beatings and killing.",
              "In addition, while threatening and disrespectful types of gang graffiti appear to be an important part of group processes leading to violence, gang graffiti of any type may be sufficiently threatening to function as a step in the sequence of events leading ultimately to violent action.",
              "As noted by Sanchez-Tranquilino (1995, p.",
              "77), \u201cone youth gang\u2019s graffiti inscribed inside a contending youth gang\u2019s territory would constitute a public notice to everyone concerned that an attempt was in the offing to appropriate more territory.",
              "\u201d Not only might this be accompanied by violent action, but it also could be interpreted as disrespectful and necessary to meet with violence in order to maintain status.",
              "In an era of rapid population growth and shrinking turfs resulting from gentrification, gangs increasingly occupy contested spaces in which \u201cany utterance by a rival gang member can be treated as antagonistic\u201d (Adams and Winter 1997, p.",

              "From a policy standpoint, our findings suggest the possibility of reducing expressive forms of gang violence by using gang graffiti as strategic intelligence needed to intervene effectively to minimize threat and disrupt escalation and contagion processes.",

              "g., through social media and informants), especially because not all gang violence is accompanied by graffiti, it seems clear gang graffiti is a means of inter-gang communication and an important part of group processes and behaviors in the streets.",

              "Wheatpasting is an art form that has been around since ancient times, though its modern uses are often associated with street culture and urban areas.",
              "It involves the application of wheat paste to a surface, usually paper or cardstock, in order to attach posters or artwork for display purposes \u2013 thus gaining it the moniker \u2018wheatpaste poster\u2019.",
              "The use of wheat paste dates back thousands of years, however its emergence as an artistic medium can be traced from Ancient Egypt through to Medieval Europe.",
              "The production of wheat paste requires only a few basic ingredients;",
              "flour and water are combined together to create a mixture which is then heated until it thickens into a sticky substance known as adhesive wheat starch.",
              "This material forms the backbone of any wheatpaste project \u2013 whether you\u2019re creating an elaborate installation piece or just putting up some quick flyers on your local telephone poles.",
              "Various additives may also be added to enhance the binding or drying properties of the glue depending on what type work is being done.",
              "From large scale street murals to small-scale window displays, wheat pasting offers artists numerous opportunities to express their creativity in public spaces without requiring expensive equipment or materials.",
              "Wheatpastes have been used by many renowned contemporary artists such as Banksy, Swoon and Shepard Fairey who have become well known for their distinctive style and engaging visuals.",
              "In recent years there has been an increasing trend towards using digital prints for wheatpasted works instead of traditional hand painted pieces due to their ease of production and affordability.",
              "However, regardless of how they are created, these vibrant installations offer viewers a unique glimpse into the creative minds behind them while providing something visually stimulating for passersby alike.",
              "Wheatpasting is an art form that has been around for centuries, yet its history and origin remain unknown.",
              "It\u2019s a popular medium for street artists to communicate their messages and create artwork in public spaces.",
              "Coincidentally, wheatpasting was also used by advertisers as early as the 19th century when they needed to quickly put up posters or advertisements on walls or other surfaces.",
              "The process of making wheatpaste is relatively simple;",
              "it involves mixing flour with water until a thick paste is formed which can then be applied directly onto objects such as paper or walls using brushes or sticks.",
              "The mixture holds firmly once dried and has become a staple in many street artist\u2019s toolbox over time due to its affordability, effectiveness and portability.",
              "Street poster art became hugely popular during the 1960s, primarily among counterculture movements like Punk Rock who used wheatpastes to spread their messages through graffiti-style murals.",
              "This trend slowly but surely gained popularity and today, many cities have embraced this method of expression as part of urban culture \u2013 often commissioning local artists to create large scale pieces of work across entire city blocks.",
              "Although wheatpasting might appear deceptively easy at first glance, there are some important considerations one must take into account before embarking on a project: what type of surface will you use?",
              "What materials do you need?",
              "How long will your project last?",
              "Answering these questions ensures the success of any wheatpasting venture.",
              "A thorough understanding of how to make wheatpaste along with thoughtful consideration towards the medium itself would enable anyone looking to experiment with this style of art form whether for personal projects or commercial purposes.",
              "Wheatpasting is a popular form of street art that has been used by artists and activists alike to spread their message.",
              "This method involves affixing posters or other printed materials onto surfaces in public areas such as walls, sidewalks, streets, etc.",
              "Through wheatpasting, these messages can easily be seen by viewers while also allowing the artist to remain anonymous.",
              "Wheatpasting is considered an accessible way for anyone with access to poster paper and glue to create artwork on often neglected urban spaces.",
              "The process of wheatpasting begins with preparing the surface where the artwork will be placed.",
              "Depending on what type of wall it is and how sticky the adhesive needs to be, different types of glue must be used in order to ensure that the work stays up for extended periods of time without falling off or fading away.",
              "In addition, creating a wheat paste recipe using flour and water is necessary in order to make a strong enough bond between the paper material and surface when putting up posters.",
              "Furthermore, careful planning should take place beforehand regarding placement so that passersby have ample opportunity to view the art piece from multiple angles over an area rather than just one spot.",
              "Once all preparations are done, it\u2019s time for installation!",
              "The artist dips pieces of paper into the wheat paste mixture before applying them onto pre-prepared surfaces in various locations around town \u2013 always keeping safety measures in mind.",
              "It\u2019s important not only adhere to any existing laws related to posting anything outdoors but also pay attention to weather conditions like wind speed and humidity which may affect adhesion strength if they become too extreme.",
              "In some cases large scale installations require scaffolding or climbing ladders due to height restrictions;",
              "however smaller projects generally suffice with ground level applications alone.",
              "As long as proper technique is observed during application (e.",

              "Wheatpasting is an increasingly popular form of street art, yet some may still question the techniques and materials required to put a poster on the wall.",
              "In order to understand how wheatpasting works, it is important to consider both the materials and methods used.",
              "Firstly, there are several tools that can be used for wheatpasting.",
              "These include large brushes, rollers, squeegees or even hands for small-scale projects.",
              "The paint tray should also not be forgotten;",
              "it usually contains glue or paste which helps adhere paper posters onto walls.",
              "This type of adhesive could range from wallpaper paste to regular flour-and water mixtures.",
              "Furthermore, one must remember to wear gloves during this process as skin contact with these adhesives can cause irritation.",
              "The technique itself is relatively straightforward \u2013 depending upon the size of the project \u2013 but requires careful attention throughout each step in order to ensure proper adherence of the poster onto the surface being pasted.",
              "Generally speaking, one will start by cutting out desired shapes or images from simple brown craft paper before applying paste directly onto a painted wall using either a brush or roller (or sometimes hands).",

              "Also, the effect on the viewer is instant, you don't need to wait for it to sink in.\"",
              "One of the earliest known street artists to use stencils was John Fekner, who started using the technique in 1968 to stencil purely textual messages onto walls.",
              "Other well-known stencil artists include French artists Ernest Pignon-Ernest and Blek le Rat, British artists Nick Walker and Banksy, and American artists Shepard Fairey and Above.",
              "Wheat paste (also known as flour paste) is a gel or liquid adhesive made from combining wheat flour or starch with water.",
              "Many street artists use wheat paste to adhere paper posters to walls.",
              "Much like stencils, wheat paste posters are preferable for street artists as it allows them to do most of the preparation at home or in the studio, with only a few moments needed at the site of installation, pasting the poster to the desired surface.",
              "This is crucial for artists installing works in unsanctioned locations, as it lowers the risk of apprehension and arrest.",
              "Some street artists who use the wheat paste method include Italian duo Sten and Lex, French artists JR and Ludo, and American artist Swoon.",
              "Some street artists create three-dimensional sculptural interventions, which can be installed surreptitiously in public spaces, usually under the cover of darkness.",
              "This type of work differs from Public Art in that it is rebellious in nature and completed illegally, while Public Art is officially sanctioned/commissioned (and thus more palatable to a general audience).",
              "Unsanctioned Street Art interventions usually aim to shock viewers by presenting a visually realistic, yet simultaneously unbelievable situation.",
              "For instance, in his Third Man Series (2006), artist Dan Witz installs gloves on sewer grates to give the impression that a person is inside the sewer attempting to escape.",
              "Works like these often cause passers-by to do a \"double-take.\"",
              "Reverse graffiti (also known as clean tagging, dust tagging, grime writing, clean graffiti, green graffiti, or clean advertising) is a method by which artists create images on walls or other surfaces by removing dirt from a surface.",
              "According to British reverse graffiti artist Moose, \"Once you do this, you make people confront whether or not they like people cleaning walls or if they really have a problem with personal expression.\"",
              "This sort of work calls attention to environmental concerns in urban spaces, such as pollution.",
              "There are street artists who experiment with other media, such as Invader (Paris), who adheres ceramic tiles to city surfaces, recreating images from the popular Space Invaders video game of 1978.",
              "Invader says that tile is \"a perfect material because it is permanent.",
              "Even after years of being outside the colors don't fade.\"",
              "Many other artists use simple stickers, which they post on surfaces around the city.",
              "Often, these stickers are printed with the artist's tag or a simple graphic.",
              "Others invite participation from the audience, like Ji Lee who pastes empty comic speech-bubbles onto advertisements, allowing passers-by to write in their own captions.",
              "Others still use natural materials to beautify urban spaces.",
              "For instance, in 2005, Shannon Spanhake planted flowers in various potholes of the streets in Tijuana, Mexico.",
              "She says of the project, \"Adorning the streets of Tijuana are potholes, open wounds that mark the failure of man's Promethean Project to tame nature, and somehow surviving in the margins are abandoned buildings, entropic monuments celebrating a hyperrealistic vision of a modernist utopia linked to capitalist expansion gone awry.\"",
              "There are also artists who create Street Art interventions through the use of clay, chalk, charcoal, knitting, and projected photo/video.",
              "The possibilities for Street Art media are endless.",
              "Street Art continues to be a popular category of art all over the world, with many of its practitioners rising to fame and mainstream success (such as Bristol's Banksy, Paris' ZEVS, and L.",
              "A.'",
              "s Shepard Fairey).",
              "Street artists who experience commercial success are often criticized by their peers for \"selling out\" and becoming part of the system that they had formerly rebelled against by creating illegal public works.",
              "Communications professor Tracey Bowen sees the act of creating graffiti as both a \"celebration of existence\" and \"a declaration of resistance.\"",
              "Similarly, Slovenian Feminist author Tea Hvala views graffiti as \"the most accessible medium of resistance\" for oppressed people to use against dominant culture due to its tactical (non-institutional, decentralized) qualities.",
              "For both Bowen and Hvala these unique positive attributes of graffiti are heavily reliant on its location in urban public spaces.",
              "Art critic and curator Johannes Stahl argues that the public context is crucial for Street Art to be political, because \"it happens in places that are accessible to all [and] it employs a means of expression that is not controlled by the government.\"",
              "Street artist BOOKSIIII holds an opinion not uncommon of many of today's street artists, that it is not inherently wrong for young artists to try to make money from galleries and corporations for their works, \"as long as they do their job honestly, sell work, and represent careers,\" yet at the same time he notes that \"graffiti does not stay the same when transferred to the gallery from the street.",
              "A tag on canvas will never hold the same power as the exact same tag on the street.\"",
              "This movement from the street to the gallery also indicates a growing acceptance of graffiti and Street Art within the mainstream art world and art history.",
              "Some apply the label \"post-graffiti\" to the work of street artists that also participate in the mainstream art world, although this is somewhat of a misnomer, as many such artists continue to execute illegal public interventions at the same time as they participate in sanctioned exhibitions in galleries and museums. This phenomenon also presents difficulties for art historians, as the sheer number of street artists, as well as their tendency to maintain anonymity, makes it hard to engage with individual artists in any sort of profound way.",
              "Moreover, it is difficult to insert Street Art into the art historical canon, as it did not develop from any progression of artistic movements, but rather began independently, with early graffiti and street artists developing their own unique techniques and aesthetic styles.",
              "Today, street artists both inspire and are inspired by many other artistic movements and styles, with many artists' works bearing elements of wide-ranging movements, from Pop Art to Renaissance Art.",
              "Street Art's status as vandalism often eclipses its status as art.",
              "More recently, as mentioned above, many artists are finding more opportunities to create artworks in sanctioned situations, by showing in galleries and museums, or by partnering with organizations that offer outdoor public spaces in which street artists are permitted to execute works.",
              "However, many others continue to focus on unsanctioned illegal works.",
              "Part of the allure of working illegally has to do with the adrenaline rush that artists get from successfully executing a piece without being apprehended by the authorities.",
              "Moreover, carrying out illegal/unsanctioned attacks on privately owned surfaces (such as a billboard being rented out by an advertising agency, or a politically-charged surface such as border walls), serves as a direct confrontation with the owner of that space (be it a marketing firm, or a political entity).",
              "With the advent of the Internet and the development of various graphic software and technologies, street artists now have a multitude of tools at their fingertips to assist in the creation and dissemination of their works.",
              "Specialized computer programs allow artists (like San Francisco-born MOMO) to better plan for their graffiti pieces and prepare their stencils and wheat paste posters, while digital photography used in conjunction with the Internet and social media allows Street Art works to be documented, shared, and thus immortalized where previously, most pieces tended to disappear when they were removed by city authorities or painted over by other artists.",

              "From the outside looking in, graffiti writing seems chaotic and mindless.",
              "It\u2019s almost as if there are no rules that graffiti artists follow when they paint.",
              "But what if I told you that instead of rules, there is style.",

              "Find out about the top 18 most popular graffiti styles you need to know, what defines them and what makes them unique.",
              "Contents A tag can be defined as a stylised signature of the graffiti artist\u2019s name, often done quickly on a public surface.",
              "Tags are the most common style of graffiti and often the starting point for new graffiti artists.",
              "Tags can be found in every graffiti culture worldwide because they\u2019re the earliest method of modern-day graffiti \u2013 with graffiti writers like Cornbread from Philadelphia being the first to do a graffiti tag in 1965.",
              "Some claim that without tags, we wouldn\u2019t have vibrant, detailed and colourful graffiti such as murals.",
              "This is because most graffiti artists\u2019 work originates from a single tag.",
              "And as artists evolve their style, their name becomes more stylised to include elements like 3D effects and colours.",
              "The most common tools for graffiti tags include spray paint and marker pens.",
              "Throw-ups are a style of graffiti characterised by rounded bubble letters with minimal negative space painted quickly (or \u2018thrown-up\u2019) on a surface.",
              "The throw-up is usually the next progression from a tag.",
              "This comes as graffiti artists get more familiar with letter structures and strive for their names to be painted bigger, whilst also maintaining speed.",
              "By avoiding negative space, sharp edges and intricate details, throw-ups are able to be painted quickly.",
              "Throw-ups contain two colours of paint \u2013 one for the fill and one for the outline.",
              "High pressure spray paint is the medium of choice for throw-ups as the high output allows for maximum speed.",
              "Two letter throw-ups share a similar style to regular throw-ups, but they instead only contain two letters of the graffiti writer\u2019s tag.",
              "Most commonly, the first two letters.",
              "This style of throw-up allows graffiti writers to paint their names up even faster, whilst also being able to fit into smaller spaces where a full throw-up isn\u2019t possible.",
              "JA One from New York and Oker from London are two infamous graffiti artists who are well known for their two letter throw-ups.",
              "Hollows are similar to throw-ups, except they only feature the letter outline in one colour with no fill-in.",
              "Hollows are another way to paint which allows for even more speed whilst also going big, all whilst being an efficient use of paint.",
              "Hollow graffiti is notoriously hard, however, as it can be obvious when lines have been done poorly.",
              "With only one colour and no fill-in to hide any errors, it\u2019s difficult to fix mistakes.",
              "Because of their difficulty, hollows can be a good display of a graffiti artist\u2019s skill as they require exceptional can control for them to look clean.",
              "A straight letter piece is defined by its big, bold and often more readable letters in combination with the graffiti artist\u2019s personal flare.",
              "This style of graffiti is commonly the next progression from a throw-up as it contains more detailed, sharper edges and has more negative space.",
              "A straight letter is usually painted with speed in mind and uses only 2 \u2013 4 colours in a piece.",
              "In London graffiti culture, a straight letter piece painted with silver chrome and black is commonly known as a \u2018Dub\u2019.",
              "A full colour piece is similar to a straight letter piece, but is much more stylised in appearance and contains more colours.",
              "This style of graffiti is much more detailed and usually features a 3D or shadow, a background and sometimes a character depending on the artist\u2019s style.",
              "Spray paint is the essential medium for full colour pieces, although artists may also use emulsion paint with a paint roller to prepare the wall.",
              "This gives them a neutral background so no graffiti underneath distracts from the piece.",
              "Wildstyle is one of the most advanced styles of graffiti, containing many complex and intricate details including letters usually only readable by other graffiti artists.",
              "Elements like arrows, 3D, spikes, flares and sharp edges define wildstyle graffiti.",
              "However, to non-graffiti artists, these elaborate details can make it difficult to read the artist\u2019s name.",
              "As a strong display of a graffiti writer\u2019s skill, the complexity of this style continues to evolve across the globe.",
              "Legendary graffiti writer Tracy 168 (RIP) is widely known as being the king of wildstyle graffiti, having pushed this style in mid-1970s NYC across the subway system and the city walls.",
              "A blockbuster is a style of graffiti characterised by huge straight letters painted using only 2 \u2013 3 colours.",
              "Both spray paint and/or emulsion paint can be used to create blockbuster pieces.",
              "Although a blockbuster can be painted anywhere, they\u2019re commonly found on large surfaces that are distanced from public view.",
              "This means that there is a need to go huge in order to be seen, as a normal-sized piece may be missed.",
              "Common spots include highways, rooftops and abandoned buildings \u2013 but you can find blockbusters anywhere.",
              "Murals are large pieces of street art containing faces, characters, objects, abstract designs and sometimes letters often painted with permission.",
              "The line between graffiti and street art becomes blurred with murals, as the previous graffiti styles we\u2019ve covered have been primarily name-based.",
              "Murals do not always contain a name or a tag, which puts them more in the category of street art.",
              "As murals are usually commissioned, artists are able to spend as much time as they need to perfect their work, which is often not the case for other graffiti styles.",
              "Also unlike the other styles we\u2019ve looked at, murals are usually painted for everyone to appreciate \u2013 not just graffiti artists.",
              "Some mural artists aim to send a message, provoke a thought or pay tribute to someone or something through their work.",
              "Roller graffiti (also known as roll-ups) is a style that uses emulsion paint along with paint rollers to produce big pieces in hard-to-reach places.",
              "A big limitation of spray paint is that unless you have access to a ladder, you\u2019re only able to paint as high as you can reach.",
              "But by using an extended paint roller instead, graffiti artists can access spaces previously inaccessible with spray paint without needing a ladder.",
              "Roller graffiti can be much cheaper too, as a bucket of emulsion paint goes much further than a can of spray paint.",
              "Anti-style (also known as hipster graffiti and ignorant style) is a type of graffiti that completely ignores traditional graffiti conventions.",
              "By ignoring these conventions, anti-style writers are strictly \u201cagainst\u201d any graffiti traditional style.",
              "Although anti-style can be found around the world, it\u2019s one of the rarer types of graffiti.",
              "This is because many artists strive for respect and recognition, which is hard to achieve as an anti-style writer because this style only appeals to a small minority of graffiti artists.",
              "Anti-style can be hard to look at as pieces lack composition and flow.",
              "With no rules to follow, anti-style can be produced using any type of graffiti paint.",
              "Sticker art (also known as sticker slapping and sticker bombing) is a common type of graffiti where artists either write on blank stickers or print names and images on stickers and stick them up in public.",
              "Although originating in New York, this style of graffiti can be found all across the world.",
              "Sticker art is unique as it\u2019s not just used as a means of increasing someone\u2019s profile through a tag like traditional graffiti.",
              "Stickers are also often used to raise awareness of social issues and to promote political agendas.",
              "Although some brands have designed stickers that are difficult to remove, sticker bombing is regarded as a minor form of graffiti.",
              "This is because most stickers can be more easily peeled off compared to removing paint.",
              "Stencil graffiti or stencil art is a style that uses a sheet of card, plastic or metal with shapes cut out of it.",
              "Artists then put the sheet on a surface and use spray paint to fill in the cut-out shapes, producing their artwork.",
              "Stencil graffiti was made famous by Banksy through his popular pieces Girl with Balloon and Flower Thrower.",
              "Since then, stencil graffiti has become more popular and often inherits a political or social message which is aimed at the wider public.",
              "In graffiti culture, stencils are not a well-respected type of graffiti due to the lack of skill needed to produce a stencil piece.",
              "Although not strictly a graffiti style, a heaven spot is a piece painted in a high-up and difficult place.",
              "As the name suggests, heaven relates to being high up in the sky.",
              "But it\u2019s also the place a writer might end up if they fall.",
              "Heaven spots can range from rooftops, towers, highway signs and more.",
              "Pretty much any graffiti piece which is high up in the air.",
              "Graffiti writers who are able to reach these spots are more likely to be seen and gain more respect for taking on the risk.",
              "Both spray paint and emulsion paint are common tools for painting heaven spots.",
              "Wheat paste is a style that uses wheat flour or starch mixed with water to adhere paper imagery to a surface.",
              "Like stencils, stickers and murals \u2013 wheat paste falls more into the category of street art than traditional graffiti.",
              "This is because it focuses on images and symbols instead of a graffiti name.",
              "Wheat paste posters also often try to provoke a social or political message as they\u2019re commonly used by activist groups to raise awareness for their cause.",
              "Etched graffiti is a style where graffiti writers mix an acid solution into a marker pen to burn their tags on glass permanently.",
              "Beyond the usual risks of graffiti, etching can be very dangerous as it involves the handling of corrosive acids.",
              "Despite this, it\u2019s a common style of graffiti that can be found worldwide \u2013 especially in major cities.",
              "It\u2019s also one of the most expensive forms of graffiti to remove as etched tags can\u2019t be removed with cleaning products.",
              "Instead, the glass must be replaced.",
              "This adds to its appeal as etched tags aren\u2019t usually removed due to the cost of replacing an entire glass pane.",
              "Calligraphy graffiti (or calligraffiti) combines traditional calligraphy lettering with elements of graffiti culture.",
              "This style of graffiti can be achieved using many different art supplies, such as calligraphy marker pens, calligraphy caps on spray paint and paintbrushes.",
              "Because it\u2019s possible to do with many different mediums, calligraphy graffiti can range from tags, straight letter pieces, full-colour pieces and murals.",
              "Pichac\u0327a\u0303o (pronounced pi-cha-c\u0327a\u0303o) is a unique style of graffiti native to Sa\u0303o Paulo.",
              "Roughly translated to \u201cwall writings\u201d, Pichac\u0327a\u0303o is a form of tagging it\u2019s known for its cryptic lettering painted in hard to reach places across cities in Brazil.",
              "Although Pichac\u0327a\u0303o writing began in the 1970s as a form of political and social protest, modern Pichac\u0327a\u0303o writers instead use it as a way to promote their graffiti name \u2013 much like traditional name-based graffiti.",
              "Pichac\u0327a\u0303o can be easily recognised by its thin and aggressive lettering made possible by the use of spray paint, paintbrushes and paint rollers.",

              "But Graffiti art as we know it was born in 1970s New York, when people started to use the medium of spray paints to leave their unique signature on public spaces of every kind.",
              "Graffiti has many forms, from the stylised graphic imagery known as wildstyle to boldly aesthetic ciphers, commonly known as as tags and unique to each artist.",
              "Street Art and Graffiti are two terms that often go hand in hand.",
              "Both art forms happen in the public arena.",
              "However, Street art, as a category of artistic production, is a much broader identifier in regards to its lack of characteristic limitations on style and medium.",
              "Comparatively, contemporary Graffiti art is fairly narrow in its identification, centering on the concept of tagging and emphasizing a text-based aesthetic.",
              "Street art, meanwhile, extends to a wide range of media, from stencils to video projections.",
              "Although somewhat confined in terms of categorization, contemporary Graffiti is created in a huge range of styles and techniques.",
              "The primary Graffiti form is the tag.",
              "Tags, put simple, are names of individual artists spray painted or stenciled onto public surfaces in a highly stylised manner.",
              "Associated with tags and tagging is the Throw-Up, an elaborated tag that usually features more colour variance and complicated design.",
              "Since tagging is most often executed on property that does not belong to the artist, it is sometimes considered vandalism.",
              "However, the art of taking up space that is technically \u2018off-limits\u2019 is a means by which to explore concepts of hierarchy, ownership, and creative freedom.",

              "Around 1970-71 the center of Graffiti culture shifted from Philadelphia to New York City.",
              "In predominantly black neighborhoods like Washington Heights, Graffiti artists began making a name and building artist collective.",
              "Artists like TAKI 183 and Tracy 168 started to gain notoriety for their frequent illegal tagging.",
              "Using a tagging convention in which their moniker combined their street address with their nickname, these artists \u201cbombed\u201d subway trains with their mark, letting the train dissipate their work across the city.",

              "As the art form grew, it came to transcend lettering and incorporated abstract and figurative compositions to accompany the text, something which has a role to play in its eventual commercial success.",
              "Wildstyle and Bubble are terms used to describe more complex aerosol paintings that were more difficult to read and resembled abstract compositions of interlocking forms and letters.",
              "Occasionally, artists will choose to work with brushes in order to add more detail to the imagery.",
              "Abstract art became increasingly influential in the Graffiti scene throughout the 1980s, perhaps due to the growing commercial success of artists like Jackson Pollock and Jean-Michele Basquiat, the latter combining elements of street and abstract art in his neo-expressionist paintings.",
              "With the integration of the abstract, artists focused primarily on the pure aestheticism of the piece, combining color, shape and line to create a visually balanced composition.",
              "By the 1990s, Graffiti became a world popular subculture.",
              "Artists like Banksy and Blek le Rat reached global recognition with their stencil style art pieces.",
              "Graffiti had officially hit the mainstream.",

              "In more recent years, with the popularity and intrigue for Graffiti art growing, a number of Street artists, including Banksy, have presented their work in commercial gallery settings.",
              "The increase in the popularity of Graffiti and urban artistic culture more broadly has spurred many traditional Graffiti artists to combine their street style and techniques with more traditional, studio-based practices.",
              "Graffiti, especially in the past twenty years, has managed to shake off its association with vandalism and public defacement and has entered the realm of high art.",
              "While some of the original New York Graffiti artists of the 70s such as Lady Pink, Crash and Daze were able to cross into the commercial gallery scene, it is only now that this combination of street and studio style is becoming common practice."

              "2 The article, published on July 21st 1971 and entitled \u201cTaki 183 Spawns Pen Pals,\u201d briefly explained how this writer, whose alias referred to his address (he lived in the northern part of Harlem, on 183rd Street), took advantage of his job as a courier to write his name wherever he could during his working hours.",
              "5This recognition by the media established Taki 183 as the trailblazer of the movement in New York.",
              "He was followed shortly by writers like Joe 136, Barbara and Eva 62, Eel 159, Yank 135, Julio 204, and Frank 207 who started to write their aliases and places of residence on numerous walls across town.",
              "(Silver and Chaflant 1984) 6If the handwriting was somewhat basic in the early days of graffiti, the conspicuous development of the practice rapidly prompted writers to be original and more creative.",
              "The tags soon evolved from a mere signature to sophisticated bombings or pieces.",
              "Bombers, as the young authors of these meticulous works used to call each other, performed stylized paintings that required more technique, more time, and that were divided into several stages.",
              "In swapping the tip of their spray cans, they started with the outline of their signature, filled it in with colours, and then frequently added a background.",
              "A mannered work at the decorating stage, as well as the size of a piece, considerably contributed to the fame and to the prestige of its author.",
              "7Moreover, new styles and letterings appeared during this seminal period (from the end of the 60s to the mid 70s).",
              "The majority of the graffiti designed at that time were essentially written either in block letters \u2013 straight letters with a shade effect -, leaning letters \u2013 an oblique lettering -, bubble letters \u2013 a superimposition of swollen letters invented by Phase II which were very popular in the early 70s -, or arrow letters \u2013 a widespread lettering the ends of which invariably ended with an arrow.",
              "8The wildstyle, a complex style of lettering that was usually unreadable for inexperienced eyes was also extremely popular.",
              "In the meantime, pieces were diversifying and numerous bombing techniques appeared.",
              "The \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d technique, for example, consisted in painting a whole surface while a \u201cwhole car\u201d graffiti painting covered a whole wagon.",
              "9Early on, writers had started tagging their \u201cpen-names\u201d on New York trains and stations to get greater visibility and so that their pieces could travel across town (Alonso 1998, 3;",
              "Desse et SDG 1993, 63).",
              "For that last reason, bombing trains was undeniably the most appreciated practice.",
              "10After 1973, the cars of the urban transit system became the favourite medium of a competition where youths from New York\u2019s five boroughs had to write their names on as many trains as possible.",
              "These acts of bravado were gradually outshined by aesthetic challenges where the bomber who designed the most beautiful piece on a line was temporarily crowned King of that line.",
              "This period, ranging from the late 60s to the early 70s, marks the beginnings of graffiti writing as an organized and structured practice.",
              "The pioneers who had inscribed their pen names (which kept them relatively anonymous) on the city walls defined its legitimacy standards.",

              "Emulating and revisiting, between 1969 and 1975, the painting techniques with spray cans and the basic style introduced by Cornbread, Cool Earl or Taki, pioneers of the New York graffiti movement like Phase II, Futura 2000, Seen, Kaze II or Fab 5 Freddy effectively launched the history of graffiti writing.",

              "They also lastingly defined the aesthetics and cultural legitimacy of an expressive form the creative principles of which had gradually matured.",
              "11In the beginning, graffiti writing was loosely linked to a hip hop movement considerably marked with the street gang culture that characterized disadvantaged neighbourhoods.",
              "The original link between this movement and street gangs is generally hinted at in works dedicated to it.",
              "If Pierre Evil devotes a whole chapter to it in his book on gangsta rap and explains that hip hop is a direct by-product of gang activities, rituals and rivalries (Evil 55) and if Charles Ahearn explores this link in his history of the hip hop movement (Ahearn 2002), most of the writings, even though they do not dodge the subject, generally discount it in favour of aesthetic aspects which legitimize its practices to the detriment of a notable \u201csemi-criminal\u201d aspect.",
              "However, as Charles Ahearn indicates in the first pages of Yes Yes Y\u2019all, a book tracing back the origins of hip hop, the graffiti movement incontestably emerged from a street culture dominated by juvenile gangs (Ahearn 3).",
              "Besides, many hip hop characteristics, such as the pronounced emphasis on the place of residence of rap musicians or their cliquish ideology find their origins in this culture (Diallo 10).",
              "12According to Charlie Ahearn, who was one of the first to document graffiti and its closely related practices in the docudrama Wildstyle (Ahearn, 1982), there is not the slightest doubt that graffiti was one of the first components of the hip hop movement.",
              "While channelling gang-related violence through artistic battles, hip hop practices preserved the marked community spirit of street gangs, and, conjointly, a pronounced sense of territorial identity.",
              "As Ahearn and Alejandro Alonso (Alonso 1998) have remarked, these residues particularly show through graffiti as well as rap or break-dance.",
              "One of the main remainders being an exacerbated spirit of competition.",
              "Similar to the battles between rappers or B-boys that became famous on account of the media interest that they aroused (Hanson, 2002;",
              "La Chappelle, 2005), the spirit of competition is omnipresent in graffiti.",
              "It can be found under the form of tacit contests where the goal of each writer or crew is to burn potential rivals and to make sure that they hold a prominent symbolic status in the milieu of graffiti.",
              "13Several graffiti painters have confirmed the closeness between graffiti and other hip hop practices brought to light by the first historians (Milon, 1999).",
              "Dj Grandmaster Flash, for example, claims that he used to bomb trains in the early 70s (SBG and Desse, 43), very much like KRS-ONE who, in 1992, published his paintings in mainstream magazines like Spin and Rolling Stone.",
              "French graffiti writer Darco introduces himself both as graffiti artist and break-dancer (Osganian, 8).",
              "Phase II, one of the pioneers of the New York graffiti movement, lays the stress on the importance of graffiti and of \u201cflyer men\u201d in the promotion work of rap musicians like Grandmaster Flash for whom he designed flyers in 1977 in a style that he had dubbed \u201chip hop style\u201d at the time (Desse and SBG, 155).",
              "Finally, Lee, the high-profile writer of the late 70s who starred in the docudrama Wildstyle insists on the absence of any separation whatsoever, at the beginning of the movement anyway, between dancers and writers and claims that many of the prominent rappers of that era were also graffiti writers.",
              "(Desse and SBG, 166) 14This original link between graffiti and the hip hop movement, which results more from the intersection and aggregation of different forms of expression performed by youths from the same place and milieu than from a structured and spontaneous movement, though it was clearly undeniable until the 80s, became less and less obvious and exclusive as the socioeconomic trajectories of rap music and graffiti went in different directions.",
              "15Even though graffiti writing and rap music were closely related in the beginning, their ties became gradually looser.",
              "While rap music rapidly developed into a commodity (West, 1993) and turned into the lucrative industry that we all know, graffiti infiltrated into the contemporary art scene and found itself exhibited in several Soho art galleries as well as in renowned institutions.",
              "This difference of trajectory finds it principle in a conjunction of distinctive strategies and of various logics.",
              "16It is important to point out that graffiti paintings, insofar as they \u201cdefaced\u201d public buildings were considered illegal as soon as they appeared and that their authors ran the risk of prosecution.",
              "Graffiti notably triggered severe measures from the part of the New York City Hall and sharp criticisms from public transport users (Chaflant and Silver, 1984).",
              "A repeat offender, according to the three times repeater law put in place by Mayor Koch, incurred a jail sentence (Levikow, 1997;",
              "(Anonymous) Dirty Handz 3: Search and Destroy, 2004).",
              "The ostentatious spread of graffiti in the public space, greatly favoured by the mobility of trains, encouraged City Hall to take, towards the late seventies, a series of measures meant to curb graffiti and to find a remedy for the deterioration of the urban landscape it was held responsible for (Lachman, 336).",
              "Alejandro Alonso, in his research on Los Angeles graffiti, explains that unlike New York, the concentration of bombings in the disadvantaged neighbourhoods of East Los Angeles, Whittier, and Boyle Heights and their non-proliferation in other neighbourhoods triggered similar measures of a lesser extent (Alonso, 4).",
              "17On the other hand, in New York City, several costly measures were implemented, belatedly, to fight what the town council considered a sheer plague.",
              "Edward Koch, who was mayor at the time (1978-1989) launched a vast media campaign against graffiti with the support of high-profile athletes and entertainers.",
              "Boxers Hector Camacho and Alex Ramos underlined the pointlessness of graffiti with the slogan \u201cTake it from the champs.",
              "Graffiti is for chumps.",
              "\u201d Irene Cara and Gene Ray, two protagonists from the popular series Fame, exhorted youths to \u201cMake (their) mark in society.",
              "Not on society,\u201d in an ad campaign shot on location on subway trains, the favourite targets of graffiti writers.",
              "18At the same time, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority took costly measures to have the trains cleaned up.",
              "Between 1970 and 1985, they spent more than one hundred million dollars to fruitlessly erase graffiti paintings from its network with the buff, a chemical solution sprayed by high pressure water-cleaners.",
              "It also invested in draconian security systems to protect train depots.",
              "Graffiti writers would usually visit these depots at night to paint more elaborate pieces on stationary vehicles and to reduce the risks of being taken.",
              "To put an end to this practice, the MTA installed, on the mayor\u2019s initiative, five-meter high barb-wired fences separated by a corridor patrolled by guard dogs.",
              "19This war on graffiti had a determining influence on the practice and on its artistic trajectory.",
              "According to Futura 2000, one of the most renowned graffiti artists, this repression undeniably transformed the New York graffiti scene.",
              "Subway trains were no longer exploitable as a means of artistic mediation and many writers turned to new media when they could (Desse and SBG, 62).",
              "20The media coverage started with the New York Times article had attracted the attention of other journalists on graffiti, of academics and of the contemporary art milieu.",
              "As early as 1972, Hugo Martinez, a sociologist at the University of New York who particularly appreciated the aesthetic character of the first bombings organized, with the United Graffiti Artists, a crew of graffiti writers, the very first canvas exhibition at the Razor Gallery.",
              "This exhibition, chronicled by Richard Goldstein in the New York Magazine, paved the way for the legitimating of graffiti as an art form.",
              "Young graffiti writers were suddenly in the limelight and were invited by downtown gallery owners to show their pieces on canvas.",
              "The Fashion Moda gallery and the Fun Gallery, located, respectively, on 3rd avenue in the Bronx and in East Village, and specialized in graffiti only, greatly contributed to the artistic blossoming of graffiti in the early 80s.",
              "They also played a determining role in its exportation to Europe where contemporary art sellers were equally receptive to this mode of expression in the process of becoming a legitimate art form.",
              "21This pivotal period marks the entrance of graffiti in the art scene.",
              "It drew the attention of art lovers (Ahearn, 1982, Chaflant and Silver, 1984), journalists (Cooper, 1988) and academics (Baudrillard, 1976) whose trailblazing works paved the way for a great number of authoritative monographs.",
              "The highly influential Village Voice published an article on graffiti when it burst into the Manhattan artsy scene with artists like Fab 5 Freddy, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Futura 2000 and Zephyr to whom hipsters from the bohemian New York scene such as Debbie Harry (Blondie), Malcolm Mac Laren, or the Sex Pistols, were proposing various artistic collaborations (Poschard, 210).",
              "Moreover, networks like ABC and CBS started to broadcast documentaries and reports on graffiti that cast a different light on this practice and that significantly contributed to its legitimacy as an art form in putting forward, no longer its criminal aspect as it had usually been the case until then, but its aesthetic character.",
              "22This media coverage and the sudden change in status it entailed in addressing the question of the artistic value of graffiti gave rise to a central question, which, on its own, legitimated this practice as an art form.",
              "From the moment it had been socially established as such by several media, acknowledged as an aesthetic practice by a new guard of gallery owners and contemporary artists, exhibited and sold in institutional sites of diffusion, graffiti entered the milieu of \u201clegitimate\u201d art.",
              "3 Unlike rap music, which had triggered a similar interest among journalists and academics, if not a more important one, graffiti benefited straight away from an institutional artistic recognition.",
              "This artistic redefinition could express itself insofar as it met precisely the expectations of an avant-garde fraction probably inclined to appreciate this expressive form on the grounds of its irreverent and transgressive character, of its formal closeness to classical painting \u2013 a legitimate art form -, or of its limited reproducibility that dismissed a potential mass distribution and consumption, incompatible with the conception of art that it defended.",
              "23In addition, the fact that graffiti started in New York, a city that holds a prominent position in the American art market and the critics of which have the power to decide on artistic value and to legitimate authoritatively new practices as art, rapidly put graffiti on the way to institutional sanctification.",
              "As one art critic underlines in the documentary Style Wars (Chaflant and Silver, 1984), no other aesthetic movement since pop art had created such a commotion in the New York avant-garde.",
              "Graffiti, with its raw aesthetics and its daring appeared at the right place at the right time for art sellers seeking new aesthetics forms and practices.",
              "This interest was an opportunity for the progressive professionalizing of artists, regularly invited to show their pieces or to paint murals on canvas or for public or private institutions.",
              "4 It certainly increased the life span of pieces, and put graffiti at the centre of a sterile debate on its artistic value.",
              "24If the media discourse on graffiti is still ambivalent today, one can find in the celebrating actions of its aesthetic qualities by commentators from the art milieu and from the academy the characteristics of a form of expression that Pierre Bourdieu identifies as being \u201cin the process of becoming legitimate\u201d.",
              "Like in the case of jazz music in the recent past, social sanctification through artistic, scholarly and highly performative discourses was one of the main stages of this legitimating process (Fabianni, 1999).",
              "If graffiti has remained firmly rooted in the public sites that have witnessed its appearance (public walls, means of public transportation), and if it has preserved loose ties with the hip hop movement, it is also appreciated, following the collective symbolic action it has been the subject of and the determining elements of which we have already emphasized, as a noble cultural product and is commonly exhibited as such in renowned art galleries and museums worldwide.",

              "be accessible, rather than hidden away inside galleries, museums, and private collections;",
              "and be democratic and empowering, in that all people (regardless of race, age, gender, economic status, etc.)",

              "An artist's tag is a pseudonym, which protects both the individual's identity and anonymity, while simultaneously providing the writer an opportunity to develop a new identity or persona (much like a digital avatar).",

              "More than anything else, graffiti writers convey their identity and their existence by painting their tag in public spaces.",

              "This choice of location would have garnered greater prestige for the artists, as writing on subway cars put them at very high risk of apprehension by the authorities, and thus considered more daring.",

              "These types of pieces garner higher levels of respect for writers as opposed to \"throwups\" (simpler pieces using maximum two or three colors to create two-dimensional bubble text) or \"tags\", because wildstyle work involves more artistic prowess and takes longer to complete, thus putting the writer at a higher risk for run-ins with police.",

              "As we can see, the use of the stencil allowed the artist to create a striking, sharp image with clean, crisp lines, using only black spray paint over a white surface.",

              "Seeing Fascist stencils in Italy during his youth, as well as political paintings in French Algeria, left a lasting impression on him, and in 1981 he decided to start making his own stencil works around Paris, beginning with small rats.",
              "Like Bristol's Banksy, Blek le Rat sees the rat as an ideal symbol for the graffiti artist, as both operate under cover of darkness to evade capture and eradication.",
              "Blek le Rat explains, \"I began to spray some small rats in the streets of Paris because rats are the only wild animals living in cities, and only rats will survive when the human race disappears and dies out.\"",

              "When asked about the commercialism of his work, Haring said: \"I could earn more money if I just painted a few things and jacked up the price.",

              "The stickers, written with the words Obey Giant, popped up all over the urban landscapes where Fairey lived and traveled, becoming the artist's visual, public experiment with phenomenology.",

              "things so taken for granted that they become muted by abstract observation.",
              "Thus, the famous wrestler's face became a familiar motif on the streets, its repetition causing notice while remaining meaningless, until it eventually became just another familiar piece of the urban landscape, unquestioned or analyzed.",
              "Fairey became widely known during the 2008 presidential election for his Barack Obama HOPE poster.",
              "He is one of the most influential street artists who have crossed into the gallery zone as he is included in collections at The Smithsonian, the Los Angeles Country Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City among others.",
              "Artist: Banksy This graffiti piece features a black and white stenciled rat.",
              "Banksy often uses the image of the rat as a personalized symbol representing himself, as he, like his graffiti artist predecessor Blek le Rat, felt an affinity with this city-dwelling creature that is active at night in order to evade apprehension and eradication.",
              "He says, \"If you feel dirty, insignificant or unloved, then rats are a good role model.",
              "They exist without permission, they have no respect for the hierarchy of society, and they have sex 50 times a day.\"",
              "Since the 1990s, Banksy has rapidly risen to international fame, arguably becoming one of, if not the most well-known contemporary street artists, despite maintaining anonymity by keeping his true identity a secret.",
              "His works have sold at auction for hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars.",
              "Much of his work (especially in his earlier days) used stencils, allowing him to execute pieces in a matter of seconds and remain undetected by authorities.",
              "Since the early 2000s, he has also executed other types of unsanctioned interventions, including sculptures and performative actions.",
              "Most of his work aims to offer political and social criticism.",
              "Soldiers and police officers, as well as popular cultural icons (like Ronald McDonald and Mickey Mouse) recur in many of his pieces.",
              "He marked the end of the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference by painting four murals on global warming.",
              "One included the phrase, \"I don't believe in global warming\" submerged in water.",
              "In 2005 he traveled to the Israel-Palestine West Bank barrier wall and executed nine murals on the wall (including a dove with a bulletproof vest and a heart-shaped target over its chest, a child beneath a ladder stretching to the top of the wall, and the silhouette of a young girl being lifted upwards by a bunch of balloons).",
              "Banksy has also held various notable exhibitions, such as his 2006 Barely Legal show in a Los Angeles warehouse, which featured a live Indian elephant painted with the same red and gold floral pattern as the wallpaper that was pasted up in the section of the warehouse where the elephant was displayed.",
              "This created controversy, as animal rights activists protested the elephant's involvement.",
              "However, the show was immensely popular, with several A-list Hollywood celebrities in attendance.",
              "Another one of Banksy's exhibitions, Banksy vs. Bristol Museum (2009) featured Banksy's own take on famous historical paintings, as well as animatronics, sculptures, and installations.",
              "Spray paint Artist: Banksy In September of 2006, Banksy snuck a life-size inflatable doll dressed as a Guantanamo Bay prisoner into the Disneyland theme park in California, and installed it within the confines of the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride.",
              "The work remained in place for over an hour before park officials noticed it, shut down the ride, and removed the doll.",
              "A spokeswoman for Banksy said the work was intended to highlight the situation in which terror suspects find themselves in at the controversial detention center in Cuba.",
              "The artist hoped that by confronting carefree park-goers with what appeared to be an actual Guantanamo Bay prisoner in \"the happiest place on earth,\" he might shock them into thinking more seriously about the implications of the war on terror.",
              "This work serves as a prime example of how sculptural works by street artists are particularly useful in orchestrating jarring experiences that reflect the political or social climate.",
              "Banksy has carried out a number of other such performative illegal interventions.",
              "In 2004, he produced 100,000 fake British A\u0302\u00a310 notes, replacing the picture of the Queen's head with that of Diana, Princess of Wales and changing the text \"Bank of England\" to \"Banksy of England.\"",
              "He tossed these into a crowd at the Notting Hill Carnival that same year, which some people then attempted to spend in local shops.",
              "In March 2005, he surreptitiously hung various modified artworks of his own (such as a Warhol-esque painting of a discount soup can) in New York City's Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, and Brooklyn Museum.",
              "In August/September of 2006, he placed approximately 500 fake copies of Paris Hilton's debut CD, Paris, in 48 record stores around the UK, modified with his own cover art (photoshopped to show Hilton topless).",
              "Other pictures in the album insert featured Paris with her chihuahua Tinkerbell's head replacing her own, and one of her stepping out of a luxury car, edited to include a group of homeless people, with the caption \"90% of success is just showing up.\"",
              "Music tracks were given titles such as \"Why Am I Famous?\"",
              "\"What Have I Done?\"",
              "and \"What Am I For?\"",
              "The public purchased several copies of the CD before stores were able to remove them.",
              "The purchased copies went on to be sold for much more on online auction websites.",
              "Inflatable doll, orange jumpsuit, black hood, and handcuffs - Disneyland, California Artist: Alexandre Orion This work, which took seventeen nights to complete, serves as an example of \"reverse\" graffiti, in that the artist did not actually apply any material to the surface of the wall where he was working, but rather, created images of over 3,500 human skulls in a space measuring almost 1000 feet long, by merely wiping away the heavy layer of soot that had accumulated on the wall of this transportation tunnel from vehicle exhaust pipes.",
              "Here, the repeated skull image, combined with the method of image creation, conveys the idea that the pollution of urban centers is a deadly problem affecting countless people.",
              "Orion says that, \"I wanted to bring a catacomb from the near future to the present, to show people that the tragedy of pollution is happening right now.\"",
              "Reverse graffiti poses a unique problem for law enforcement officers, who are generally conditioned to understand Street Art as a form of vandalism.",
              "However, in the case of reverse graffiti works such as this, the artist has done little more than clean a portion of a public surface.",
              "Orion explains, \"There is no crime in cleaning.",
              "The crime here is against the environment, it is a crime against life.\"",
              "Authorities in Sao Paulo ultimately decided that there was nothing they could charge Orion with, and the episode even prompted city officials to order the monthly cleaning of every transportation tunnel in the city.",
              "Scraped-off soot - Max Feffer Tunnel, Sao Paulo, Brazil Artist: ZEVS French street artist Aguirre Schwarz, better known by his tag \"ZEVS\" (pronounced as \"Zeus\") creates what he calls \"Visual Violations,\" taking spray paint to public advertisements in his Liquidated Logos series.",
              "This series involves the application of water-based paint, which drips down heavily from well-known corporate logos (such as the luxury design house Chanel and the fast food restaurant McDonald's).",
              "He first created works illegally in public spaces, \"liquidating\" logos on billboards, storefronts, and city walls, and later adapted them for his gallery shows.",
              "Cultural critic and curator Carlo McCormick has referred to ZEVS as the \"most subversive\" of all contemporary French street artists.",
              "In fact, Zevs was arrested in Hong Kong in 2009 after spraying this liquidated Chanel logo on the side of a Giorgio Armani shop.",
              "Indeed, throughout the history of Street Art, artists have commonly targeted public advertisements and corporate space as a rebellion against the consumerism and commercialization that pervades contemporary society.",
              "These artists have adopted a confrontational attitude toward marketing, asking: If advertisers are permitted to visually pollute purportedly \"public\" places, why can't citizens be a part of that dialogue?",
              "As cultural critic and curator Carlo McCormick writes, \"One of the most salient features of graffiti is its approximation of branding.",
              "At its most basic level, the tag mimics the ideographic compression, repetition, and saturation that we would expect of corporate logos and marketing campaigns.\"",
              "Banksy argues that, \"To some people breaking into property and painting it might seem a little inconsiderate, but in reality the 30 square centimetres of your brain are trespassed upon every day by teams of marketing experts.",
              "Graffiti is a perfectly proportionate response to being sold unattainable goals by a society obsessed with status and infamy.",
              "Graffiti is the sight of an unregulated free market getting the kind of art it deserves.\"",
              "In recent years, ZEVS has been recreating his Liquidated Logos on canvas and exhibiting them in galleries, such as at his 2011 solo show Liquidated Version at the De Buck Gallery in Chelsea, New York City.",
              "While the formal qualities and compositions of his paintings remain identical to one another, their subversive power is diminished when relocated in the rarified environment of a gallery or museum.",
              "The Liquidated Logos, when seen in the street, explicitly and directly confront corporate capitalism.",
              "Bold graffiti imagery in public spaces surprises viewers through visual appropriation of recognizable motifs, and these familiar yet perverted slogans register as protest and vandalism.",
              "Meanwhile, the same imagery in a gallery space lacks the agitation, hostility, and contradiction, which according to art historian Claire Bishop, \"can be crucial to any work's artistic impact.\"",
              "Paint - Hong Kong Artist: SWOON This wheat paste poster work, installed on the wall and window of a shop front, depicts three young boys wearing baggy pants, sweaters, and sneakers.",
              "The two older boys look out at the viewer, one of them with his mouth partly opened, as if addressing passers-by and implicating them in the work.",
              "SWOON (nA\u0303\u00a9e Caledonia Curry) is a female street artist who was born in New London, Connecticut, raised in Daytona Beach, Florida, and now resides in New York City.",
              "She began creating Street Art in 1999, spending several days in her studio preparing wheat paste posters made of recycled newspaper, and then transporting the finished works to urban public spaces where she pasted them onto walls.",
              "She, like many other street artists, favors this method as it allows her to execute detailed works while spending minimal time at the intended location.",
              "She has explained that Street Art was important to her as it allowed her to have an impact on the urban landscape, rather than disappearing into obscurity by creating commercial art that would remain hidden inside a gallery or private collection.",
              "SWOON's wheat paste works frequently depict people, including her friends, family members, and other individuals she has seen in the locations where she executes her works.",
              "Culture critic and curator Carlo McCormick writes of SWOON's figures that, \"when you pass a figure by an artist like SWOON, the effect has the familiarity of an old neighbor you have not seen for a long while.\"",
              "He explains that a great deal of public art and Street Art is based on the desire to remember and commemorate common people and events, as evidenced by the phenomenon of memorial graffiti carried out in Latino communities in the United States and the UK, and in the 2003 Ghost Bike movement in the United States, where white bicycles were placed at the sites of road accidents where cyclists were killed.",
              "In her own way, SWOON leaves traces of people she knows, allowing their spirits to live on in the community even though they may have gone, or grown older and changed.",

              "Louis, Missouri Graffiti, defined simply as writing, drawing, or painting on walls or surfaces of a structure, dates back to prehistoric and ancient times, as evidenced by the Lascaux cave paintings in France and other historic findings across the world.",
              "Scholars believe that the images of hunting scenes found at these sites were either meant to commemorate past hunting victories, or were used as part of rituals intended to increase hunters' success.",
              "During World War II, it became popular for soldiers to write the phrase \"Kilroy was here,\" along with a simple sketch of a bald figure with a large nose peeking over a ledge, on surfaces along their route.",
              "The motivation behind this simple early graffiti was to create a motif of connection for these soldiers during their difficult times, cementing their unique brotherhood amongst foreign land and to make themselves \"seen.\"",
              "This was closely aligned with the motivation behind contemporary graffiti, with the writers aiming to assert their existence and to repeat their mark in as many places as possible.",
              "Contemporary (or \"hip-hop\") graffiti dates to the late 1960s, generally said to have arisen from the Black and Latino neighborhoods of New York City alongside hip-hop music and street subcultures, and catalyzed by the invention of the aerosol spray can.",
              "Early graffiti artists were commonly called \"writers\" or \"taggers\" (individuals who write simple \"tags,\" or their stylized signatures, with the goal of tagging as many locations as possible.)",
              "Indeed, the fundamental underlying principle of graffiti practice was the intention to \"get up,\" to have one's work seen by as many people as possible, in as many places as possible.",
              "The exact geographical location of the first \"tagger\" is difficult to pinpoint.",
              "Some sources identify New York (specifically taggers Julio 204 and Taki 183 of the Washington Heights area), and others identify Philadelphia (with tagger Corn Bread) as the point of origin.",
              "Yet, it goes more or less undisputed that New York \"is where graffiti culture blossomed, matured, and most clearly distinguished itself from all prior forms of graffiti,\" as Eric Felisbret, former graffiti artist and lecturer, explains.",
              "Soon after graffiti began appearing on city surfaces, subway cars and trains became major targets for New York City's early graffiti writers and taggers, as these vehicles traveled great distances, allowing the writer's name to be seen by a wider audience.",
              "The subway rapidly became the most popular place to write, with many graffiti artists looking down upon those who wrote on walls.",
              "Sociologist Richard Lachmann notes how the added element of movement made graffiti a uniquely dynamic art form.",
              "He writes, \"Much of the best graffiti was meant to be appreciated in motion, as it passed through dark and dingy stations or on elevated tracks.",
              "Photos and graffiti canvases cannot convey the energy and aura of giant artwork in motion.\"",
              "Graffiti on subway cars began as crude, simple tags, but as tagging became increasingly popular, writers had to find new ways to make their names stand out.",
              "Over the next few years, new calligraphic styles were developed and tags turned into large, colorful, elaborate pieces, aided by the realization that different spray can nozzles (also referred to as \"caps\") from other household aerosol products (like oven cleaner) could be used on spray paint cans to create varying effects and line widths.",
              "It did not take long for the crude tags to grow in size, and to develop into artistic, colorful pieces that took up the length of entire subway cars.",
              "By the 1980s, the city of New York viewed graffiti's inherent vandalism as a major concern, and a massive amount of resources were poured into the graffiti \"problem.\"",
              "As Art Historian Martha Cooper writes, \"For [New York City mayor Ed] Koch, graffiti was evidence of a lack of authoritarian order;",
              "as such, the presence of graffiti had a psychological effect that made all citizens its victim through a disruption of the visual order, thus promoting a feeling of confusion and fear among people.\"",
              "The New York Police cracked down on writers, often following suspect youth as they left school, searching them for graffiti-related paraphernalia, staking out their houses, or gathering information from informants.",
              "The Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) received a significant increase in their budget in 1982, allowing them to erect more sophisticated fences and to better maintain the train yards and lay-ups that were popular targets for writers (due to the possibility for hitting several cars at once).",
              "However, writers saw these measures as a mere challenge, and worked even harder to hit their targets, while also becoming increasingly territorial and aggressive toward other writers and \"crews\" (groups of writers).",
              "In 1984, the MTA launched its Clean Car Program, which involved a five-year plan to completely eliminate graffiti on subway cars, operating on the principle that a graffiti-covered subway car could not be put into service until all the graffiti on it had been cleaned off.",
              "This program was implemented one subway line at a time, gradually pushing writers outward, and by 1986 many of the city's lines were completely clear of graffiti.",
              "Lieutenant Steve Mona recalls one day when the ACC crew hit 130 cars in a yard at Coney Island, assuming that the MTA wouldn't shut down service and that the graffitied trains would run.",
              "Yet the MTA opted to not provide service, greatly inconveniencing citizens who had to wait over an hour for a train that morning.",
              "That was the day that the MTA's dedication to the eradication of graffiti became apparent.",
              "However graffiti was anything but eradicated.",
              "In the past few decades, this practice has spread around the world, often maintaining elements of the American wildstyle, like interlocking letterforms and bold colors, yet also adopting local flare, such as manga-inspired Street Art in Japan.",
              "It is important to note that contemporary graffiti has developed completely apart from traditional, institutionalized art forms. Art critic and curator Johannes Stahl writes that, \"We have long since got accustomed to understanding art history as a succession of epochs [.",
              ".",
              ".]",
              "But at the same time there has always existed something outside of official art history, a unruly and recalcitrant art, which takes place not in the sheltered environs of churches, collections or galleries, but out on the street.\"",
              "Graffiti artists today draw inspiration from Art History at times, but it cannot be said that graffiti grew directly out of any such canon or typology.",
              "Modern graffiti did not begin as an art form at all, but rather, as a form of text-based urban communication that developed its own networks.",
              "As Lachmann notes, rather than submitting to the criteria of valuation upheld by the institutionalized art world, early graffiti writers developed an entirely new and separate art world, based on their own \"qualitative conception of style\" and the particular \"aesthetic standards\" developed within the community for judging writers' content and technique.",
              "During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many graffiti writers began to shift away from text-based works to include imagery.",
              "Key artists involved in this shift included Jean-Michel Basquiat (who wrote graffiti using the tag SAMO) and Keith Haring, whose simple illuminated figures gave testament to the AIDS epidemic, both of whom were active in New York City.",
              "Around the same time, many artists also began experimenting with different techniques and materials, the most popular being stencils and wheat paste posters.",
              "Since the turn of the millennium, this proliferation has continued, with artists using all sorts of materials to complete illegal works in pubic spaces.",
              "The myriad approaches have come to be housed under the label of \"Street Art\" (sometimes also referred to as \"Urban Art\"), which has expanded its purview beyond graffiti to include these other techniques and styles.",
              "The term \"graffiti\" comes from the Greek \"graphein,\" meaning \"to scratch, draw, or write,\" and thus a broad definition of the term includes all forms of inscriptions on walls.",
              "More specifically, however, the modern, or \"hip-hop\" graffiti, that has pervaded city spaces since the 1960s and 1970s involves the use of spray paint or paint markers.",
              "It is associated with a particular aesthetic, most often utilizing bold color choices, involving highly stylized and abstract lettering known as \"wildstyle,\" and/or including cartoon-like characters.",
              "Photographer and author Nicolas Ganz notes that graffiti and Street Art practices are characterized by differing \"sociological elements,\" writing that graffiti writers continue to be \"governed by the desire to spread one's tag and achieve fame\" through both quality and quantity of pieces created, while street artists are governed by \"fewer rules and [embrace] a much broader range of styles and techniques.\"",
              "Anthropologist and archaeologist Troy Lovata and art historian Elizabeth Olson write that \"the rapid proliferation of this aggressive style of writing appearing on the walls of urban centres all over the world has become an international signifier of rebellion,\" and cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard has called it the \"symbolic destruction of social relations.\"",
              "Stencils (also known as stencil graffiti) are usually prepared beforehand out of paper or cardboard and then brought to the site of the work's intended installation, attached to the wall with tape, and then spray painted over, resulting in the image or text being left behind once the stencil is removed.",
              "Many street artists favor the use of stencils as opposed to freehand graffiti because they allow for an image or text to be installed very easily in a matter of seconds, minimizing the chance of run-ins with the authorities.",
              "Stencils are also preferable as they are infinitely re-useable and repeatable.",
              "Sometimes artists use multiple layers of stencils on the same image to add colors, details, and the illusion of depth.",
              "Brighton-based artist Hutch explains that he prefers to stencil because \"it can produce a very clean and graphic style, which is what I like when creating realistic human figures.",
              "Also, the effect on the viewer is instant, you don't need to wait for it to sink in.\"",
              "One of the earliest known street artists to use stencils was John Fekner, who started using the technique in 1968 to stencil purely textual messages onto walls.",
              "Other well-known stencil artists include French artists Ernest Pignon-Ernest and Blek le Rat, British artists Nick Walker and Banksy, and American artists Shepard Fairey and Above.",
              "Wheat paste (also known as flour paste) is a gel or liquid adhesive made from combining wheat flour or starch with water.",
              "Many street artists use wheat paste to adhere paper posters to walls.",
              "Much like stencils, wheat paste posters are preferable for street artists as it allows them to do most of the preparation at home or in the studio, with only a few moments needed at the site of installation, pasting the poster to the desired surface.",
              "This is crucial for artists installing works in unsanctioned locations, as it lowers the risk of apprehension and arrest.",
              "Some street artists who use the wheat paste method include Italian duo Sten and Lex, French artists JR and Ludo, and American artist Swoon.",
              "Some street artists create three-dimensional sculptural interventions, which can be installed surreptitiously in public spaces, usually under the cover of darkness.",
              "This type of work differs from Public Art in that it is rebellious in nature and completed illegally, while Public Art is officially sanctioned/commissioned (and thus more palatable to a general audience).",
              "Unsanctioned Street Art interventions usually aim to shock viewers by presenting a visually realistic, yet simultaneously unbelievable situation.",
              "For instance, in his Third Man Series (2006), artist Dan Witz installs gloves on sewer grates to give the impression that a person is inside the sewer attempting to escape.",
              "Works like these often cause passers-by to do a \"double-take.\"",
              "Reverse graffiti (also known as clean tagging, dust tagging, grime writing, clean graffiti, green graffiti, or clean advertising) is a method by which artists create images on walls or other surfaces by removing dirt from a surface.",
              "According to British reverse graffiti artist Moose, \"Once you do this, you make people confront whether or not they like people cleaning walls or if they really have a problem with personal expression.\"",
              "This sort of work calls attention to environmental concerns in urban spaces, such as pollution.",
              "There are street artists who experiment with other media, such as Invader (Paris), who adheres ceramic tiles to city surfaces, recreating images from the popular Space Invaders video game of 1978.",
              "Invader says that tile is \"a perfect material because it is permanent.",
              "Even after years of being outside the colors don't fade.\"",
              "Many other artists use simple stickers, which they post on surfaces around the city.",
              "Often, these stickers are printed with the artist's tag or a simple graphic.",
              "Others invite participation from the audience, like Ji Lee who pastes empty comic speech-bubbles onto advertisements, allowing passers-by to write in their own captions.",
              "Others still use natural materials to beautify urban spaces.",
              "For instance, in 2005, Shannon Spanhake planted flowers in various potholes of the streets in Tijuana, Mexico.",
              "She says of the project, \"Adorning the streets of Tijuana are potholes, open wounds that mark the failure of man's Promethean Project to tame nature, and somehow surviving in the margins are abandoned buildings, entropic monuments celebrating a hyperrealistic vision of a modernist utopia linked to capitalist expansion gone awry.\"",
              "There are also artists who create Street Art interventions through the use of clay, chalk, charcoal, knitting, and projected photo/video.",
              "The possibilities for Street Art media are endless.",
              "Street Art continues to be a popular category of art all over the world, with many of its practitioners rising to fame and mainstream success (such as Bristol's Banksy, Paris' ZEVS, and L.",
              "A.'",
              "s Shepard Fairey).",
              "Street artists who experience commercial success are often criticized by their peers for \"selling out\" and becoming part of the system that they had formerly rebelled against by creating illegal public works.",
              "Communications professor Tracey Bowen sees the act of creating graffiti as both a \"celebration of existence\" and \"a declaration of resistance.\"",
              "Similarly, Slovenian Feminist author Tea Hvala views graffiti as \"the most accessible medium of resistance\" for oppressed people to use against dominant culture due to its tactical (non-institutional, decentralized) qualities.",
              "For both Bowen and Hvala these unique positive attributes of graffiti are heavily reliant on its location in urban public spaces.",
              "Art critic and curator Johannes Stahl argues that the public context is crucial for Street Art to be political, because \"it happens in places that are accessible to all [and] it employs a means of expression that is not controlled by the government.\"",
              "Street artist BOOKSIIII holds an opinion not uncommon of many of today's street artists, that it is not inherently wrong for young artists to try to make money from galleries and corporations for their works, \"as long as they do their job honestly, sell work, and represent careers,\" yet at the same time he notes that \"graffiti does not stay the same when transferred to the gallery from the street.",
              "A tag on canvas will never hold the same power as the exact same tag on the street.\"",
              "This movement from the street to the gallery also indicates a growing acceptance of graffiti and Street Art within the mainstream art world and art history.",
              "Some apply the label \"post-graffiti\" to the work of street artists that also participate in the mainstream art world, although this is somewhat of a misnomer, as many such artists continue to execute illegal public interventions at the same time as they participate in sanctioned exhibitions in galleries and museums. This phenomenon also presents difficulties for art historians, as the sheer number of street artists, as well as their tendency to maintain anonymity, makes it hard to engage with individual artists in any sort of profound way.",
              "Moreover, it is difficult to insert Street Art into the art historical canon, as it did not develop from any progression of artistic movements, but rather began independently, with early graffiti and street artists developing their own unique techniques and aesthetic styles.",
              "Today, street artists both inspire and are inspired by many other artistic movements and styles, with many artists' works bearing elements of wide-ranging movements, from Pop Art to Renaissance Art.",
              "Street Art's status as vandalism often eclipses its status as art.",
              "More recently, as mentioned above, many artists are finding more opportunities to create artworks in sanctioned situations, by showing in galleries and museums, or by partnering with organizations that offer outdoor public spaces in which street artists are permitted to execute works.",
              "However, many others continue to focus on unsanctioned illegal works.",
              "Part of the allure of working illegally has to do with the adrenaline rush that artists get from successfully executing a piece without being apprehended by the authorities.",
              "Moreover, carrying out illegal/unsanctioned attacks on privately owned surfaces (such as a billboard being rented out by an advertising agency, or a politically-charged surface such as border walls), serves as a direct confrontation with the owner of that space (be it a marketing firm, or a political entity).",
              "With the advent of the Internet and the development of various graphic software and technologies, street artists now have a multitude of tools at their fingertips to assist in the creation and dissemination of their works.",
              "Specialized computer programs allow artists (like San Francisco-born MOMO) to better plan for their graffiti pieces and prepare their stencils and wheat paste posters, while digital photography used in conjunction with the Internet and social media allows Street Art works to be documented, shared, and thus immortalized where previously, most pieces tended to disappear when they were removed by city authorities or painted over by other artists.",

              "He had migrated to the city with his mother and brother from Ecuador in the 1990s as part of a large Latin American diaspora.",
              "In his urban environment, he found himself surrounded by beautiful, cryptic messages.",
              "They were written on walls and scrawled daringly across billboards.",
              "Little by little, he began to understand the meanings behind some of these messages.",
              "And, eventually, he started writing back.",
              "Illescas became a graffiti writer himself, for a time.",
              "He has since given it up, but he never lost his initial sense of curiosity and admiration.",
              "In fact, now, as a doctoral candidate in Latin American and Latino Studies, his dissertation research has taken him back to Los Angeles, where he gathered insights from current and former graffiti writers about how their work connects with concepts of art, identity, culture, and space.",
              "For those who create it, graffiti is an expression of identity and an outlet for creativity, social connection, and achievement, according to Illescas\u2019s research.",
              "Some of the most popular graffiti yards in Los Angeles are abandoned spaces in communities of color that neither the economy nor the city has been willing to invest in, he says.",
              "But graffiti allows Black and Latino young men to transform these areas into spaces of congregation and empowerment.",
              "\u201cIn a city where these youth are marginalised, ostracized, and invisibilized, graffiti is a way for them to become visible,\u201d Illescas said.",
              "\u201cThey feel that the system is against them, and upward social mobility is limited for them, so putting their names up around the city is a way for them to achieve respect from their peers and assert their dignity, and that doesn\u2019t come easily from other places and institutions in society.",
              "\u201d Graffiti also offers what Illescas calls an \u201cillicit cartography,\u201d meaning that it can be read like a cultural map of the city.",
              "Graffiti styles in East Los Angeles, for example, reflect Mexican-American artistic influence that began with Pachuco counterculture in the 1940s.",
              "Rich graffiti writing traditions emerged, including \u201cplacas,\u201d or tags that list a writer\u2019s stylized signature, and \u201cbarrio calligraphy,\u201d which blends rolling scripts with Old English lettering.",
              "In the 1980s, those traditions then incorporated colorful, whimsical East Coast influences.",
              "\u201cThe result is that Los Angeles has a really unique graffiti style,\u201d Illescas said.",
              "\u201cAlthough outsiders might not necessarily notice it, you can easily see the Mexican-American artistic influence in the aesthetics, and that has become associated with Latinx urban identities.",
              "\u201d Graffiti is a multiracial and multi-ethnic subculture, and Illescas says his research aims to recognize the specific contributions of Black and Latinx communities.",
              "He\u2019s also critically examining the subculture\u2019s hypermasculinity and how that may limit its transformative potential.",
              "And he\u2019s particularly interested in shedding light on how race may affect public perceptions of graffiti.",
              "Depending on the context, graffiti can either be publicly admired as \u201cstreet art\u201d\u2014and valued up to millions of dollars\u2014or it can be criminalized at levels ranging up to felony charges and years of jail time.",
              "In Los Angeles, a city which many researchers consider to be highly racially segregated, Black and Latinx communities, like South Central Los Angeles and East Los Angeles, are the places where graffiti is most likely to be severely criminalized and lumped together with gang activity, Illescas says.",
              "Meanwhile, Illescas says street art is more likely to be recognized as such within arts districts, where officially sanctioned \u201cbeautification\u201d projects use public art to attract more business and new residents, which can contribute to gentrification issues.",
              "And some of the most famous street artists are actually white men, like Banksy or Shepard Fairey, who have each attained international recognition for the artistic value of their illegal works.",
              "\u201cThis is where systemic racism occurs,\u201d Illescas said.",
              "\u201cYou have some people who are more prone to being criminalized and severely punished for a very similar act, and that punishment falls mainly on young Black and Latino men.",
              "\u201d For these reasons, Illescas has found that many graffiti writers of color have mixed feelings about the growing public appreciation for street art.",
              "\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s a capitalistic appropriation of transgressive graffiti into commercialized street art,\u201d Illescas said.",
              "\u201cBut it also ties into the efforts of graffiti writers who have been pushing for years to decriminalize their art and demonstrate its artistic and social value and the types of knowledge that it brings with it.",
              "\u201d Street art has, in fact, already brought opportunities for some veteran Black and Latino graffiti writers, who told Illescas they had recently been commissioned for their art or had found jobs as tour guides in arts districts.",
              "But each of these artists got their start creating illegal graffiti tags.",
              "Illescas believes that decriminalization will ultimately require transforming public appreciation of street art into a deeper understanding of the expressive value of other forms of graffiti.",
              "And he hopes his research might aid in that process.",
              "\u201cThe graffiti that we see up in the streets may seem like an insignificant tag or scribble to some people, but there\u2019s a lot of meaning behind it,\u201d he said.",
              "\u201cThere needs to be a recognition that graffiti is actually a visual representation of someone\u2019s identity, and it\u2019s also potentially their starting point to a very meaningful artistic career.",

              "\u201cThe story of how Graffiti became a global cultural phenomenon hadn\u2019t been told yet, and sharing this information is important in order for the fans and the world to know who, how, and why this art movement is so prevalent today,\u201d Ket explains.",
              "Drawing from his personal experiences and interactions with innovators and pioneers throughout his life, Ket felt prepared to chronicle this influential art movement.",

              "He explained, \u201cThis was difficult, and it required lots of research and lots of communication with artists that normally do not share these images as a result of the illegality of the art form.",
              "\u201d \u201cThe selection process, he continues, started with selecting the artists that are prolific and open to finally sharing their work.",
              "The older photographs allow us all to see the incredible pioneers of this movement and to see the trajectory of development of painting styles and techniques.",
              "\u201d Addressing the societal opposition that graffiti artists often face, The Wide World of Graffiti tackles topics such as incarceration and cities\u2019 harsh treatment of artists.",
              "It brings attention to the struggles faced by artists like Ian Debeer, known as Hert, who was sentenced to a year in prison and faced restrictions on creating art even after release.",
              "The book also highlights the experiences of Desa from New York City, showcasing the harm caused by the criminalization of street graffiti.",
