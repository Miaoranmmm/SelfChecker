    "response": "That's a great question. Black holes are fascinating objects that challenge our understanding of the universe and fundamental physics. There have been many discoveries about black holes in recent years, but here are some of the most remarkable ones:\n\n- In 2019, the **Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)** collaboration released the first-ever image of a black hole's shadow, showing the silhouette of a supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy M87[^1^].\n- In 2020, the **Nobel Prize in Physics** was awarded to three scientists for their contributions to black hole research: Roger Penrose for proving that black holes are a consequence of general relativity, and Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez for discovering a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy[^2^].\n- In 2020, the **LIGO** and **Virgo** gravitational-wave observatories detected the largest black hole merger ever recorded, producing a black hole of 142 solar masses and confirming the existence of intermediate-mass black holes[^2^].\n- In 2021, astronomers discovered a **rogue** black hole wandering through space, using a technique called gravitational microlensing that magnifies the light from distant stars[^1^].\n- In 2021, astronomers measured the **spin** of five supermassive black holes using X-ray observations, finding that some of them rotate at nearly the speed of light[^4^].\n\nThese discoveries have deepened our understanding of how black holes form, evolve, interact with their surroundings, and affect the structure and evolution of galaxies. They have also tested and confirmed some of the predictions of general relativity, such as the existence of event horizons, gravitational waves, and gravitational lensing. However, they have also raised new questions and challenges, such as how to explain the origin and diversity of black hole masses, how to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics in extreme conditions, and how to observe what happens inside or beyond a black hole.",

              "The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) \u2014 a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration \u2014 was designed to capture images of a black hole.",
              "Today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, EHT researchers reveal that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.",
              "This breakthrough was announced today in a series of six papers published in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
              "The image reveals the black hole at the center of Messier 87 [1], a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster.",
              "This black hole resides 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.",
              "5 billion times that of the Sun [2].",
              "The EHT links telescopes around the globe to form an Earth-sized virtual telescope with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution [3].",
              "The EHT is the result of years of international collaboration, and offers scientists a new way to study the most extreme objects in the Universe predicted by Einstein\u2019s general relativity during the centennial year of the historic experiment that first confirmed the theory [4].",
              "\"We have taken the first picture of a black hole,\" said EHT project director Sheperd S.",

              "\"If immersed in a bright region, like a disc of glowing gas, we expect a black hole to create a dark region similar to a shadow \u2014 something predicted by Einstein\u2019s general relativity that we\u2019ve never seen before, explained chair of the EHT Science Council Heino Falcke of Radboud University, the Netherlands.",
              "\"This shadow, caused by the gravitational bending and capture of light by the event horizon, reveals a lot about the nature of these fascinating objects and allowed us to measure the enormous mass of M87\u2019s black hole.\"",
              "Multiple calibration and imaging methods have revealed a ring-like structure with a dark central region \u2014 the black hole\u2019s shadow \u2014 that persisted over multiple independent EHT observations.",
              "\"Once we were sure we had imaged the shadow, we could compare our observations to extensive computer models that include the physics of warped space, superheated matter and strong magnetic fields.",

              "\"This makes us confident about the interpretation of our observations, including our estimation of the black hole\u2019s mass.\"",
              "Creating the EHT was a formidable challenge which required upgrading and connecting a worldwide network of eight pre-existing telescopes deployed at a variety of challenging high-altitude sites.",
              "These locations included volcanoes in Hawai`i and Mexico, mountains in Arizona and the Spanish Sierra Nevada, the Chilean Atacama Desert, and Antarctica.",
              "The EHT observations use a technique called very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) which synchronises telescope facilities around the world and exploits the rotation of our planet to form one huge, Earth-size telescope observing at a wavelength of 1.",
              "3 mm.",
              "VLBI allows the EHT to achieve an angular resolution of 20 micro-arcseconds \u2014 enough to read a newspaper in New York from a sidewalk cafe\u0301 in Paris [6].",
              "The telescopes contributing to this result were ALMA, APEX, the IRAM 30-meter telescope, the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano, the Submillimeter Array, the Submillimeter Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope [7].",
              "Petabytes of raw data from the telescopes were combined by highly specialised supercomputers hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy and MIT Haystack Observatory.",
              "The construction of the EHT and the observations announced today represent the culmination of decades of observational, technical, and theoretical work.",
              "This example of global teamwork required close collaboration by researchers from around the world.",
              "Thirteen partner institutions worked together to create the EHT, using both pre-existing infrastructure and support from a variety of agencies.",
              "Key funding was provided by the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the EU's European Research Council (ERC), and funding agencies in East Asia.",

              "\"Breakthroughs in technology, connections between the world's best radio observatories, and innovative algorithms all came together to open an entirely new window on black holes and the event horizon.\"",

              "5 times smaller than the shadow it casts and measures just under 40 billion km across.",
              "[2] Supermassive black holes are relatively tiny astronomical objects \u2014 which has made them impossible to directly observe until now.",
              "As a black hole\u2019s size is proportional to its mass, the more massive a black hole, the larger the shadow.",
              "Thanks to its enormous mass and relative proximity, M87\u2019s black hole was predicted to be one of the largest viewable from Earth \u2014 making it a perfect target for the EHT.",
              "[3] Although the telescopes are not physically connected, they are able to synchronize their recorded data with atomic clocks \u2014 hydrogen masers \u2014 which precisely time their observations.",
              "These observations were collected at a wavelength of 1.",
              "3 mm during a 2017 global campaign.",
              "Each telescope of the EHT produced enormous amounts of data \u2014 roughly 350 terabytes per day \u2014 which was stored on high-performance helium-filled hard drives.",
              "These data were flown to highly specialised supercomputers \u2014 known as correlators \u2014 at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy and MIT Haystack Observatory to be combined.",
              "They were then painstakingly converted into an image using novel computational tools developed by the collaboration.",
              "[4] 100 years ago, two expeditions set out for the island of Pri\u0301ncipe off the coast of Africa and Sobral in Brazil to observe the 1919 solar eclipse, with the goal of testing general relativity by seeing if starlight would be bent around the limb of the sun, as predicted by Einstein.",

              "This result provides overwhelming evidence that the object is indeed a black hole and yields valuable clues about the workings of such giants, which are thought to reside at the centre of most galaxies.",
              "The image was produced by a global research team called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration, using observations from a worldwide network of radio telescopes.",
              "The image is a long-anticipated look at the massive object that sits at the very centre of our galaxy.",
              "Scientists had previously seen stars orbiting around something invisible, compact, and very massive at the centre of the Milky Way.",
              "This strongly suggested that this object \u2014 known as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*, pronounced \"sadge-ay-star\") \u2014 is a black hole, and today\u2019s image provides the first direct visual evidence of it.",
              "Although we cannot see the black hole itself, because it is completely dark, glowing gas around it reveals a telltale signature: a dark central region (called a shadow) surrounded by a bright ring-like structure.",
              "The new view captures light bent by the powerful gravity of the black hole, which is four million times more massive than our Sun.",
              "\u201cWe were stunned by how well the size of the ring agreed with predictions from Einstein\u2019s Theory of General Relativity,\" said EHT Project Scientist Geoffrey Bower from the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei.",
              "\"These unprecedented observations have greatly improved our understanding of what happens at the very centre of our galaxy, and offer new insights on how these giant black holes interact with their surroundings.\"",
              "The EHT team's results are being published today in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
              "Because the black hole is about 27 000 light-years away from Earth, it appears to us to have about the same size in the sky as a doughnut on the Moon.",
              "To image it, the team created the powerful EHT, which linked together eight existing radio observatories across the planet to form a single \u201cEarth-sized\u201d virtual telescope [1].",
              "The EHT observed Sgr A* on multiple nights in 2017, collecting data for many hours in a row, similar to using a long exposure time on a camera.",
              "In addition to other facilities, the EHT network of radio observatories includes the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) in the Atacama Desert in Chile, co-owned and co-operated by ESO on behalf of its member states in Europe.",

              "But where gas takes days to weeks to orbit the larger M87*, in the much smaller Sgr A* it completes an orbit in mere minutes.",
              "This means the brightness and pattern of the gas around Sgr A* were changing rapidly as the EHT Collaboration was observing it \u2014 a bit like trying to take a clear picture of a puppy quickly chasing its tail.",
              "\u201d The researchers had to develop sophisticated new tools that accounted for the gas movement around Sgr A*.",
              "While M87* was an easier, steadier target, with nearly all images looking the same, that was not the case for Sgr A*.",

              "The effort was made possible through the ingenuity of more than 300 researchers from 80 institutes around the world that together make up the EHT Collaboration.",
              "In addition to developing complex tools to overcome the challenges of imaging Sgr A*, the team worked rigorously for five years, using supercomputers to combine and analyse their data, all while compiling an unprecedented library of simulated black holes to compare with the observations.",

              "His brother Jonathan is a chess grandmaster.",
              "Sir Roger shied away from competition as a child and struggled in exams. He told BBC Radio 4's The Life Scientific programme in 2016: \"I was good at maths, but I didn't necessarily do very well in my tests.\"",
              "However, he added: \"The teacher realised if he gave me enough time, I would do well.",
              "\"I think I had to do all my arithmetic working it out from first principles,\" he chuckled, adding: \"I just was slow, and I'm slow at writing.\"",
              "In the 1950s, he came up with the Penrose triangle, an impossible object which could be depicted in a perspective drawing but could not exist in reality.",
              "The triangle, along with other observations by Sir Roger and his father Lionel, influenced the Dutch artist MC Escher, who incorporated them into his artworks Waterfall, and Ascending and Descending.",
              "Inspired by the British scientist Dennis Sciama, Penrose next applied his mathematical ability to physics.",
              "In 1965, he published a landmark paper in which he was able to show that a black hole always hides a singularity, a boundary where space and time ends.",
              "The mathematical concept of \"trapped surfaces,\" was crucial to this giant leap in understanding.",
              "A trapped surface forces all rays to point towards a centre, regardless of whether the surface curves outwards or inwards.",
              "Once matter begins to collapse, as in the formation of a black hole, and a trapped surface forms, nothing can stop the process from continuing.",
              "Similarly, all matter crosses a black hole's event horizon in one direction, with everything carried towards an inescapable end at the singularity.",
              "Sir Roger held a lectureship at Birkbeck College (now Birkbeck, University of London) at the time of the breakthrough, and it was on the way to his workplace that he had a moment of inspiration.",
              "It occurred as he was in conversation with the physicist Ivor Robinson.",
              "The pair crossed a road and an image popped into Sir Roger's head of the trapped surfaces.",
              "He told the BBC: \"Maybe it was having myself be a bit distracted from [the black hole problem] which led to me thinking about it in a different way.\"",

              "Roger Penrose showed that black holes are a direct consequence of the general theory of relativity.",
              "Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez discovered that an invisible and extremely heavy object governs the stars\u2019 orbits at the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way.",
              "A supermassive black hole is the only currently known explanation.",
              "Roger Penrose invented ingenious mathematical methods to explore Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.",
              "He showed that the theory leads to the formation of black holes, those monsters in time and space that capture everything that enters them.",
              "Nothing, not even light, can escape.",
              "Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez each lead a group of astronomers who have focused on a region at the centre of the Milky Way since the early 1990s.",
              "With increasing precision, they have mapped the orbits of the brightest stars that are closest to the centre.",
              "Both groups found something that is both invisible and heavy, forcing this jumble of stars to swirl around.",
              "This invisible mass has about four million solar masses squeezed together in a region no larger than our solar system.",
              "What is it that makes the stars at the heart of the Milky Way swing around at such astonishing speeds?",
              "According to the current theory of gravity, there is only one candidate \u2013 a supermassive black hole.",
              "Not even Albert Einstein, the father of general relativity, thought that black holes could actually exist.",
              "However, ten years after Einstein\u2019s death, the British theorist Roger Penrose demonstrated that black holes can form and described their properties.",
              "At their heart, black holes hide a singularity, a boundary at which all the known laws of nature break down.",
              "To prove that black hole formation is a stable process, Penrose needed to expand the methods used to study the theory of relativity \u2013 tackling the theory\u2019s problems with new mathematical concepts.",
              "Penrose\u2019s ground-breaking article was published in January 1965 and is still regarded as the most important contribution to the general theory of relativity since Einstein.",
              "Black holes are perhaps the strangest consequence of the general theory of relativity.",
              "When Albert Einstein presented his theory in November 1915, it upended all the previous concepts of space and time.",
              "The theory provided an entirely new foundation for understanding gravity, which shapes the universe at the largest scale.",
              "Since then, this theory has provided the basis for all studies of the universe, and also has a practical use in one of our most common navigation tools, the GPS.",
              "Einstein\u2019s theory describes how everything and everyone in the universe is held in the grip of gravitation.",
              "Gravity holds us on Earth, it governs the orbits of the planets around the Sun and the orbit of the Sun around the centre of the Milky Way.",
              "It leads to the birth of stars from interstellar clouds, and eventually their death in a gravitational collapse.",
              "Gravitation brings shape to space and influences the passage of time.",
              "A heavy mass bends space and slows time;",
              "an extremely heavy mass can even cut off and encapsulate a piece of space \u2013 forming a black hole.",
              "The first theoretical description of what we now call a black hole came just a few weeks after the publication of the general theory of relativity.",
              "Despite the theory\u2019s extremely complicated mathematical equations, the German astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild was able to provide Einstein with a solution that described how heavy masses can bend space and time.",
              "Later studies showed that once a black hole has formed, it is surrounded by an event horizon that sweeps around the mass at its centre like a veil.",
              "The black hole remains forever hidden inside its event horizon.",
              "The greater the mass, the larger the black hole and its horizon.",
              "For a mass equivalent to the Sun, the event horizon has a diameter of almost three kilometres and, for a mass like that of the Earth, its diameter is just nine millimetres.",
              "The concept of the \u2018black hole\u2019 has found new meaning in many forms of cultural expression but, for physicists, black holes are the natural end point of the evolution of giant stars.",
              "The first calculation of the dramatic collapse of a massive star was made at the end of the 1930s, by physicist Robert Oppenheimer, who later led the Manhattan Project that constructed the first atomic bomb.",
              "When giant stars, many times heavier than the Sun, run out of fuel, they first explode as supernovas and then collapse into extremely densely packed remnants, so heavy that gravity pulls everything inside, even light.",
              "The idea of \u2018dark stars\u2019 was considered as long ago as the end of the 18th century, in the works of the British philosopher and mathematician John Michell and the renowned French scientist Pierre Simon de Laplace.",
              "Both had reasoned that heavenly bodies could become so dense that they would be invisible \u2013 not even the speed of light would be fast enough to escape their gravity.",
              "A little more than a century later, when Albert Einstein published his general theory of relativity, some of the solutions to the theory\u2019s notoriously difficult equations described just such dark stars.",
              "Up until the 1960s, these solutions were regarded as purely theoretical speculations, describing ideal situations in which stars and their black holes were perfectly round and symmetrical.",
              "But nothing in the universe is perfect, and Roger Penrose was the first to successfully find a realistic solution for all collapsing matter, with its dints, dimples and natural imperfections.",
              "The question of the existence of black holes resurfaced in 1963, with the discovery of quasars, the brightest objects in the universe.",
              "For almost a decade, astronomers had been puzzled by radio rays from mysterious sources, such as 3C273 in the constellation of Virgo.",
              "The radiation in visible light finally revealed its true location \u2013 3C273 is so far away that the rays travel towards Earth for over a billion years.",
              "If the light source is such a long way away, it must have an intensity equal to the light of several hundred galaxies.",
              "It was given the name \u2018quasar\u2019.",
              "Astronomers soon found quasars that were so distant they had emitted their radiation in the early childhood of the universe.",
              "Where does this incredible radiation come from?",
              "There is only one way to obtain that much energy within the limited volume of a quasar \u2013 from matter falling into a massive black hole.",
              "Whether black holes could form under realistic conditions was a question that puzzled Roger Penrose.",
              "The answer, as he later recalled, appeared in the autumn of 1964 during a walk with a colleague in London, where Penrose was professor of mathematics at Birkbeck College.",
              "When they stopped talking for a moment to cross a side street, an idea flashed into his mind.",
              "Later that afternoon, he searched for it in his memory.",
              "This idea, which he called trapped surfaces, was the key he had unconsciously been searching for, a crucial mathematical tool needed to describe a black hole.",
              "A trapped surface forces all rays to point towards a centre, regardless of whether the surface curves outwards or inwards.",
              "Using trapped surfaces, Penrose was able to prove that a black hole always hides a singularity, a boundary where time and space end.",
              "Its density is infinite and, as yet, there is no theory for how to approach this strangest phenomenon in physics.",
              "Trapped surfaces became a central concept in the completion of Penrose\u2019s proof of the singularity theorem.",
              "The topological methods he introduced are now invaluable in the study of our curved universe.",
              "Once matter begins to collapse and a trapped surface forms, nothing can stop the collapse from continuing.",
              "There is no way back, as in the story told by physicist and Nobel Laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, from his childhood in India.",
              "The story is about dragonflies and their larva, which live underwater.",
              "When a larva is ready to unfold its wings, it promises it will tell its friends what life is like on the other side of the water\u2019s surface.",
              "But once the larva passes through the surface and flies away as a dragonfly, there is no return.",
              "The larvae in the water will never hear the story of life on the other side.",
              "Similarly, all matter can only cross a black hole\u2019s event horizon in one direction.",
              "Time then replaces space and all possible paths point inwards, the flow of time carrying everything towards an inescapable end at the singularity (figure 2).",
              "You will not feel anything if you fall through the event horizon of a supermassive black hole.",
              "From the outside, no one can see you falling in and your journey towards the horizon continues forever.",
              "Peering into a black hole is not possible within the laws of physics;",
              "black holes hide all their secrets behind their event horizons.",
              "Even though we cannot see the black hole, it is possible to establish its properties by observing how its colossal gravity directs the motions of the surrounding stars.",
              "Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez each lead separate research groups that explore the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way.",
              "Shaped like a flat disc about 100,000 light years across, it consists of gas and dust and a few hundred billion stars;",
              "one of these stars is our Sun (figure 3).",
              "From our vantage point on Earth, enormous clouds of interstellar gas and dust obscure most of the visible light coming from the centre of the galaxy.",
              "Infrared telescopes and radio technology were what first allowed astronomers to see through the galaxy\u2019s disc and image the stars at the centre.",
              "Using the orbits of the stars as guides, Genzel and Ghez have produced the most convincing evidence yet that there is an invisible supermassive object hiding there.",
              "A black hole is the only possible explanation.",
              "Figure 2.",
              "A black hole is formed.",
              "For more than fifty years, physicists have suspected that there may be a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.",
              "Ever since quasars were discovered in the early 1960s, physicists reasoned that supermassive black holes might be found inside most large galaxies, including the Milky Way.",
              "However, no one can currently explain how the galaxies and their black holes, between a few million and many billion solar masses, were formed.",
              "One hundred years ago, the American astronomer Harlow Shapley was the first to identify the centre of the Milky Way, in the direction of the constellation of Sagittarius.",
              "With later observations astronomers found a strong source of radio waves there, which was given the name Sagittarius A*.",
              "Towards the end of the 1960s, it became clear that Sagittarius A* occupies the centre of the Milky Way, around which all stars in the galaxy orbit.",
              "It was not until the 1990s that bigger telescopes and better equipment allowed more systematic studies of Sagittarius A*.",
              "Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez each started projects to attempt to see through the dust clouds to the heart of the Milky Way.",
              "Along with their research groups, they developed and refined their techniques, building unique instruments and committing themselves to long-term research.",
              "Figure 3.",
              "The Milky Way, our galaxy, seen from above.",
              "It is shaped like a flat disc about 100,000 light-years across.",
              "Its spiral arms are made of gas and dust and a few hundred billion stars.",
              "One of these stars is our Sun.",
              "Only the world\u2019s biggest telescopes will suffice for gazing at distant stars \u2013 the bigger the better is absolutely true in astronomy.",
              "The German astronomer Reinhard Genzel and his group initially used NTT, the New Technology Telescope on La Silla mountain in Chile.",
              "They eventually moved their observations to the Very Large Telescope facility, VLT, on Paranal mountain (also in Chile).",
              "With four giant telescopes twice the size of NTT, the VLT has the world\u2019s biggest monolithic mirrors, each with a diameter of more than 8 metres.",
              "In the USA, Andrea Ghez and her research team use the Keck Observatory, located on the Hawaiian mountain of Mauna Kea.",
              "Its mirrors are almost 10 metres in diameter and are currently among the largest in the world.",
              "Each mirror is like a honeycomb, consisting of 36 hexagonal segments that can be controlled separately to better focus the starlight.",
              "However big the telescopes, there is always a limit to the detail they can resolve because we live at the bottom of an almost 100-kilometre-deep atmospheric sea.",
              "Large bubbles of air above the telescope, which are hotter or colder than their surroundings, act like lenses and refract the light on its way to the telescope\u2019s mirror, distorting the light waves.",
              "This is why the stars twinkle and also why their images are blurred.",
              "The advent of adaptive optics was crucial in improving observations.",
              "The telescopes are now equipped with a thin extra mirror that compensates for the air\u2019s turbulence and corrects the distorted image.",
              "For almost thirty years, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez have followed their stars in the distant stellar jumble at the centre of our galaxy.",
              "They continue to develop and refine the technology, with more sensitive digital light sensors and better adaptive optics, so that image resolution has improved more than a thousandfold.",
              "They are now able to more precisely determine the stars\u2019 positions, following them night by night.",
              "The researchers track some thirty of the brightest stars in the multitude.",
              "The stars move most rapidly within a radius of one light-month from the centre, inside which they perform a busy dance like that of a swarm of bees.",
              "The stars that are outside this area, on the other hand, follow their elliptical orbits in a more orderly manner (figure 4).",
              "One star, called S2 or S-O2, completes an orbit of the centre of the galaxy in less than 16 years.",
              "This is an extremely short time, so the astronomers were able to map its entire orbit.",
              "We can compare this to the Sun, which takes more than 200 million years to complete one lap around the Milky Way\u2019s centre;",
              "dinosaurs were walking the Earth when we started our current lap.",
              "Figure 4.",
              "The stars\u2019 orbits revealed that something invisible and heavy governed their paths at the heart of the Milky Way.",
              "The agreement between the measurements of the two teams was excellent, leading to the conclusion that the black hole at the centre of our galaxy should be equivalent to around 4 million solar masses, packed into a region the size of our solar system.",
              "We may soon get a direct look at Sagittarius A*.",
              "This is next on the list because, just over a year ago, the Event Horizon Telescope astronomy network succeeded in imaging the closest surroundings of a supermassive black hole.",
              "Farthest in, in the galaxy known as Messier 87 (M87), 55 million light years from us, is a blacker than black eye surrounded by a ring of fire.",
              "The black core of M87 is gigantic, more than one thousand times heavier than Sagittarius A*.",
              "The colliding black holes that caused the recently discovered gravitational waves were considerably lighter.",
              "Like black holes, gravitational waves existed only as calculations from Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, before being captured for the first time in the autumn of 2015, by the LIGO detector in the USA (Nobel Prize in Physics, 2017).",
              "Roger Penrose showed that black holes are a direct consequence of the general theory of relativity but, in the infinitely strong gravity of the singularity, this theory ceases to apply.",
              "Intensive work is being conducted in the field of theoretical physics to create a new theory of quantum gravity.",
              "This must unite the two pillars of physics, the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, which meet in the extreme interior of black holes.",
              "At the same time, observations are coming closer to black holes.",
              "The pioneering work of Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez has led the way for new generations of precise tests of the general theory of relativity and its most bizarre predictions.",

              "Black holes are where mass curves spacetime so much that nothing, not even light, can escape.",
              "Technically, the concept of a dense object from which light can\u2019t escape predates Einstein.",
              "The English priest and scientist John Michell and the French polymath Pierre-Simon Laplace independently suggested the idea in the late 1700s.",
              "But it was the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild who laid the groundwork for black holes as we know them today, when he solved Einstein\u2019s equations for how a symmetric, nonrotating, and hefty mass would curve the spacetime around it \u2014 all while on a World War I battlefront in early 1916.",
              "Black holes would not be scientifically palatable, however, for several decades.",
              "In 1939, calculations by American physicist Robert Oppenheimer and his student Hartland Snyder showed that an astronomical body will inevitably contract to a singularity of infinite density in certain cases of spherically symmetric collapse.",
              "An event horizon would surround the singularity, closing the interior off from the outside universe.",
              "(Einstein loathed the idea.)",
              "New Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr expanded the work to rotating objects in 1963.",
              "But it was Penrose in the mid-1960s who generalized the idea: He showed that collapse to a singularity always happens when there\u2019s enough mass/energy packed together, regardless of the symmetry of the collapse.",
              "Penrose introduced a new mathematical concept to make this leap: trapped surfaces.",
              "A trapped surface forces all rays perpendicular to it to converge, regardless of whether the surface curves inwards or outwards.",

              "And since nothing can travel faster than light, everything else falls in.",
              "The path inward is as inexorable as the forward arrow of time outside the black hole: one-way traffic only.",
              "The unavoidable outcome is a singularity \u2014 which, for related reasons, is sometimes described as a single moment in time.",
              "It remains unclear what the singularity actually is.",
              "All we know is, it\u2019s there that classical physics breaks down.",
              "(In gravity terms, spacetime becomes infinitely curved.)",
              "Among his other contributions, Penrose also discovered that it\u2019s possible to extract energy from a spinning black hole.",
              "Place a heavy mug on a cloth napkin and twist the mug.",
              "The napkin will twist with the mug, creating a warped cloth landscape.",
              "Something similar happens with a spinning black hole: It drags the fabric of spacetime around with it, in what\u2019s called the Lense-Thirring effect.",
              "(Earth does this, too, but not as severely.)",
              "The twisted region is called the ergosphere.",
              "Here, an astronaut (or asteroid, or any other object) would be forcibly dragged around with the black hole\u2019s rotation, even though they were outside the event horizon.",
              "Penrose realized that it\u2019s possible to steal rotational energy from the black hole via the ergosphere.",
              "Others have since used this insight to suggest that spin energy is how black holes power their relativistic jets, some of which shoot across thousands of light-years.",
              "Penrose\u2019s work helped explain how black holes could power distant, stupendously luminous sources discovered during the same years he was working on the singularity problem in the 1960s.",
              "These quasars were the first observational evidence of black holes.",
              "But it would take several decades for astronomers to amass the observations to convince themselves that supermassive black holes sit at the center of nearly every major galaxy.",
              "The objects even have a strangely symbiotic relationship with their hosts.",
              "Genzel and Ghez\u2019s work was pivotal in this effort.",
              "Thanks to a series of technical feats they either developed or took advantage of, the two astronomers and their competing teams have spent nearly three decades using the world\u2019s best ground-based infrared telescopes to peer through the dusty gas of our galaxy\u2019s center.",
              "Here, deep in the heart of the Milky Way, they saw dozens of stars looping pell-mell around an invisible center.",
              "By tracing the stars\u2019 motions over years, the astronomers mapped out the stars\u2019 orbits \u2014 which, it must be emphasized, is no mean feat: These stars are more than 26,000 light-years away and crowd together in the field of view like moving polka dots.",
              "The orbits revealed that the stars revolve around an unseen, unmoving, and compact something-or-other with the mass of 4 million Suns.",
              "The best explanation is a supermassive black hole, which astronomers call Sagittarius A*.",
              "The teams\u2019 observations have also enabled them to confirm two predictions of general relativity: gravitational redshift and orbital precession.",
              "As the star S2 (S0-2 in the Ghez team\u2019s nomenclature) bore down on Sgr A* in 2018, it dipped into the spacetime valley the black hole makes around itself.",
              "During this time, the star\u2019s light had to work harder to climb out and reach us.",
              "The energy loss reddened the light, which both teams detected.",
              "Traveling through the warped spacetime also shifted the star\u2019s path slightly.",
              "Its incoming angle changed by a tiny amount, which in turn changed the location of its closest approach to the black hole.",
              "Over many passes, the star\u2019s orbit will trace out a rosette shape instead of a single ellipse.",
              "Genzel\u2019s team reported the first evidence of this shift earlier this year.",
              "Astronomers both inside and outside the teams credit the longstanding competition between the two groups for driving them to excellence.",
              "Their results \u2014 arrived at with independent methods and observations \u2014 also provide a beautiful confirmation of each other\u2019s analyses that can be hard to come by in science.",
              "In short, the three newly minted Nobel laureates are remarkable scientists.",
              "But the real winners, one might argue, are black holes.",
              "A century ago, they were math on paper;",
              "now, they\u2019re as common in the cosmos as dust bunnies under a couch.",
              "Genzel, Ghez, and Penrose helped make that happen.",
              "The Nobel Committee for Physics has released two excellent write-ups of the winners\u2019 work: a detailed explanation for the public and a more technical scientific background document.",
              "These both go into far more detail than I have here, and I encourage you to read them \u2014 not just about these awards, but on any topic that\u2019s received a Nobel: The prize committee write-ups are often superb sources of information.",

              "They emit no light that we can detect, unless material is falling onto them, a process that generates X-rays from the space around the black hole.",

              "Almost.",
              "What a black hole does have is an extreme gravitational field, so powerful that it warps any light that travels through it.",
              "For us, as observers, that means we might see a distant star appear brighter, and in a different position, than how it appears normally.",
              "On 2 June 2011, that's exactly what happened.",
              "Two separate microlensing surveys \u2013 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) \u2013 independently recorded an event that ended up peaking on July 20.",
              "This event was named MOA-2011-BLG-191/OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 (shortened to OB110462), and because it was unusually long and unusually bright, scientists homed in for a closer look.",

              "It's not a guarantee, though, because the duration of the brightening episode not only depends on how massive the foreground lens is, but also on how fast the foreground lens and background star are moving relative to each other.",

              "This result, they say, suggests that perhaps a supernova explosion is not necessary for the birth of a black hole.",

              "By Andy Tomaswick, Universe Today February 7, 2022 Microlensing strikes again.",
              "Astronomers have been using the technique to detect everything from rogue planets to the most distant star ever seen.",
              "Now, astronomers have officially found another elusive object that has long been theorized, and that Universe Today first reported on back in 2009 but has never directly detected \u2013 a rogue black hole.",
              "That detection comes at the end of a 6-year observational campaign, with dozens of authors collaborating on a paper recently published in arXiv (meaning it has not yet been peer-reviewed).",
              "Those six years of painstakingly gathered data all started back in 2011, when a star about 20,000 light-years away brightened suddenly.",
              "Scientists were looking for just such an event and had found several before but needed more data to be sure of what they were actually seeing.",
              "Microlensing leaves two tell-tale signs.",
              "The object in the background of a microlensing event would grow significantly bright, as was seen with this star in 2011.",
              "In addition, and if the positioning were lucky enough, telescopes would see the star shift ever so slightly as the massive lensing object passed in front of it.",
              "Past observations have shown plenty of brightening events that microlenses might have caused, but astronomers have never before seen the positional shift that would confirm that theory.",
              "Kailash Sahu and his colleagues turned Hubble, which is still one of the most functional observation platforms in humanity\u2019s arsenal, toward the star a few weeks after its original brightening.",
              "They then checked back in with it periodically over the course of the next six years.",
              "In that time frame, they also collected positional data, hoping to use a technique called astrometry to detect slight movements that would indicate the star was subject to a microlensing object between itself and Hubble.",
              "What Hubble saw was a mix of light amplification and warping.",
              "Just the fact that it was heavy enough to produce a microlensing effect, however, was insufficient to show that the heavy object in front of the star was a black hole.",
              "Sahu and his colleagues examined the lens\u2019s light level to rule out any more possible microlens sources.",
              "None were discovered, which would have been the case if a different object\u2014like a brown dwarf\u2014had been the source of the lens.",
              "Furthermore, the lensing effect must last long enough to indicate a very deep gravity well.",
              "The first event in 2011 lasted 300 days, which was long enough to identify a black hole with a mass that is around 7.",
              "1 times greater than the sun.",
              "With that weight estimate, scientists were also able to estimate how fast the black hole was moving and came up with around 45 kilometers per second \u2013 much faster than the stars surrounding it in that area of the Milky Way.",
              "Such a speed differential also points to a potential source of the black hole itself \u2013 an explosion from a supermassive star probably both created the black hole and kicked it on its way.",
              "Sahu estimates the event happened around 100 million years ago, but it is hard to tell as there is no clear, traceable path to where the black hole came from.",
              "Even without that clear, traceable path, scientists have now definitively found something they have long sought, and they won\u2019t be alone in doing so.",
              "Several all-sky surveys are popping up soon that will help scientists consistently scan the skies for events like that in June 2011, and they will most likely find plenty more.",
              "That isn\u2019t to say that any of these hard-to-see masses of gravity will prove a threat to Earth, but the more we leverage new techniques like microlensing, the more likely we are to find any that eventually might be.",

              "Key characteristics of black holes include their masses and their 'spin' - they rotate even though they have no actual surface, with an 'event horizon' that defines where light cannot escape.",
              "Observers have uncovered black holes spanning a broad spread of masses, ranging from those comparable to the mass of stars to ones millions or billions of times the mass of our Sun, the \"supermassive black holes.\"",
              "We now know that the majority of large galaxies harbor such supermassive black holes, although major questions remain about how they form and evolve.",
              "While the defining characteristic of a black hole is its event horizon, we know that light does emit from regions just beyond the event horizon.",
              "Matter orbiting around the supermassive black holes does emit light, from radio to gamma rays.",
              "Employing an array of telescopes located on Earth, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) recently obtained images of two supermassive black holes at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths by capturing the emitted light originating from electrons orbiting within the innermost vicinity around the black hole.",
              "The main targets for the EHTC are the supermassive black hole residing at the core of the elliptical galaxy Messier 87, along with SgrA*, which lives at the very heart of our Milky Way galaxy.",
              "The EHT images of both sources show rings of emission formed when radio waves emitted close to the event horizon are bent in the curved spacetime close to the black hole - the mass and spin of the black holes determine the size and shape of these rings.",
              "The light emitted from the black hole's vicinity is 'polarized,' with a distinct orientation depending upon its origin.",
              "On Earth, we use polarized sunglasses to cut down on glare from reflected sunlight, as reflection from water or a car\u2019s windshield induces a polarization to the light.",
              "I have recently led a team that presented an innovative approach for estimating black hole properties such as spin using the polarization - the results have just been published in The Astrophysical Journal.",
              "We demonstrated that the spin of a black hole should detectably change the polarization of the emitted radio waves.",
              "We also found that the temperature of the rotating electrons within the plasma (gas that is so hot that all of the atoms have had their electrons stripped away) that orbits the supermassive black hole along with the strength of the magnetic field in the region all affect the results, making a complex picture but one with new power to reveal otherwise undetectable black hole characteristics.",

              "The transfer of momentum from the photons to the gas by way of radiation pressure is the only process that can be almost 100% efficient, but dust must cover a large solid angle.",
              "The low momentum of photons with respect to their energy also limits the mass that can be ejected through this mechanism, as photons are massless particles.",
              "If the momentum in the photons radiated by an AGN was transferred to the gas with 100% efficiency, this momentum could eject a gas mass equal to at most \u223c10% of the bulge stellar mass, which is the mass of the gas that is typically left over at the end of a gas-rich merger.",

              "The interpretation is that when the growth of the black hole is activated, the star formation rate declines.",

              "Here\u2019s everything you need to know to understand this week\u2019s massive physics news.",
              "What are gravitational waves?",
              "Long predicted but never directly seen, gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of the universe.",
              "Advertisement Albert Einstein compared the universe\u2019s shape to a single fabric, hewn from space and time.",
              "According to his theory of general relativity, the force of gravity is the result of curvature in this space-time, and gravitational waves are ripples in it, produced when massive objects like black holes collide.",
              "Who has found them?",
              "If rumours are to be believed, researchers working on the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) experiment.",
              "This pair of detectors, sitting 3000 kilometres apart in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, use lasers to pick up tiny variations in space-time that could be caused by a passing gravitational wave.",
              "The LIGO team have scheduled a press conference on Thursday, and an exclusive New Scientist analysis suggests they may have seen as many as three such signals.",
              "Why does it matter?",
              "Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity revolutionised our understanding of gravity and is one of the great pillars of modern physics.",
              "But we know it can\u2019t fully describe the universe because it disagrees with another major theory, quantum mechanics.",
              "By studying gravitational waves, the final unconfirmed prediction of Einstein\u2019s theory, physicists may be able to figure out a way to extend it.",
              "What else can they do?",
              "Besides putting Einstein to the test, the first confirmed observation of gravitational waves will mark the beginning of a new kind of astronomy.",
              "Just as we use various electromagnetic wavelengths such as visible light, infrared and X-rays to study the cosmos, gravitational waves will act as a brand new eye on the universe, potentially giving us greater insight into objects like black holes and neutron stars.",
              "Has anyone tried to see them before?",
              "In 1974, astronomers Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor detected a binary pulsar, a pair of two dead stars emitting pulses of radio waves.",
              "Hulse and Taylor realised that the two pulsars were losing energy and slowly spiralling towards each other in a way that was exactly consistent with Einstein\u2019s equations of general relativity: the missing energy is thought to be emitted as gravitational waves.",
              "The finding earned the pair the Nobel prize for physics in 1993.",
              "Wasn\u2019t there a big fuss over gravitational waves a few years ago?",
              "In 2014, researchers on the BICEP2 telescope announced they had seen signs of primordial gravitational waves, ripples created not from modern-day black hole collisions but from the big bang itself.",
              "But the team later had to backtrack on these claims, after it turned out they hadn\u2019t accounted for the effects of galactic dust.",
