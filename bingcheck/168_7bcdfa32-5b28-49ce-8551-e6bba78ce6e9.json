As the universe expanded and cooled down, tiny particles grouped together to form atoms. Then those atoms grouped together to form stars and galaxies[^4^].

              "The theory itself was originally formalised by Father Georges Lemai\u0302tre in 1927.",
              "[1] Hubble's Law of the expansion of the universe provided foundational support for the theory.",
              "In medieval philosophy, there was much debate over whether the universe had a finite or infinite past (see Temporal finitism).",
              "The philosophy of Aristotle held that the universe had an infinite past, which caused problems for past Jewish and Islamic philosophers who were unable to reconcile the Aristotelian conception of the eternal with the Abrahamic view of creation.",
              "[2] As a result, a variety of logical arguments for the universe having a finite past were developed by John Philoponus, Al-Kindi, Saadia Gaon, Al-Ghazali and Immanuel Kant, among others.",
              "[3] English theologian Robert Grosseteste explored the nature of matter and the cosmos in his 1225 treatise De Luce (On Light).",
              "He described the birth of the universe in an explosion and the crystallization of matter to form stars and planets in a set of nested spheres around Earth.",

              "Seventy-seven years later, Isaac Newton described large-scale motion throughout the universe.",
              "The description of a universe that expanded and contracted in a cyclic manner was first put forward in a poem published in 1791 by Erasmus Darwin.",
              "Edgar Allan Poe presented a similar cyclic system in his 1848 essay titled Eureka: A Prose Poem;",
              "it is obviously not a scientific work, but Poe, while starting from metaphysical principles, tried to explain the universe using contemporary physical and mental knowledge.",
              "Ignored by the scientific community and often misunderstood by literary critics, its scientific implications have been reevaluated in recent times.",

              "\"Divine Volition\", manifesting itself as a repulsive force, fragmented the Primordial Particle into atoms. Atoms spread evenly throughout space, until the repulsive force stops, and attraction appears as a reaction: then matter begins to clump together forming stars and star systems, while the material universe is drawn back together by gravity, finally collapsing and ending eventually returning to the Primordial Particle stage in order to begin the process of repulsion and attraction once again.",
              "This part of Eureka describes a Newtonian evolving universe which shares a number of properties with relativistic models, and for this reason Poe anticipates some themes of modern cosmology.",
              "[5] Observationally, in the 1910s, Vesto Slipher and later, Carl Wilhelm Wirtz, determined that most spiral nebulae (now correctly called spiral galaxies) were receding from Earth.",
              "Slipher used spectroscopy to investigate the rotation periods of planets, the composition of planetary atmospheres, and was the first to observe the radial velocities of galaxies.",
              "Wirtz observed a systematic redshift of nebulae, which was difficult to interpret in terms of a cosmology in which the universe is filled more or less uniformly with stars and nebulae.",
              "They weren't aware of the cosmological implications, nor that the supposed nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own Milky Way.",
              "[6] Also in that decade, Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity was found to admit no static cosmological solutions, given the basic assumptions of cosmology described in the Big Bang's theoretical underpinnings.",
              "The universe (i.",
              "e., the space-time metric) was described by a metric tensor that was either expanding or shrinking (i.",
              "e., was not constant or invariant).",
              "This result, coming from an evaluation of the field equations of the general theory, at first led Einstein himself to consider that his formulation of the field equations of the general theory may be in error, and he tried to correct it by adding a cosmological constant.",
              "This constant would restore to the general theory's description of space-time an invariant metric tensor for the fabric of space/existence.",
              "The first person to seriously apply general relativity to cosmology without the stabilizing cosmological constant was Alexander Friedmann.",
              "Friedmann derived the expanding-universe solution to general relativity field equations in 1922.",

              "He based his theory on the work of Einstein and De Sitter, and independently derived Friedmann's equations for an expanding universe.",
              "Also, the red shifts themselves were not constant, but varied in such manner as to lead to the conclusion that there was a definite relationship between amount of red-shift of nebulae, and their distance from observers.",
              "In 1929, Edwin Hubble provided a comprehensive observational foundation for Lemaitre's theory.",
              "Hubble's experimental observations discovered that, relative to the Earth and all other observed bodies, galaxies are receding in every direction at velocities (calculated from their observed red-shifts) directly proportional to their distance from the Earth and each other.",
              "In 1929, Hubble and Milton Humason formulated the empirical Redshift Distance Law of galaxies, nowadays known as Hubble's law, which, once the Redshift is interpreted as a measure of recession speed, is consistent with the solutions of Einstein's General Relativity Equations for a homogeneous, isotropic expanding universe.",
              "The law states that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation.",
              "In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that most of the universe was expanding and moving away from everything else.",
              "If everything is moving away from everything else, then it should be thought that everything was once closer together.",
              "The logical conclusion is that at some point, all matter started from a single point a few millimetres across before exploding outward.",
              "It was so hot that it consisted of only raw energy for hundreds of thousands of years before the matter could form.",
              "Whatever happened had to unleash an unfathomable force, since the universe is still expanding billions of years later.",
              "The theory he devised to explain what he found is called the Big Bang theory.",
              "[citation needed] In 1931, Lemai\u0302tre proposed in his \"hypothe\u0300se de l'atome primitif\" (hypothesis of the primeval atom) that the universe began with the \"explosion\" of the \"primeval atom\" \u2013 what was later called the Big Bang.",
              "Lemai\u0302tre first took cosmic rays to be the remnants of the event, although it is now known that they originate within the local galaxy.",
              "Lemaitre had to wait until shortly before his death to learn of the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation, the remnant radiation of a dense and hot phase in the early universe.",
              "[8] Hubble's Law had suggested that the universe was expanding, contradicting the cosmological principle whereby the universe, when viewed on sufficiently large distance scales, has no preferred directions or preferred places.",
              "Hubble's idea allowed for two opposing hypotheses to be suggested.",
              "One was Lemai\u0302tre's Big Bang, advocated and developed by George Gamow.",
              "The other model was Fred Hoyle's Steady State theory, in which new matter would be created as the galaxies moved away from each other.",
              "In this model, the universe is roughly the same at any point in time.",
              "It was actually Hoyle who coined the name of Lemai\u0302tre's theory, referring to it as \"this 'big bang' idea\" during a radio broadcast on 28 March 1949, on the BBC Third Programme.",
              "It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative \"steady state\" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models.",
              "[9] Hoyle repeated the term in further broadcasts in early 1950, as part of a series of five lectures entitled The Nature of The Universe.",
              "The text of each lecture was published in The Listener a week after the broadcast, the first time that the term \"big bang\" appeared in print.",
              "[10] As evidence in favour of the Big Bang model mounted, and the consensus became widespread, Hoyle himself, albeit somewhat reluctantly, admitted to it by formulating a new cosmological model that other scientists later referred to as the \"Steady Bang\".",
              "[11] From around 1950 to 1965, the support for these theories was evenly divided, with a slight imbalance arising from the fact that the Big Bang theory could explain both the formation and the observed abundances of hydrogen and helium, whereas the Steady State could explain how they were formed, but not why they should have the observed abundances.",
              "However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state.",
              "Objects such as quasars and radio galaxies were observed to be much more common at large distances (therefore in the distant past) than in the nearby universe, whereas the Steady State predicted that the average properties of the universe should be unchanging with time.",
              "In addition, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 was considered the death knell of the Steady State, although this prediction was only qualitative, and failed to predict the exact temperature of the CMB.",
              "(The key big bang prediction is the black-body spectrum of the CMB, which was not measured with high accuracy until COBE in 1990).",
              "After some reformulation, the Big Bang has been regarded as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos.",
              "Before the late 1960s, many cosmologists thought the infinitely dense and physically paradoxical singularity at the starting time of Friedmann's cosmological model could be avoided by allowing for a universe which was contracting before entering the hot dense state, and starting to expand again.",
              "This was formalized as Richard Tolman's oscillating universe.",
              "In the sixties, Stephen Hawking and others demonstrated that this idea was unworkable,[citation needed] and the singularity is an essential feature of the physics described by Einstein's gravity.",
              "This led the majority of cosmologists to accept the notion that the universe as currently described by the physics of general relativity has a finite age.",
              "However, due to a lack of a theory of quantum gravity, there is no way to say whether the singularity is an actual origin point for the universe, or whether the physical processes that govern the regime cause the universe to be effectively eternal in character.",
              "Through the 1970s and 1980s, most cosmologists accepted the Big Bang, but several puzzles remained, including the non-discovery of anisotropies in the CMB, and occasional observations hinting at deviations from a black-body spectrum;",
              "thus the theory was not very strongly confirmed.",
              "Huge advances in Big Bang cosmology were made in the 1990s and the early 21st century, as a result of major advances in telescope technology in combination with large amounts of satellite data, such as COBE, the Hubble Space Telescope and WMAP.",
              "In 1990, measurements from the COBE satellite showed that the spectrum of the CMB matches a 2.",
              "725 K black-body to very high precision;",
              "deviations do not exceed 2 parts in 100000.",
              "This showed that earlier claims of spectral deviations were incorrect, and essentially proved that the universe was hot and dense in the past, since no other known mechanism can produce a black-body to such high accuracy.",
              "Further observations from COBE in 1992 discovered the very small anisotropies of the CMB on large scales, approximately as predicted from Big Bang models with dark matter.",
              "From then on, models of non-standard cosmology without some form of Big Bang became very rare in the mainstream astronomy journals.",
              "In 1998, measurements of distant supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and this was supported by other observations including ground-based CMB observations and large galaxy red-shift surveys.",
              "In 1999\u20132000, the Boomerang and Maxima balloon-borne CMB observations showed that the geometry of the universe is close to flat, then in 2001 the 2dFGRS galaxy red-shift survey estimated the mean matter density around 25\u201330 percent of critical density.",
              "From 2001 to 2010, NASA's WMAP spacecraft took very detailed pictures of the universe by means of the cosmic microwave background radiation.",
              "The images can be interpreted to indicate that the universe is 13.",
              "7 billion years old (within one percent error) and that the Lambda-CDM model and the inflationary theory are correct.",
              "No other cosmological theory can yet explain such a wide range of observed parameters, from the ratio of the elemental abundances in the early universe to the structure of the cosmic microwave background, the observed higher abundance of active galactic nuclei in the early universe and the observed masses of clusters of galaxies.",

              "A Belgian priest named Georges Lemai\u0302tre first suggested the big bang theory in the 1920s, when he theorized that the universe began from a single primordial atom.",
              "The idea received major boosts from Edwin Hubble's observations that galaxies are speeding away from us in all directions, as well as from the 1960s discovery of cosmic microwave radiation\u2014interpreted as echoes of the big bang\u2014by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson.",

              "Here\u2019s the theory: In the first 10^-43 seconds of its existence, the universe was very compact, less than a million billion billionth the size of a single atom.",
              "It's thought that at such an incomprehensibly dense, energetic state, the four fundamental forces\u2014gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces\u2014were forged into a single force, but our current theories haven't yet figured out how a single, unified force would work.",
              "To pull this off, we'd need to know how gravity works on the subatomic scale, but we currently don't.",
              "It's also thought that the extremely close quarters allowed the universe's very first particles to mix, mingle, and settle into roughly the same temperature.",
              "Then, in an unimaginably small fraction of a second, all that matter and energy expanded outward more or less evenly, with tiny variations provided by fluctuations on the quantum scale.",
              "That model of breakneck expansion, called inflation, may explain why the universe has such an even temperature and distribution of matter.",
              "After inflation, the universe continued to expand but at a much slower rate.",
              "It's still unclear what exactly powered inflation.",
              "As time passed and matter cooled, more diverse kinds of particles began to form, and they eventually condensed into the stars and galaxies of our present universe.",

              "But as the universe cooled, photons no longer packed enough punch to make matter-antimatter pairs.",

              "Within the universe's first second, it was cool enough for the remaining matter to coalesce into protons and neutrons, the familiar particles that make up atoms' nuclei.",
              "And after the first three minutes, the protons and neutrons had assembled into hydrogen and helium nuclei.",
              "By mass, hydrogen was 75 percent of the early universe's matter, and helium was 25 percent.",
              "The abundance of helium is a key prediction of big bang theory, and it's been confirmed by scientific observations.",
              "Despite having atomic nuclei, the young universe was still too hot for electrons to settle in around them to form stable atoms. The universe's matter remained an electrically charged fog that was so dense, light had a hard time bouncing its way through.",

              "It took that long for gravity to gather clouds of hydrogen and forge them into stars.",
              "Many physicists think that vast clouds of dark matter, a still-unknown material that outweighs visible matter by more than five to one, provided a gravitational scaffold for the first galaxies and stars.",
              "Once the universe's first stars ignited, the light they unleashed packed enough punch to once again strip electrons from neutral atoms, a key chapter of the universe called reionization.",

              "[25][26] The Planck epoch was succeeded by the grand unification epoch beginning at 10\u221243 seconds, where gravitation separated from the other forces as the universe's temperature fell.",
              "[24] At approximately 10\u221237 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially, unconstrained by the light speed invariance, and temperatures dropped by a factor of 100,000.",
              "This concept is motivated by the flatness problem, where the density of matter and energy is very close to the critical density needed to produce a flat universe.",

              "Microscopic quantum fluctuations that occurred because of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle were \"frozen in\" by inflation, becoming amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe.",
              "[27] At a time around 10\u221236 seconds, the electroweak epoch begins when the strong nuclear force separates from the other forces, with only the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force remaining unified.",
              "[28] Inflation stopped locally at around 10\u221233 to 10\u221232 seconds, with the observable universe's volume having increased by a factor of at least 1078.",

              "[29][30] Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle\u2013antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions.",
              "[1] At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons\u2014of the order of one part in 30 million.",
              "This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.",
              "[31] The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing.",
              "Symmetry-breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form, with the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force separating at about 10\u221212 seconds.",
              "[28][32] After about 10\u221211 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle accelerators.",
              "At about 10\u22126 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons.",
              "The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons.",

              "A mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 108 of the original matter particles and none of their antiparticles.",
              "[33] A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons.",
              "After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by photons (with a minor contribution from neutrinos).",
              "A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion kelvin and the density of matter in the universe was comparable to the current density of Earth's atmosphere, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN).",
              "[34] Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.",
              "[35] As the universe cooled, the rest energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon radiation.",
              "After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen), which were able to emit radiation.",
              "This relic radiation, which continued through space largely unimpeded, is known as the cosmic microwave background.",
              "[35] Over a long period of time, the slightly denser regions of the uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today.",

              "[52][53] Another issue pointed out by Santhosh Mathew is that bang implies sound, which is not an important feature of the model.",

              "In the sixties, Stephen Hawking and others demonstrated that this idea was unworkable,[citation needed] and the singularity is an essential feature of the physics described by Einstein's gravity.",
              "This led the majority of cosmologists to accept the notion that the universe as currently described by the physics of general relativity has a finite age.",
              "However, due to a lack of a theory of quantum gravity, there is no way to say whether the singularity is an actual origin point for the universe, or whether the physical processes that govern the regime cause the universe to be effectively eternal in character.",
              "Through the 1970s and 1980s, most cosmologists accepted the Big Bang, but several puzzles remained, including the non-discovery of anisotropies in the CMB, and occasional observations hinting at deviations from a black-body spectrum;",
              "thus the theory was not very strongly confirmed.",
              "Huge advances in Big Bang cosmology were made in the 1990s and the early 21st century, as a result of major advances in telescope technology in combination with large amounts of satellite data, such as COBE, the Hubble Space Telescope and WMAP.",
              "In 1990, measurements from the COBE satellite showed that the spectrum of the CMB matches a 2.",
              "725 K black-body to very high precision;",
              "deviations do not exceed 2 parts in 100000.",
              "This showed that earlier claims of spectral deviations were incorrect, and essentially proved that the universe was hot and dense in the past, since no other known mechanism can produce a black-body to such high accuracy.",
              "Further observations from COBE in 1992 discovered the very small anisotropies of the CMB on large scales, approximately as predicted from Big Bang models with dark matter.",
              "From then on, models of non-standard cosmology without some form of Big Bang became very rare in the mainstream astronomy journals.",
              "In 1998, measurements of distant supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and this was supported by other observations including ground-based CMB observations and large galaxy red-shift surveys.",
              "In 1999\u20132000, the Boomerang and Maxima balloon-borne CMB observations showed that the geometry of the universe is close to flat, then in 2001 the 2dFGRS galaxy red-shift survey estimated the mean matter density around 25\u201330 percent of critical density.",
              "From 2001 to 2010, NASA's WMAP spacecraft took very detailed pictures of the universe by means of the cosmic microwave background radiation.",
              "The images can be interpreted to indicate that the universe is 13.",
              "7 billion years old (within one percent error) and that the Lambda-CDM model and the inflationary theory are correct.",
              "No other cosmological theory can yet explain such a wide range of observed parameters, from the ratio of the elemental abundances in the early universe to the structure of the cosmic microwave background, the observed higher abundance of active galactic nuclei in the early universe and the observed masses of clusters of galaxies.",
              "In 2013 and 2015, ESA's Planck spacecraft released even more detailed images of the cosmic microwave background, showing consistency with the Lambda-CDM model to still higher precision.",
              "Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding what happened in the earliest times after the Big Bang, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.",
              "Cosmologists continue to calculate many of the parameters of the Big Bang to a new level of precision, and carry out more detailed observations which are hoped to provide clues to the nature of dark energy and dark matter, and to test the theory of General Relativity on cosmic scales."

              "This Planck period of time extends from point 0 to approximately 10-43 seconds, and is so named because it can only be measured in Planck time.",
              "Due to the extreme heat and density of matter, the state of the universe was highly unstable.",

              "It is here that the fundamental forces that govern the Universe are believed to have began separating from each other.",
              "The first step in this was the force of gravitation separating from gauge forces, which account for strong and weak nuclear forces and electromagnetism.",
              "Then, from 10-36 to 10-32 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe was low enough (1028 K) that the forces of electromagnetism (strong force) and weak nuclear forces (weak interaction) were able to separate as well, forming two distinct forces.",

              "For example, scientists believe that about 10-11 seconds after the Big Bang, particle energies dropped considerably.",
              "At about 10-6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons, and a small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons.",
              "Since temperatures were not high enough to create new proton-antiproton pairs (or neutron-anitneutron pairs), mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 1010 of the original protons and neutrons and none of their antiparticles.",
              "A similar process happened at about 1 second after the Big Bang for electrons and positrons.",
              "After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by photons \u2013 and to a lesser extent, neutrinos.",

              "Thanks to temperatures dropping to 1 billion kelvin and the energy densities dropping to about the equivalent of air, neutrons and protons began to combine to form the universe's first deuterium (a stable isotope of Hydrogen) and helium atoms. However, most of the Universe's protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.",

              "This consists of visible matter distributed in structures of various sizes, ranging from stars and planets to galaxies, galaxy clusters, and super clusters \u2013 where matter is concentrated \u2013 that are separated by enormous gulfs containing few galaxies.",

              "In other words, as long as the density of matter remains at or above a certain value (1-3 \u00d710-26 kg of matter per m3), the Universe will eventually contract.",

              "Meanwhile, all existing stars would burn out and become white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes.",
              "Very gradually, collisions between these black holes would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes.",
              "The average temperature of the universe would approach absolute zero, and black holes would evaporate after emitting the last of their Hawking radiation.",

              "We live in a universe that is full of bright objects.",
              "On a clear night one can see thousands of stars with the naked eye.",
              "These stars occupy merely a small nearby part of the Milky Way galaxy;",

              "Astronomers have long wondered: How did this dramatic transition from darkness to light come about?",
              "After decades of study, researchers have recently made great strides toward answering this question.",
              "Using sophisticated computer simulation techniques, cosmologists have devised models that show how the density fluctuations left over from the big bang could have evolved into the first stars.",
              "In addition, observations of distant quasars have allowed scientists to probe back in time and catch a glimpse of the final days of the \u201ccosmic dark ages.",
              "\u201d The new models indicate that the first stars were most likely quite massive and luminous and that their formation was an epochal event that fundamentally changed the universe and its subsequent evolution.",
              "These stars altered the dynamics of the cosmos by heating and ionizing the surrounding gases.",
              "The earliest stars also produced and dispersed the first heavy elements, paving the way for the eventual formation of solar systems like our own.",
              "And the collapse of some of the first stars may have seeded the growth of supermassive black holes that formed in the hearts of galaxies and became the spectacular power sources of quasars.",
              "In short, the earliest stars made possible the emergence of the universe that we see today\u2014everything from galaxies and quasars to planets and people.",
              "The Dark Ages The study of the early universe is hampered by a lack of direct observations.",
              "Astronomers have been able to examine much of the universe\u2019s history by training their telescopes on distant galaxies and quasars that emitted their light billions of years ago.",
              "The age of each object can be determined by the redshift of its light, which shows how much the universe has expanded since the light was produced.",
              "The oldest galaxies and quasars that have been observed so far date from about a billion years after the big bang (assuming a present age for the universe of 12 billion to 14 billion years).",
              "Researchers will need better telescopes to see more distant objects dating from still earlier times.",
              "Cosmologists, however, can make deductions about the early universe based on the cosmic microwave background radiation, which was emitted about 400,000 years after the big bang.",
              "The uniformity of this radiation indicates that matter was distributed very smoothly at that time.",
              "Because there were no large luminous objects to disturb the primordial soup, it must have remained smooth and featureless for millions of years afterward.",
              "As the cosmos expanded, the background radiation redshifted to longer wavelengths and the universe grew increasingly cold and dark.",
              "Astronomers have no observations of this dark era.",
              "But by a billion years after the big bang, some bright galaxies and quasars had already appeared, so the first stars must have formed sometime before.",
              "When did these first luminous objects arise, and how might they have formed?",
              "Many astrophysicists, including Martin Rees of the University of Cambridge and Abraham Loeb of Harvard University, have made important contributions toward solving these problems. The recent studies begin with the standard cosmological models that describe the evolution of the universe following the big bang.",
              "Although the early universe was remarkably smooth, the background radiation shows evidence of small-scale density fluctuations\u2014clumps in the primordial soup.",
              "The cosmological models predict that these clumps would gradually evolve into gravitationally bound structures.",
              "Smaller systems would form first and then merge into larger agglomerations.",
              "The denser regions would take the form of a network of filaments, and the first star-forming systems\u2014small protogalaxies\u2014would coalesce at the nodes of this network.",
              "In a similar way, the protogalaxies would then merge to form galaxies, and the galaxies would congregate into galaxy clusters.",
              "The process is ongoing: although galaxy formation is now mostly complete, galaxies are still assembling into clusters, which are in turn aggregating into a vast filamentary network that stretches across the universe.",
              "According to the cosmological models, the first small systems capable of forming stars should have appeared between 100 million and 250 million years after the big bang.",
              "These protogalaxies would have been 100,000 to one million times more massive than the sun and would have measured about 30 to 100 light-years across.",
              "These properties are similar to those of the molecular gas clouds in which stars are currently forming in the Milky Way, but the first protogalaxies would have differed in some fundamental ways.",
              "For one, they would have consisted mostly of dark matter, the putative elementary particles that are believed to make up about 90 percent of the universe\u2019s mass.",
              "In present-day large galaxies, dark matter is segregated from ordinary matter: over time, ordinary matter concentrates in the galaxy\u2019s inner region, whereas the dark matter remains scattered throughout an enormous outer halo.",
              "But in the protogalaxies, the ordinary matter would still have been mixed with the dark matter.",
              "The second important difference is that the protogalaxies would have contained no significant amounts of any elements besides hydrogen and helium.",
              "The big bang produced hydrogen and helium, but most of the heavier elements are created only by the thermonuclear fusion reactions in stars, so they would not have been present before the first stars had formed.",
              "Astronomers use the term \u201cmetals\u201d for all these heavier elements.",
              "The young metal-rich stars in the Milky Way are called Population I stars, and the old metal-poor stars are called Population II stars;",
              "following this terminology, the stars with no metals at all\u2014the very first generation\u2014are sometimes called Population III stars.",
              "In the absence of metals, the physics of the first star-forming systems would have been much simpler than that of present-day molecular gas clouds.",
              "Furthermore, the cosmological models can provide, in principle, a complete description of the initial conditions that preceded the first generation of stars.",
              "In contrast, the stars that arise from molecular gas clouds are born in complex environments that have been altered by the effects of previous star formation.",
              "Therefore, scientists may find it easier to model the formation of the first stars than to model how stars form at present.",
              "In any case, the problem is an appealing one for theoretical study, and several research groups have used computer simulations to portray the formation of the earliest stars.",
              "A group consisting of Tom Abel, Greg Bryan and Michael L.",
              "Norman (now at Pennsylvania State University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California at San Diego, respectively) has made the most realistic simulations.",

              "Toru Tsuribe, now at Osaka University in Japan, has made similar calculations using more powerful computers.",
              "Fumitaka Nakamura and Masayuki Umemura (now at Niigata and Tsukuba universities in Japan, respectively) have worked with a more idealized simulation, but it has still yielded instructive results.",
              "Although these studies differ in various details, they have all produced similar descriptions of how the earliest stars might have been born.",
              "Let There Be Light!",
              "The simulations show that the primordial gas clouds would typically form at the nodes of a small-scale filamentary network and then begin to contract because of their gravity.",
              "Compression would heat the gas to temperatures above 1,000 kelvins.",
              "Some hydrogen atoms would pair up in the dense, hot gas, creating trace amounts of molecular hydrogen.",
              "The hydrogen molecules would then start to cool the densest parts of the gas by emitting infrared radiation after they collide with hydrogen atoms. The temperature in the densest parts would drop to about 200 to 300 kelvins, reducing the gas pressure in these regions and hence allowing them to contract into gravitationally bound clumps.",
              "This cooling plays an essential role in allowing the ordinary matter in the primordial system to separate from the dark matter.",
              "The cooling hydrogen settles into a flattened rotating configuration that is clumpy and filamentary and possibly shaped like a disk.",
              "But because the darkmatter particles would not emit radiation or lose energy, they would remain scattered in the primordial cloud.",
              "Thus, the star-forming system would come to resemble a miniature galaxy, with a disk of ordinary matter and a halo of dark matter.",
              "Inside the disk, the densest clumps of gas would continue to contract, and eventually some of them would undergo a runaway collapse and become stars.",
              "The first star-forming clumps were much warmer than the molecular gas clouds in which most stars currently form.",
              "Dust grains and molecules containing heavy elements cool the present-day clouds much more efficiently to temperatures of only about 10 kelvins.",
              "The minimum mass that a clump of gas must have to collapse under its gravity is called the Jeans mass, which is proportional to the square of the gas temperature and inversely proportional to the square root of the gas pressure.",
              "The first star-forming systems would have had pressures similar to those of present-day molecular clouds.",
              "But because the temperatures of the first collapsing gas clumps were almost 30 times higher than those of molecular clouds, their Jeans mass would have been almost 1,000 times larger.",
              "In molecular clouds in the nearby part of the Milky Way, the Jeans mass is roughly equal to the mass of the sun, and the masses of the prestellar clumps observed in these clouds are about the same.",
              "If we scale up by a factor of almost 1,000, we can estimate that the masses of the first star-forming clumps would have been about 500 to 1,000 solar masses.",
              "In agreement with this prediction, all the computer simulations mentioned above showed the formation of clumps with masses of several hundred solar masses or more.",
              "Our group\u2019s calculations suggest that the predicted masses of the first star-forming clumps are not very sensitive to the assumed cosmological conditions (for example, the exact nature of the initial density fluctuations).",
              "In fact, the predicted masses depend primarily on the physics of the hydrogen molecule and only secondarily on the cosmological model or simulation technique.",
              "One reason is that molecular hydrogen cannot cool the gas below 200 kelvins, making this a lower limit to the temperature of the first star-forming clumps.",
              "Another is that the cooling from molecular hydrogen becomes inefficient at the higher densities encountered when the clumps begin to collapse.",
              "At these densities the hydrogen molecules collide with other atoms before they have time to emit an infrared photon;",
              "this raises the gas temperature and slows down the contraction until the clumps have built up to at least a few hundred solar masses.",
              "What was the fate of the first collapsing clumps?",
              "Did they form stars with similarly large masses, or did they fragment into many smaller parts and form many smaller stars?",
              "The research groups have pushed their calculations to the point at which the clumps are well on their way to forming stars, and none of the simulations has yet revealed any tendency for the clumps to fragment.",
              "This agrees with our understanding of present-day star formation;",
              "observations and simulations show that the fragmentation of star-forming clumps is typically limited to the formation of binary systems (two stars orbiting around each other).",
              "Fragmentation seems even less likely to occur in the primordial clumps, because the inefficiency of molecular hydrogen cooling would keep the Jeans mass high.",
              "The simulations, however, have not yet determined the final outcome of collapse with certainty, and the formation of binary systems cannot be ruled out.",
              "Different groups have arrived at somewhat different estimates of just how massive the first stars might have been.",
              "Abel, Bryan and Norman have argued that the stars probably had masses no greater than 300 solar masses.",
              "Our own work suggests that masses as high as 1,000 solar masses might have been possible.",
              "Both predictions might be valid in different circumstances: the very first stars to form might have had masses no larger than 300 solar masses, whereas stars that formed a little later from the collapse of larger protogalaxies might have reached the higher estimate.",
              "Quantitative predictions are difficult because of feedback effects;",
              "as a massive star forms, it produces intense radiation and matter outflows that may blow away some of the gas in the collapsing clump.",
              "But these effects depend strongly on the presence of heavy elements in the gas, and therefore they should be less important for the earliest stars.",
              "Thus, it seems safe to conclude that the first stars in the universe were typically many times more massive and luminous than the sun.",
              "The Cosmic Renaissance What effects did these first stars have on the rest of the universe?",
              "An important property of stars with no metals is that they have higher surface temperatures than stars with compositions like that of the sun.",
              "The production of nuclear energy at the center of a star is less efficient without metals, and the star would have to be hotter and more compact to produce enough energy to counteract gravity.",
              "Because of the more compact structure, the surface layers of the star would also be hotter.",
              "In collaboration with Rolf-Peter Kudritzki of the University of Hawaii and Abraham Loeb of Harvard, one of us (Bromm) devised theoretical models of such stars with masses between 100 and 1,000 solar masses.",
              "The models showed that the stars had surface temperatures of about 100,000 kelvins\u2014about 17 times higher than the sun\u2019s surface temperature.",
              "Therefore, the first starlight in the universe would have been mainly ultraviolet radiation from very hot stars, and it would have begun to heat and ionize the neutral hydrogen and helium gas around these stars soon after they formed.",
              "We call this event the cosmic renaissance.",
              "Although astronomers cannot yet estimate how much of the gas in the universe condensed into the first stars, even a fraction as small as one part in 100,000 could have been enough for these stars to ionize much of the remaining gas.",
              "Once the first stars started shining, a growing bubble of ionized gas would have formed around each one.",
              "As more and more stars formed over hundreds of millions of years, the bubbles of ionized gas would have eventually merged, and the intergalactic gas would have become completely ionized.",
              "Scientists from the California Institute of Technology and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey have recently found evidence for the final stages of this ionization process.",
              "The researchers observed strong absorption of ultraviolet light in the spectra of quasars that date from about 900 million years after the big bang.",
              "The results suggest that the last patches of neutral hydrogen gas were being ionized at that time.",
              "Helium requires more energy to ionize than hydrogen does, but if the first stars were as massive as predicted, they would have ionized helium at the same time.",
              "On the other hand, if the first stars were not quite so massive, the helium must have been ionized later by energetic radiation from sources such as quasars.",
              "Future observations of distant objects may help determine when the universe\u2019s helium was ionized.",
              "If the first stars were indeed very massive, they would also have had relatively short lifetimes\u2014only a few million years.",
              "Some of the stars would have exploded as supernovae at the end of their lives, expelling the metals they produced by fusion reactions.",
              "Stars that are between 100 and 250 times as massive as the sun are predicted to blow up completely in energetic explosions, and some of the first stars most likely had masses in this range.",
              "Because metals are much more effective than hydrogen in cooling star-forming clouds and allowing them to collapse into stars, the production and dispersal of even a small amount could have had a major effect on star formation.",
              "Working in collaboration with Andrea Ferrara of the University of Florence in Italy, we have found that when the abundance of metals in star-forming clouds rises above one thousandth of the metal abundance in the sun, the metals rapidly cool the gas to the temperature of the cosmic background radiation.",
              "(This temperature declines as the universe expands, falling to 19 kelvins a billion years after the big bang and to 2.",
              "7 kelvins today.)",
              "This efficient cooling allows the formation of stars with smaller masses and may also considerably boost the overall rate at which stars are born.",
              "In fact, it is possible that the pace of star formation did not accelerate until after the first metals had been produced.",
              "In this case, the second-generation stars might have been the ones primarily responsible for lighting up the universe and bringing about the cosmic renaissance.",
              "At the start of this active period of star birth, the cosmic background temperature would have been higher than the temperature in present-day molecular clouds (10 kelvins).",
              "Until the temperature dropped to that level\u2014which happened about two billion years after the big bang\u2014the process of star formation may still have favored massive stars.",
              "As a result, large numbers of such stars may have formed during the early stages of galaxy building by successive mergers of protogalaxies.",
              "A similar phenomenon may occur in the modern universe when two galaxies collide and trigger a starburst\u2014a sudden increase in the rate of star formation.",
              "Such events are now fairly rare, but some evidence suggests that they may produce relatively large numbers of massive stars.",
              "Puzzling Evidence This hypothesis about early star formation might help explain some puzzling features of the present universe.",
              "One unsolved problem is that galaxies contain fewer metal-poor stars than would be expected if metals were produced at a rate proportional to the star formation rate.",
              "This discrepancy might be resolved if early star formation had produced relatively more massive stars;",
              "on dying, these stars would have dispersed large amounts of metals, which would have then been incorporated into most of the low-mass stars that we now see.",
              "Another puzzling feature is the high metal abundance of the hot x-ray-emitting intergalactic gas in clusters of galaxies.",
              "This observation could be accounted for most easily if there had been an early period of rapid formation of massive stars and a correspondingly high supernova rate that chemically enriched the intergalactic gas.",
              "The case for a high supernova rate at early times also dovetails with the recent evidence suggesting that most of the ordinary matter and metals in the universe lies in the diffuse intergalactic medium rather than in galaxies.",
              "To produce such a distribution of matter, galaxy formation must have been a spectacular process, involving intense bursts of massive star formation and barrages of supernovae that expelled most of the gas and metals out of the galaxies.",
              "Stars that are more than 250 times more massive than the sun do not explode at the end of their lives;",
              "instead they collapse into similarly massive black holes.",
              "Several of the computer simulations mentioned above predict that some of the first stars would have had masses this great.",
              "Because the first stars formed in the densest parts of the universe, any black holes resulting from their collapse would have become incorporated, via successive mergers, into systems of larger and larger size.",
              "It is possible that some of these black holes became concentrated in the inner part of large galaxies and seeded the growth of the supermassive black holes\u2014millions of times more massive than the sun\u2014that are now found in galactic nuclei.",
              "Furthermore, astronomers believe that the energy source for quasars is the gas whirling into the black holes at the centers of large galaxies.",
              "If smaller black holes had formed at the centers of some of the first protogalaxies, the accretion of matter into the holes might have generated \u201cmini quasars.",
              "\u201d Because these objects could have appeared soon after the first stars, they might have provided an additional source of light and ionizing radiation at early times.",
              "Thus, a coherent picture of the universe\u2019s early history is emerging, although certain parts remain speculative.",
              "The formation of the first stars and protogalaxies began a process of cosmic evolution.",
              "Much evidence suggests that the period of most intense star formation, galaxy building and quasar activity occurred a few billion years after the big bang and that all these phenomena have continued at declining rates as the universe has aged.",
              "Most of the cosmic structure building has now shifted to larger scales as galaxies assemble into clusters.",
              "In the coming years, researchers hope to learn more about the early stages of the story, when structures started developing on the smallest scales.",

              "Being distributed randomly, all kinds of scenarios are possible - things running away from each other, zooming past each other, bumping into each other, etc.",
              "It's a messy and random universe, and the order of expansion becomes apparent only on the largest scale.",
              "The galaxies don't really get \"off track\" - it's not impossible, but that kind of thing probably doesn't happen anymore (as space continues to expand).",
              "What actually happens is that galaxies form gravitationally bound clusters - within the cluster, the acceleration due to gravity is larger than the equivalent expansion of space between the galaxies, so rather than growing more distant, the galaxies in question actually get closer together over time.",
              "Eventually, this results in a collision and a merger.",
              "If the expansion remains roughly constant, there will come a point where we'll no longer be able to see any galaxies outside of our own cluster.",
              "But for those close enough, this has little effect - just like the expansion of space doesn't cause atoms, planets, solar systems or galaxies to get bigger.",
              "I'm not sure that anyone has answered the question asked.",
              "The root cause is indeed that gravitationally bound structures with freefall timescales that are much shorter than the age of the universe are not greatly affected by the general expansion of the universe (NB: Structures with freefall timescales longer than this are not going to be the source of many galaxy collisions).",
              "That is, locally, the expansion within such structures is negligible.",
              "However, that does not necessarily lead to collisions on a a timescale shorter than the age of the universe.",
              "The first reason for galaxy collisions is that galaxy clusters have a very large number density - that is, the spacing between galaxies is not vastly larger than the \"size\" of a galaxy, where here, \"size\" means the effective interaction cross-sectional radius.",
              "As a result of these high densities, the freefall dynamical timescales in rich clusters (and even smaller groups of galaxies) are of order billions of years and so there is plenty of time for the galaxies to interact.",
              "As a contrast, think about how you might construct a scale model of stars in the local neighbourhood and compare the sizes of stars with their separations.",
              "It would in fact be difficult to make such a scale model with any meaningfully sized stars.",
              "On the other hand, you can make a scale model of say the local group of galaxies because their separations are only $\\sim 10$ times their sizes.",
              "The second reason is that many galaxies contain gas and that gas can easily dissipate kinetic energy and also transfer angular momentum.",
              "Another factor is that massive clusters of galaxies contain intracluster gas that can also serve to dissipate kinetic energy.",
              "In a gravitationally bound system, then objects that are in orbit around each other or around a common centre of mass need ways in which kinetic energy and angular momentum can be lost in order for a collision to take place.",
              "Even without gas, the fact that galaxies exist in groups and clusters means that n-body interactions can serve to dissipate energy and angular momentum to make a collision happen.",
              "Galaxies don't get \"off track\" - to see how collisions happen, we need to go right back to galaxy formation early on.",

              "Space continues to expand, but at a much slower rate.",

              "Even though expansion left us with an incredibly uniform, homogenous universe, the density does sliiightly vary between places.",

              "As an aside, because it can't release radiation, it also can't jettison the energy that must be got rid of to allow dense objects to form.",
              "So it ends up quickly collapsing to a hazy diffuse \"halo\", but then can't collapse much more.",
              "And no surprise, it collapses in those places where the universe was fractionally denser.",
              "So you get what cosmologists call \"filaments\" and \"halos\" of dark matter, a bit like a sponge or a swiss cheese, with comparative \"voids\" separating them.",
              "Ordinary matter is more strongly attracted to these already-existing dark matter filaments and halos.",
              "It collapses towards them.",
              "The self-gravity of the ordinary matter is enhanced by the gravity due to the concentrations of dark matter there - and ordinary matter can lose energy by radiation, so it collapses more than dark matter does, to form the galaxies and their contents which we can see today.",
              "Gravity can do this, because the expansion of the universe has by now slowed down so much from its \"heyday\", that gravity can pull some of the matter together within space faster than the expansion can add space between them.",
              "Over cosmic distances, gravity is much much weaker, and expansion dominates, so clusters and superclusters still move apart, but within clusters, the galaxies and groups of galaxies are accelerated by gravity enough that they mostly stay in their groups and clusters, and move around or orbit within them.",
              "So we end up with a universe that, on a cosmic scale, we see expansion \"winning\" as gravity is weak, so we see superclusters moving apart.",
              "But within clusters and galaxy groups, we see gravity \"winning\" because it's stronger over smaller distances, so clusters and gravitationally bound entities like galaxies stay together.",
              "What this in turn means, is that galaxies and galaxy groups are bound by gravity more than they are separated by expansion.",
              "So they remain moving within their clusters and groups, despite universal expansion.",
              "And, occasionally, because motion of 3 or more separate bodies under gravity is chaotic (and clusters can contain billions or trillions of galaxies), entire galaxies will get ejected, or collide, or do whatever galaxies do.",
              "And that's how it happens.",
              "(Although you didn't ask, it's a natural question to wonder what happens next.",
              "We believe that the rate of expansion has slowly sped up.",
              "That means that in the far future (tens and hundreds of billions of years), that galaxies will have to be even closer together, for gravity to dominate expansion.",
              "So clusters that are stable now, might break apart in the far future.",
              "If expansion accelerates enough then even smaller bodies could ultimately break up, perhaps galaxies themselves, or even stars and atoms. But that's something nobody knows.)",

              "Hubble's law tells us that the farther away an object is, the faster it's being pulled away by the expansion.",

              "As it continued to cool, it would eventually reach the temperature where electrons combined with nuclei to form neutral atoms. Before this \"recombination\" occurred, the Universe would have been opaque because the free electrons would have caused light (photons) to scatter the way sunlight scatters from the water droplets in clouds.",
