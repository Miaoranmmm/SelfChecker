    "response": "The periodic table is a way of arranging the elements based on their properties and atomic structure. The inspiration behind the creation of the periodic table was to find a pattern that could explain the similarities and differences among the elements. The structure of the periodic table has evolved over time as new elements were discovered and new theories were developed.\n\nThe first person to publish a version of the periodic table that we would recognize today was **Dmitri Mendeleev**, a Russian chemist, in **1869**[^1^] [^4^]. He arranged the elements by their atomic weight and left gaps for elements that were not yet known. He also predicted some of the properties of these missing elements based on their position in the table[^5^].\n\nHowever, Mendeleev was not the only one who contributed to the development of the periodic table. Before him, several other chemists tried to classify the elements based on their properties, such as Antoine Lavoisier, Johann D\u00f6bereiner, Alexandre-Emile B\u00e9guyer de Chancourtois and John Newlands[^2^]. After him, many discoveries and innovations changed the way we understand the elements, such as radioactivity, isotopes, atomic number, electron shells, quantum mechanics, protons, neutrons and relativistic effects[^3^]. These discoveries led to the addition of new elements and groups to the periodic table, such as the inert gases, the actinides and the superheavy elements[^3^].\n\nThe periodic table is still evolving today as scientists search for new elements and explore their properties and interactions. The current version of the periodic table has **118** confirmed elements, with **7** periods and **18** groups[^3^].",

              "Throughout its long history, the periodic table has been disputed, altered and improved as science has progressed and as new elements have been discovered [see \u201cMaking New Elements,\u201d by Peter Armbruster and Fritz Peter Hessberger].",

              "Were it not for the simplification provided by this chart, students of chemistry would need to learn the properties of all 112 known elements.",
              "Fortunately, the periodic table allows chemists to function by mastering the properties of a handful of typical elements;",
              "all the others fall into so-called groups or families with similar chemical properties.",
              "(In the modern periodic table, a group or family corresponds to one vertical column.)",
              "The discovery of the periodic system for classifying the elements represents the culmination of a number of scientific developments, rather than a sudden brainstorm on the part of one individual.",
              "Yet historians typically consider one event as marking the formal birth of the modern periodic table: on February 17, 1869, a Russian professor of chemistry, Dimitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, completed the first of his numerous periodic charts.",
              "It included 63 known elements arranged according to increasing atomic weight;",
              "Mendeleev also left spaces for as yet undiscovered elements for which he predicted atomic weights.",
              "Prior to Mendeleev\u2019s discovery, however, other scientists had been actively developing some kind of organizing system to describe the elements.",
              "In 1787, for example, French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, working with Antoine Fourcroy, Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau and Claude-Louis Berthollet, devised a list of the 33 elements known at the time.",
              "Yet such lists are simply onedimensional representations.",
              "The power of the modern table lies in its two- or even three-dimensional display of all the known elements (and even the ones yet to be discovered) in a logical system of precisely ordered rows and columns.",
              "In an early attempt to organize the elements into a meaningful array, German chemist Johann Do\u0308bereiner pointed out in 1817 that many of the known elements could be arranged by their similarities into groups of three, which he called triads.",
              "Do\u0308bereiner singled out triads of the elements lithium, sodium and potassium as well as chlorine, bromine and iodine.",
              "He noticed that if the three members of a triad were ordered according to their atomic weights, the properties of the middle element fell in between those of the first and third elements.",
              "For example, lithium, sodium and potassium all react vigorously with water.",
              "But lithium, the lightest of the triad, reacts more mildly than the other two, whereas the heaviest of the three, potassium, explodes violently.",
              "In addition, Do\u0308bereiner showed that the atomic weight of the middle element is close to the average of the weights for the first and third members of the triad.",
              "Do\u0308bereiner\u2019s work encouraged others to search for correlations between the chemical properties of the elements and their atomic weights.",
              "One of those who pursued the triad approach further during the 19th century was Peter Kremers of Cologne, who suggested that certain elements could belong to two triads placed perpendicularly.",
              "Kremers thus broke new ground by comparing elements in two directions, a feature that later proved to be an essential aspect of Mendeleev\u2019s system.",
              "In 1857 French chemist Jean-Baptiste- Andre\u0301 Dumas turned away from the idea of triads and focused instead on devising a set of mathematical equations that could account for the increase in atomic weight among several groups of chemically similar elements.",
              "But as chemists now recognize, any attempt to establish an organizing pattern based on an element\u2019s atomic weight will not succeed, because atomic weight is not the fundamental property that characterizes each of the elements.",
              "Periodic Properties The crucial characteristic of Mendeleev\u2019s system was that it illustrated a periodicity, or repetition, in the properties of the elements at certain regular intervals.",
              "This feature had been observed previously in an arrangement of elements by atomic weight devised in 1862 by French geologist Alexandre- Emile Be\u0301guyer de Chancourtois.",
              "The system relied on a fairly intricate geometric configuration: de Chancourtois positioned the elements according to increasing atomic weight along a spiral inscribed on the surface of a cylinder and inclined at 45 degrees from the base.",
              "The first full turn of the spiral coincided with the element oxygen, and the second full turn occurred at sulfur.",
              "Elements that lined up vertically on the surface of the cylinder tended to have similar properties, so this arrangement succeeded in capturing some of the patterns that would later become central to Mendeleev\u2019s system.",
              "Yet for a number of reasons, de Chancourtois\u2019s system did not have much effect on scientists of the time: his original article failed to include a diagram of the table, the system was rather complicated, and the chemical similarities among elements were not displayed very convincingly.",
              "Several other researchers put forward their own versions of a periodic table during the 1860s.",
              "Using newly standardized values for atomic weights, English chemist John Newlands suggested in 1864 that when the elements were arranged in order of atomic weight, any one of the elements showed properties similar to those of the elements eight places ahead and eight places behind in the list\u2014a feature that Newlands called \u201cthe law of octaves.",
              "\u201d In his original table, Newlands left empty spaces for missing elements, but his more publicized version of 1866 did not include these open slots.",
              "Other chemists immediately raised objections to the table because it would not be able to accommodate any new elements that might be discovered.",
              "In fact, some investigators openly ridiculed Newlands\u2019s ideas.",
              "At a meeting of the Chemical Society in London in 1866, George Carey Foster of University College London asked Newlands whether he had considered ordering the elements alphabetically, because any kind of arrangement would present occasional coincidences.",
              "As a result of the meeting, the Chemical Society refused to publish Newlands\u2019s paper.",
              "Despite its poor reception, however, Newlands\u2019s work does represent the first time anyone used a sequence of ordinal numbers (in this case, one based on the sequence of atomic weights) to organize the elements.",
              "In this respect, Newlands anticipated the modern organization of the periodic table, which is based on the sequence of so-called atomic numbers.",
              "(The concept of atomic number, which indicates the number of protons present within an atom\u2019s nucleus, was not established until the early 20th century.)",
              "The Modern Periodic Table Chemist Julius Lothar Meyer of Breslau University in Germany, while in the process of revising his chemistry textbook in 1868, produced a periodic table that turned out to be remarkably similar to Mendeleev\u2019s famous 1869 version\u2014although Lothar Meyer failed to classify all the elements correctly.",
              "But the table did not appear in print until 1870 because of a publisher\u2019s delay\u2014a factor that contributed to an acrimonious dispute for priority that ensued between Lothar Meyer and Mendeleev.",
              "Around the same time, Mendeleev assembled his own periodic table while he, too, was writing a textbook of chemistry.",
              "Unlike his predecessors, Mendeleev had sufficient confidence in his periodic table to use it to predict several new elements and the properties of their compounds.",
              "He also corrected the atomic weights of some already known elements.",
              "Interestingly, Mendeleev admitted to having seen certain earlier tables, such as those of Newlands, but claimed to have been unaware of Lothar Meyer\u2019s work when developing his chart.",
              "Although the predictive aspect of Mendeleev\u2019s table was a major advance, it seems to have been overemphasized by historians, who have generally suggested that Mendeleev\u2019s table was accepted especially because of this feature.",
              "These scholars have failed to notice that the citation from the Royal Society of London that accompanied the Davy Medal (which Mendeleev received in 1882) makes no mention whatsoever of his predictions.",
              "Instead Mendeleev\u2019s ability to accommodate the already known elements may have contributed as much to the acceptance of the periodic system as did his striking predictions.",
              "Although numerous scientists helped to develop the periodic system, Mendeleev receives most of the credit for discovering chemical periodicity because he elevated the discovery to a law of nature and spent the rest of his life boldly examining its consequences and defending its validity.",
              "Defending the periodic table was no simple task\u2014its accuracy was frequently challenged by subsequent discoveries.",
              "One notable occasion arose in 1894, when William Ramsay of University College London and Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt) of the Royal Institution in London discovered the element argon;",
              "over the next few years, Ramsay announced the identification of four other elements\u2014helium, neon, krypton and xenon\u2014known as the noble gases.",
              "(The last of the known noble gases, radon, was discovered in 1900 by German physicist Friedrich Ernst Dorn.)",
              "The name \u201cnoble\u201d derives from the fact that all these gases seem to stand apart from the other elements, rarely interacting with them to form compounds.",
              "As a result, some chemists suggested that the noble gases did not even belong in the periodic table.",
              "These elements had not been predicted by Mendeleev or anyone else, and only after six years of intense effort could chemists and physicists successfully incorporate the noble gases into the table.",
              "In the new arrangement, an additional column was introduced between the halogens (the gaseous elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine and astatine) and the alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium and francium).",
              "A second point of contention surrounded the precise ordering of the elements.",
              "Mendeleev\u2019s original table positioned the elements according to atomic weight, but in 1913 Dutch amateur theoretical physicist Anton van den Broek suggested that the ordering principle for the periodic table lay instead in the nuclear charge of each atom.",
              "Physicist Henry Moseley, working at the University of Manchester, tested this hypothesis, also in 1913, shortly before his tragic death in World War I.",
              "Moseley began by photographing the x-ray spectrum of 12 elements, 10 of which occupied consecutive places in the periodic table.",
              "He discovered that the frequencies of features called K-lines in the spectrum of each element were directly proportional to the squares of the integers representing the position of each successive element in the table.",
              "As Moseley put it, here was proof that \u201cthere is in the atom a fundamental quantity, which increases by regular steps as we pass from one element to the next.",
              "\u201d This fundamental quantity, first referred to as atomic number in 1920 by Ernest Rutherford, who was then at the University of Cambridge, is now identified as the number of protons in the nucleus.",
              "Moseley\u2019s work provided a method that could be used to determine exactly how many empty spaces remained in the periodic table.",
              "After this discovery, chemists turned to using atomic number as the fundamental ordering principle for the periodic table, instead of atomic weight.",
              "This change resolved many of the lingering problems in the arrangement of the elements.",
              "For example, when iodine and tellurium were ordered according to atomic weight (with iodine first), the two elements appeared to be incorrectly positioned in terms of their chemical behavior.",
              "When ordered according to atomic number (with tellurium first), however, the two elements were in their correct positions.",
              "Understanding the Atom The periodic table inspired the work not only of chemists but also of atomic physicists struggling to understand the structure of the atom.",
              "In 1904, working at Cambridge, physicist J.",
              "J.",
              "Thomson (who also discovered the electron) developed a model of the atom, paying close attention to the periodicity of the elements.",
              "He proposed that the atoms of a particular element contained a specific number of electrons arranged in concentric rings.",
              "Furthermore, according to Thomson, elements with similar configurations of electrons would have similar properties;",
              "Thomson\u2019s work thus provided the first physical explanation for the periodicity of the elements.",
              "Although Thomson imagined the rings of electrons as lying inside the main body of the atom, rather than circulating around the nucleus as is believed today, his model does represent the first time anyone addressed the arrangement of electrons in the atom, a concept that pervades the whole of modern chemistry.",
              "Danish physicist Niels Bohr, the first to bring quantum theory to bear on the structure of the atom, was also motivated by the arrangement of the elements in the periodic system.",
              "In Bohr\u2019s model of the atom, developed in 1913, electrons inhabit a series of concentric shells that encircle the nucleus.",
              "Bohr reasoned that elements in the same group of the periodic table might have identical configurations of electrons in their outermost shell and that the chemical properties of an element would depend in large part on the arrangement of electrons in the outer shell of its atoms. Bohr\u2019s model of the atom also served to explain why the noble gases lack reactivity: noble gases possess full outer shells of electrons, making them unusually stable and unlikely to form compounds.",
              "Indeed, most other elements form compounds as a way to obtain full outer electron shells.",
              "More recent analysis of how Bohr arrived at these electronic configurations suggests that he functioned more like a chemist than has generally been credited.",
              "Bohr did not derive electron configurations from quantum theory but obtained them from the known chemical and spectroscopic properties of the elements.",
              "In 1924 another physicist, Austrianborn Wolfgang Pauli, set out to explain the length of each row, or period, in the table.",
              "As a result, he developed the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two electrons can exist in exactly the same quantum state, which is defined by what scientists call quantum numbers.",
              "The lengths of the various periods emerge from experimental evidence about the order of electron-shell filling and from the quantum-mechanical restrictions on the four quantum numbers that electrons can adopt.",
              "The modifications to quantum theory made by Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schro\u0308dinger in the mid-1920s yielded quantum mechanics in essentially the form used to this day.",
              "But the influence of these changes on the periodic table has been rather minimal.",
              "Despite the efforts of many physicists and chemists, quantum mechanics cannot explain the periodic table any further.",
              "For example, it cannot explain from first principles the order in which electrons fill the various electron shells.",
              "The electronic configurations of atoms, on which our modern understanding of the periodic table is based, cannot be derived using quantum mechanics (this is because the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics, the Schro\u0308dinger equation, cannot be solved exactly for atoms other than hydrogen).",
              "As a result, quantum mechanics can only reproduce Mendeleev\u2019s original discovery by the use of mathematical approximations\u2014it cannot predict the periodic system.",
              "Variations on a Theme In more recent times, researchers have proposed different approaches for displaying the periodic system.",
              "For instance, Fernando Dufour, a retired chemistry professor from Colle\u0300ge Ahuntsic in Montreal, has developed a three-dimensional periodic table, which displays the fundamental symmetry of the periodic law, unlike the common two-dimensional form of the table in common use.",
              "The same virtue is also seen in a version of the periodic table shaped as a pyramid, a form suggested on many occasions but most recently refined by William B.",
              "Jensen of the University of Cincinnati.",
              "Another departure has been the invention of periodic systems aimed at summarizing the properties of compounds rather than elements.",
              "In 1980 Ray Hefferlin of Southern Adventist University in Collegedale, Tenn.",
              ", devised a periodic system for all the conceivable diatomic molecules that could be formed between the first 118 elements (only 112 have been discovered to date).",
              "Hefferlin\u2019s chart reveals that certain properties of molecules\u2014the distance between atoms and the energy required to ionize the molecule, for instance\u2014occur in regular patterns.",
              "This table has enabled scientists to predict the properties of diatomic molecules successfully.",
              "In a similar effort, Jerry R.",
              "Dias of the University of Missouri at Kansas City devised a periodic classification of a type of organic molecule called benzenoid aromatic hydrocarbons.",
              "The compound naphthalene (C10H8), found in mothballs, is the simplest example.",
              "Dias\u2019s classification system is analogous to Do\u0308bereiner\u2019s triads of elements: any central molecule of a triad has a total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms that is the mean of the flanking entries, both downward and across the table.",
              "This scheme has been applied to a systematic study of the properties of benzenoid aromatic hydrocarbons and, with the use of graph theory, has led to predictions of the stability and reactivity of some of these compounds.",
              "Still, it is the periodic table of the elements that has had the widest and most enduring influence.",
              "After evolving for over 200 years through the work of many people, the periodic table remains at the heart of the study of chemistry.",
              "It ranks as one of the most fruitful ideas in modern science, comparable perhaps to Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution.",

              "His principal contribution to chemistry was the 'vis tellurique' (telluric screw), a three-dimensional arrangement of the elements constituting an early form of the periodic classification, published in 1862.",
              "The telluric screw plotted the atomic weights of the elements on the outside of a cylinder, so that one complete turn corresponded to an atomic weight increase of 16.",
              "As the diagram shows, this arrangement means that certain elements with similar properties appear in a vertical line.",
              "Although the telluric screw did not correctly display all the trends that were known at the time, de Chancourtois was the first to use a periodic arrangement of all of the known elements, showing that similar elements appear at periodic atom weights.",

              "Meyer's roots, however, were firmly in Germany.",
              "Meyer was just four years older than Mendeleev, and produced several Periodic Tables between 1864-1870.",
              "His first table contained just 28 elements, organised by their valency (how many other atoms they can combine with).",
              "These elements were almost entirely main group elements, but in 1868 he incorporated the transition metals in a much more developed table.",
              "This 1868 table listed the elements in order of atomic weight, with elements with the same valency arranged in vertical lines, strikingly similar to Mendeleev\u2019s table.",
              "Unfortunately for Meyer, his work wasn\u2019t published until 1870, a year after Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table had been published.",
              "Even after 1870, Meyer and Mendeleev were still unaware of each other\u2019s work, although Meyer later admitted that Mendeleev had published his version first.",
              "Meyer did contribute to the development of the periodic table in another way though.",
              "He was the first person to recognise the periodic trends in the properties of elements, and the graph shows the pattern he saw in the atomic volume of an element plotted against its atomic weight.",

              "As we have seen, Mendeleev was not the first to attempt to find order within the elements, but it is his attempt that was so successful that it now forms the basis of the modern periodic table.",

              "He wrote a textbook, Chemical Principles, because he couldn\u2019t find an adequate Russian book.",
              "Mendeleev discovered the periodic table (or Periodic System, as he called it) while attempting to organise the elements in February of 1869.",
              "He did so by writing the properties of the elements on pieces of card and arranging and rearranging them until he realised that, by putting them in order of increasing atomic weight, certain types of element regularly occurred.",
              "For example, a reactive non-metal was directly followed by a very reactive light metal and then a less reactive light metal.",
              "Initially, the table had similar elements in horizontal rows, but he soon changed them to fit in vertical columns, as we see today.",
              "Not only did Mendeleev arrange the elements in the correct way, but if an element appeared to be in the wrong place due to its atomic weight, he moved it to where it fitted with the pattern he had discovered.",
              "For example, iodine and tellurium should be the other way around, based on atomic weights, but Mendeleev saw that iodine was very similar to the rest of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine), and tellurium similar to the group 6 elements (oxygen, sulphur, selenium), so he swapped them over.",
              "The real genius of Mendeleev\u2019s achievement was to leave gaps for undiscovered elements.",
              "He even predicted the properties of five of these elements and their compounds.",

              "In these places he not only predicted there were as-yet-undiscovered elements, but he predicted their atomic weights and their characteristics.",
              "The discovery of new elements in the 1870s that fulfilled several of his predictions brought increased interest to the periodic system and it became not only an object of study but a tool for research.",

              "Mendeleev found that, when all the known chemical elements were arranged in order of increasing atomic weight, the resulting table displayed a recurring pattern, or periodicity, of properties within groups of elements.",
              "In his version of the periodic table of 1871, he left gaps in places where he believed unknown elements would find their place.",
              "He even predicted the likely properties of three of the potential elements.",
              "The subsequent proof of many of his predictions within his lifetime brought fame to Mendeleev as the founder of the periodic law.",
              "Mendeleev was born in the small Siberian town of Tobolsk as the last of 14 surviving children (or 13, depending on the source) of Ivan Pavlovich Mendeleev, a teacher at the local gymnasium, and Mariya Dmitriyevna Kornileva.",

              "Instead of working closely with the prominent chemists of the university, including Robert Bunsen, Emil Erlenmeyer, and August Kekule\u0301, he set up a laboratory in his own apartment.",
              "In September 1860 he attended the International Chemistry Congress in Karlsruhe, convened to discuss such crucial issues as atomic weights, chemical symbols, and chemical formulas.",
              "There he met and established contacts with many of Europe\u2019s leading chemists.",
              "In later years Mendeleev would especially remember a paper circulated by the Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro that clarified the notion of atomic weights.",

              "Within these two groups of dissimilar elements, he discovered similarities in the progression of atomic weights, and he wondered if other groups of elements exhibited similar properties.",
              "After studying the alkaline earths, Mendeleev established that the order of atomic weights could be used not only to arrange the elements within each group but also to arrange the groups themselves.",
              "Thus, in his effort to make sense of the extensive knowledge that already existed of the chemical and physical properties of the chemical elements and their compounds, Mendeleev discovered the periodic law.",
              "His newly formulated law was announced before the Russian Chemical Society in March 1869 with the statement \u201celements arranged according to the value of their atomic weights present a clear periodicity of properties.",

              "He had such faith in the validity of the periodic law that he proposed changes to the generally accepted values for the atomic weight of a few elements and predicted the locations within the table of unknown elements together with their properties.",
              "At first the periodic system did not raise interest among chemists.",
              "However, with the discovery of the predicted elements, notably gallium in 1875, scandium in 1879, and germanium in 1886, it began to win wide acceptance.",
              "Gradually the periodic law and table became the framework for a great part of chemical theory.",
              "By the time Mendeleev died in 1907, he enjoyed international recognition and had received distinctions and awards from many countries."

              "Footnote 5 In the absence of explanations, we must suppose that he proposed them simply because they corresponded with places in his table, marked by a blank (only eka-manganese is entered with its atomic weight in his 1871 table).",
              "For a prediction to be counted a success, it must fall on a higher analogue of the element on which it is based and have appropriate properties, but this partly depends on the structure of his table;",

              "All of these fell in the \u2018dead zone\u2019 where the lanthanides would have been;",
              "their RAM values correspond roughly to those of cerium, promethium, europium or gadolinium, thulium or ytterbium and lutecium, but they cannot be called predictions, except to the extent that Mendeleev surmised that the anomaly was \u2018due to the nature of the elements in question\u2019.",
              "In fact higher analogues were present, on the other side of the \u2018dead zone\u2019, but in his terms they would have been \u2018dvi\u2019 and not \u2018eka\u2019: those of molybdenum, niobium and cadmium were tungsten, tantalum and mercury respectively.",

              "It is ironic to think that if he had paid more attention to ordinary air he might have discovered argon and added the missing group to his periodic table.",
              "The gas work absorbed Mendeleev with diminishing intensity until he resigned in January 1881.",
              "For a few years he followed the chemical literature, and in 1875 he quickly seized on the discovery of gallium as vindicating his method, but in 1879 he had to be alerted by Per Cleve to the discovery of scandium.",
              "Footnote 7 In 1885 when germanium was discovered and there was speculation that it was eka-stibium, Mendeleev suggested eka-cadmium, and it was Viktor von Richter and Lothar Meyer who proposed that it was eka-silicon.",

              "Footnote 9 Failure to be elected to the Academy of Sciences in 1880 was followed by the scandal of his marriage with a young painter, Anna Popova, in January 1882, even before his divorce from his first wife had been finalised\u2014a weakness overlooked by the Czar, who remarked \u2018We admit that Mendeleev has two wives, but we have only one Mendeleev.",
              "\u2019 Undeterred, he started campaigning and writing on public education in Russia, the low quality of which he blamed for ignorance and superstition.",
              "He widened his concern with public affairs and began to write about reform of the economy and the organisation of the Empire.",
              "He also became quite a showman, and in 1887, in front of a large audience, he ascended in a balloon to observe an eclipse.",

              "He also added coronium as a noble gas lighter than hydrogen, and he marked blanks for six more elements between hydrogen and helium.",
              "In the text he presented purely theoretical calculations of the atomic weights of \u00e6ther and coronium, which was thought to explain a green emission line seen in the solar corona during the eclipse of 1869, eventually identified as due to a highly ionised form of iron and named \u2018coronium\u2019 by Gruenwald.",

              "Footnote 13 He also included spaces for two elements lighter than hydrogen and two elements between hydrogen and helium, but this just shows that such ideas were around at the time and were not an innovation of Mendeleev\u2019s.",
              "Werner deservedly won the 1913 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on the coordination compounds of transition metals.",
              "Mendeleev was nominated for the 1906 prize but, by 5 votes to 4, it was awarded to Henri Moissan for his invention of the electric furnace (1892) and his isolation of fluorine (1886).",

              "He did so by writing the properties of the elements on pieces of card and arranging and rearranging them until he realised that, by putting them in order of increasing atomic weight, certain types of element regularly occurred.",

              "Initially, the table had similar elements in horizontal rows, but he soon changed them to fit in vertical columns, as we see today.",
              "Not only did Mendeleev arrange the elements in the correct way, but if an element appeared to be in the wrong place due to its atomic weight, he moved it to where it fitted with the pattern he had discovered.",
              "For example, iodine and tellurium should be the other way around, based on atomic weights, but Mendeleev saw that iodine was very similar to the rest of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine), and tellurium similar to the group 6 elements (oxygen, sulphur, selenium), so he swapped them over.",

              "This year marks the 100th anniversary of the death of one of the most famous scientists of all time, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev (1834\u20131907).",
              "The periodic table that he introduced in 1869 was a monumental achievement\u2014a wonderful mnemonic and a tool that serves to organize the whole of chemistry.",
              "No longer were students of chemistry obliged to memorize the properties of all the known elements;",
              "hereafter they could learn the properties of at least one element from each column and could, in principle, make sound predictions about the other group members.",
              "Arguably, however, Mendeleev\u2019s greatest achievement was not the periodic table so much as the recognition of the periodic system on which it was based.",
              "Of the nearly 1,000 variations that have been published since, all are attempts to represent the fundamental rule that after certain but varying intervals the chemical elements show an approximate repetition in their properties.",
              "Mendeleev was hardly the first to arrive at a periodic system.",
              "The observation that certain types of elements prefer to combine with certain other types prompted early chemists to classify the elements in tables of chemical affinities.",
              "In 1817 the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Do\u0308bereiner noticed the existence of groupings of elements in threes, subsequently called triads.",
              "The elements in these groupings displayed an important numerical relationship to each other: the equivalent weight (an early substitute for atomic weight) of the middle element had the approximate mean of the values of the two flanking elements.",
              "Although Do\u0308bereiner worked with the rather crude approximations of atomic weight available at the time, he successfully identified four such groups: strontium, calcium, and barium;",
              "bromine, iodine, and chlorine;",
              "sodium, lithium, and potassium;",
              "and selenium, sulfur, and tellurium.",
              "His triads\u2014which would eventually appear on the periodic table in vertical columns\u2014represented the first step in fitting the elements into a system that would account for their chemical properties and reveal their physical relationships.",
              "By the 1860s a number of scientists had moved beyond the triad concept to produce some very respectable periodic systems. The French geologist Alexandre-E\u0301mile Be\u0301guyer de Chancourtois achieved the first true periodic system in 1862 by arranging the elements by atomic weight in a spiral line wrapped around a metal cylinder.",
              "Periodic relationships could be seen by moving vertically down the screw.",
              "In 1863 and 1864 two British chemists, John Newlands and William Olding (coincidentally, both born in the same London borough of Southwark), independently published periodic tables that used atomic weight to arrange the elements into groups with analogous properties.",
              "A more eccentric spiral periodic system was created by the Danish-born polymath Gustavus Hinrichs in 1864.",
              "Hinrichs was intrigued that atomic spectral frequencies, like planetary distances, show whole number ratios, and he concluded that atomic spectra must therefore be an indication of atomic size.",
              "The closest precursor to Mendeleev\u2019s table in both chronological and philosophical terms was developed by Julius Lothar Meyer, a German chemist, in 1864.",
              "Although Meyer stressed physical rather than chemical properties, his table bears remarkable similarity to the one that Mendeleev would develop five years later.",
              "For a number of reasons, Meyer\u2019s prominence in the history books never matched Mendeleev\u2019s.",
              "There was an untimely delay in the publication of his most elaborate periodic table, and, perhaps more importantly, Meyer\u2014unlike Mendeleev\u2014hesitated to make predictions about unknown elements.",
              "Notwithstanding these earlier scientists\u2019 contributions to the idea of periodicity, Mendeleev remains the undisputed champion of the periodic system in the literal sense of its defense, propagation, and elaboration.",
              "Mendeleev\u2019s version of the periodic table left the biggest impact on the scientific community, both at the time it was produced and thereafter.",
              "In the popular imagination the periodic system invariably and justifiably connects to his name, to the same extent that the theory of evolution connects to Darwin\u2019s name and the theory of relativity to Einstein\u2019s.",
              "But what really set Mendeleev\u2019s contribution apart?",
              "By organizing the elements as he did Mendeleev took a stand on the centuries-old question of the philosophical status of the elements.",
              "Unlike some of his contemporaries Mendeleev rejected the suggestion that the periodic system implied the existence of any form of primary matter of which all the elements were composed.",
              "He maintained that all elements were strictly individual, indestructible, and irreducible, yet he acknowledged the seeming challenge posed by chemical reactions.",
              "Consider the familiar example of sodium chloride: common white table salt does not seem to include either poisonous grey metallic sodium or poisonous green gaseous chlorine.",

              "Although the four elements were themselves unobservable, their relative proportions within a specific substance governed its properties.",
              "Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his contemporaries challenged this view in the 18th century with new concepts of simple substances.",
              "They created a list of 37 simple substances that could be isolated from the decomposition of compounds and could not be further decomposed by any known means.",
              "More than any of the other discoverers of the periodic system, Mendeleev was concerned with the philosophical status of the elements.",

              "Osnovy Khimii, first edition, Saint Petersburg, 1869), he wrote, \u201cIt is useful in this sense to make a clear distinction between the conception of an element as a separate homogenous substance and as a material but invisible part of a compound\u201d (p.",
              "23).",
              "For Mendeleev an element was an entity that was essentially unobservable but formed the inner essence of simple bodies.",

              "His periodic table classified abstract elements, not simple substances.",
              "Mendeleev\u2019s genius lay in recognizing that just as it was the element in the abstract sense that survived intact in the course of compound formation, so atomic weight was the only quantity that survived in measurable amounts.",
              "He therefore took the step of associating these two features: an element\u2014a \u2014basic substance\u2014was to be characterized by its atomic weight.",
              "In a sense an abstract element had acquired a single measurable attribute that would remain unchanged in all its chemical combinations.",
              "Here, then, was a profound justification for using atomic weight as the basis for the classification of the elements, unlike any of the precursors to the periodic system.",
              "Toward the end of Mendeleev\u2019s life a growing body of evidence began to challenge his conception of the nature of the elements.",
              "Several revolutionary discoveries in physics showed that atoms were, in fact, reducible, and that there was a sense in which all elements are composed of the same primary matter: protons, neutrons, and electrons.",
              "Most alarmingly, there was even evidence to suggest that certain elements could be transformed into others through radioactivity.",

              "Thomson identified electrons as the particles constituting cathode rays.",
              "By repeating his experiments with cathode rays produced by different elements, he concluded that the same particle was produced in every case, and that this particle was therefore a fundamental constituent of all matter.",
              "Shortly thereafter Henri Becquerel and the Curies began to explore the phenomenon of radioactivity.",
              "One of the most talented researchers attracted to the study of radioactivity was Ernest Rutherford, who suggested in 1902 that radioactive reactions had the power to transform certain elements into entirely different elements.",
              "While fully aware of the possible criticism that such a notion might bring, Rutherford and his colleague Frederick Soddy went so far as to describe this new phenomenon as chemical transmutation, thus evoking the age-old dream of the alchemists.",
              "As if the threat of transmutation were not enough, the discovery of isotopy nearly unraveled the entire periodic system.",
              "Scientists\u2019 failure to separate radioisotopes by chemical means threatened both the traditional notion of the elements and the utility of atomic weight as an elemental characteristic.",
              "Reflecting on this sad situation in the Annual Report to the London Chemical Society in 1911, Soddy wrote, \u201cChemical homogeneity is no longer a guarantee that any supposed element is not a mixture of several different atomic weights, or that any atomic weight is not merely a mean number.",
              "The constancy of atomic weight, whatever the source of the material, is not a complete proof of homogeneity.",
              "\u201d This situation was clarified somewhat when Soddy and Kasimir Fajans, a Polish-born chemist, independently suggested what became known as the group displacement laws in 1913.",
              "Each found that the emission of an alpha particle from an element produces an element located two places to the left on the periodic table, while the emission of a beta particle resulted in a movement one position to the right.",
              "For example if an atom of uranium-235 undergoes alpha decay, it forms an atom of thorium-231;",
              "meanwhile, an atom of actinium-230 can undergo a beta decay to form an atom of thorium-230.",
              "Today we would recognize both products as atoms of the same elements with different atomic weights, but at the time the matter of elemental identity had not yet been settled.",
              "By the 1920s the periodic system was in crisis.",
              "Many new isotopes had been discovered over a short period of time so that the number of \u201catoms,\u201d or fundamental units, suddenly seemed to have multiplied.",
              "At this point some chemists, including Fajans, called for abandoning Mendeleev\u2019s periodic system in favor of a more complicated table of isotopes.",
              "A way out appeared in the form of atomic numbers assigned by nuclear charge.",
              "The Austrian chemist Fritz Paneth championed the atomic number\u2014instead of atomic weight\u2014as the primary characteristic of the elements.",
              "Paneth, along with Hungarian chemist Gyo\u0308rgy Hevesy, showed that the chemical properties of isotopes of the same element were, for all intents and purposes, identical.",
              "Chemists could therefore regard the isotopes of any element as being the same simple substance, even though individual atoms might appear in different isotopic forms. If the discovery of isotopes threatened to undermine the periodic system, the discovery of the electron explained many of the periodic properties on which the table was based.",

              "Thomson attempted to explain the periodic system by postulating rings of electrons embedded in the positive charge that comprised his plum pudding model of the atom.",
              "Thomson\u2019s model was quickly superseded by more sophisticated and elaborate models of atomic structure.",
              "However, the origin of our current conception of electronic configurations\u2014an explanatory paradigm in much of chemistry\u2014can be traced to his ideas.",
              "Because of Thompson we know that the key to an atom\u2019s properties lies in the number of outer-shell electrons, and that in turn can be deduced\u2014with some exceptions\u2014from an element\u2019s position on the periodic table.",
              "The origin of electronic configuration is frequently and inaccurately attributed to Niels Bohr, who introduced quantum theory to the study of the atom.",
              "But Bohr essentially tidied up Thomson\u2019s pre-quantum configurations and took advantage of a more accurate knowledge of the number of electrons each of the elements actually possessed.",
              "Further developments in quantum theory, including Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle and Schro\u0308dinger\u2019s equation, led to a more rigorous theoretical explanation of the form of the periodic system.",

              "Like Thomson\u2019s discovery of the electron, the discovery of radioactivity in uranium by French physicist Henri Becquerel in 1896 forced scientists to radically change their ideas about atomic structure.",
              "Radioactivity demonstrated that the atom was neither indivisible nor immutable.",
              "Instead of serving merely as an inert matrix for electrons, the atom could change form and emit an enormous amount of energy.",
              "Furthermore, radioactivity itself became an important tool for revealing the interior of the atom.",
              "German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Ro\u0308ntgen had discovered X-rays in 1895, and Becquerel thought they might be related to fluorescence and phosphorescence, processes in which substances absorb and emit energy as light.",
              "In the course of his investigations, Becquerel stored some photographic plates and uranium salts in a desk drawer.",
              "Expecting to find the plates only lightly fogged, he developed them and was surprised to find sharp images of the salts.",
              "He then began experiments that showed that uranium salts emit a penetrating radiation independent of external influences.",
              "Becquerel also demonstrated that the radiation could discharge electrified bodies.",
              "In this case discharge means the removal of electric charge, and it is now understood that the radiation, by ionizing molecules of air, allows the air to conduct an electric current.",
              "Early studies of radioactivity relied on measuring ionization power or on observing the effects of radiation on photographic plates.",
              "In 1898 French physicists Pierre and Marie Curie discovered the strongly radioactive elements polonium and radium, which occur naturally in uranium minerals.",
              "Marie coined the term radioactivity for the spontaneous emission of ionizing, penetrating rays by certain atoms. Experiments conducted by British physicist Ernest Rutherford in 1899 showed that radioactive substances emit more than one kind of radiation.",
              "It was determined that part of the radiation is 100 times more penetrating than the rest and can pass through aluminum foil one-fiftieth of a millimetre thick.",
              "Rutherford named the less-penetrating emanations alpha rays and the more-powerful ones beta rays, after the first two letters of the Greek alphabet.",
              "Investigators who in 1899 found that beta rays were deflected by a magnetic field concluded that they are negatively charged particles similar to cathode rays.",
              "In 1903 Rutherford found that alpha rays were deflected slightly in the opposite direction, showing that they are massive, positively charged particles.",
              "Much later Rutherford proved that alpha rays are nuclei of helium atoms by collecting the rays in an evacuated tube and detecting the buildup of helium gas over several days.",
              "A third kind of radiation was identified by French chemist Paul Villard in 1900.",
              "Designated as the gamma ray, it is not deflected by magnets and is much more penetrating than alpha particles.",
              "Gamma rays were later shown to be a form of electromagnetic radiation, similar to light or X-rays, but with much shorter wavelengths.",
              "Because of these shorter wavelengths, gamma rays have higher frequencies and are even more penetrating than X-rays.",
              "In 1902, while studying the radioactivity of thorium, Rutherford and English chemist Frederick Soddy discovered that radioactivity was associated with changes inside the atom that transformed thorium into a different element.",
              "They found that thorium continually generates a chemically different substance that is intensely radioactive.",
              "The radioactivity eventually makes the new element disappear.",
              "Watching the process, Rutherford and Soddy formulated the exponential decay law (see decay constant), which states that a fixed fraction of the element will decay in each unit of time.",
              "For example, half of the thorium product decays in four days, half the remaining sample in the next four days, and so on.",
              "Until the 20th century, physicists had studied subjects, such as mechanics, heat, and electromagnetism, that they could understand by applying common sense or by extrapolating from everyday experiences.",
              "The discoveries of the electron and radioactivity, however, showed that classical Newtonian mechanics could not explain phenomena at atomic and subatomic levels.",
              "As the primacy of classical mechanics crumbled during the early 20th century, quantum mechanics was developed to replace it.",
              "Since then experiments and theories have led physicists into a world that is often extremely abstract and seemingly contradictory.",

              "Thomson\u2019s discovery of the negatively charged electron had raised theoretical problems for physicists as early as 1897, because atoms as a whole are electrically neutral.",
              "Where was the neutralizing positive charge and what held it in place?",
              "Between 1903 and 1907 Thomson tried to solve the mystery by adapting an atomic model that had been first proposed by Scottish scientist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1902.",
              "According to the Thomson atomic model, often referred to as the \u201cplum-pudding\u201d model, the atom is a sphere of uniformly distributed positive charge about one angstrom in diameter.",
              "Electrons are embedded in a regular pattern, like raisins in a plum pudding, to neutralize the positive charge.",
              "The advantage of the Thomson atom was that it was inherently stable: if the electrons were displaced, they would attempt to return to their original positions.",
              "In another contemporary model, the atom resembled the solar system or the planet Saturn, with rings of electrons surrounding a concentrated positive charge.",
              "Japanese physicist Nagaoka Hantaro in particular developed the \u201cSaturnian\u201d system in 1904.",
              "The atom, as postulated in this model, was inherently unstable because, by radiating continuously, the electron would gradually lose energy and spiral into the nucleus.",
              "No electron could thus remain in any particular orbit indefinitely."

              "Kekule, Wurtz, and German chemist Carl Weltzien were organizers of the first international chemical conference, held at Karlsruhe in southwestern Germany in September 1860, which was intended to gain unity and understanding across the European chemical community.",

              "The reformers\u2019 success was incomplete, but the Karlsruhe Congress can stand as an appropriate symbol of the era when chemistry attained a recognizably modern appearance.",
              "The widespread adoption of a single reformed set of atomic weights for the 60-odd known elements appears to have prompted renewed speculation on the relationships of the elements to each other, and various proposals for systems of classification were developed in the 1860s.",
              "By far the most successful of these systems was that of the Russian chemist Dmitry Mendeleev.",
              "In 1869 he announced that when the elements were arranged horizontally according to increasing atomic weight, and a new horizontal row was begun below the first whenever similar properties in the elements reappear, then the resulting semi-rectangular table revealed consistent periodicities.",
              "The vertical columns of similar elements were called groups or families, and the entire array was called the periodic table of the elements.",
              "Mendeleev demonstrated that this manner of looking at the elements was more than mere chance when he was able to use his periodic law to predict the existence of three new elements, later named gallium, scandium, and germanium, which were discovered in the 1870s and \u201980s.",

              "Structuralist ideas from organic chemistry, as well as the development of the periodic table, gave new impetus to the study of inorganic compounds in the late 19th century.",
              "The leading chemical field in the second half of the century, however, was clearly organic chemistry, and the leading country was Germany.",
              "It was the Germans who exploited the structure theory most aggressively, and their success was measured by the explosive growth of university institutes as well as by practical applications developed in commercial enterprises.",
              "Organic chemists such as August Wilhelm von Hofmann and Emil Fischer at the University of Berlin and Adolf von Baeyer at the University of Munich developed large research groups that turned out novel compounds, research publications, and doctoral dissertations by the score.",
              "By the late 19th century, German chemistry, both academic and industrial, dominated Europe and the world.",
              "This is not to say that other approaches to chemistry were neglected, nor that other countries failed to participate in the excitement.",

              "Michael Faraday in England, Hermann Kopp and Robert Bunsen in Germany, and Henri-Victor Regnault in France carried out investigations on the physical characteristics of substances in the period 1830\u201360.",

Soon after the turn of the century, two chemists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who had studied with Ostwald, Arthur Noyes and Gilbert Lewis, formed the nucleus of a rising American chemical community.",

              "Lewis suggested that a chemical bond consisted of a pair of electrons that was shared between the combining atoms. By equal sharing of electrons (forming what the American physical chemist Irving Langmuir was soon to call a covalent bond), each atom could complete its outer electron shell and thus achieve stability.",

              "An alternative quantum mechanical method of understanding chemical bonding, called the molecular orbital method, was developed by the American chemist Robert Mulliken and the German physicist Friedrich Hund.",
              "Although mathematically more complex, this approach has largely replaced Pauling\u2019s.",
              "In any case, ever since Lewis and Bohr, it has been understood that all chemical reactions and all chemical bonding involves the outer electron shells\u2014the valence electrons\u2014of participating atoms. Organic chemists also incorporated electronic ideas into their theories.",

          "He had tabulated the elements in order of their atomic weight, forming the basis for a fascinating chart that revealed patterns amongst the primary building blocks of matter.",
          "Later that decade, Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, organized all the known elements according to similar properties.",
          "Because certain properties of the elements repeat on a regular basis throughout the table (that is, they are periodic), it became known as the periodic table."

          "Throughout its long history, the periodic table has been disputed, altered and improved as science has progressed and as new elements have been discovered [see \u201cMaking New Elements,\u201d by Peter Armbruster and Fritz Peter Hessberger].",
          "The discovery of the periodic system for classifying the elements represents the culmination of a number of scientific developments, rather than a sudden brainstorm on the part of one individual.",
          "Yet historians typically consider one event as marking the formal birth of the modern periodic table: on February 17, 1869, a Russian professor of chemistry, Dimitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, completed the first of his numerous periodic charts.",
          "Mendeleev also left spaces for as yet undiscovered elements for which he predicted atomic weights.",
          "Prior to Mendeleev\u2019s discovery, however, other scientists had been actively developing some kind of organizing system to describe the elements.",
          "His principal contribution to chemistry was the 'vis tellurique' (telluric screw), a three-dimensional arrangement of the elements constituting an early form of the periodic classification, published in 1862.",

          "In March 1869, Mendeleev delivered a full paper to the Russian Chemical Society spelling out the most significant aspect of his system, that characteristics of the elements recur at a periodic interval as a function of their atomic weight.",
          "This was the first iteration of the periodic law.",
          "In 1869, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev arranged 63 elements by increasing atomic weight in several columns, noting recurring chemical properties across them.",

          "He discovered that when he placed them in order of increasing atomic mass, certain similarities in chemical behavior repeated at regular intervals.",
          "Mendeleev believed that elements with atomic masses of 68 and 70 would eventually be discovered and that they would fit chemically into each of those spaces.",
          "In his version of the periodic table of 1871, he left gaps in places where he believed unknown elements would find their place.",
          "He even predicted the likely properties of three of the potential elements.",

          "Although the telluric screw did not correctly display all the trends that were known at the time, de Chancourtois was the first to use a periodic arrangement of all of the known elements, showing that similar elements appear at periodic atom weights."

          "Several revolutionary discoveries in physics showed that atoms were, in fact, reducible, and that there was a sense in which all elements are composed of the same primary matter: protons, neutrons, and electrons.",
          "Most alarmingly, there was even evidence to suggest that certain elements could be transformed into others through radioactivity.",
          "Like Thomson\u2019s discovery of the electron, the discovery of radioactivity in uranium by French physicist Henri Becquerel in 1896 forced scientists to radically change their ideas about atomic structure.",
