    "response": "That's a great question. The concept of zero has a long and fascinating history. According to Scientific American[^1^], the first recorded zero appeared in **Mesopotamia around 3 B.C.** The Mayans invented it independently circa **4 A.D.** It was later devised in India in the mid-fifth century, spread to Cambodia near the end of the seventh century, and into China and the Islamic countries at the end of the eighth.\n\nZero was not widely accepted in Europe until the 12th century, when it was introduced by Italian mathematician Fibonacci. Zero is now an essential part of mathematics, representing both a number and a symbol for nothingness.",

              "Zero\u2019s origins most likely date back to the \u201cfertile crescent\u201d of ancient Mesopotamia.",
              "Sumerian scribes used spaces to denote absences in number columns as early as 4,000 years ago, but the first recorded use of a zero-like symbol dates to sometime around the third century B.",
              "C.",
              "in ancient Babylon.",
              "The Babylonians employed a number system based around values of 60, and they developed a specific sign\u2014two small wedges\u2014to differentiate between magnitudes in the same way that modern decimal-based systems use zeros to distinguish between tenths, hundreds and thousandths.",
              "A similar type of symbol cropped up independently in the Americas sometime around A.",
              "D.",
              "350, when the Mayans began using a zero marker in their calendars.",
              "These early counting systems only saw the zero as a placeholder\u2014not a number with its own unique value or properties.",
              "A full grasp of zero\u2019s importance would not arrive until the seventh century A.",
              "D.",
              "in India.",
              "There, the mathematician Brahmagupta and others used small dots under numbers to show a zero placeholder, but they also viewed the zero as having a null value, called \u201csunya.",
              "\u201d Brahmagupta was also the first to show that subtracting a number from itself results in zero.",
              "From India, the zero made its way to China and back to the Middle East, where it was taken up by the mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi around 773.",
              "He studied and synthesized Indian arithmetic and showed how zero functioned in the system of formulas he called \u2018al-jabr\u2019\u2014today known as algebra.",
              "By the 10th century, the zero had entered the Arabic numeral system in a form resembling the oval shape we use today.",
              "The zero continued to migrate for another few centuries before finally reaching Europe sometime around the 1100s.",
              "Thinkers like the Italian mathematician Fibonacci helped introduce zero to the mainstream, and it later figured prominently in the work of Rene Descartes along with Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz\u2019s invention of calculus.",
              "Since then, the concept of \u201cnothing\u201d has continued to play a role in the development of everything from physics and economics to engineering and computing.",

              "In similar experiments, researchers have shown that monkeys can recognize the empty set (and are often better at it than 4-year-old humans).",
              "But the fact that bees can do it is kind of amazing, considering how far they are away from us on the evolutionary trees of life.",
