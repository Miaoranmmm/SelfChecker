    "response": "The character of Black Panther in the Marvel comics and movie was inspired by various historical and mythological sources from Africa and beyond. According to one article[^1^], the Marvel universe drew heavily from ancient African mythologies to create new ones in Wakanda, such as the Panther cult that worships Bast, derived from the Egyptian cat goddess[^1^]. Another article[^2^] states that observers have drawn real-world parallels between Wakanda and Ethiopia, which was never officially colonized. Some have also looked to the Monomutapa civilization of Great Zimbabwe as the inspiration for the Black Panther story[^4^]. The character also has some connections to the Black Panther Party, a revolutionary political organization that emerged in 1966, the same year that T'Challa debuted in Marvel comics[^6^]. However, Marvel briefly changed the Black Panther's name to the Black Leopard in an attempt to dissociate the two[^3^].",

              "Jump to The core Pantheon of Wakanda is known as the Orisha, which refers in real life to spirits that play a key role in the Yoruba religion of West Africa and several diasporic religions.",
              "The Orisha is comprised of five gods based on ancient Egyptian and other African deities.",
              "Both Africana religions and Afro-speculative fiction, like \"Black Panther,\" explore \"what it is to be Black and human\" and their possibilities, according to Torin Alexander, professor of Africana religion at Winston-Salem State University.",
              "Religion and fiction's imaginations of what is possible for Africana people have fostered \"their flourishing, their perserverance, and resilience in an anti-Black world,\" Alexander said.",
              "Bast, the panther goddess, is one of the most prominent of the Orisha in the MCU.",
              "She is based on Bastet, the fierce feline goddess of ancient Egyptian religion.",
              "Bastet was the protector of Lower Egypt, defending the king and the sun god Ra.",
              "Though she was originally depicted as a lioness in the third millennium BCE, she later took on the form of a cat.",
              "Cats were highly regarded in ancient Egypt, as they protected crops and slowed the spread of disease by killing vermin.",
              "In Wakandan lore, Bast is represented as a panther goddess.",
              "T'Challa's ancestor Bashenga formed a religious order, the Panther cult, to guard a giant mound created by a vibranium meteor.",
              "The meteor had created demon spirits, and the Panthers fought to keep them from spreading across the kingdom.",
