    "query": "What is the most unique cultural perspective on time and how does it differ from the Western concept of time?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. Different cultures have different ways of understanding and expressing time, and some of them are quite different from the Western concept of time. One example is the **Yupno people** of Papua New Guinea, who use **spatial metaphors** to think about time. They gesture **uphill** when they talk about the future, and **downhill** when they talk about the past, regardless of which direction they are facing[^1^]. Another example is the **Aymara people** of South America, who reverse the common spatial mapping of time. They gesture **behind them** when they talk about the future, and **in front of them** when they talk about the past. They think of the future as something unknown and invisible, and the past as something visible and known[^1^]. A third example is the **Madagascar people**, who think of time as flowing into their heads from behind, and out of their chests into the future. They use expressions like \"the day that pushes me\" to refer to tomorrow, and \"the day that I push\" to refer to yesterday[^2^].\n\nThese examples show that time is not a universal concept, but a cultural one that depends on language, environment, and cognition. The Western concept of time is based on a **linear** and **monochronic** view, where time is seen as a straight line that can be divided into segments, and where people prefer to do one thing at a time in a fixed schedule[^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. However, other cultures may have a more **cyclical** or **polychronic** view of time, where time is seen as a circle or a spiral that repeats itself, and where people are more flexible and multitask in their activities[^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. These different perspectives on time can affect how people communicate, cooperate, and negotiate with each other across cultures[^5^].",

              "The Yupno conception of time is not anchored to the body, as the Western one is, but to the world and its contours.",
              "By investigating cases such as these, we and other researchers are starting to piece together an answer to a question that has puzzled thinkers for centuries: How are human beings able to make sense of time?",
              "Humans, like creatures ranging from amoebas and bees to mockingbirds and elephants, come with built-in equipment for perceiving some aspects of time, such as the rhythms of night and day, the waxing and waning of the moon, and the turning of the seasons.",
              "What separates humans from other animals is that we do not stop at merely sensing time's passage.",
              "We tackle time head-on\u2014or at least we try.",
              "We dice it into units, even ones that go beyond what is perceivable, such as milliseconds, or that transcend our life span, such as millennia.",
              "We depict time graphically, talk about it ceaselessly and even make gestural models of it in the air as we talk.",
              "In short, humans everywhere create and rely on time concepts\u2014ideas about the nature of time that allow us to make plans, follow recipes, share memories and discuss possible futures.",

              "What is going on in the mind of a speaker of Yupno, or English for that matter, when answering our question about the difference between yesterday and tomorrow?",
              "Recent research in cognitive science is uncovering a surprising answer.",
              "Across cultures, human time concepts depend, in large part, on metaphor\u2014in particular, on what cognitive scientists call conceptual metaphor, in which we think about something, in this case time, in terms of something else, in this case space.",
              "Thus, we build our understanding of duration, of time's passage and of sequences of events out of familiar spatial ideas such as size, movement and location.",
              "The latest findings reveal that this basic \u201ctime is like space\u201d metaphor appears to be universal around the world\u2014yet it also takes strikingly different forms from one culture to the next.",

              "Only in the past century have researchers started to study human time concepts with an empirical eye, and they started by looking closely at the language people use to talk about time.",
              "Benjamin Lee Whorf, famous for his idea that the language you speak guides the way you think, keenly observed in the early 20th century that speakers of English and many other European languages talk of time as \u201cmotion on a space\u201d and imagine time units as standing \u201cin a row.",
              "\u201d Whorf also claimed that the Hopi, a Native American tribe, conceived of time in their language without such spatial metaphors.",
              "Later researchers showed that spatial metaphors for time are actually rampant in Hopi, just as they are in English.",
              "More remarkably, it turns out that all human cultures seem to treat time through spatial metaphors (although these metaphors are more or less pronounced across languages).",
              "Durations are talked about using words for size (\u201ca short weekend\u201d).",
              "Time's passage is treated as movement (\u201cthe week flew by\u201d).",
              "Events are imagined as located at different positions on a path, in two different ways\u2014by taking an internal perspective or an external one [see illustration below].",
              "We sometimes imagine ourselves inside the sequence of events, with past, present and future conceptualized as locations where we once were, currently are and will be.",
              "This internal perspective on time motivates English expressions such as \u201cthe week ahead of us.",
              "\u201d When we take the external perspective, however, we view the succession of events from the outside, much like watching a lineup of people all moving in one direction.",
              "This external perspective motivates phrases such as \u201ca reception follows the ceremony.",
              "\u201d These basic ideas about time are expressed spatially in a dazzling variety of unrelated languages, across cultures that differ in every way imaginable.",
              "The idea that temporal sequences are like queues of people is found, for example, in Tamil (India), Maori (New Zealand), Greenlandic (Greenland) and Sesotho (South Africa), where the idea that \u201cspring follows winter\u201d can be expressed as \u201cspring is in the footprints left by winter.",
              "\u201d But now we come to a wrinkle.",
              "Even as people of all cultures lean on spatial concepts for understanding time, exactly which spatial metaphors they use can vary.",
              "Take the internal perspective, future-in-front metaphor mentioned earlier, found in English and many other languages.",
              "This metaphor was long thought to be universal, but in 2006 members of our team investigated a striking counterexample in South America.",
              "In Aymara, a language spoken high in the Andes, many phrases suggest the opposite metaphor is at work.",

              "The first is that, as mentioned, other communities have now been documented that use the same mapping, and no communities, to our knowledge, have yet been shown to use the opposite, future-downhill mapping.",
              "There are three other cases of future-uphill construals reported in the same region of Papua New Guinea (Pennington, Reference Pennington2016;",

              "A second reason for doubt is that the ancestral origins explanation privileges a particular sense of downhill: the macroscale inclination of the valley, from the source of the Yupno river down toward the sea.",

              "On a day like this, in terms of pure elevation gain and loss, one will go uphill exactly as much as one went downhill.",

              "and that it fits the gestures we observed.",
              "However, this account depends on a number of unknowns \u2013 in particular, whether walking uphill really is the canonical form of walking in Yupno.",
              "More fundamentally, the very notion of \u2018canonical\u2019 forms of experience and how they shape construals requires further theoretical elaboration.",

              "The \u2018looking downhill\u2019 and \u2018canonical travel\u2019 explanations are general, compatible with gestures we observed, and relevant to the Yupno case.",
              "Of the two, the \u2018canonical travel\u2019 explanation seems the more intuitive, due to its affinity with the cross-culturally widespread future-in-front construal.",

              "The man and woman belong to an Amerindian group called the Aymara, who inhabit some of the highest valleys in the Andes - in their case, in northern Chile.",

              "Nu\u0301n\u0303ez now believes that he has definitive evidence that the Aymara have a sense of the passage of time that is the mirror image of his own: the past is in front of them, the future behind.",
              "With his collaborator, linguist Eve Sweetser, he will publish his findings later this year, but they have already prompted speculation as to whether other peoples might conceive of time like the Aymara.",
              "George Lakoff, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, thinks that it is a strong possibility.",
              "The clues lie in language, and as he points out, \"There are 6,000 languages and most of them have never been written down.\"",
              "More fundamentally, Nu\u0301n\u0303ez and Sweetser's work highlights the illusory nature of time.",
              "Time, as Einstein showed, is a tricky concept to nail down, and all languages resort to metaphor to express it.",
              "In fact, with staggering monotony, they all resort to the same metaphor: space.",
              "If an English speaker says: \"We are approaching the deadline,\" he or she is expressing imminence in terms of nearness, a property of physical space.",
              "Anyone listening will understand exactly what he or she means, even though the deadline is not an entity that exists in the physical world.",
              "Nu\u0301n\u0303ez says: \"There is no ultimate truth that you could discover that is outside that metaphor.\"",
              "So if temporal landmarks don't exist except in our heads, where does our notion of time come from?",
              "And why do we feel so strongly a sense of time as motion?",
              "In all Indo-European languages including English, but also in languages as diverse as Hebrew, Polynesian, Japanese and Bantu, speakers face the future.",
              "Time flows from a point in front of them, through their current position - the present - and back to the past.",
              "The Aymara also feel time as motion, but for them, speakers face the past and have their backs to the future.",
              "The Aymara word for past is transcribed as nayra , which literally means eye, sight or front.",
              "The word for future is q\"ipa , which translates as behind or the back.",
              "The Jesuits undoubtedly noticed this oddity in the 16th century, when they ventured up into the mountains to spread the word.",
              "More recently, linguistic anthropologists have puzzled over what it means.",
              "In 1975, Andrew Miracle and Juan de Dios Yapita Moya, both at the University of Florida, observed that q\"ipu\u0308ru , the Aymara word for tomorrow, combines q\"ipa and uru , the word for day, to produce a literal meaning of \"some day behind one's back\".",
              "Over the years, rumours have surfaced of similar strangeness in other languages.",
              "Maori speakers use front-type words to signify events that happened earlier, Agathe Thornton, an expert in the Maori oral tradition reported in the 1980s.",
              "Malagasy, too, uses \"in front of\" to mean \"earlier than\".",
              "It began to look as if the Aymara weren't alone in spinning time's arrow - until in 1980, Lakoff and Mark Johnson, a philosopher at the University of Oregon, warned against jumping to that conclusion.",
              "Lakoff and Johnson realised that not only could different languages use different metaphors for time, but a single language could contain more than one metaphor.",
              "In English, for instance, speakers switch between at least two different frames of reference when discussing the order of events, a trick Nu\u0301n\u0303ez has demonstrated in a simple experiment.",
              "Ask any randomly selected group of English speakers to answer this question: if a meeting scheduled for Wednesday is moved forward two days, what day will it fall on?",
              "\"More or less 50% of the people will say Friday, and 50% will say Monday,\" says Nu\u0301n\u0303ez.",
              "The word \"moved\" allows the ambiguity that the meeting is either being moved forward in time, meaning it will happen later, or being brought closer in time to the person.",
              "The reason for the split in answers is that half the people are using themselves as a reference.",
              "Time is moving towards them, so \"forward\" denotes into the future, hence Friday.",
              "But it is also possible to think in a temporal reference frame that excludes ego, as in, \"Monday follows Sunday\".",
              "In that case, it is as if the speaker is looking out onto a landscape or conveyor belt of time from which he or she is removed.",
              "And on that conveyor belt, later events come after, or behind earlier ones.",
              "So moving the meeting forward means moving it to Monday.",
              "A complex system of rules governs which metaphor is appropriate in a given context, but as Nu\u0301n\u0303ez's experiment demonstrates, some situations are ambiguous.",
              "He and colleague Ben Motz have even biased people's choice towards the Monday response by showing them in advance a sequence of cubes moving across a screen, a motion scene that does not depend on the observer's location.",
              "So when it came to the Aymara, Nu\u0301n\u0303ez decided to proceed cautiously: \"The question that has never been asked of Aymara is, when they use these two words, nayra and q\"ipa , are they using them with reference to themselves, or to another time?\"",
              "If to another time, they may not be doing anything very differently from his North American subjects who thought that the meeting would fall on a Monday;",
              "if to themselves, then he would have concrete evidence of a conceptual chasm that exists between them and us, the future gazers.",
              "To find out which it was, he decided to study Aymara gesture and speech simultaneously, because in gesture people tend to act out the metaphor they are using in speech.",
              "Think of a person expressing a choice, who holds her palms upwards and alters their height as if weighing something on scales.",
              "Braving the thin air at 4,000 metres, he interviewed 27 adults, some of whom spoke only Aymara, some of whom were bilingual in Aymara and Spanish - chatting about old times and about future happenings in their community.",
              "In all, he collected about 20 hours of videotaped conversation, sections of which he later analysed for synchronicity of word and gesture.",
              "And he found that the Aymara did indeed have two frames of reference when it came to time.",
              "When they talked about very wide time spans, their gestures indicated that they conceived of it spanning from left to right, excluding themselves.",
              "But when they talked about shorter spans, several generations say, the axis was front-back, with them at point zero.",
              "The gestures of the old man and the woman discussing their grandparents confirmed that they really did think of the past as in front of them.",
              "Nu\u0301n\u0303ez thinks that the reason the Aymara think they way they do might be connected with the importance they accord vision.",
              "Every language has a system of markers which forces the speaker to pay attention to some aspects of the information being conveyed and not others.",
              "French emphasises the gender of an object (sa voiture , son livre), English the gender of the subject (his car, her book).",
              "Aymara marks whether the speaker saw the action happen or not: \"Yesterday my mother cooked potatoes (but I did not see her do it).\"",
              "If these markers are left out, the speaker is regarded as boastful or a liar.",
              "Thirty years ago, Miracle and Yapita pointed to the often incredulous responses of Aymara to some written texts: \"'Columbus discovered America' - was the author actually there?\"",
              "In a language so reliant on the eyewitness, it is not surprising that the speaker metaphorically faces what has already been seen: the past.",
              "It is even logical, says Lakoff.",
              "\"This Aymara finding is big news,\" says Vyvyan Evans, a theoretical cognitive linguist at the University of Sussex.",
              "\"It is the first really well-documented example of the future and past being structured in a totally different way from lots of other languages, including English.\"",
              "But Evans's own research had already predicted that there would be people in the world who view time differently.",
              "The only thing that all humans have in common when it comes to temporal experience is their brains' perceptual mechanisms. \"There is change in our environment, there is motion in our environment, and we need to be able to deal with that information,\" says Evans.",
              "The human brain has therefore evolved to be able to recognise three basic components of time: duration, simultaneity and repetition.",
              "Most languages have ways of expressing these three phenomena, but they might combine them into metaphors that are culturally determined.",
              "English, for instance, offers the possibility of buying time, while Aymara does not.",
              "The availability of different metaphors orients the whole language towards a subtly different, and perhaps unique, view of time.",
              "The closer the languages, the closer the metaphors.",
              "The Aymara have been pretty much isolated from the rest of the world for a long time, and for the moment, theirs is the only language in which a really dramatic divergence has been demonstrated.",
              "So it is hard to say to what extent their notion of time influences other areas of their thought-or how English or Hebrew speakers' influences theirs.",
              "\"It may not affect everything, but it may affect a lot of important things,\" says Lakoff.",
              "\"For instance, you're probably not going to get the same metaphors for progress.\"",
              "In their 1975 paper, Miracle and Yapita described the \"great patience\" of the Aymara, who thought nothing of waiting half a day for a truck to take them to market.",
              "People from English-speaking cultures like to plan, and feel outraged when life intervenes.",
              "But if you can't see the future, says Marta Hardman, an anthropologist at the University of Florida, there seems less point in planning.",
              "Hardman has studied the Aymara for 50 years - Miracle and Yapita were her students.",
              "When she first arrived among the Aymara of Peru in the 1950s, she was struck by the absence of a sexual hierarchy.",
              "People made much of remembering where you came from.",
              "That might mean your community or your ancestors, or your mother.",

              "Mandarin speakers often envision time as a vertical line where down represents the future (Credit: Reuters/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Alamy) Linguists, neuroscientists, psychologists and others have spent decades trying to uncover the ways in which language influences our thoughts, often focusing on abstract concepts such as space and time which are open to interpretation.",
              "But getting scientific results isn't easy.",
              "If we just compare the thinking and behaviour of people who speak different languages, it's hard to be sure that any differences aren't down to culture, personality or something else entirely.",
              "The central role that language plays in expressing ourselves also makes it hard to unpick it from these other influences.",
              "There are ways around this conundrum, however.",
              "Casasanto, for example, often teaches people in his lab to use metaphors from other languages (in their own tongue) and investigates what impact this has on their thinking.",
              "We know that people often use metaphors to think about abstract concepts \u2013 for example, a \"high price\", \"long time\" or \"deep mystery\".",
              "This way, you are not comparing people from different cultures, which may influence the results.",
              "Instead you are focusing on how thinking changes in the same people from the same culture while speaking in two different ways.",
              "Any cultural differences are therefore removed from the equation.",
              "You might also like: Cognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky, one of the pioneers of research into how language manipulates our thoughts, has shown that English speakers typically view time as a horizontal line.",
              "They might move meetings forward or push deadlines back.",
              "They also tend to view time as travelling from left to right, most likely in line with how you are reading the text on this page or the way the English language is written.",
              "This relationship to the direction text is written and time appears to apply in other languages too.",
              "Hebrew speakers, for example, who read and write from right to left, picture time as following the same path as their text.",
              "If you asked a Hebrew speaker to place photos on a timeline, they would most likely start from the right with the oldest images and then locate more recent ones to the left.",
              "Mandarin speakers, meanwhile, often envision time as a vertical line, where up represents the past and down the future.",
              "For example, they use the word xia (\"down\") when talking about future events, so that \"next week\" literally becomes \"down week\".",
              "As with English and Hebrew, this is also in line with how Mandarin traditionally was written and read \u2013 with lines running vertically, from the top of the page to the bottom.",
              "This association between the way we read language and organise time in our thoughts also impacts our cognition when dealing with time.",
              "Speakers of different languages process temporal information faster if it's organised in a way that matches their language.",
              "One experiment, for example, showed that monolingual English people were quicker to determine whether a picture was from the past or the future (represented by science fiction-style images) if the button they had to press for the past was to the left of the button for future than if they were positioned the other way around.",
              "If the buttons were placed above or below each other, however, it made no difference.",
              "Things start to get really strange, however, when looking at what happens in the minds of people who speak more than one language fluently.",
              "\"With bilinguals, you are literally looking at two different languages in the same mind,\" explains Panos Athanasopoulos, a linguist at Lancaster University in the UK.",
              "\"This means that you can establish a causal role of language on cognition, if you find that the same individual changes their behaviour when the language context changes.\"",
              "Bilingual Mandarin and English speakers living in Singapore also showed a preference for left to right mental time mapping over right to left mental mapping.",
              "But amazingly, this group was also quicker to react to future oriented pictures if the future button was located below the past button \u2013 in line with Mandarin.",
              "Indeed, this also suggests that bilinguals may have two different views of time's direction \u2013 particularly if they learn both languages from an early age.",
              "We aren't necessarily prisoners to thinking a certain way, though.",
              "Intriguingly, Casasanto has shown that you can quickly reverse people's mental time representation by training them to read mirror-reversed text, which goes in the opposite direction to what they're used to.",
              "They then react faster to statements that are consistent with time going the opposite way to what they are used to.",
              "But things get even more interesting.",
              "In English and many other European languages, we typically view the past as being behind us and the future in front of us.",
              "In Swedish, for example, the word for future, framtid, literally means \"front time\".",
              "But in Aymara, spoken by the Aymara people who live in the Andes in Bolivia, Chile, Peru and Argentina, the word for future means \"behind time\".",
              "They reason that, because we can't see the future, it must be to our rear.",
              "In fact, when the Aymara talk about the future they tend to make backwards gestures, whereas people who speak Spanish, for example, who view the future as being ahead of them, make forwards gestures.",
              "Similarly, like the Aymara, Mandarin speakers also imagine the future being behind them and the past ahead of them, calling the day before yesterday \"front day\" and the day after tomorrow \"back day\".",
              "Those that speak both Mandarin and English tend to switch between a forward and backward conception of the future, at times in ways that can clash with each other.",
              "Do you carry an umbrella with you tomorrow, or did you need it yesterday?",
              "The answer might depend on the language you speak (Credit: Ian Barnes/Getty Images) Casasanto noted that people tend to use spatial metaphors to talk about duration.",
              "For example, in English, French, German or the Scandinavian languages, a meeting can be \"long\" and a holiday \"short\".",
              "Casasanto showed that these metaphors are more than ways of talking \u2013 people conceptualise \"lengths\" of time as if they were lines in space.",
              "He initially believed this was universally true for all people, regardless of the languages they speak.",
              "But when presenting his findings at a conference in Greece, he was interrupted by a local researcher who insisted this wasn't correct for her language.",
              "\"My first response was a bit dismissive,\" admits Casasanto, who had doubled down on his view.",
              "Eventually, though, he says that he \"stopped talking and started listening\".",
              "And the result changed the course of his research to focus on language-related differences rather than universals in thinking.",
              "What he discovered was that Greek people tend to view time as a three-dimensional entity, like a bottle, which can fill up or empty out.",
              "A meeting, therefore, isn't \"long\" but \"big\" or \"much\", while a break isn't \"short\" but \"small\".",
              "The same is also true in Spanish.",
              "\"I can talk about 'long time' [in English], but if I use this expression in Greek, people will look at me funny,\" explains Athanasopoulos, who is a native Greek speaker.",
              "\"They will think I'm using it in a poetic way or in a way to emphasise it.\"",
              "Athanasopoulos, who found Casasanto's results fascinating, set out to investigate this issue.",
              "He sat Swedish and Spanish speakers in front of a computer screen and asked them to estimate how much time had passed when either watching a line grow or a container fill up.",
              "The trick was that these events occurred at different rates.",
              "Monolingual Swedish speakers were easily misled when the line was shown \u2013 they believed a longer line meant more time had passed, even if that wasn't the case.",
              "Their time estimates weren't, however, influenced by a filling container.",
              "For Spanish speakers, it was the other way around.",
              "Athanasopoulos then went further, looking at bilingual Spanish and Swedish speakers \u2013 and what he found was remarkable.",
              "When the Swedish word for duration (tid) appeared in the top corner of the computer screen, the participants estimated time using line length and weren't affected by container volume.",
              "But when this changed to the Spanish word for duration (duracio\u0301n), the results completely reversed.",
              "The extent to which the bilinguals were affected by the time metaphors of their second language was related to how proficient they were in that language.",
              "These language quirks are fascinating, but how much impact do they really have on our thinking?",
              "Casasanto raises a curious point.",
              "When you imagine time on a line, each point is fixed so that two points of time cannot swap places \u2013 there's a strict arrow.",
              "But in a container, points of time are floating around \u2013 and potentially capable of swapping places.",
              "\"I've long wondered whether our physics of time might be shaped by the fact that English, German and French speakers were instrumental in creating it,\" he says.",
              "Interestingly, time is an increasingly tricky problem in physics, standing in the way of uniting its different branches.",
              "Physicists long imagined time as having an arrow, and ticking reliably from the past into the future.",
              "But modern theories are more complicated.",
              "In Einstein's theory of general relativity, for example, time doesn't seem to flow at all on the grandest scale of the universe \u2013 which is a weird idea even to physicists.",
              "Instead, the past, present and future all seem to exist simultaneously \u2013 as if they were points swimming around in a bottle.",
              "So perhaps the time as a line metaphor has been \u2013 and still is \u2013 holding back physics.",
              "(Read more about whether time goes in just one direction.)",
              "\"That would be a pretty remarkable effect of language on thought,\" says Casasanto.",
              "Languages also encode time in their grammar.",
              "In English, for example, the future is one of three simple tenses, along with the past and the present \u2013 we say \"it rained\", \"it rains\" and \"it will rain\".",
              "But in German, you can say Morgen regnet, which means \"it rains tomorrow\" \u2013 you don't need to build the future into the grammar.",
              "The same is true for many other languages, including Mandarin, where external circumstances often denote that something is taking place in the future, such as \"I go on holiday next month\".",
              "But does this affect how we think?",
              "In 2013, Keith Chen, a behavioural economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, set out to test whether people who speak languages that are \"futureless\" might feel closer to the future than those who speak other languages.",
              "For example, German, Chinese, Japanese, Dutch and the Scandinavian languages have no linguistic barrier between the present and the future, while \"futured languages\", such as English, French, Italian, Spanish and Greek, encourage speakers to view the future as something separate from the present.",
              "He discovered that speakers of futureless languages were more likely to engage in future-focused activities.",
              "They were 31% more likely to have put money into savings in any given year and had accumulated 39% more wealth by retirement.",
              "They were also 24% less likely to smoke, 29% more likely to be physically active, and 13% less likely to be medically obese.",
              "This result held even when controlling for factors such as socioeconomic status and religion.",
              "In fact, OECD countries (the group of industrialised nations) with futureless languages save on average 5% more of their GDP per year.",
              "This correlation may sound like a fluke, with complex historical and political reasons perhaps being the real drivers.",
              "But Chen has since investigated whether variables such as culture or how languages are related could be influencing the results.",
              "When he accounted for these factors, the correlation was weaker \u2013 but nevertheless held in most cases.",
              "\"The hypothesis still seems surprisingly robust to me,\" argues Chen.",
              "The Aymara people reason that because we cannot see the future, it must be behind us (Credit: Jenny Matthews/Alamy) It is also backed by a 2018 experiment in the bilingual city Meran/Merano, in northern Italy, where about half the inhabitants speak German, a futureless language, and the other half Italian, a futured language.",
              "The researchers tested 1,154 primary school children's ability to resist temptation by asking them whether they would like two tokens (which could be exchanged for presents) at the end of the experiment or a bigger reward (three, four or five tokens) in four weeks.",
              "They discovered that German-speaking children were on average 16 percentage points more likely to be able to wait for a larger number of tokens than Italian-speaking children \u2013 in line with Chen's hypothesis.",
              "The results still held when controlling for risk attitudes, IQ, family background and residential area.",
              "But the effects of language can extend even further into our physical world \u2013 influencing how we orient ourselves in space.",
              "Different languages can force us to think in terms of specific \"reference frames\".",
              "As Boroditsky and her colleague Alice Gaby have shown, Aboriginal Kuuk Thaayorre people in Australia, for example, use cardinal directions \u2013 north, south, east, west \u2013 to talk about even mundane things, such as \"the cup is on your south-west\".",
              "This is called an \"absolute\" reference frame \u2013 the coordinates provided are independent of the observer's viewpoint or the location of reference objects.",
              "But many languages, including English, use rather clumsy terms for spatial orientation \u2013 such as \"next to\", \"left of\", \"behind\" or \"above\".",
              "As if that wasn't enough, we also have to calculate which frame of reference they apply in.",
              "If someone tells you to pick up the keys on the right of a computer, do they mean on the computer's right-hand side or to the right of the computer from your perspective when facing it?",
              "The former is called an \"intrinsic\" reference frame (having two reference points: computer and keys) and the latter a \"relative\" reference frame (there are three reference points: computer, keys and observer).",
              "And this can shape how we think \u2013 and navigate.",

              "The ball is on the left of the dog.\"",
              "Or: \"I see a dog, the ball is on the dog's left.\"",
              "In English, those two descriptions can denote two different sides of the dog, whereas in Spanish they both refer to what English speakers would think of as the \"dog's left\".",
              "Spanish monolinguals located the ball using the intrinsic reference frame 78% of the time and English monolinguals 52% of the time.",
              "English speakers only chose the intrinsic frame if the possessive sentence, \"the ball is on the dog's left\", was used.",
              "The phrasing didn't matter to Spanish speakers.",
              "They simply preferred the intrinsic frame, unless the object was inanimate \u2013 it was a vase or a car rather than a dog, statue or human.",
              "In a follow-up study, Tenbrink showed that bilingual Spanish and English speakers were somewhere in the middle between monolingual Spanish and English speakers, and were more influenced by the reference frame used most commonly in the country they lived in.",
              "\"Spanish and English speakers interpret spatial relationships in a slightly different way,\" says Tenbrink.",
              "\"And once the speaker speaks both languages, their preferences shift in different ways.",

              "When he talks about his ancestors, does he mean the Incas?",
              "No, he replies in a sort of Spanish creole, he means his great-great-grandfather.",
              "And with his right hand he makes a rotating gesture up and forwards from his body.",
              "The Incas, he adds, came way earlier.",
              "And with the same hand he sweeps even further forward, towards the mountains on the horizon.",
              "In the next video clip, the researcher asks a woman to explain the origins of her culture.",
              "She starts by describing her parents' generation, then her grandparents', and so on, extending her arm further and further in front of her as she does so.",
              "Then she switches to talk about how the values of those earlier generations have been handed back to her (her hand gradually returns to her body from out front), and how she will in turn pass them on to her children (she thumbs over her shoulder).",
              "The man and woman belong to an Amerindian group called the Aymara, who inhabit some of the highest valleys in the Andes - in their case, in northern Chile.",
              "The researcher is Rafael Nu\u0301n\u0303ez, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, San Diego, who is interested in how we develop abstract ideas like time.",
              "Nu\u0301n\u0303ez now believes that he has definitive evidence that the Aymara have a sense of the passage of time that is the mirror image of his own: the past is in front of them, the future behind.",
              "With his collaborator, linguist Eve Sweetser, he will publish his findings later this year, but they have already prompted speculation as to whether other peoples might conceive of time like the Aymara.",
              "George Lakoff, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, thinks that it is a strong possibility.",
              "The clues lie in language, and as he points out, \"There are 6,000 languages and most of them have never been written down.\"",
              "More fundamentally, Nu\u0301n\u0303ez and Sweetser's work highlights the illusory nature of time.",
              "Time, as Einstein showed, is a tricky concept to nail down, and all languages resort to metaphor to express it.",
              "In fact, with staggering monotony, they all resort to the same metaphor: space.",
              "If an English speaker says: \"We are approaching the deadline,\" he or she is expressing imminence in terms of nearness, a property of physical space.",
              "Anyone listening will understand exactly what he or she means, even though the deadline is not an entity that exists in the physical world.",
              "Nu\u0301n\u0303ez says: \"There is no ultimate truth that you could discover that is outside that metaphor.\"",
              "So if temporal landmarks don't exist except in our heads, where does our notion of time come from?",
              "And why do we feel so strongly a sense of time as motion?",
              "In all Indo-European languages including English, but also in languages as diverse as Hebrew, Polynesian, Japanese and Bantu, speakers face the future.",
              "Time flows from a point in front of them, through their current position - the present - and back to the past.",
              "The Aymara also feel time as motion, but for them, speakers face the past and have their backs to the future.",
              "The Aymara word for past is transcribed as nayra , which literally means eye, sight or front.",
              "The word for future is q\"ipa , which translates as behind or the back.",
              "The Jesuits undoubtedly noticed this oddity in the 16th century, when they ventured up into the mountains to spread the word.",
              "More recently, linguistic anthropologists have puzzled over what it means.",
              "In 1975, Andrew Miracle and Juan de Dios Yapita Moya, both at the University of Florida, observed that q\"ipu\u0308ru , the Aymara word for tomorrow, combines q\"ipa and uru , the word for day, to produce a literal meaning of \"some day behind one's back\".",
              "Over the years, rumours have surfaced of similar strangeness in other languages.",
              "Maori speakers use front-type words to signify events that happened earlier, Agathe Thornton, an expert in the Maori oral tradition reported in the 1980s.",
              "Malagasy, too, uses \"in front of\" to mean \"earlier than\".",
              "It began to look as if the Aymara weren't alone in spinning time's arrow - until in 1980, Lakoff and Mark Johnson, a philosopher at the University of Oregon, warned against jumping to that conclusion.",
              "Lakoff and Johnson realised that not only could different languages use different metaphors for time, but a single language could contain more than one metaphor.",
              "In English, for instance, speakers switch between at least two different frames of reference when discussing the order of events, a trick Nu\u0301n\u0303ez has demonstrated in a simple experiment.",
              "Ask any randomly selected group of English speakers to answer this question: if a meeting scheduled for Wednesday is moved forward two days, what day will it fall on?",
              "\"More or less 50% of the people will say Friday, and 50% will say Monday,\" says Nu\u0301n\u0303ez.",
              "The word \"moved\" allows the ambiguity that the meeting is either being moved forward in time, meaning it will happen later, or being brought closer in time to the person.",
              "The reason for the split in answers is that half the people are using themselves as a reference.",
              "Time is moving towards them, so \"forward\" denotes into the future, hence Friday.",
              "But it is also possible to think in a temporal reference frame that excludes ego, as in, \"Monday follows Sunday\".",
              "In that case, it is as if the speaker is looking out onto a landscape or conveyor belt of time from which he or she is removed.",
              "And on that conveyor belt, later events come after, or behind earlier ones.",
              "So moving the meeting forward means moving it to Monday.",
              "A complex system of rules governs which metaphor is appropriate in a given context, but as Nu\u0301n\u0303ez's experiment demonstrates, some situations are ambiguous.",
              "He and colleague Ben Motz have even biased people's choice towards the Monday response by showing them in advance a sequence of cubes moving across a screen, a motion scene that does not depend on the observer's location.",
              "So when it came to the Aymara, Nu\u0301n\u0303ez decided to proceed cautiously: \"The question that has never been asked of Aymara is, when they use these two words, nayra and q\"ipa , are they using them with reference to themselves, or to another time?\"",
              "If to another time, they may not be doing anything very differently from his North American subjects who thought that the meeting would fall on a Monday;",
              "if to themselves, then he would have concrete evidence of a conceptual chasm that exists between them and us, the future gazers.",
              "To find out which it was, he decided to study Aymara gesture and speech simultaneously, because in gesture people tend to act out the metaphor they are using in speech.",
              "Think of a person expressing a choice, who holds her palms upwards and alters their height as if weighing something on scales.",
              "Braving the thin air at 4,000 metres, he interviewed 27 adults, some of whom spoke only Aymara, some of whom were bilingual in Aymara and Spanish - chatting about old times and about future happenings in their community.",
              "In all, he collected about 20 hours of videotaped conversation, sections of which he later analysed for synchronicity of word and gesture.",
              "And he found that the Aymara did indeed have two frames of reference when it came to time.",
              "When they talked about very wide time spans, their gestures indicated that they conceived of it spanning from left to right, excluding themselves.",
              "But when they talked about shorter spans, several generations say, the axis was front-back, with them at point zero.",
              "The gestures of the old man and the woman discussing their grandparents confirmed that they really did think of the past as in front of them.",
              "Nu\u0301n\u0303ez thinks that the reason the Aymara think they way they do might be connected with the importance they accord vision.",
              "Every language has a system of markers which forces the speaker to pay attention to some aspects of the information being conveyed and not others.",
              "French emphasises the gender of an object (sa voiture , son livre), English the gender of the subject (his car, her book).",
              "Aymara marks whether the speaker saw the action happen or not: \"Yesterday my mother cooked potatoes (but I did not see her do it).\"",
              "If these markers are left out, the speaker is regarded as boastful or a liar.",
              "Thirty years ago, Miracle and Yapita pointed to the often incredulous responses of Aymara to some written texts: \"'Columbus discovered America' - was the author actually there?\"",
              "In a language so reliant on the eyewitness, it is not surprising that the speaker metaphorically faces what has already been seen: the past.",
              "It is even logical, says Lakoff.",
              "\"This Aymara finding is big news,\" says Vyvyan Evans, a theoretical cognitive linguist at the University of Sussex.",
              "\"It is the first really well-documented example of the future and past being structured in a totally different way from lots of other languages, including English.\"",
              "But Evans's own research had already predicted that there would be people in the world who view time differently.",
              "The only thing that all humans have in common when it comes to temporal experience is their brains' perceptual mechanisms. \"There is change in our environment, there is motion in our environment, and we need to be able to deal with that information,\" says Evans.",
              "The human brain has therefore evolved to be able to recognise three basic components of time: duration, simultaneity and repetition.",
              "Most languages have ways of expressing these three phenomena, but they might combine them into metaphors that are culturally determined.",
              "English, for instance, offers the possibility of buying time, while Aymara does not.",
              "The availability of different metaphors orients the whole language towards a subtly different, and perhaps unique, view of time.",
              "The closer the languages, the closer the metaphors.",
              "The Aymara have been pretty much isolated from the rest of the world for a long time, and for the moment, theirs is the only language in which a really dramatic divergence has been demonstrated.",
              "So it is hard to say to what extent their notion of time influences other areas of their thought-or how English or Hebrew speakers' influences theirs.",
              "\"It may not affect everything, but it may affect a lot of important things,\" says Lakoff.",
              "\"For instance, you're probably not going to get the same metaphors for progress.\"",
              "In their 1975 paper, Miracle and Yapita described the \"great patience\" of the Aymara, who thought nothing of waiting half a day for a truck to take them to market.",
              "People from English-speaking cultures like to plan, and feel outraged when life intervenes.",
              "But if you can't see the future, says Marta Hardman, an anthropologist at the University of Florida, there seems less point in planning.",
              "Hardman has studied the Aymara for 50 years - Miracle and Yapita were her students.",
              "When she first arrived among the Aymara of Peru in the 1950s, she was struck by the absence of a sexual hierarchy.",
              "People made much of remembering where you came from.",
              "That might mean your community or your ancestors, or your mother.",
              "Women were respected more than in her home town.",
              "\"I was suddenly treated as a full person,\" she says.",
              "And 50 years on, she can't help feeling that it is her native culture, not the Aymara, which is going against the grain.",
              "In English we are encouraged to ignore the past, she says.",
              "\"We pretend it's not there, yet we're lugging it with us as we go.\""

              "In contrast, polychronic cultures have a flexible approach to time.",
              "Polychronic cultures work on several things at once, both in business and in daily life.",
              "Meyer suggests that one factor that contributes to the development of monochronic cultures is industrialization.",
              "During the Industrial Revolution, people were newly required to arrive at an exact time to a specific location.",
              "This is because they started working in factories, and the machines were turned on at specific times.",
              "If you were late, you cost the company money.",

              "The first is adaptability: successful companies and managers are able to take environmental changes in stride and adjust how they work.",
