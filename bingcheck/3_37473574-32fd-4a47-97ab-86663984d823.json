              "\u201cThe lumbar region is critical to understanding the nature of bipedalism in our earliest ancestors and to understanding how well adapted they were to walking on two legs,\u201d says Professor Scott Williams of New York University and Wits University and lead author on the paper.",

              "\u201cWhile Issa was already one of the most complete skeletons of an ancient hominin ever discovered, these vertebrae practically complete the lower back and make Issa\u2019s lumbar region a contender for not only the best-preserved hominin lower back ever discovered, but also probably the best preserved,\u201d says Berger, who is an author on the study and leader of the Malapa project.",
              "He adds that this combination of completeness and preservation gave the team an unprecedented look at the anatomy of the lower back of the species.",
              "Previous studies of the incomplete lower spine by authors not involved in the present study hypothesised that sediba would have had a relatively straight spine, without the curvature, or lordosis, typically seen in modern humans.",
              "They further hypothesised Issa\u2019s spine was more like that of the extinct species Neandertals and other more primitive species of ancient hominins older than two million years.",
              "Lordosis is the inward curve of the lumbar spine and is typically used to demonstrate strong adaptations to bipedalism.",
              "However, with the more complete spine, and excellent preservation of the fossils, the present study found the lordosis of sediba was in fact more extreme than any other australopithecines yet discovered, and the amount of curvature of the spine observed was only exceeded by that seen in the spine of the 1.",

              "Additionally, it can be shown that any massless spin-2 field would give rise to a force indistinguishable from gravitation, because a massless spin-2 field would couple to the stress\u2013energy tensor in the same way gravitational interactions do.",

              "These included not only the 5\\(\\sigma \\) threshold separating excess events (or evidence) from discovery (or observation), which was crossed in July of 2012, but also the milestones set for confirming that the particle was the SM Higgs boson, e.",

              "We will end with a short discussion of the most pressing question remaining after the Higgs boson discovery: what avenues remain to rule out its potential BSM character?",

              "The Higgs boson quickly became a cornerstone of the SM after it was shown that it retains the renormalizability of electroweak theory (\u2019t Hooft 1971).",
              "Within the SM, the Higgs boson is an elementary particle with unambiguously predicted quantum numbers, notably its spin J, parity P, and charge conjugation parity C being \\(\\hbox {J}^{\\mathrm {PC} }\\) = 0\\(^{++}\\).",
              "While theory required its mass to be smaller than about 800 GeV, the exact value could not be predicted.",

              "2011)].",
              "This allowed for a clear experimental search strategy.",
              "The LEP \\(e^+e^-\\) collider operating in the 1990s, and later the Tevatron \\(p{\\bar{p}}\\) collider operating in the 2000s, reached sufficient experimental sensitivity to begin Higgs hunting.",
              "They did not find a signal, but excluded a SM Higgs with a mass below 114.",
              "6 GeV, and within a small interval around 160 GeV, respectively.",
              "Furthermore, under the assumption that the SM was correct, and using precision measurements and calculations of virtual effects, it was found that the Higgs should have a mass below 156 GeV.",
              "The SM has internal shortcomings, like the lack of explanation for the number and structure of fundamental matter particles and their respective interactions, e.",
              "g., the twelve fundamental fermions come in three \u2018generations\u2019 with almost identical properties.",
              "In addition there are external deficiencies, like having no dark matter (DM) candidate.",
              "Many BSM models address deficiencies of the SM, with quite a few explicitly covering EWSB.",
              "These include supersymmetric (SUSY) variations (which assume a fundamental symmetry between bosons and fermions), composite Higgs models (which assume the Higgs boson to be made up of subconstituents held together by an additional strong interaction), models with an extended Higgs sector (which assume at least one additional doublet), and models which embed EWSB in a higher dimensional space (with different variants, some implying no Higgs boson).",
              "The main goals motivating the construction of the LHC were to probe the multi-TeV range for BSM effects and, in particular, to understand the mechanism of EWSB.",
              "It began operation at a collision energy of 7 TeV in March 2010, collecting data until the end of 2012, by which time it had increased to 8 TeV.",
              "Since 2015, the LHC has been collecting data at 13 TeV.",
              "After continuously extending the excluded mass range for a SM Higgs boson, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations presented their preliminary results of the 2011 data taking at a joint seminar at CERN on December 13, 2011.",
              "Both ATLAS and CMS showed that they could exclude almost the entirety of the possible Higgs mass range except for 115\u2013130 GeV and very high masses of more than 450 GeV (ATLAS Collaboration 2011;",
              "CMS Collaboration 2011).",
              "More importantly, they independently reported an excess of events around 125 GeV in both the \\(\\gamma \\gamma \\), or di-photon, channel and the \\(\\hbox {ZZ}^*\\rightarrow \\) 4 lepton channel.",
              "Footnote 1 Each collaboration obtained a local significanceFootnote 2 of about 2.",
              "5\u20133.",
              "5\\(\\sigma \\), which is not enough to claim an observation.",
              "Footnote 3 But because the yields (the modes and strengths in which the excess was observed) and mass were consistent with the SM Higgs prediction, there was a strong expectation in the physics community that a Higgs discovery was in reach as more data came in.",
              "Early in 2012, the data had been analysed in more detail and the searches extended to additional potential Higgs decay modes, essentially confirming the previous evidence (ATLAS Collaboration 2012a;",
              "Collaboration 2012a).",
              "ATLAS and CMS, along with the CDF and D0 experiments from the Tevatron, presented their findings at the XLVIIth Rencontres de Moriond in March of 2012.",
              "In that conference\u2019s experimental summary, Dissertori, called the excess \u201ctantalizing at this stage.",
              "\u201d However, he warned that \u201cwe should not forget the still limited statistics available,\u201d nor the \u201cstill not overwhelming significance of these observations.",
              "\u201d He concluded by remarking that \u201cthe final missing building block, the Higgs boson, [is] probably on the horizon\u201d (Dissertori 2012).",
              "On July 4, 2012, on the eve of the \\(36{\\text {th}}\\) International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP) in Australia, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations presented the result of their Higgs searches at a special colloquium at CERN.",
              "Based on an increased data set taken at the higher energy of 8 TeV, the two collaborations reported an excess at 125 GeV with a local significance of \\(5\\sigma \\), the minimum significance that is conventionally considered sufficient for declaring the observation of a new particle.",
              "The significance was driven by the precision channels of \\(\\gamma \\gamma \\) and \\(\\hbox {ZZ}^*\\rightarrow \\) 4 leptons.",
              "The observed mass, along with preliminary examinations of the branching ratios, fit within the expectations of a SM Higgs boson.",
              "These data, along with analyses of additional decay channels, were submitted to journals at the end of July (Collaboration 2012b, b).",
              "Both collaborations were careful to state that, though the particle\u2019s known properties were consistent with a SM Higgs, further data would be required to determine if the last missing SM particle had been found.",
              "In fact, much of the talk of the conferences following the observation announcement was dedicated to analysing the available data for clues to the exact nature of this new particle and for any signs of SM deviations.",
              "One of the most pressing questions was whether this new particle was a Higgs \u201cimpostor,\u201d such as a composite Higgs.",
              "For instance, Pomarol discussed the implications of the data for various Higgs models in his EWSB summary at ICHEP 2012, noting that the observation likely spelled the end of Higgsless models and that the observed mass is just barely consistent with the ranges allowed by CH models or the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM).",
              "With the question of whether the particle is a SM Higgs or an indicator of BSM physics looming large, Pomarol assured the conference that a new era of physics has just begun (Pomarol 2012).",
              "At the 2012 Higgs Hunting Workshop, Peskin outlined the steps required to establish whether the particle was a Higgs boson: (i) determining that it is a CP-even spin-0 field, (ii) identifying that the major decay modes are present, and (iii) confirming that their signal strengths are SM-like.",
              "He also outlined (iv) the need to search for small SM deviations, because precise Higgs measurements may be the best route for finding new physics.",
              "Although Peskin noted that some of the observed relative strengths of the branching ratios, particularly in the di-photon channel, were suggestive of a SM deviation, by mid-2012 there was simply not enough information to make a clear determination (Peskin 2012).",
              "As we can see, in the first days and weeks after the observation announcement there was a great deal of speculation but no firm answers about the exact nature of this new particle.",
              "Though the data leading to the announcement were consistent with a SM Higgs of 125 GeV, room remained in the model landscape for SM extensions that could produce similar results.",
              "This led to the common description of the particle as a \u201cHiggs-like\u201d boson.",
              "In this environment, many physicists working on BSM models moved to incorporate the available data, which were quickly being analysed for tell-tale clues indicative of the particle\u2019s precise nature.",
              "Five months later, in November 2012, participants at the Hadron Collider Physics Symposium in Kyoto, Japan and a satellite workshop on Higgs Coupling in Tokyo assessed the current status of the observed boson.",
              "By then, up to twice the amount of data used for the July announcement had been analysed by various studies.",
              "New results were presented on the particle\u2019s couplings to fermions and bosons, to a large extent derived from loop processes.",
              "In addition, a first direct indication of the Higgs coupling to fermions (\\(H\\rightarrow \\tau ^+\\tau ^-\\)) had been seen, albeit at just \\(1\\sigma \\) significance.",
              "Furthermore, the \\(0^+\\) property of the SM Higgs boson agreed with the data, while the spin J-parity P \\(J^P~= 0^-\\) was found to be disfavoured.",
