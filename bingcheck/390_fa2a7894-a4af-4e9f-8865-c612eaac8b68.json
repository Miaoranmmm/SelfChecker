    "query": "What is the process and technology behind the manufacturing of electric car batteries, and what steps are being taken to improve their efficiency, sustainability, and affordability for widespread adoption?",
    "response": "The manufacturing process of electric car batteries involves several steps, from mining the raw materials to assembling the battery pack. The main components of a battery pack are the individual battery cells, which contain a positive electrode (cathode), a negative electrode (anode), and a solid electrolyte that allows the movement of lithium ions between them. The cells are arranged in modules, which are connected by a battery management system that controls the power output and monitors the temperature and voltage. The battery pack also has a cooling system to prevent overheating and improve performance[^1^] [^2^].\n\nThe efficiency, sustainability, and affordability of electric car batteries depend on various factors, such as the choice of materials, the design of the battery pack, the availability of recycling options, and the environmental impact of mining and manufacturing. Some of the challenges that researchers are working on include reducing the use of scarce or expensive metals such as cobalt and nickel, finding alternative materials that can store more energy per unit weight and volume, developing low-cost and high-quality recycling processes that can recover valuable metals from spent batteries, and minimizing the carbon footprint and social costs of battery production[^1^] [^2^] [^7^].\n\nElectric car batteries have many advantages over conventional fossil fuel vehicles, such as lower greenhouse gas emissions, lower operating costs, and higher energy efficiency. However, they also face some barriers to widespread adoption, such as high upfront costs, limited driving range, long charging time, and lack of charging infrastructure. These challenges can be overcome by further innovation in battery technology, policy support, consumer education, and market incentives[^6^] [^9^].",

              "If those trends escalate as expected, the need for better methods of storing electrical energy will intensify.",
              "\u201cWe need all the strategies we can get to address the threat of climate change,\u201d says Elsa Olivetti PhD \u201907, the Esther and Harold E.",
              "Edgerton Associate Professor in Materials Science and Engineering.",
              "\u201cObviously, developing technologies for grid-based storage at a large scale is critical.",
              "But for mobile applications \u2014 in particular, transportation \u2014 much research is focusing on adapting today\u2019s lithium-ion battery to make versions that are safer, smaller, and can store more energy for their size and weight.",
              "\u201d Traditional lithium-ion batteries continue to improve, but they have limitations that persist, in part because of their structure.",
              "A lithium-ion battery consists of two electrodes \u2014 one positive and one negative \u2014 sandwiched around an organic (carbon-containing) liquid.",
              "As the battery is charged and discharged, electrically charged particles (or ions) of lithium pass from one electrode to the other through the liquid electrolyte.",
              "One problem with that design is that at certain voltages and temperatures, the liquid electrolyte can become volatile and catch fire.",
              "\u201cBatteries are generally safe under normal usage, but the risk is still there,\u201d says Kevin Huang PhD \u201915, a research scientist in Olivetti\u2019s group.",
              "Another problem is that lithium-ion batteries are not well-suited for use in vehicles.",
              "Large, heavy battery packs take up space and increase a vehicle\u2019s overall weight, reducing fuel efficiency.",
              "But it\u2019s proving difficult to make today\u2019s lithium-ion batteries smaller and lighter while maintaining their energy density \u2014 that is, the amount of energy they store per gram of weight.",
              "To solve those problems, researchers are changing key features of the lithium-ion battery to make an all-solid, or \u201csolid-state,\u201d version.",
              "They replace the liquid electrolyte in the middle with a thin, solid electrolyte that\u2019s stable at a wide range of voltages and temperatures.",
              "With that solid electrolyte, they use a high-capacity positive electrode and a high-capacity, lithium metal negative electrode that\u2019s far thinner than the usual layer of porous carbon.",
              "Those changes make it possible to shrink the overall battery considerably while maintaining its energy-storage capacity, thereby achieving a higher energy density.",
              "\u201cThose features \u2014 enhanced safety and greater energy density \u2014 are probably the two most-often-touted advantages of a potential solid-state battery,\u201d says Huang.",
              "He then quickly clarifies that \u201call of these things are prospective, hoped-for, and not necessarily realized.",
              "\u201d Nevertheless, the possibility has many researchers scrambling to find materials and designs that can deliver on that promise.",
              "Thinking beyond the lab Researchers have come up with many intriguing options that look promising \u2014 in the lab.",
              "But Olivetti and Huang believe that additional practical considerations may be important, given the urgency of the climate change challenge.",
              "\u201cThere are always metrics that we researchers use in the lab to evaluate possible materials and processes,\u201d says Olivetti.",
              "Examples might include energy-storage capacity and charge/discharge rate.",
              "When performing basic research \u2014 which she deems both necessary and important \u2014 those metrics are appropriate.",
              "\u201cBut if the aim is implementation, we suggest adding a few metrics that specifically address the potential for rapid scaling,\u201d she says.",
              "Based on industry\u2019s experience with current lithium-ion batteries, the MIT researchers and their colleague Gerbrand Ceder, the Daniel M.",
              "Tellep Distinguished Professor of Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, suggest three broad questions that can help identify potential constraints on future scale-up as a result of materials selection.",
              "First, with this battery design, could materials availability, supply chains, or price volatility become a problem as production scales up?",
              "(Note that the environmental and other concerns raised by expanded mining are outside the scope of this study.)",
              "Second, will fabricating batteries from these materials involve difficult manufacturing steps during which parts are likely to fail?",
              "And third, do manufacturing measures needed to ensure a high-performance product based on these materials ultimately lower or raise the cost of the batteries produced?",
              "To demonstrate their approach, Olivetti, Ceder, and Huang examined some of the electrolyte chemistries and battery structures now being investigated by researchers.",
              "To select their examples, they turned to previous work in which they and their collaborators used text- and data-mining techniques to gather information on materials and processing details reported in the literature.",
              "From that database, they selected a few frequently reported options that represent a range of possibilities.",
              "Materials and availability In the world of solid inorganic electrolytes, there are two main classes of materials \u2014 the oxides, which contain oxygen, and the sulfides, which contain sulfur.",
              "Olivetti, Ceder, and Huang focused on one promising electrolyte option in each class and examined key elements of concern for each of them.",
              "The sulfide they considered was LGPS, which combines lithium, germanium, phosphorus, and sulfur.",
              "Based on availability considerations, they focused on the germanium, an element that raises concerns in part because it\u2019s not generally mined on its own.",
              "Instead, it\u2019s a byproduct produced during the mining of coal and zinc.",
              "To investigate its availability, the researchers looked at how much germanium was produced annually in the past six decades during coal and zinc mining and then at how much could have been produced.",
              "The outcome suggested that 100 times more germanium could have been produced, even in recent years.",
              "Given that supply potential, the availability of germanium is not likely to constrain the scale-up of a solid-state battery based on an LGPS electrolyte.",
              "The situation looked less promising with the researchers\u2019 selected oxide, LLZO, which consists of lithium, lanthanum, zirconium, and oxygen.",
              "Extraction and processing of lanthanum are largely concentrated in China, and there\u2019s limited data available, so the researchers didn\u2019t try to analyze its availability.",
              "The other three elements are abundantly available.",
              "However, in practice, a small quantity of another element \u2014 called a dopant \u2014 must be added to make LLZO easy to process.",
              "So the team focused on tantalum, the most frequently used dopant, as the main element of concern for LLZO.",
              "Tantalum is produced as a byproduct of tin and niobium mining.",
              "Historical data show that the amount of tantalum produced during tin and niobium mining was much closer to the potential maximum than was the case with germanium.",
              "So the availability of tantalum is more of a concern for the possible scale-up of an LLZO-based battery.",
              "But knowing the availability of an element in the ground doesn\u2019t address the steps required to get it to a manufacturer.",
              "So the researchers investigated a follow-on question concerning the supply chains for critical elements \u2014 mining, processing, refining, shipping, and so on.",
              "Assuming that abundant supplies are available, can the supply chains that deliver those materials expand quickly enough to meet the growing demand for batteries?",
              "In sample analyses, they looked at how much supply chains for germanium and tantalum would need to grow year to year to provide batteries for a projected fleet of electric vehicles in 2030.",
              "As an example, an electric vehicle fleet often cited as a goal for 2030 would require production of enough batteries to deliver a total of 100 gigawatt hours of energy.",
              "To meet that goal using just LGPS batteries, the supply chain for germanium would need to grow by 50 percent from year to year \u2014 a stretch, since the maximum growth rate in the past has been about 7 percent.",
              "Using just LLZO batteries, the supply chain for tantalum would need to grow by about 30 percent \u2014 a growth rate well above the historical high of about 10 percent.",
              "Those examples demonstrate the importance of considering both materials availability and supply chains when evaluating different solid electrolytes for their scale-up potential.",
              "\u201cEven when the quantity of a material available isn\u2019t a concern, as is the case with germanium, scaling all the steps in the supply chain to match the future production of electric vehicles may require a growth rate that\u2019s literally unprecedented,\u201d says Huang.",
              "Materials and processing In assessing the potential for scale-up of a battery design, another factor to consider is the difficulty of the manufacturing process and how it may impact cost.",
              "Fabricating a solid-state battery inevitably involves many steps, and a failure at any step raises the cost of each battery successfully produced.",
              "As Huang explains, \u201cYou\u2019re not shipping those failed batteries;",
              "you\u2019re throwing them away.",
              "But you\u2019ve still spent money on the materials and time and processing.",
              "\u201d As a proxy for manufacturing difficulty, Olivetti, Ceder, and Huang explored the impact of failure rate on overall cost for selected solid-state battery designs in their database.",
              "In one example, they focused on the oxide LLZO.",
              "LLZO is extremely brittle, and at the high temperatures involved in manufacturing, a large sheet that\u2019s thin enough to use in a high-performance solid-state battery is likely to crack or warp.",
              "To determine the impact of such failures on cost, they modeled four key processing steps in assembling LLZO-based batteries.",
              "At each step, they calculated cost based on an assumed yield \u2014 that is, the fraction of total units that were successfully processed without failing.",
              "With the LLZO, the yield was far lower than with the other designs they examined;",
              "and, as the yield went down, the cost of each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of battery energy went up significantly.",
              "For example, when 5 percent more units failed during the final cathode heating step, cost increased by about $30/kWh \u2014 a nontrivial change considering that a commonly accepted target cost for such batteries is $100/kWh.",
              "Clearly, manufacturing difficulties can have a profound impact on the viability of a design for large-scale adoption.",
              "Materials and performance One of the main challenges in designing an all-solid battery comes from \u201cinterfaces\u201d \u2014 that is, where one component meets another.",
              "During manufacturing or operation, materials at those interfaces can become unstable.",
              "\u201cAtoms start going places that they shouldn\u2019t, and battery performance declines,\u201d says Huang.",
              "As a result, much research is devoted to coming up with methods of stabilizing interfaces in different battery designs.",
              "Many of the methods proposed do increase performance;",
              "and as a result, the cost of the battery in dollars per kWh goes down.",
              "But implementing such solutions generally involves added materials and time, increasing the cost per kWh during large-scale manufacturing.",
              "To illustrate that trade-off, the researchers first examined their oxide, LLZO.",
              "Here, the goal is to stabilize the interface between the LLZO electrolyte and the negative electrode by inserting a thin layer of tin between the two.",
              "They analyzed the impacts \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 on cost of implementing that solution.",
              "They found that adding the tin separator increases energy-storage capacity and improves performance, which reduces the unit cost in dollars/kWh.",
              "But the cost of including the tin layer exceeds the savings so that the final cost is higher than the original cost.",
              "In another analysis, they looked at a sulfide electrolyte called LPSCl, which consists of lithium, phosphorus, and sulfur with a bit of added chlorine.",
              "In this case, the positive electrode incorporates particles of the electrolyte material \u2014 a method of ensuring that the lithium ions can find a pathway through the electrolyte to the other electrode.",
              "However, the added electrolyte particles are not compatible with other particles in the positive electrode \u2014 another interface problem.",
              "In this case, a standard solution is to add a \u201cbinder,\u201d another material that makes the particles stick together.",
              "Their analysis confirmed that without the binder, performance is poor, and the cost of the LPSCl-based battery is more than $500/kWh.",
              "Adding the binder improves performance significantly, and the cost drops by almost $300/kWh.",
              "In this case, the cost of adding the binder during manufacturing is so low that essentially all the of the cost decrease from adding the binder is realized.",
              "Here, the method implemented to solve the interface problem pays off in lower costs.",
              "The researchers performed similar studies of other promising solid-state batteries reported in the literature, and their results were consistent: The choice of battery materials and processes can affect not only near-term outcomes in the lab but also the feasibility and cost of manufacturing the proposed solid-state battery at the scale needed to meet future demand.",
              "The results also showed that considering all three factors together \u2014 availability, processing needs, and battery performance \u2014 is important because there may be collective effects and trade-offs involved.",
              "Olivetti is proud of the range of concerns the team\u2019s approach can probe.",

              "The BMS fetches real-time data on fundamental battery parameters like voltage, temperature, and current.",
              "With these metrics, BMS closely monitors important performance parameters like State of Charge (SoC), denoting the amount of charge remaining out of the EV battery\u2019s maximum capacity and State of Health (SoH), showing the overall status of battery pack health.",
              "SoC monitoring helps EV customers asses their disposable driving range and plan their charging station stops without worrying much about range anxiety.",

              "BMS includes a cell balancing process to make the energy cells perform uniformly.",
              "At a fully charged state, it equalizes the voltage and state of charge among the cells through two distinctive methods: active balancing \u2013 transferring energy from overcharged to undercharged and passive balancing \u2013 excess energy is discharged through dissipative bypass mechanisms. Hence, no one cell gets overcharged or under-charged.",
              "Cell balancing increases the efficiency and longevity of the battery pack in an electric vehicle.",

              "Introduction to Electric Vehicle Battery Systems",
              "Electric vehicle design is a complex concept.",
              "Here's a look at the heart of every EV: the battery.",
              "The fundamental piece of any electric vehicle (EV) is its battery.",
              "The battery must be designed to satisfy the requirements of the motor(s) and charging system that a vehicle utilizes.",
              "This includes physical constraints such as efficient packaging within the vehicle\u2019s body to maximize capacity.",
              "As the main contributor to weight in an EV, designers must also consider the battery's placement within a vehicle as they can affect power efficiency and vehicle handling characteristics (which is typically why you'll often see batteries placed under the floor pan of the vehicle).",
              "Here's an overview of some of the specifications, safety considerations, and management systems that go into EV battery design.",
              "An electric vehicle battery is often composed of many hundreds of small, individual cells arranged in a series/parallel configuration to achieve the desired voltage and capacity in the final pack.",
              "A common pack is composed of blocks of 18-30 parallel cells in series to achieve a desired voltage.",
              "For example, a 400V nominal pack will often have around 96 series blocks (as in the Tesla Model 3).",
              "Common nominal pack voltages in current vehicles range from 100V-200V for hybrid/plug-in hybrid vehicles and 400V to 800V and higher for electric-only vehicles.",
              "The reason for this is higher voltages allow more power to be transferred with less loss over the same diameter (and mass) of copper cable.",
              "The drawbacks of higher voltages include the necessity for higher-voltage-rated components in the entire system.",
              "They also prevent the ability to use DC fast-charging stations of a lower voltage without incorporating some type of DC-DC boost converter in the on-board charger.",
              "Common battery capacity ranges, on the other hand, are as follows: The battery represents multiple challenges for safety when it comes to design, as well as regarding the high voltages permanently present within them.",
              "Fuses are present inside the battery pack before the output connector, often on both the positive and negative side.",
              "Special high-current, sealed relays known as contactors connect the internal fuses to the battery, itself.",
              "Contactors incorporate features such as a sacrificial contacts to prevent increasing resistance due to contact pitting.",
              "They also often incorporate an auxiliary contact to detect internal welding which may occur if the contactor is intentionally or unintentionally opened while a large current is passing through it.",
              "The contactor coil power supply is usually passed through a HVIL or high-voltage interlock loop, which loops through all the high voltage components in the system alongside the high voltage cables (usually incorporated into each connector), such that the contactor cannot receive power to close unless all the high voltage connections are securely plugged in to the battery.",
              "A pre-charge contactor closes before the main contactors, to allow a small current to flow into the system through a large resistor.",
              "This limits the inrush current into all the large capacitors in the system and allows the battery management system to detect short circuits before the high-current path is completed.",
              "Isolation is continually monitored, usually on both sides of the main contactors, and a fault will occur if the isolation from either side of the high voltage system to the chassis drops to less than 500 ohms per volt.",
              "Tesla also incorporated a new safety device into their Model 3 and newer packs, known as a pyro fuse.",
              "This device can be blown open by a small pyrotechnic charge if the contactors become welded, which allows them to use less robust contactors.",
              "A discharge resistor and contactor are sometimes included across the output of the battery to allow the system to be actively discharged to a safe voltage after shutdown.",
              "The battery\u2019s blocks of cells need to be monitored and kept in balance and specialized circuit boards are included within the pack to perform this task.",
              "These boards must include an isolated communication interface, as each board\u2019s ground reference will be hundreds of volts different from each other and from the main BMS (battery management system).",
              "These boards monitor the voltage and temperature of each block as well as the temperature of the interconnects between blocks.",
              "They also contain small groups of resistors to carry out the task of balancing.",
              "The blocks of cells inside the pack must be kept within a few millivolts of each other to allow maximum power to be transferred in and out of the pack.",
              "Due to natural differences in the manufacturing of the cells, some blocks will charge or discharge slightly faster than others.",
              "To combat this, during charging, balancing is performed which drains a small amount of power from the highest voltage blocks to bring them close to the others.",
              "These block monitoring boards also provide an additional safety feature of the pack, which allows the temperature of the cells and interconnection points within the pack to be monitored very precisely.",
              "In cases of, say, damaged cells, this means that a fault can be raised before serious damage or even possibly a fire can occur.",
              "Finally, the Battery Management System, or BMS as it is commonly known, manages the task of monitoring and controlling all aspects of the battery pack.",
              "Current shunts report various pieces of information to the BMS, including the total charge transferred in and out of the pack.",
              "Voltage measurements before and after the contactors allow monitoring of the pack system voltages.",
              "Contactor control and economizer circuits manage the contactor closing and minimize static current through the coils after the contacts have pulled-in.",
              "The BMS is also in constant communication with the block management boards to monitor cell voltage and temperature and control balancing.",
              "Overall system and connector temperatures are monitored to detect any high resistance connections caused by loose connectors or bolts.",
              "System and pack isolation are also continuously monitored, and other potentially redundant safety features can be incorporated.",
              "The BMS also exposes a communication interface to the rest of the vehicle\u2014often over either automotive ethernet or CAN bus\u2014where it communicates with the inverter, charger, and other systems. It calculates and provides charge and discharge current limits, pack state-of-health and state-of-charge, and notifies other systems when the contactors must open so ideally they can open without a load present.",
              "This concludes our exploration into the heart of the electric vehicle, the battery pack.",

              "Although there are other options for cooling EV batteries than using a liquid, it is rapidly taking over from forced-air cooling, as energy and power densities increase.",
              "It is emerging as the dominant technology, particularly as the use of integrated thermal management systems for the whole vehicle become more common.",
              "Such systems incorporate heating as well as cooling, and move heat around to control the temperatures of many components as well as the battery and cabin.",
              "The use of heat pumps and the imminent adoption of immersion cooling demand even more sophistication and adaptability from them.",
              "The principal sources of heat in a battery pack are the cells, although the busbars that connect the cells and modules together can also get very hot.",
              "That heating is mainly ohmic in nature, resulting from resistance to the flow of current through the conductors.",
              "The cell tabs and connection points in the busbar system can therefore become hotspots.",
              "The electrochemical processes inside the cells also generate heat, although in normal operation it is a relatively small amount.",
              "In a thermal runaway, however, they can generate a lot more, and very quickly, and can also release volatile chemicals from the electrolyte along with oxygen.",
              "Rapid, reliable detection and a quick response from the cooling system are therefore essential.",
              "A typical cylindrical cell in the 21700 format, for example, has a power dissipation of around 5% when operating at low load, but can exceed that figure considerably at higher loads, according to an expert in battery and cooling systems. A 100 kWh battery pack could generate around 5 kW of heat, so only an efficient liquid-cooling system can remove that much from the cells quickly enough to keep them at a stable temperature in their optimum range, the expert says.",
              "Abnormal events such as thermal runaways are a major safety issue for high-energy battery packs, and several specialists stress that safety is the most critical consideration in the design of an EV battery cooling or thermal management system.",
              "In the view of one expert in thermal interface materials (TIMs), initially too little attention was paid to safety in the pursuit of headline grabbing performance, an approach that has contributed to some high profile accidents and incidents.",
              "Typically, battery liquid-cooling systems rely on the familiar water ethylene glycol (WEG) mixtures used in IC engined vehicles.",
              "There are alternatives, however, including dielectric fluids for immersion cooling and even fluids containing highly thermally conductive particulates developed for computer servers.",
              "What\u2019s more, integrated cooling systems tend to require the movement of heat between different working fluids, and of necessity incorporate heat pumps that reverse the natural hot-to-cold thermodynamic flow.",
              "Engineers must therefore make the right choices for every vehicle, in what is a field of growing complexity.",
              "The challenges faced in engineering these systems range from maximising the overall energy efficiency, cost effectiveness, responsiveness, robustness, reliability and ease of maintenance, to more detailed considerations such as the ability to make increasingly large cold plates.",
              "In integrated systems, it is also important to ensure there is enough capacity to keep occupants and the battery comfortable, for example.",
              "One expert in the design and manufacture of electrified powertrain components and systems points out that this can be a tough balancing act, explaining that if you simply took the peak requirement for every component in the system and added them together you would end up with an over specified and thus expensive system.",
              "With integrated systems, a further challenge is matching the different temperature requirements of different components, particularly if the battery needs heating while other components need cooling, for example.",
              "Lithium-ion batteries perform best and live longest when kept at a comfortable temperature of between 20 and 25 C, which is relatively straightforward in temperate climates but far more difficult in regions of the world that experience extremes of temperature.",
              "While a given climate is usually fairly predictable and therefore tends not to demand a rapid response from the cooling system, normal operations such as rapid charging and emergencies such as the onset of thermal runaway do require the system to provide powerful cooling very quickly.",
              "Not only must the cooling medium be able to remove heat from battery cells and the pack as a whole, the heat must be able to flow from the cells into the liquid as quickly as possible.",
              "That means the heat path must be as short as is practical, and demands intelligent use of the right TIMs.",
              "Batteries are not actually difficult to cool, one expert at a specialist cooling company says, because their heat density is generally low, although the cost of cold plates and supporting materials including TIMs is an important consideration.",
              "However, minimising temperature gradients inside cells \u2013 more of an issue for core battery technologies than the cooling systems themselves \u2013 makes it likely that how a cooling circuit is designed will become increasingly important.",
              "Furthermore, as the industry moves towards faster charging, even better temperature management will be needed.",
              "The charging rate has to be limited when batteries are too cold or too warm, and might have to be paused to let the battery cool if it heats up to 60 C or more.",
              "Our powertrain components and systems expert emphasises the challenge of maintaining consistent temperatures across the pack, rather than any particular temperature point, to eliminate hotspots and temperature gradients, and to do that in an energy efficient manner.",
              "He stresses the importance of not allowing the thermal management system to become an excessive consumer of power in the vehicle, and of balancing consistency and energy consumption against cost.",
              "Thermal inertia \u2013 how slowly the temperature of a battery pack approaches that of its surroundings \u2013 is a critical factor to bear in mind when developing a cooling system with the required responsiveness.",
              "That depends on factors such as its size, shape, absorptivity, specific heat and thermal conductivity.",
              "Although a modern battery management system will have a well placed set of temperature sensors and plenty of computing power to assess what is happening in the battery, thermal inertia sets the physical limits on which it has to work.",
              "Understanding the impact of thermal inertia, and developing designs that optimise it, is high on the list of challenges that engineers concerned with battery cooling in particular and EV thermal management more broadly must face.",
              "A simulation specialist who helped with the research for this article says a digital assessment of the problem is a valuable step to take before committing to building physical hardware.",
              "The proposed system must be modelled as accurately as possible in software, to give the confidence that the prototype systems will respond as expected when they begin real-world testing.",
              "A colleague of his adds that as development progresses, the hardware and its virtual surrogate become complementary, each helping to \u2018educate\u2019 the other.",
              "Eventually, it is likely that a virtual model will be good enough to act as the basis for a new battery and cooling system design.",
              "The colleague drew a parallel with the world of vehicle crash testing, where so-called zero-zero prototype testing has come to be accepted, because authorities are confident in engineers\u2019 ability to predict the behaviour of vehicle structures in crashes.",
              "He cautions, however, that battery thermal simulation involves a lot of complex multi-physics work before it reaches that stage.",
              "Before that level of confidence is reached, the first specialist notes, it is possible to change parameters in the virtual model and obtain good enough trend information to direct the development of hardware.",
              "Digging into responsiveness a little further, there are several determinants of how quickly a cooling system can react effectively to a change in battery temperature.",
              "Another company with extensive cooling system and EV expertise points to the size of the battery packs, the total amount of heat in the system and requirements for uniformity of heat and temperature distribution \u2013 factors that have to be balanced against others such as the cooling system\u2019s power consumption, cost, safety, reliability and service life.",
              "In liquid-cooling systems, the mass of the fluid in the reservoir will help keep the temperature stable thanks to its heat capacity, which provides some extra time for the system to respond.",
              "In systems that rely on cooling from the phase change in a refrigerant, the position of the expansion valve can also be an important contributor to a quick response, a specialist in this technology notes.",
              "The performance of coolant-flow control valves is also important to responsiveness, a specialist in electromagnetic solutions emphasises, and modern devices can easily meet the needs of EV thermal management systems in this respect.",
              "The technology enables response times as short as 200 ms, says the company \u2013 although opening in less than a second is normally adequate for EV coolant valves \u2013 while low hysteresis and a flat force/stroke curve contribute to accurate and repeatable control.",
              "This specialist\u2019s devices also use latching technology that allows the valves to hold position without needing a constant current, saving energy in battery-operated applications.",
              "With a typical operating voltage of 12-24 VDC and up to 2.",
              "5 A current draw, they permit flow rates up to 0.",
              "5 litres/second, coolant temperatures up to 110 C and circuit pressures up to 500 kPa.",
              "Our expert in battery and cooling system design says the heat capacity of the working fluid, and hydraulic parameters such as flow velocities, are very important.",
              "He adds that a homogeneous temperature distribution across all the battery modules and cells is a very demanding requirement that calls for intensive optimisation of the flow geometries, noting that his company strives to keep the temperature in each cooling channel of a system within 1 C of the target value.",
              "The heat capacity of the working fluid is one area in which liquid-cooling systems win out over those relying on air, our simulation specialist notes, with the speed of response coming from the greater capacity to absorb heat for a given mass flow rate.",
              "Another key factor in responsiveness, the powertrain specialist says, is the quality of the thermal interface.",
              "This determines how effectively the heat generating components can be coupled to the components in the system that carry the heat away.",
              "The TIM specialist emphasises that this is all about minimising thermal resistance through the right combination of the physical distance that the heat has to cross and the gap-filling material that eliminates air between the surfaces, air being an effective insulator.",
              "Gap-filling TIMs are rated by their thermal conductivity, which is a measure of how much power moves through a distance due to a temperature difference, and is often expressed in terms of Watts per metre per Kelvin (W/m-K).",
              "TIMs with a high thermal conductivity are expensive, so it is generally more cost-effective to choose a small gap with a filler of more modest conductivity if possible.",
              "For example, a 10 mm gap filled by a 10 W/m-K material would, all else being equal, have the same thermal resistance as a 1 mm gap filled by a 1 W/m-K material.",
              "Surface area is also important here, he adds, with larger areas providing more opportunity for the heat to spread out, lowering thermal resistance.",
              "While it is common to transfer cell heat to the bottom of the module using a gap-filling TIM, it can also be useful to provide a thermal connection to the module\u2019s sides, another TIM specialist says.",
              "That often means filling in large areas and thin gaps during manufacture, a challenge that has led the company to develop an ultra-low viscosity gap filler that it says \u201cflows like water\u201d, finding its own level and filling the entire space.",
              "The company describes the filler as a two-component system with a viscosity of less than 5.",
              "0 millipascal seconds (mPa.",
              "s), a thermal conductivity of 1.",
              "8 W/m-K and an electrical insulation rating of 15 kV/mm.",
              "Silicone-based, it remains soft to accommodate the vibration and thermal expansion of other components.",
              "Cell design also has a major impact on how quickly heat can get into and out of the pack, with cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cells all presenting different challenges.",
              "In principle, the larger the surface area of the cell in relation to its volume, the easier it is for heat to move in and out.",
              "As an illustration, a prismatic cell is a slim rectangular box, so it has eight times the surface area available for cooling as a cylindrical cell of comparable capacity, one of our experts explains.",
              "Other differences in cooling behaviour can be associated with cell performance, our first TIM specialist adds, as high-performance or high energy cells tend to generate less heat than others.",
              "However, the cooling system must react even more quickly to changes in their temperature to keep them within their optimum range.",
              "Packs consisting of modules with large numbers of small cylindrical cells, for example, are often cooled by fluid channels snaking between the rows of cells, with an inlet at one end of the module and an outlet at the other.",
              "That is not considered a good way of achieving even temperatures though, as the coolant picks up heat on the journey from one end of the cell to the other, creating an unwanted thermal gradient and presenting the risk of a short-circuit and a consequent thermal runaway in the event of a leak.",
              "That has led to some battery pack developers to use alternative arrangements of cylindrical cells in modules.",
              "One way is to secure them in carriers that hold them at the top and bottom, with air gaps between cells to reduce the risk of thermal runaway, along with a cooling plate underneath that is thermally coupled by a thin layer of TIM, which also provides extra electrical isolation.",
              "In designing an EV cooling system, whether it is to be dedicated to the batteries or serve as part of a whole vehicle thermal management system, characterising the cells to be used is one of the most critical considerations, our first expert emphasises.",
              "This involves a large set of measurements, detailed electrochemical analyses and intensive laboratory testing under conditions that closely match the intended use-cases.",
              "This expert notes that while each battery and its cooling system is designed to meet the requirements of the intended application, requirements drawn up by customers are often incomplete and must be supplemented with the design team\u2019s experience.",
              "With so many design criteria, multiple standards and use-cases, a great deal of care is needed at the design stage, particularly when matching the safety concept to the intended application and operating conditions.",
              "A battery pack and thermal management system developer we consulted emphasises that focusing on cooling (and heating) the battery alone is not the most efficient solution overall.",
              "The company has therefore integrated battery cooling and heating into its overall vehicle thermal management system, incorporating heat pump (HP) and refrigerant technology in a primary loop, and a secondary WEG loop for the battery and other vehicle systems. As a HP can move heat from hot areas to cooler ones, and vice versa, for less expenditure of energy than say \u2018brute force\u2019 electric resistive heating, they are useful for saving energy overall.",
              "However, resistive heaters still have to be integrated for use in very low temperatures.",
              "The above developer makes an HP based unit that can operate as a self contained battery thermal management module or as part of a vehicle-wide system.",
              "Consisting of a compressor, refrigerant, valving, a plate-type heat exchanger and control logic, the unit exerts full and continuous control over the compressor and the proportional electronic expansion valves.",
              "In this way, it regulates the mass flow of the refrigerant passing through the plate heat exchanger, through the other circuit of which flows the WEG mixture that regulates the temperature of the battery and, in an integrated system, other vehicle subsystems. This secondary loop, the developer says, is coolant-agnostic and can easily be adapted to dielectric fluids, for example.",
              "It can also be connected to a separate valve block that allows fluid flow to be directed to individual battery packs and other components, enabling the system to prioritise any component that needs cooling or heating.",
              "A senior engineer from this developer says the term \u2018battery thermal management system\u2019 means different things to different people, even when referring to active systems. For example, such a system could feed water chilled to a set temperature, such as 15 C, with a constant flow rate into a battery pack.",
              "A basic system like that might be relatively cheap to make, he says, but it would use a lot of energy and would not control the battery\u2019s temperature very accurately, resulting in a shortened service life.",
              "It would also miss the opportunity to use waste heat from the battery elsewhere to offset the vehicle\u2019s overall energy consumption.",
              "The engineer comments that although today\u2019s EV fleets are not large enough to put stress on electricity grids, at some point energy efficiency standards for EVs will become essential.",
              "When it comes to selecting liquid coolants themselves, several factors must be taken into account.",
              "Technically, the most important properties are the lowest feasible electrical conductivity, and low and stable viscosity behaviour in all temperature ranges.",
              "Environmental compatibility is another key consideration, measures of which include the Global Warming Potential, CO2 balance and physiological safety in the event of an accident.",
              "Inevitably, the cost must also be low enough to allow competitive systems to be developed.",
              "One specialist we consulted says his company specifies and evaluates about two dozen properties for the coolants it recommends for its systems. WEG remains the dominant coolant, because of the excellent heat transfer properties of water, and because it is cheap, easy to pump and ubiquitous.",
              "It is made from a mixture of distilled or de-ionised water (which is the actual coolant) and ethylene glycol to lower its freezing point and raise its boiling point, with additives to inhibit corrosion.",
              "Ethylene glycol is toxic, however, and industry is increasingly offering alternatives based on propylene glycol, which is already deemed safe for use in the food industry.",
              "While battery and cooling system developers endeavour to make their products agnostic as regards fluids, this is complicated by the additives used in both WEG and propylene glycol-based coolants.",
              "These additives are the main differences used to define coolant products, including inorganic acid technology, organic acid technology and hybrid organic acid technology types.",
              "As these fluids were developed for IC engines, it is natural to consider whether there are better alternatives for EVs.",
              "One important direction here is the use of fluids that do not conduct electricity and can therefore be used in direct contact with cells, transferring heat from and to the cell over its entire outer surface area.",
              "One major category of such dielectric fluids is silicone oils.",
              "Long-established in cooling high-voltage transformers in domestic and industrial power distribution grids, they have also been adopted as immersion cooling fluids to transfer heat away from electronic components in data centres, and have been investigated for EV battery cooling.",
              "Our EV powertrain specialist says his company has been involved in extensive investigations into the use of silicone oils, reporting though that their generally high viscosity makes them much harder to pump around a cooling circuit than a conventional fluid such as a WEG mixture.",
              "A cooling system using it would therefore probably need more power, all other things being equal.",
              "Some of them can also exhibit unusual fluidic behaviours, he adds.",
              "For example, one that the company tested turned out to have non-Newtonian properties, causing it to behave rather like British custard, thickening in response to a pumping force.",
              "Such issues are likely to have contributed to uncertainty surrounding the future of immersion cooling.",
              "One niche chemicals company tells us that while battery manufacturers\u2019 enthusiasm for it has waxed and waned over the past five years or so, it believes it will be widely adopted soon.",
              "Another group of materials that make good bases for dielectric cooling fluids are esters.",
              "A spokesperson for a supplier of esters used as additives and base oils by major lubricant formulators says they can be engineered for low viscosities to ease pumping, along with high flash points that make them less volatile and therefore safer than alternative synthetic base oils such as polyalphaolefi ns (PAO) and Group III oils.",
              "Esters can also offer high thermal conductivity, higher than PAO2, PAO4 and Group III oils.",
              "Contrary to a widespread misconception, esters also offer good stability, with higher breakdown voltages and longer oxidation induction times than hydrocarbon-based oils, the spokesperson says.",
              "The company used an ester based fluid in a recent comparison of alternative dielectric fluids and cold-plate and immersion cooling, which involved simulations, CFD analyses and hardware models of battery modules composed of cylindrical cells.",
              "The combination of ester-based fluid and immersion cooling exhibited more efficient heat transfer, with fewer hotspots and more stable characteristics.",
              "The company is about to launch a new fluid that it regards as a first generation product, as a market tester to elicit feedback from industry in what the spokesperson hopes will generate fruitful conversations between chemists and battery engineers.",
              "Some of the more exotic fluids used in cooling high-end computer systems such as servers are beginning to incorporate particulate matter such as graphene to improve their heat transfer properties.",
              "One expert with experience in this area says that, as well as the properties of the material, particle shape, size and the way they contact each other are important determinants of how much heat transfer capability they add to the fluid.",
              "These factors also influence the wear that such particles might cause to pumps and valves in the system, for example, which is potentially a big issue in vehicles intended for long service lives with a minimum of maintenance.",
              "High on the list of important criteria for any new or improved working fluid is worldwide availability in mass-production quantities at low cost, which the EV and battery industries can only achieve through partnerships with large companies in the chemicals industry, our expert in battery and cooling system design says.",
              "In terms of technical properties, homogeneous viscosity, higher thermal conductivity and good processability for production will continue to be the strategic development directions, he adds.",
              "Increased adoption of immersion cooling and more diverse and advanced heat transfer fluids will make life more complex for cooling and thermal management providers who need to engineer their systems to be as agnostic as possible when it comes to fluids.",
              "The developer we consulted has worked to get ahead of the curve here.",
              "They say they have focused on material compatibility and adaptable control parameters that enable its new system to accommodate the different heat transfer capacities and fl ow characteristics of various fluids in the secondary cooling loop, which can be both cooled and heated by the HPbased primary loop.",
              "The company has taken a similarly flexible approach to this primary loop with its self-contained compressor and plate heat exchanger module.",
              "As the components for this module are sourced from the market rather than developed in-house, it is fairly straightforward to replace it with a system that uses a different refrigerant without disturbing the secondary loop.",
              "A further benefit of this approach, his colleague says, is that it minimises the quantity of refrigerant in the vehicle and therefore the potential for leakage, which is very significant in large Looking further ahead, the EV battery industry will have to come to grips with new cell technologies with different chemical compositions, including those with solid electrolytes.",
              "These, says our expert in battery and cooling system design, will require extended thermal management because of higher operating temperatures, while other future concepts such as cells with super-porous separators will need even faster responses from cooling systems. Advanced phase-change materials, particularly those that absorb energy in solid-to-liquid changes, are likely to be needed to cope with extreme conditions.",
              "However, others that use mechanisms such as ablation or becoming volatile can absorb even more heat energy and are therefore good candidates for slowing thermal runaways, enabling the main cooling system to mitigate the risk of runaway propagation from cell to cell.",
              "It is clear that the evolution of thermal management for EVs in general and battery cooling in particular is accelerating.",

              "an indirect liquid cooling system has the lowest maximum temperature rise;",
              "and a fin cooling system adds about 40% extra weight of cell, which weighs most when the four kinds cooling methods have the same volume.",
              "Indirect liquid cooling is a more practical form than direct liquid cooling, though it has slightly lower cooling performance.",
              "(Comparison of different cooling methods for lithium-ion battery cells) Each of these proposed systems can be designed to achieve the correct temperature range and uniformity.",
              "Energy efficiency is more difficult to achieve, as the cooling effects need to be greater than the heat generated when powering the cooling system.",
              "Also, a system with too much additional weight will drain energy from the car as it outputs power.",
              "Phase change material, fan cooling and air cooling all fail at the energy efficiency and size and weight requirements, though they may be just as easy to implement and maintain as liquid cooling.",
              "Liquid cooling is the only remaining option that does not consume too much parasitic power, delivers cooling requirements, and fits compactly and easily into the battery pack.",
              "Tesla, BMW i-3 and i-8, Chevy Volt, Ford Focus, Jaguar i-Pace, and LG Chem\u2019s lithium-ion batteries all use some form of liquid cooling system.",
              "Since electric vehicles are still a relatively new technology, there have been problems maintaining temperature range and uniformity in extreme temperatures even when using a liquid cooling system.",
              "These are likely due to manufacturing problems, and as companies gain experience developing these systems, the thermal management issues should be resolved.",
              "Direct cooling systems place the battery cells in direct contact with the coolant liquid.",
              "These thermal management schemes are currently in the research and development stage, with no cars on the market using this system.",
              "Direct cooling is more difficult to achieve, due to the fact that a new type of coolant is required.",
              "Because the battery is in contact with the liquid, the coolant needs to have low to no conductivity.",
              "Indirect cooling systems are similar to ICE cooling systems in that both circulate liquid coolant through a series of metal pipes.",
              "However, the construction of the cooling system will look much different in electric vehicles.",
              "The structure of the cooling system that achieves maximum temperature uniformity is dependent on the shape of the battery pack and will look different for each car manufacturer.",
              "Given that liquid cooling is the most efficient and practical method of cooling battery packs \u2014 and currently the most widely used \u2014 attention needs to be given to the type of coolant used in these systems. The indirect liquid cooling systems for electric vehicles and the conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) cooling system are very similar: both circulate coolant throughout a series of metal pipes to transfer heat away from the battery pack or engine.",
              "Therefore, coolant requirements for indirect liquid cooling systems will be very similar to traditional ICE coolants.",
              "99% of the coolant is made up of a commodity such as glycol or polyglycol, and water, but the 1% additive package is what separates good from great engine protection and performance.",
              "When circulating a liquid coolant throughout metal piping, it is important to protect against corrosion to protect vehicle safety and performance.",
              "Metal is very unstable, so it naturally wants to react with other elements by losing electrons to move to a more stable state.",
              "Corrosion happens because impurities in the coolant liquid have a positive charge on them, so they interact with the metal pipes and strip away some of the surface.",
              "Additive packages can be blended with antifreeze to form a coolant that protects against rust, scale and corrosion.",
              "The additive packages used in ICE vehicles contain corrosion inhibitors to protect the many types of metals found in cooling systems, such as pipes, gaskets, connections, radiator, etc.",
              "The American Society for Testing and Materials maintains standards that coolants must meet for protection against the corrosion of different metal types.",
              "What is currently known about corrosion prevention in internal combustion engine cooling systems can be easily applied to the indirect liquid cooling system in electric vehicles.",
              "There are different coolant requirements for direct liquid cooling systems. In systems where the battery will be directly exposed to the coolant, such as with fuel cell vehicles or direct liquid cooling, the coolant needs to be a low to no electrical conductivity fluid.",
              "This is going to be very different from conventional ICE coolants that have a high electrical conductivity.",
              "The reason for needing low/no electrical conductivity is due to safety: electrons are flowing throughout the battery, and if they are exposed to a high conductivity fluid, this could lead to failure and, potentially, fire and/or explosion.",
              "Some examples of ways to keep coolant conductivity low are using deionized water as a medium for the fluid or having a non-salt-based fluid medium.",
              "These low- and no-conductivity coolants are in the relatively early stages of research and development.",
              "As the electric vehicle grows, there is and will continue to be high demand for longer battery life and higher power output.",
              "To achieve this, battery thermal management systems will need to be able to transfer heat away from the battery pack as they are charged and discharged at higher rates.",
              "The heat generated as the battery is used can pose safety threats to passengers.",
              "Due to the high stress and temperatures generated by the batteries, there is even higher importance on having the correct coolant and additive package.",
              "While companies such as Tesla, BMW, and LG Chem can use a traditional liquid coolant for their indirect cooling systems, continued research and development will need to be done on battery packs and coolants to advance electric vehicle safety.",
              "Low-conductivity coolants have changed the game when it comes to Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV).",

              "Second, it typically takes over a decade from the discovery of undiscovered deposits to the extraction of the first ore, and such a time lag makes it difficult to address the global and regional demand\u2013supply imbalance in the short- to medium-term.",
              "Third, 94% of cobalt production is accompanied by copper or nickel ores as byproducts53, so cobalt is closely related to the production and price fluctuations of these two metals.",
              "Fourth, given by the massive extraction of specific cobalt deposits, the decreasing ore grade of cobalt is inevitable, which would increase cobalt production costs (economically, socially, and environmentally) and affect cobalt production to some extent.",
              "Last but not least, the cobalt primary supply faces various types of geopolitical (e.",

              "China is expected to consume much more cobalt than any other region in the future, primarily due to its enormously booming domestic EV market and expanding battery production capacity in the future.",
              "In 2019, China\u2019s cobalt reserve was only 80 kt, but it contributed to 67% of the global cobalt refinery production55, which resulted in its strong dependence on overseas primary cobalt resources.",

              "Tellep Distinguished Professor of Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, suggest three broad questions that can help identify potential constraints on future scale-up as a result of materials selection.",
              "First, with this battery design, could materials availability, supply chains, or price volatility become a problem as production scales up?",
              "(Note that the environmental and other concerns raised by expanded mining are outside the scope of this study.)",
              "Second, will fabricating batteries from these materials involve difficult manufacturing steps during which parts are likely to fail?",
              "And third, do manufacturing measures needed to ensure a high-performance product based on these materials ultimately lower or raise the cost of the batteries produced?",
              "To demonstrate their approach, Olivetti, Ceder, and Huang examined some of the electrolyte chemistries and battery structures now being investigated by researchers.",
              "To select their examples, they turned to previous work in which they and their collaborators used text- and data-mining techniques to gather information on materials and processing details reported in the literature.",
              "From that database, they selected a few frequently reported options that represent a range of possibilities.",
              "Materials and availability In the world of solid inorganic electrolytes, there are two main classes of materials \u2014 the oxides, which contain oxygen, and the sulfides, which contain sulfur.",
              "Olivetti, Ceder, and Huang focused on one promising electrolyte option in each class and examined key elements of concern for each of them.",
              "The sulfide they considered was LGPS, which combines lithium, germanium, phosphorus, and sulfur.",
              "Based on availability considerations, they focused on the germanium, an element that raises concerns in part because it\u2019s not generally mined on its own.",
              "Instead, it\u2019s a byproduct produced during the mining of coal and zinc.",
              "To investigate its availability, the researchers looked at how much germanium was produced annually in the past six decades during coal and zinc mining and then at how much could have been produced.",
              "The outcome suggested that 100 times more germanium could have been produced, even in recent years.",
              "Given that supply potential, the availability of germanium is not likely to constrain the scale-up of a solid-state battery based on an LGPS electrolyte.",
              "The situation looked less promising with the researchers\u2019 selected oxide, LLZO, which consists of lithium, lanthanum, zirconium, and oxygen.",
              "Extraction and processing of lanthanum are largely concentrated in China, and there\u2019s limited data available, so the researchers didn\u2019t try to analyze its availability.",
              "The other three elements are abundantly available.",
              "However, in practice, a small quantity of another element \u2014 called a dopant \u2014 must be added to make LLZO easy to process.",
              "So the team focused on tantalum, the most frequently used dopant, as the main element of concern for LLZO.",
              "Tantalum is produced as a byproduct of tin and niobium mining.",
              "Historical data show that the amount of tantalum produced during tin and niobium mining was much closer to the potential maximum than was the case with germanium.",
              "So the availability of tantalum is more of a concern for the possible scale-up of an LLZO-based battery.",
              "But knowing the availability of an element in the ground doesn\u2019t address the steps required to get it to a manufacturer.",
              "So the researchers investigated a follow-on question concerning the supply chains for critical elements \u2014 mining, processing, refining, shipping, and so on.",
              "Assuming that abundant supplies are available, can the supply chains that deliver those materials expand quickly enough to meet the growing demand for batteries?",
              "In sample analyses, they looked at how much supply chains for germanium and tantalum would need to grow year to year to provide batteries for a projected fleet of electric vehicles in 2030.",
              "As an example, an electric vehicle fleet often cited as a goal for 2030 would require production of enough batteries to deliver a total of 100 gigawatt hours of energy.",
              "To meet that goal using just LGPS batteries, the supply chain for germanium would need to grow by 50 percent from year to year \u2014 a stretch, since the maximum growth rate in the past has been about 7 percent.",
              "Using just LLZO batteries, the supply chain for tantalum would need to grow by about 30 percent \u2014 a growth rate well above the historical high of about 10 percent.",
              "Those examples demonstrate the importance of considering both materials availability and supply chains when evaluating different solid electrolytes for their scale-up potential.",
              "\u201cEven when the quantity of a material available isn\u2019t a concern, as is the case with germanium, scaling all the steps in the supply chain to match the future production of electric vehicles may require a growth rate that\u2019s literally unprecedented,\u201d says Huang.",
              "Materials and processing In assessing the potential for scale-up of a battery design, another factor to consider is the difficulty of the manufacturing process and how it may impact cost.",
              "Fabricating a solid-state battery inevitably involves many steps, and a failure at any step raises the cost of each battery successfully produced.",
              "As Huang explains, \u201cYou\u2019re not shipping those failed batteries;",
              "you\u2019re throwing them away.",
              "But you\u2019ve still spent money on the materials and time and processing.",
              "\u201d As a proxy for manufacturing difficulty, Olivetti, Ceder, and Huang explored the impact of failure rate on overall cost for selected solid-state battery designs in their database.",
              "In one example, they focused on the oxide LLZO.",
              "LLZO is extremely brittle, and at the high temperatures involved in manufacturing, a large sheet that\u2019s thin enough to use in a high-performance solid-state battery is likely to crack or warp.",
              "To determine the impact of such failures on cost, they modeled four key processing steps in assembling LLZO-based batteries.",
              "At each step, they calculated cost based on an assumed yield \u2014 that is, the fraction of total units that were successfully processed without failing.",
              "With the LLZO, the yield was far lower than with the other designs they examined;",
              "and, as the yield went down, the cost of each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of battery energy went up significantly.",
              "For example, when 5 percent more units failed during the final cathode heating step, cost increased by about $30/kWh \u2014 a nontrivial change considering that a commonly accepted target cost for such batteries is $100/kWh.",
              "Clearly, manufacturing difficulties can have a profound impact on the viability of a design for large-scale adoption.",
              "Materials and performance One of the main challenges in designing an all-solid battery comes from \u201cinterfaces\u201d \u2014 that is, where one component meets another.",
              "During manufacturing or operation, materials at those interfaces can become unstable.",
              "\u201cAtoms start going places that they shouldn\u2019t, and battery performance declines,\u201d says Huang.",
              "As a result, much research is devoted to coming up with methods of stabilizing interfaces in different battery designs.",
              "Many of the methods proposed do increase performance;",
              "and as a result, the cost of the battery in dollars per kWh goes down.",
              "But implementing such solutions generally involves added materials and time, increasing the cost per kWh during large-scale manufacturing.",
              "To illustrate that trade-off, the researchers first examined their oxide, LLZO.",
              "Here, the goal is to stabilize the interface between the LLZO electrolyte and the negative electrode by inserting a thin layer of tin between the two.",
              "They analyzed the impacts \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 on cost of implementing that solution.",
              "They found that adding the tin separator increases energy-storage capacity and improves performance, which reduces the unit cost in dollars/kWh.",
              "But the cost of including the tin layer exceeds the savings so that the final cost is higher than the original cost.",
              "In another analysis, they looked at a sulfide electrolyte called LPSCl, which consists of lithium, phosphorus, and sulfur with a bit of added chlorine.",
              "In this case, the positive electrode incorporates particles of the electrolyte material \u2014 a method of ensuring that the lithium ions can find a pathway through the electrolyte to the other electrode.",
              "However, the added electrolyte particles are not compatible with other particles in the positive electrode \u2014 another interface problem.",
              "In this case, a standard solution is to add a \u201cbinder,\u201d another material that makes the particles stick together.",
              "Their analysis confirmed that without the binder, performance is poor, and the cost of the LPSCl-based battery is more than $500/kWh.",
              "Adding the binder improves performance significantly, and the cost drops by almost $300/kWh.",
              "In this case, the cost of adding the binder during manufacturing is so low that essentially all the of the cost decrease from adding the binder is realized.",
              "Here, the method implemented to solve the interface problem pays off in lower costs.",
              "The researchers performed similar studies of other promising solid-state batteries reported in the literature, and their results were consistent: The choice of battery materials and processes can affect not only near-term outcomes in the lab but also the feasibility and cost of manufacturing the proposed solid-state battery at the scale needed to meet future demand.",
              "The results also showed that considering all three factors together \u2014 availability, processing needs, and battery performance \u2014 is important because there may be collective effects and trade-offs involved.",
              "Olivetti is proud of the range of concerns the team\u2019s approach can probe.",
              "But she stresses that it\u2019s not meant to replace traditional metrics used to guide materials and processing choices in the lab.",
              "\u201cInstead, it\u2019s meant to complement those metrics by also looking broadly at the sorts of things that could get in the way of scaling\u201d \u2014 an important consideration given what Huang calls \u201cthe urgent ticking clock\u201d of clean energy and climate change.",

              "Producing lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles is more material-intensive than producing traditional combustion engines, and the demand for battery materials is rising, explains Yang Shao-Horn, JR East Professor of Engineering in the MIT Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering.",

              "If electric vehicles had a shorter lifespan than gas cars, that would hurt their numbers because they would have fewer low-emissions miles on the road to make up for the carbon-intensive manufacture of their batteries.",
              "Yet when the MIT study calculated a comparison in which EVs lasted only 90,000 miles on the road rather than 180,000 miles, they remained 15 percent better than a hybrid and far better than a gas car.",

              "Electric vehicle adoption continues to increase, and if left unmanaged, EV charging loads can result in increased distribution costs, as well as forcing utilities to replace existing infrastructure ahead of planned cycles.",
              "However, if EV charging is managed properly, that additional load can be an asset to the utility by shifting it to align with overgeneration or renewable energy to maximize profitability and efficiency.",
              "When it comes to defining the value of additional load from EVs, it should be broken down into two components: the benefits from understanding and managing electric vehicle charging load, and the risks from not managing charging load.",

              "The \u201c2020 Deloitte Global Automotive Consumer Study\u201d mentions that even though drivers only drove 27 miles (45 km) on average per day, over 60% said they would like their fully-electric vehicle to have a minimum range of 200 to 400 miles (320 to 640 km).",
              "Range anxiety may be a matter of drivers commonly over-estimating daily driving distance.",
              "That being said, there are practical reasons why potential electric vehicle drivers should be concerned about range.",
              "Drivers may not have access to dedicated charging infrastructure either at work or at home, as in apartments or condominiums. As well, they may use their EV for weekend or long-distance trips, either for work or personal life.",

              "Despite states and the federal government amplifying efforts to incentivize the use of renewable energies, these incentives occur at purchase or installation and come in the form of a rebate or tax credit, oftentimes not much more than $7,500.",
              "Utility prices, consequently, are not affected by such policies, which makes charging more expensive and has long served as a disincentive for the use of EVs.",
              "However, with credits, rebates, and off-peak, time-of-use rates increasingly common, utilities have taken it upon themselves to ease this burden and propel the rise of EVs in their coverage zones.",
