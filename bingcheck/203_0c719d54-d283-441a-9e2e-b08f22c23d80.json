    "query": "Can you explain the history and cultural significance of traditional Chinese medicine, and how does it differ from Western medicine in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness?",
    "response": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a system of medicine that has a history of at least **23 centuries**[^2^] and is based on the ancient philosophy of yin and yang, the balance of complementary forces in the universe and the human body[^2^] [^5^]. TCM aims to prevent or heal disease by maintaining or restoring this balance through various psychological and/or physical approaches, such as acupuncture, tai chi, moxibustion, cupping, and herbal products[^2^] [^5^].\n\nTCM has a significant cultural significance in China and other parts of Asia, as it reflects the worldview and values of the people who practice it[^6^]. TCM is a practical medicine built on experience and observation, rather than emphasizing consistency with contemporary science and technology[^6^]. TCM also has a holistic view of the human body and its relationship with the environment, which is expressed by the theory of the \u201ccorrespondence between man and universe\u201d[^6^]. TCM practitioners use the method of \u201csyndrome differentiation\u201d to diagnose and treat patients according to their individual constitution, symptoms, and environmental factors[^6^].\n\nTCM differs from Western medicine in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness in several ways. For example:\n\n- TCM diagnosis relies on the examination of the pulse, tongue, complexion, voice, and other signs of the body's qi (vital energy) flow[^2^] [^5^], while Western medicine diagnosis relies on laboratory tests, imaging studies, and physical examinations.\n- TCM treatment aims to regulate the qi flow and restore the harmony of yin and yang in the body by using natural means such as needles, herbs, or physical exercises[^2^] [^5^], while Western medicine treatment aims to eliminate pathogens or correct abnormalities by using drugs, surgery, or radiation.\n- TCM prevention focuses on enhancing the body's immunity and resistance to disease by cultivating a healthy lifestyle, diet, and mental state[^2^] [^5^], while Western medicine prevention focuses on reducing the risk factors and exposure to disease by using vaccines, screening tests, or prophylactic drugs.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the history and cultural significance of traditional Chinese medicine, and how it differs from Western medicine in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "It included \u201cnurturing life\u201d (yang sheng \u990a\u751f), a broad category that comprised a wide range of self-cultivation techniques.",
              "In later periods, medicine also included materia medica (bencao \u672c\u8349) and internal (nei dan \u5167\u4e39) and external (wai dan \u5916\u4e39) alchemy.",
              "The early Chinese qualitative and quantitative sciences were specific, with no unified notion of science (Sivin 1982 and 1990).",
              "Secondly, medical works, like other scientific works, were classified as technical specialties, distinct from generalist works, including the \u201cMasters\u201d texts associated with Chinese philosophy (Raphals 2008\u20132009, forthcoming).",
              "Medicine and its related disciplines appear in the last section of the Bibliographic Treatise (chapter 30) of the Standard History of the Han Dynasty (Han shu).",
              "This Treatise consists of six sections.",
              "The first two (\u201cSix Classics\u201d and \u201cMasters\u201d) contain philosophical works.",
              "The last two are technical: \u201cNumbers and Techniques\u201d (Shu shu \u6578\u8853), and \u201cRecipes and Methods\u201d (Fang ji \u65b9\u6280).",
              "The latter includes works on medicine and longevity, including the categories of medical classics (yi jing \u91ab\u7d93), classical recipes (jing fang \u7d93\u65b9), sexual arts (fang zhong \u623f\u4e2d, also referred to as \u201carts of the bedchamber\u201d), and immortality practices (shen xian \u795e\u4ed9).",
              "These chapters reflect the concerns and expertise of the technical and ritual specialists closely associated with the \u201cRecipe Masters\u201d (fang shi \u65b9\u58eb) associated with the Han court.",
              "But their concerns also appear in early philosophical texts to such an extent that any separation of their philosophical from their religious and technical content is arbitrary and artificial (Harper 1998 and 1999;",
              "Kalinowski 2004).",
              "Nonetheless, Chinese philosophy and Chinese medicine shared important intellectual contexts in their early development.",
              "The origins of science in China seem to lie in an amalgam of ideas from both philosophers and technical specialists, including physicians.",
              "According to Sivin (1988 and 1990) the basic Chinese sciences were established some time between the first century BCE and the first century CE through what he describes as a combination of Ru (\u201cConfucian\u201d) ideas and ideas from technical specialists, especially experts in yin-yang, Five Agents (wu xing) \u4e94\u884c, henceforward wuxing and technical expertise traditions associated with \u201cNumbers and Techniques\u201d (Shu shu) and \u201cRecipes and Methods\u201d (Fang ji, mentioned above).",
              "Key to this amalgam were several concepts shared by both groups but deployed in very different ways.",
              "Early medical \u2013 and cosmological \u2013 thinking depicts a cosmos ultimately composed of qi \u6c23 (the energy that constitutes and organizes matter and causes growth and change) in processes of constant change, based on the interactions of yin and yang \u9670\u967d and the \u201cFive Agents\u201d or \u201cFive Powers\u201d (wuxing.",
              "See Graham 1986, Raphals 1998 and 2013).",
              "Philosophers deployed these ideas in (1) the yin-yang cosmology of the Book of Changes or Yi jing, (2) theories of correlative correspondence between heaven, earth and humanity as a shared representation of cosmic order, and (3) the idea of a \u201cclassic\u201d or \u201ccanon\u201d as the founding text of a textual lineage.",
              "The authors of the first medical classic, the Yellow Emperor\u2019s Classic of Internal Medicine (Huang Di neijing), also deployed these concepts, in particular in models of the human body as a yin-yang and Five Agent microcosm of the cosmos.",
              "Finally, physicians and philosophers created textual lineages and accounts of textual authority.",
              "The most important medical works of this kind are the Yellow Emperor\u2019s Classic of Internal Medicine and the Materia Medica of Shen Nong (Shen Nong bencao), ascribed to the \u201cDivine Husbandmen\u201d Shen Nong, who, according to legend, tested hundred of herbs and plants to ascertain their curative properties.",
              "By contrast, the evidence of recently excavated texts indicates that the Huang Di neijing derived from prior textual traditions that were subsequently lost (Harper 1998) and that the extant version is a composite of several earlier texts (Keegan 1988, Unschuld 2003, Unschuld and Tessenow 2011, Yamada 1979).",

              "They must also make a systematic study of wisdom and virtue, and only then can we protect our persons.",
              "He next identifies the combination of inherent aptitude and systematic study behind \u201dbeing intelligent and wise and protecting one\u2019s own person\u201c with what the recluse-hermits of antiquity called \u201dthe dao of nurturing life (yang sheng zhi dao \u990a\u751f\u4e4b\u9053).",
              "In his view, the nurturing life (yang sheng) practices of antiquity are what we now call philosophy.",

              "However, for people who do not use understanding and wisdom to protect their persons, the way of nurturing life was not sufficient, and they themselves could not help falling ill: \u201ctherefore they promulgated the principles of philosophy and originated the disciplines of medicine and pharmacology (materia medica) in order to offer assistance to those who themselves were unable to engage in nurturing life practices.",
              "\u201d He then goes on to identify specific physicians with this derivation of medicine from philosophy, including Ge Hong, Tao Hongjing and Sun Simiao.",
              "All these great physicians, he argues, were really philosophers who wrote important philosophical works.",
              "He then turns to the Huang Di neijing, which begins with a chapter titled \u201cDiscourse on the True [Qi Endowed by] Heaven in High Antiquity\u201d (Shang Gu Tian Zhen Lun).",
              "It says: \u201cIn highest antiquity there were true men (zhen ren) who upheld [the patterns of] heaven and earth and grasped yin and yang, exhaled and inhaled essence qi (jing qi), stood alone and guarded their spirit (shen), and their muscles and flesh were like one, and thus they were able to achieve longevity in correspondence with heaven and earth\u201d (Huang Di neijing 1, trans.",
              "after Unschuld 2011, 42).",
              "Zhang argues that, according to the neijing, these realized persons were able to use these techniques to transform their temperament and disposition and to achieved achieve an infinite life expectancy.",
              "He thus identifies a clear link from the realized persons of high antiquity to the great schools of Chinese philosophy through the methods and theories attributed to the Yellow Emperor.",
              "His point is that, although the neijing is an exposition of medicine: \u201cit necessarily begins with philosophy and takes philosophy as the study of how to safeguard one\u2019s person.",
              "People must first be able themselves to protect their own persons;",
              "only then can they represent to others how to protect their persons.",
              "Taking philosophy as the way to protect one\u2019s person, it is by means of the principles of philosophy that we are able to preserve our bodies by transforming our qi.",
              "Taking medicine is the way to protect other people\u2019s bodies, it is by first completely understanding the transformation of qi in one\u2019s own person that [the physician] is able to represent to others how to adjust the transformation of qi in their own bodies.",
              "\u201d He concludes: \u201cfrom this we understand that philosophy is the true source of medicine, or rather that medicine is the natural outcome of philosophy.",
              "This is why the Neijing states explicitly that the study of medicine must start from philosophy.",
              "\u201d How, he concludes, could philosophy obstruct medicine?",
              "(Zhang Xichun 1918\u20131934, 296\u201398).",
              "In conclusion, this brief account addresses important issues in the connections between Chinese philosophy and the development of Chinese medicine.",
              "Philosophical texts clearly influenced medicine in several ways.",
              "First, both are grounded in theories of qi, yin-yang and wuxing and microcosm-macrocosm analogies based on them.",
              "However, as in the case of science more generally, philosophical textualists emerged as a distinct social group from the fang shi, especially.",
              "Nonetheless, we can trace philosophical concerns in several areas of medical interest, especially the ongoing history of \u201cnurturing life\u201d (yang sheng) practices, first described in philosophical texts but elaborated in great and practical detail by physicians and alchemists such as Ge Hong, Tao Hongjing and Sun Simiao.",
              "This linkage is made explicit by one of the greatest of China\u2019s twentieth-century physicians and medical reformers, Zhang Xichun, who unequivocally describes philosophy as the basis of medicine.",

              "229 patents from TCM R&D agencies were authorized from local, ministerial and provincial levels.",
              "[20] Firstly, the number of TCM health agencies has increased steadily since 2010 including TCM hospitals, TCM & western medicine combined hospitals and ethnic hospitals which nearly reaching 60 hundred.",
              "However, the percentage it occupied in the total number of health agencies of national healthcare system is only around 6% (6000 over 1 million).",
              "Similarly, the number of TCM related professionals was almost doubled in 2017 (663,557) compared with that in 2010 (404,372), but its percentage in the number of medical professions of national healthcare system only increased 0.",
              "5%.",
              "Based on the number of beds, the amount of diagnosis and treatment and the number of discharged patients, TCM healthcare agencies (hospitals, out-patient departments and clinics) play a crucial role in providing medical care service taking nearly 20% of national healthcare service but with only 10% TCM practitioners.",
              "Specifically, for advanced operation of TCM medical establishments, TCM hospitals have focused on the promotion of TCM features including preventive treatment of diseases, TCM characteristic techniques of diagnosis and treatment, TCM preparation room, TCM preparation range and TCM characteristic equipment.",
              "For the cultivation of TCM characteristic talents, higher education in TCM subjects serves as a solid support.",
              "Although the number of TCM institutions of higher education is almost the same (43), more and more western medicine and non-medical institutions are setting up TCM subjects.",
              "Moreover, the number of current and graduated students is increasing gradually including college students, bachelor students, master students and PhD students.",
              "The proportion of the education level is almost the same that most TCM-subjected students (nearly 90%) are general undergraduates and continuing education undergraduates, but the percentage of PhD students for TCM research is only around 0.",

              "Therefore, TCM has improved gradually in the latest ten years in the above five sections but comparing with its proportion in the whole healthcare system, there still remains large number of challenges to be solved in the future.",
              "On the other hand, there still exist obstacles that TCM has to face because of the huge healthcare demand in China [21].",
              "First of all, current TCM medical care system does not have a full coverage across the rural communities because of a limited number of infrastructure and practitioners [22].",
              "According to the statistics in 2017, around 80% of TCM practitioners serve in urban areas while only 20% are in rural areas.",
              "Secondly, insufficient number of high-level TCM experts leads to a weak point during the operation of TCM inheritance and innovation program.",
              "According to a survey of current status of TCM, there are only three TCM practitioners every ten thousand people [23].",
              "The TCM doctors are responsible for more than 7 person-time patients every day, which is slightly higher than the average number of general hospitals but the annual income of TCM doctors are only 80% of the average income of all doctors national wide.",
              "The income of TCM hospitals is less than 40% of that of general hospitals which could explain the lower annual income of TCM doctors[20].",
              "Thirdly, the sustained development of TCM is threatened by the destruction of ethnic minority medicine and the declined quality of Chinese medical resources which also triggers a relatively low concentrated pharmaceutical industry.",
              "Chinese crude drugs even have the highest disqualification exposure rate of all the products examined by the regulatory departments in China [24].",
              "There is an urgent request for the completeness of a TCM management system so as to increase its competitiveness under the global environment [22].",
              "Fortunately, in order to overcome these difficulties, the government has not stopped guiding the direction in improving the environment for TCM development.",
              "The Chinese government has set great store by TCM and rendered vigorous support to its development consistently after the founding of People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949.",
              "More importantly, since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012, the government has issued nearly 30 major policy decisions and plans on TCM so as to improve its normative implementation and development to the rule by law [25].",
              "In President\u2019s report to the 19th CPC National Congress, the necessity to pay equal attention to the development of TCM and Western medicine and carrying forward the tradition and ensuring the development of TCM was emphasized [26].",

              "TCM has always been a significant component of traditional Chinese culture since it grows with the course of Chinese history [8].",
              "Dating back to the remote antiquity, Chinese ancestors had applied certain creatures, plants and minerals to relieve their symptoms. By assimilating the essence from natural science and humanity, the theories and methods of TCM were gradually formed and recorded in written works.",
              "The four diagnostic methods: inspection, auscultation & olfaction, inquiry and palpation was summarized by Bian Que in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Period (770-221BC) [27].",
              "The theoretical frame work for TCM came in to place during the Qin and Han times (221BC- AD220) described in the Huang Di Nei Jing (Yellow Emperor\u2019s Inner Canon) [28].",
              "One of the most important theoretical foundation of TCM was the Shang Han Za Bing Lun (Treatise on Febrile Diseases and Miscellaneous Illnesses) created by Zhang Zhongjing in the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220), which discoursed how to propose corresponding diagnosis by differentiating the patterns of miscellaneous illnesses [29].",
              "During the same period, the foundation of TCM pharmaceutical theory was advanced by the masterpiece: the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing (Shennong\u2019s Classic of Masteria Medica) which guided the prescription and safety application of TCM so as to enhance their therapeutic effects [30].",
              "Later in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Li Shizhen complied the Ben Cao Gang Mu (Compendium of Materia Medica), the first book in the world that categorized medical herbs scientifically, which enriched the TCM pharmaceutical theory in details [31].",
              "These books transformed the clinical experience into summation of theories of TCM which systematically exposed its principles and methods of treatment, the human physiology, the symptoms of illness, and the preventative treatment.",
              "The application of TCM also prospered with the development of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) since 1949.",
              "In the early period of PRC, one of the three guidelines for health work was uniting Chinese and Western medicine.",
              "The first edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia was published in 1953 for guiding the pharmaceutical industry in China while TCM was first recorded in the second edition of Pharmacopoeia in 1963 [32,33].",
              "Later in 1978, the CPC Central Committee transmitted the Ministry of Health\u2019s \u201cReport on Implementing the Party\u2019s Policies Regarding TCM and Cultivating TCM Practitioners\u201d across the country which forcefully promoted the development of TCM.",
              "Furthermore, the Constitution of the PRC stipulates the promotion of modern medicine and TCM to protect the health of Chinese people [8].",
              "In 1986, a relatively independent administration of TCM was founded by the State Council, following by the establishment of respective TCM administrations in all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities which functioned as basic organization of TCM management in China.",
              "Then in 1991, at the 4th Meeting of the 7th National People\u2019s Congress, putting equal importance on Chinese and Western medicine was made as one of the five guidelines for health work in the new period PRC.",
              "Later on, the policy system on TCM was gradually completed by the two documents issued in 2003 and 2009 separately, the Regulations of the PRC on TCM and the Opinion on Supporting and Promoting the Development of TCM [8].",
              "More recently, the Party and government have granted greater emphasis on the development of TCM since the CPC\u2019s 18th National Congress in 2012 by the formation of a series of major policy decisions and plans out of this concern [25].",
              "The Outline of the Strategic Plan on the Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2016-2030) and the 13th Five-year Plan for the Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine published in 2016 systematically planed TCM development and made it a national strategy [21].",
              "At the National Conference on Hygiene and Health held in August 2016, the importance of revitalization and development of TCM was stressed [34].",
              "Later in October 2016, the Outline of Healthy China 2030 Plan issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council also specified a series of tasks and measures on the implementation of TCM development program to improve the health of Chinese people in the next 15 years.",
              "[35] More importantly, the Law on Traditional Chinese Medicine was issued in the late 2016 which provided a sounder policy environment and legal basis for TCM development [36].",
              "The Guideline of Encouraging Innovation in Drugs and Medical Equipment by Expanding the Reform of Review and Approval System issued in 2017 approved the heritage and innovation of TCM by the establishment of a complete registration and inspection system with TCM characteristics [37].",
              "As for ensuring a modernized development of TCM, Guiding Opinions Promoting the Technology Innovation in Healthcare Service of Traditional Chinese Medicine was issued in 2018 [38].",

              "The essence of the traditional Chinese medicine has always been the most advanced and experienced therapeutic approach in the world.",
              "It has knowledge that can impact the direction of future modern medical development;",
              "still, it is easy to find simple knowledge with mark of times and special cultures.",
              "The basic structure of traditional Chinese medicine is composed of three parts: one consistent with modern medicine, one involuntarily beyond modern medicine, and one that needs to be further evaluated.",
              "The part that is consistent with modern medicine includes consensus on several theories and concepts of traditional Chinese medicine, and usage of several treatments and prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine including commonly used Chinese herbs.",
              "The part that is involuntarily beyond modern medicine contains several advanced theories and important concepts of traditional Chinese medicine, relatively advanced treatments, formula and modern prescriptions, leading herbs, acupuncture treatment and acupuncture anesthesia of traditional Chinese medicine that affect modern medicine and incorporates massage treatment that has been gradually acknowledged by modern therapy.",
              "The part that needs to be further evaluated consists not only the knowledge of pulse diagnosis, prescription, and herbs, but also many other aspects of traditional Chinese medicine.",
              "The essence of traditional Chinese medicine has always been the most advanced and experienced medicine in the world.",
              "Its vast system is full of practical medical technology and proven experiences that have been gradually incorporated into modern medicine;",
              "it has knowledge that can impact the direction of future medical development, yet its knowledge is simple enough to fit changing times and varied cultures.",
              "The basic structure of traditional Chinese medicine is composed of the following three parts: the part that is consistent with modern medicine, the part that is involuntarily beyond modern medicine, and the part that needs to be further evaluated or abandoned.",
              "In the 16th century, what is now known as \u201cwestern medicine\u201d was introduced to China but was not commonly used and thus had little effect.",
              "It was not until the Opium War that \u201cwestern medicine\u201d began to develop in China.",
              "Therefore, prior to that event, traditional Chinese medicine was always the leading force of medical care in China.",
              "The key to successful medicine lies in its efficacy.",
              "A popular Chinese saying states \u201cExcellence is from experience.",
              "\u201d The foundation of traditional Chinese medicine is based on 5,000 years of practice and experiences.",
              "With the founding of a new China in 1949, western medicine in the region also began to play a large role in medical care.",
              "As modern (westernized) medicine\u2019s impact increased, it led to the development of \u201cintegrative medicine\u201d at the end of the 1950s.",
              "Theories, therapeutic principles, technologies, and understanding of the life sciences were elaborated, and the basic structure of traditional Chinese medicine also became clearer.",
              "Most importantly, traditional Chinese medicine began to reach a common point with modern medicine.",
              "For example, \u201cthe essence of kidney\u201d is a core concept of traditional Chinese medical theory.",
              "Studies by Shen showed that \u201ckidney deficiency syndrome\u201d is equivalent to the aging in modern medicine, regardless of its external performance and internal changes [1\u20133].",
              "Studies by Chen et al.",
              "showed that what is known as \u201cheart qi deficiency\u201d is associated with cardiac insufficiency in modern medicine [4\u20136].",
              "There are four main components of traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis [7, 8].",
              "Inspection is a method to determine the medical status by visually examining the changes in appearance and the movement of the whole body or part of the body.",
              "Generally speaking, inspection includes examination of the tongue as well as the observation of a patient\u2019s external appearance, in order to recognize the internal and external manifestations of disease.",
              "Visual examination is consistent with modern medicine\u2019s emphasis on observation of a patient appearance and movement.",
              "For example, a pale lip can indicate anemia in modern medicine.",
              "The use of auscultation-olfaction, including listening to the sounds and smelling for odors, is also consistent with modern medicine.",
              "If a patient speaks loudly and powerfully, the physician can determine that the patient is full of energy.",
              "Conversely, if a patient\u2019s voice is weak or he does not want to talk, it is most likely that the patient\u2019s diseases are caused by \u201cdeficiency.",
              "\u201d A patient\u2019s bodily odors can also reveal much about the respective illness.",
              "If a patient has a rotten apple like odor, it is likely diabetic ketoacidosis.",
              "Inquiry refers to the gathering of a thorough history and reviewing the systems. These include physical and mental feelings, life history, family history, past medical history, onset time, and the present symptoms, which are widely used both in traditional medicine and modern medicine.",
              "Therapeutic studies show that Chinese medicine and modern medicine have reached a consensus on the methods of diaphoresis, purging, vomiting, warming, clearing, neutralizing, eliminating, and reinforcing (eight commonly used treatments in traditional Chinese medicine).",
              "For instance, the \u201creinforcing method\u201d is able to improve neuroendocrine regulatory function, enhance the body\u2019s ability to combat stress, adjust immune function, and improve the body\u2019s systemic function.",
              "Diaphoresis is able to promote perspiration and defervescence as well as play a role in reducing inflammation among other methods adopted by modern medicine.",
              "Illnesses cured by many ancient Chinese compounds are similar to certain diseases or conditions also seen in modern medicine and are summarized in Table 1.",
              "There are many Chinese herbs either given as single drugs or as formulations that have been effective treatments for particular illnesses for thousands of years.",
              "With the development of modern medicine, the pharmacology and mechanism of action of many of these Chinese herbs have been determined, so that traditional Chinese medicine has gradually formed a consensus with modern medicine (Table 2).",
              "Traditional Chinese medicine is a practical medicine built on experience.",
              "The theoretical system is built by means of an ancient plain materialist philosophy, the method of \u201csyndrome differentiation,\u201d and the use of natural means to treat illness rather than emphasizing consistency with contemporary science and technology [9, 10].",
              "Unlike modern medicine that has view that \u201cNature that cannot be certified cannot be conquered,\u201d keeping abreast of requirements of contemporary science, traditional Chinese medicine with the overall old and simple features involuntarily gives awareness beyond the era.",
              "The so-called \u201cintegrative medicine\u201d is able to reveal this essence continually.",
              "In terms of medical theories and ways of thinking, traditional Chinese medicine has a significant contribution to modern medicine.",
              "For example, the theory of the \u201ccorrespondence between man and universe\u201d in traditional Chinese medicine is the unified outlook of body and environment.",
              "What are known as the \u201cbiological life\u201d theory and the \u201cbiological clock\u201d theory in modern medicine refers to the patterns of hormone secretion, and treating diseases according to the place of origin are all the embodiment of \u201ccorrespondence between man and universe.",
              "\u201d The views of \u201cunity of opposites\u201d and \u201cbalance amongst dynamic forces\u201d indicate the existence of universal laws in human life.",
              "Although these views are emphasized in modern life science, both approaches differ from traditional Chinese medicine because traditional Chinese medicine always considers these views as its guiding ideology and as fundamental law.",
              "Therefore, the cognitive degrees of Chinese medicine and western medicine in these views are of difference.",
              "For example, studies by Shen show that \u201ckidney deficiency\u201d is due to neuroendocrine disturbance and preaging of the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, which is consistent with the hypothesis that \u201cthe senile bell lies in hypothalamus\u201d proposed by Everiff in the 1980s [11].",
              "However, the practice of traditional Chinese medicine precedes modern medicine by thousands of years.",
              "Our study found that the knowledge of \u201cchronic disease involving kidney\u201d in traditional Chinese medicine has a profound connotation in modern life sciences.",
              "Many diseases, such as airway inflammatory diseases, with long-term recurrence, often exacerbate the pathological changes in the anti-inflammatory system and HPA axis.",
              "Patients suffering from these are known to have significant \u201ckidney deficiency.",
              "\u201d We summarized many theories and concepts with advanced knowledge in traditional Chinese medicine in Table 3.",
              "\u201cSame treatment for different diseases,\u201d one of the most important and characteristic concepts in traditional Chinese medicine reflects the spirit of \u201csyndrome differentiation and treatment\u201d and refers to the thought that different diseases at certain stages of development show the same pathogenesis.",
              "And therefore, the same therapeutic principles can be applied to diseases.",
              "For example, according to modern medical diagnosis, different diseases are able to be cured by \u201creinforcing kidney and replenishing qi\u201d as long as they are attributed to \u201ckidney-qi deficiency\u201d syndrome.",
              "Modern research has shown that this concept of \u201csame treatment for different diseases\u201d is likely to be one of the directions of modern medicine in the future.",
              "Because some of the \u201cwalls\u201d that exist between the diseases are not always reasonable, the reason for division is often based on anatomy, rather than etiological and pathological changes.",
              "Studies have shown that different diseases with similar syndrome often have common pathological and physiological changes.",
              "It is easier to achieve better effects by using the same prescription because different diseases may have comparable changes at the cellular, molecular, and genetic levels, and drug targets or the target groups may be similar across various diseases.",
              "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has a poor prognosis.",
              "In the 1980s, a famous Chinese medical expert in China, Doctor Shi-lin Huang, designed a Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (RIF), in which, realgar, a mined ore, is the principal element and Indigo naturalis, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and Radix psudostellariae are adjuvant components to assist the effects of realgar.",
              "The main components of RIF are realgar, Indigo naturalis, and Salvia miltiorrhiza, with tetraarsenic tetrasulfide (A), indirubin (I), and tanshinone IIA (T) as major active ingredients, respectively [12\u201314].",
              "Multicenter clinical trials showed that a complete remission rate of 96.",
              "7% [15] to 98% [16] and a 5-year overall survival rate of 86.",
              "88% [17] were achieved in APL patients receiving RIF, with moderate adverse effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort and rash.",
              "Doctor Zhu Chen clarified the molecular mechanism of the compound Huangdai tablets in the treatment of APL in 2008 from the perspective of molecular biology and biochemistry in the renowned journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS).",
              "The results show that As4S4 induces degradation of the cancer protein, thus reversing the increase in cancer cells and making them differentiate and mature.",
              "Tanshinone and indirubin promote the ubiquitination of the oncoprotein and accelerate its degradation, further promoting the differentiation and maturation of the leukemia cells and inhibiting cell cycle and proliferation of cancer cells.",
              "Animal studies also showed that the use of natural indigo after realgar substantially reduced toxicity.",
              "These reflect the concepts of typical \u201cminister\u201d (the place inferior to \u201cmonarch\u201d drug) and \u201cassistant\u201d (the place inferior to \u201cminister\u201d drug) effect.",
              "Tanshinone and indirubin increase the production of channel proteins that deliver As4S4, which significantly increase the concentration of As4S4 in leukemia cells, improving its efficacy.",
              "Both tanshinone and indirubin play the role of \u201cguide\u201d (the place inferior to \u201cassistant\u201d drug).",
              "The compound Huangdai has a synergistic effect with the other components greater than its three individual components by the joint application of each component (Figure 1).",
              "The airway stabilizer solution created by Doctor Jing-cheng Dong is based on Xiao Qing Long Tang (Little Dragon Decoction) and Ding Chuan Tang (Anti-asthmatic Decoction), composed of ligusticum wallichii, ginkgo biloba, skullcap, Asarum, ginger, almonds, earthworm, rehmannia, and magnolia.",
              "It is effective in the clinical treatment of bronchial asthma and variability of cough.",
              "The various components and the basis for its efficacy are rooted in traditional Chinese medical theory, and the composition of the drug may be the main material basis for its efficacy (Table 4).",
              "The study of Chinese medicine is driven in part by the development of modern pharmacology.",
              "For instance, Artemisia annua was recorded in the \u201cHandbook of Prescriptions for Emergency\u201d (written by Hong Ge in Eastern Jin Dynasty) as a drug used to treat malaria.",
              "Modern research has shown that it has an antimalarial active ingredient (the peroxide group of sesquiterpene lactone) consisting of only 3 elements, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.",
              "It is a completely different novel compound compared to known antimalarial drug structures.",
              "This finding overturned the judgment of experts who insisted that the structure of the antimalarial drugs must have a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring [18, 19].",
              "It helps provide a direction for the design and synthesis of new drugs.",
              "In addition, ginseng, skullcap, astragalus, epimedium, and other herbs were also each shown to have a unique effect (Table 5).",
              "Those who practice acupuncture approach the treatment by looking at pathology in the whole body.",
              "According to different body conditions, varied acupoints and manipulations are selected.",
              "The selection influences multiple targets and many diseases and stimulates the body to treat diseases, affecting the pathological process and improving physique.",
              "This adjustment is accomplished by the integration of the central nervous system, including cortex recombination, neural plasticity, and release of various neurotransmitters and hormones [20, 21].",
              "The basis of acupuncture may be in changes in gene expression.",
              "Acupuncture anesthesia is a method used to prevent surgical pain and relieve physiological dysfunction.",

              "1 People\u2019s Hospital used it instead of narcotic drugs to perform tonsillectomies.",
              "Since then, acupuncture anesthesia has been passed from general usage to selected application.",
              "According to its clinical effect and scientific evaluation, acupuncture anesthesia is effectively used in thyroid surgery, surgery of posterior cranial fossa, craniocerebral operation, anterior cervical surgery, pulmonary resection, caesarean section, tubal ligation, and tooth extraction.",
              "It is also used in some surgeries with uncertain results like hysterectomy, caldwell-luc operation, subtotal gastrectomy, and strabismus surgery.",
              "It has not proved to provide effective anesthesia in limb surgery and perineal surgery.",
              "The basis of acupuncture anesthesia is the adjustment to inhibit large pain pathways by the negative reflection of spinal pain [22\u201324].",

              "CCK-8 has the negative-reflection-to-opioid effect, which is the vital factor of acupuncture and morphine.",
              "The effect of electric acupuncture depends on the balance of central opioid and CCK-8.",
              "The acupuncture signals can be reflected on some regional area of the brain to deal with the injury stimulations, which might be the physical basis of acupuncture anesthesia.",
              "Different frequencies of electric acupuncture differentiate the pain-relieving effects, which may be related to the specific expression of central genes.",
              "Two Hz electric acupuncture is widely used in the brain treatment, while 100 Hz has a narrow extension in the brain treatment.",
              "Psychological factors are not the deciding factors for success, but they are also quite important.",
              "Massage treatment utilizes the particular skills with hands or limbs to practice manipulation on the surface of the body.",
              "Therefore, it has the direct effect of activating blood and dispersing stagnation, smoothing tendons, and improving malformation.",
              "On the other hand, massage reflectively influences the neuro and body fluid by acupoint-meridian-viscera network.",
              "Clinical researches show that appropriate manipulations can result in improvement of outcomes [25].",
              "Modern research studies show that massage can promote blood and lymph circulation, increase metabolism, and assist the repair of soft tissue injury [26].",

              "The total cell count increases, while lung function improves.",

              "Rubbing manipulation, embrocation, and kneading manipulation could increase the elasticity and glossiness of skin.",
              "In short, skilled massage manipulation can effectively prevent diseases by the combination of static strength and motive force in a localized point or throughout the entire body.",
              "In the system of human science, including medical science, concepts change from new to old, and ideas become theories and facts.",
              "All the concepts and rules indicate the stability.",
              "However, this kind of stability is conditional, partial, and relative, while instability is absolute and unconditional.",
              "Any scientific systems should confess their demerits and rectify them so as to generate new concepts, methods, and theory.",
              "Meanwhile, the initial phase of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine were founded in specific cultures and eras.",

              "With an annual incidence ranging from 10 to more than 20 per 100,000 individuals [2], the worldwide disease burden could exceed 17 million by 2040 [3], and the Chinese Parkinson population could be 5 million by 2030.",
              "As a progressive disease leading to a high rate of disability, PD imposes a great burden on society and caregivers, which is becoming substantially more severe due to the ageing of society [4].",
              "To build a better picture of disease progression, the Hoehn & Yahr stage [5] has been created and is widely used in clinical practice, and studies have shown that the Hoehn & Yahr stage is correlated with both motor symptoms (MSs) and nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) [6].",
              "To facilitate clinical studies, PD patients are often classified into different stages according to the Hoehn & Yahr stage, namely staged \u2264 2 as mild/early, 2.",

              "Since the existence of MS and NMS occurs throughout the disease duration, current guidelines recommend long-term management therapy, emphasizing the distinct particularities of different stages of the disease.",
              "The key feature of the mild stage is considerable progression;",
              "during this stage, neuroinflammation and pyroptosis can be found, which promotes the loss of dopaminergic neurons [8].",
              "With disease progression and an increased dose of levodopa, patients are prone to suffer from motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, mainly described as a wearing-off period and peak-dose dyskinesia.",
              "As the disease advances, \u03b1-synuclein pathology spreads to higher centres in the brain, involving the limbic system, amygdala, neocortex, and prefrontal lobe [9].",
              "With the participation of the side effects of medication and peripheral disorders, these pathogenesis eventually lead to a grievous \u201cOFF\u201d time, disabling motor complications and a wide range of NMSs, including cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, and autonomic nerve dysfunction.",
              "Hence, clinicians always eventually shift their focus to dealing with quality of life (QoL).",
              "Pharmacological therapy is always a challenge at all stages of PD.",
              "First, corroborating the necessity of early initiation of disease-modification therapy, the present problem is the absence of disease-modifying drugs [10].",
              "Monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors (MOA-BI), including selegiline and rasagiline, have been reported to improve the dopamine-deficient state and the activity of some antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and neurotrophic factors, but a clinical neuroprotective effect lacks high-level clinical evidence [11].",
              "Second, levodopa, the predominant anti-Parkinson drug, is now 65 years old [12].",
              "Studies have indicated that levodopa-induced motor fluctuation occurs in more than half of long-term medicated PD patients [13].",
              "In addition to dopaminergic neuron loss, pulsatile delivery of high-dose levodopa causes plasma concentration fluctuation following phasic stimulation of dopamine receptors, further worsening the function of dopaminergic receptors in the postsynaptic membrane [14].",
              "Although dopamine agonists (DAs), such as pramipexole, ropinirole, apomorphine and rotigotine, can increase the \u201cON\u201d time and reduce the \u201cOFF\u201d time [15, 16], they cause dopaminergic side effects, including orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, nausea, somnolence, and impulse control disorders [10].",
              "Last, in the advanced stage, severe neuron loss forces patients to take high-dose, combined pharmacological therapy and even undergo invasive treatments to maintain a relatively stable situation [17].",
              "Otherwise, levodopa-induced dyskinesia and the combinations of anti-Parkinson medicines causes conflicts between effective dosages and clinical responses during the treatment of moderate to advanced PD patients, making treatment more complex.",
              "Due to this complicated situation, an increasing number of patients are starting to receive traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment, and studies have indicated that TCM therapy can improve both motor and nonmotor symptoms in PD patients [18].",
              "Our team has been working on TCM treatment of PD for decades.",
              "In past clinical practice, we attributed the basic mechanism of Parkinson's disease to \"liver wind\", and the pathogenesis is root vacuity and tip repletion.",
              "Deficiency of Zang-fu organ function obstructs the formation and circulation of Qi and blood and causes blood stasis and phlegm, whose long-term accumulation transforms to toxin.",
              "Past analyses indicated that the most common syndromes of PD are Yin deficiency of liver and kidney (YDLK), deficiency of Qi and blood (DOQB), phlegm heat and wind stirring (PHWS), blood stasis and wind stirring (BSWS), and deficiency of Yin and Yang (DOYY) [19].",
              "Our unpublished works further correlated the PD clinical stages to TCM syndromes and found that there are relatively uniform syndromes during each stage of disease development.",
              "During the early stage, the main syndrome is YDLK, and the pathogenesis is Yin deficiency of the liver and kidney.",
              "Kidney water fails to nourish liver wood;",
              "thus, liver wind stirs internally, so symptoms occur, \u201cwind being mobile and changeable\u201d [20].",
              "This stage experiences relatively high-speed progression.",
              "During the moderate stage, the main syndromes are PHWS and BSWS, and long-term accumulation of phlegm and blood stasis, together with medical toxin, are the main source of toxin damage to the brain, which encumbers treatment.",
              "During the late stage, the dominant syndromes are DOYY and DOOB.",
              "Because of the mutual rooting of Yin and Yang, Yin impairment involves Yang, and toxin simultaneously damages vital Qi, finally causing a deficiency of both Yin and Yang.",
              "A schematic diagram of the pathogenesis is shown in Fig.",
              "1.",
              "TCM pathogenesis of PD Following the therapeutic methodology of nourishing the liver and kidney, dredging collaterals, and detoxification, our team established the Pingchan formula in the past decade.",
              "The Pingchan formula is made up of Rehmanniae radix praeparata (Shudihuang) 15 g, Lycii fructus (Gouqizi) 12 g, Taxilli herba (Sangjisheng) 15 g, Gastrodiae rhizoma (Tianma) 9 g, Paeoniae radix alba (Baishao) 15 g, Bombyx batryiticatus (Jiangcan) 9 g, Scorpio (Quanxie) 3 g, and scolopendra (Wugong) 3 g.",
              "Our past studies have proven its efficacy in reducing the occurrence of motor complications and mitigating dyskinesia and improving depression in mild and moderate PD patients [21, 22].",
              "Additionally, our previous study indicated that Pingchan granules can alleviate inflammation and apoptosis in nigral cells and dopaminergic neurons in PD mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) by regulating the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) pathway in the substantia nigra [23].",
              "In addition, considering the side effects of long-term use of levodopa, Pingchan granules inhibit the hyperphosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and downregulate the expression of anti-apoptotic genes worsened by levodopa [24], simultaneously upregulating dopamine D2 receptor gene expression, whose overinhibition has been proven to be the main mechanism of levodopa-induced dyskinesia [25].",
              "On the basis of the Pingchan formula and our syndrome differentiation by stage theory, we proposed a new model of TCM treatment by stage of PD.",
              "Based on the general principle of nourishing liver Yin and kidney Yin, we introduced detoxification and supporting vital Qi, respectively, to the treatment of moderate and advanced stages, aiming at delaying disease progression during the early stage, dealing with complications during the moderate stage, and improving the QoL during the late stage.",
              "We removed scolopendra from the Pingchan formula to produce the Ziyin Pingchan formula for the mild stage to nourish the liver Yin and kidney Yin and to slow the process of accumulation of toxin in the brain.",
              "Ziyin Pingchan formula was used as the foundation, to which we added Arisaematis rhizoma preparatum (Zhitiannanxing) 15 g and Curcumae rhizoma (Ezhu) 9 g to reduce drug toxin, noxious blood stasis, and phlegm toxin, namely, the Jiedu Pingchan formula for the moderate stage, and Astragali radix (Huangqi) 30 g, Cistanches herba (Roucongrong) 30 g to nourish the kidney Yang and vital Qi to additionally moisten the intestines and urge purgation, namely, the Fuzheng Pingchan formula for the late stage.",
              "Based on the rationales above, we hypothesize that every formula will succeed in treating each stage of PD.",
              "Our treatment by stages therapy is a long-term management treatment that covers the key points of every stage of PD based on TCM pathogenesis.",
              "In the mild stage, we delay the progression of the disease.",
              "In the moderate stage, we improve the symptoms, increase the curative effect and reduce the side effects of anti-Parkinson medicine.",
              "In the advanced stage, we improve the QoL.",
              "This TCM whole-process management and treatment can delay disease progression, improve the complications caused by Western medicine, and improve the QoL of patients, which is innovative and quite practical.",
              "The major objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of treating Parkinson\u2019s disease by stages using integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine methods and to provide an evidence base for forming a standardized scheme of diagnosis and treatment.",

              "The integration of TCM is a bidirectional process that requires the following preconditions [19]: Contemporary TCM could be understood as a model of vegetative system biology centered on the theory of regulation and the so-called guiding criteria as categories of clinical signs based on four physiological models of body regulation.",
              "These involve signs of neurovegetative origin felt as \u201cfullness\u201d or \u201cemptiness\u201d, signs of humoro-vegetative origin felt as \u201cheat\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d, signs of neuro-immunological stages expressed as \u201cexterior\u201d or \u201cinterior\u201d affections, and signs of structural deficiency versus primary regulatory deficiency understood as \u201cyin yang\u201d.",

              "The previously mentioned studies show that acupoints\u2019 diagnosis-dependent selection contributed to a higher analgesic effect.",
              "If acupoints are understood as reflex points that elicit specific neurovegetative changes, it can be speculated that they might only yield satisfactory treatment results if they match the current vegetative status of the patient [23].",

              "This variability, often related to the subjectivity of the variables and subcategories of diseases, can lead to an incorrect selection of acupoints and erroneous therapeutic results.",
              "Moreover, non-individualized, non-diagnosis based interventions could negatively contribute to some acupuncture meta-analysis, which based on the poor results of some inaccurate trials, evaluate acupuncture treatments as not being statistically different from controls [27].",
              "Furthermore, acupoints\u2019 exact location is critical and might significantly influence the results.",
              "In addition to lab-scale experiments involving nitric oxide biocapture over the skin in zones corresponding to acupuncture points [28], advanced technological methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, synchrotron radiation phase-contrast X-ray CT imaging, and positron emission tomography might help clarify the meridian network and validate the traditional \u201ccun\u201d measurement unit often used to locate acupoints [29,30].",
              "The concept of syndrome or pattern in TCM (known as \u201cZheng\u201d) is crucial while establishing the diagnosis [31].",
              "It entails the human body\u2019s overall physiological and pathological pattern as a function of a particular condition, which usually reflects an internal unbalance defined by a systematic analysis of the clinical symptoms and signs gathered by a practitioner [1].",
              "Thus, to establish a general picture of the patient condition involving subtle and physical factors related to inner nature [32], pathological agent, and physiological status, Chinese medicine diagnosis considers four main essential examinations: looking, listening-smelling, palpating, and questioning [33].",
              "During this process, tongue diagnosis is one of the aspects evaluated while looking, whereas pulse diagnosis is evaluated while palpating.",
              "In Chinese medicine, the tongue shows the state of some fundamental substances known as \u201cqi\u201d (commonly referred to as \u201cvital force\u201d or \u201cenergy\u201d), \u201cxue\u201d (blood), and \u201cjin ye\u201d (body fluids) and correlates with groups of diagnostically relevant signs, which indicate the state of a body island, as well as with the functional properties of meridians [34].",
              "TCM holds that \u201cqi\u201d and \u201cxue\u201d are functional powers in the body, or vegetative capacities to function, which may be seen in functional physical signs related with measurable physiological processes and aspects such as the increase of the peripheral microcirculation and skin temperature and the changes on acupoints\u2019 electrical potential and resistance, and even on the surrounding biomagnetic field [9].",
              "The tongue is a mirror for the internal organs, reflecting the body\u2019s physiological and clinical-pathological condition (Figure 1).",
              "The color, size and form, motion, substance, coating, and geometric shape of the tongue, as well as changes in the tongue body, such as thickness, cracks, and teeth marks, are just a few qualities that must be evaluated and related to the health state of the patient [35].",

              "The Automatic Tongue Diagnosis System (ATDS, Figure 2) comprises hardware responsible for the image acquisition and software that allows the tongue body segmentation, feature extraction, and diagnosis.",

              "The active contour model (ACM) or snake is an edge segmentation technique frequently used in tongue segmentation.",
              "However, it presents poor convergence of concavities, limited capture range, undesirable contracting and clustering effects, and lack of global control [35,41].",
              "Several methods have been proposed in combination with the ACM to overcome these limitations, such as the bi-elliptical deformable template, the watershed transform, the gradient vector flow, and the knowledge-based initial tongue body boundary detection plus color gradient [40,41,42,43].",
              "Other techniques are also able to be successfully used in tongue segmentation, such as the threshold method using the Otsu\u2019s thresholding algorithm, the color control-geometric and gradient flow snake, and the double geo-vector flow [44].",

              "As a general requirement, the developed ATDS must be able to mimic, in a reproducible way, the traditional tongue diagnosis, and for that, when submitted to clinical tests, their output must correlate with the findings of experienced TCM practitioners.",
              "In a study on the agreement between an automatic tongue diagnosis system and the evaluation made by several TCM practitioners, ATDS was shown to be more consistent with significantly higher intra-agreement than TCM doctors.",
              "Moreover, the inter-agreements between the ATDS and TCM doctors were both moderate [39].",
              "Similar results were found by Kim et al.",
              "(2012) while evaluating the tongue coating thickness [49].",
