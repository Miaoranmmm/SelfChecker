    "query": "What is the most efficient way to convert waste into energy, and how has this technology developed over time to become a viable alternative to traditional forms of energy production?",
    "response": "That's a great question. There are different methods of converting waste into energy, such as combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion, and fermentation[^1^]. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency, environmental impact, and cost.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), waste-to-energy plants in the United States generated about 13.6 billion kilowatthours of electricity from burning about 28 million tons of combustible municipal solid waste (MSW) in 2021[^2^]. Waste-to-energy plants reduce the volume of waste by about 87% and the weight by about 75%[^2^] [^7^]. However, they also produce carbon dioxide and other emissions that contribute to climate change and air pollution.\n\nThe efficiency of waste-to-energy plants depends on several factors, such as the type and composition of waste, the technology used, and the energy output. The EIA estimates that the average net electric efficiency of waste-to-energy plants in the United States is about 17%, which means that for every 100 units of energy in the waste, only 17 units are converted into electricity[^7^]. This is lower than the efficiency of conventional fossil fuel power plants, which can range from 33% to 60%[^7^].\n\nHowever, some waste-to-energy technologies can achieve higher efficiencies by producing both heat and electricity, or by using syngas or biogas as fuel. For example, gasification converts waste into a synthetic gas that can be burned in a turbine or engine to generate electricity or used as a feedstock for chemicals or fuels. Pyrolysis converts waste into a liquid oil that can be refined into fuels or chemicals. Anaerobic digestion converts organic waste into biogas that can be used for heating or power generation. Fermentation converts organic waste into ethanol that can be used as a biofuel.\n\nThe development of waste-to-energy technologies has been influenced by various factors, such as environmental regulations, energy prices, waste management policies, and public acceptance. In some countries, such as Japan and some European countries, waste-to-energy is more widely used than in the United States, partly because of limited landfill space and higher energy costs[^2^]. In other countries, such as China and India, waste-to-energy is seen as a way to address the growing problem of waste disposal and energy demand.\n\nWaste-to-energy is one of the options for managing waste and producing renewable energy from biomass. However, it is not a perfect solution and it has some trade-offs and challenges. It is important to consider the whole life cycle of waste and energy systems, from source reduction and recycling to disposal and recovery. Waste-to-energy can be a viable alternative to traditional forms of energy production if it is done in an efficient, sustainable, and socially acceptable way.",

              "It was 2011, and Kung was at MIT as a biological engineering grad student focused on cancer research.",

              "The problem, as Kung describes it, was that charcoal was everywhere in Kibera \u2014 piled up outside, traded by the road, and used as the primary fuel, even indoors.",
              "Its creation contributed to deforestation, and its smoke presented a serious health hazard.",
              "Eager to address this challenge, Kung secured fellowship support from the MIT International Development Initiative and the Priscilla King Gray Public Service Center to conduct more research in Kenya.",
              "In 2012, he formed Takachar as a team and received seed money from the MIT IDEAS Global Challenge, MIT Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship, and D-Lab to produce charcoal from household organic waste.",

              "Back in 2010, he had a master\u2019s student interested in renewable energy, and he suggested the student investigate biomass.",
              "That student, Richard Bates \u201910, SM \u201912, PhD \u201916, began exploring the science of converting biomass to more clean-burning charcoal through torrefaction.",
              "Most torrefaction (also known as low-temperature pyrolysis) systems use external heating sources, but the lab\u2019s goal, Ghoniem explains, was to develop an efficient, self-sustained reactor that would generate fewer emissions.",
              "\u201cWe needed to understand the chemistry and physics of the process, and develop fundamental scaling models, before going to the lab to build the device,\u201d he says.",
              "By the time Kung joined the lab in 2013, Ghoniem was working with the Tata Center to identify technology suitable for developing countries and largely based on renewable energy.",
              "Kung was able to secure a Tata Fellowship and \u2014 building on Bates\u2019 research \u2014 develop the small-scale, practical device for biomass thermochemical conversion in the field that launched Takachar.",
              "This device, which was patented by MIT with inventors Kung, Ghoniem, Stoner, MIT research scientist Santosh Shanbhogue, and Slocum, is self-contained and scalable.",
              "It burns a little of the biomass to generate heat;",
              "this heat bakes the rest of the biomass, releasing gases;",
              "the system then introduces air to enable these gases to combust, which burns off the volatiles and generates more heat, keeping the thermochemical reaction going.",
              "\u201cThe trick is how to introduce the right amount of air at the right location to sustain the process,\u201d Ghoniem explains.",
              "\u201cIf you put in more air, that will burn the biomass.",
              "If you put in less, there won\u2019t be enough heat to produce the charcoal.",
              "That will stop the reaction.",
              "\u201d About 10 percent of the biomass is used as fuel to support the reaction, Kung says, adding that \u201c90 percent is densified into a form that\u2019s easier to handle and utilize.",
              "\u201d He notes that the research received financial support from the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab and the Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, both at MIT.",
              "Sonal Thengane, another postdoc in Ghoniem\u2019s lab, participated in the effort to scale up the technology at the MIT Bates Lab (no relation to Richard Bates).",
              "The charcoal produced is more valuable per ton and easier to transport and sell than biomass, reducing transportation costs by two-thirds and giving farmers an additional income opportunity \u2014 and an incentive not to burn agricultural waste, Kung says.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s more income for farmers, and you get better air quality.",
              "\u201d Roots in India When Kung became a Tata Fellow, he joined a program founded to take on the biggest challenges of the developing world, with a focus on India.",
              "According to Stoner, Tata Fellows, including Kung, typically visit India twice a year and spend six to eight weeks meeting stakeholders in industry, the government, and in communities to gain perspective on their areas of study.",
              "\u201cA unique part of Tata is that you\u2019re considering the ecosystem as a whole,\u201d says Kung, who interviewed hundreds of smallholder farmers, met with truck drivers, and visited existing biomass processing plants during his Tata trips to India.",
              "(Along the way, he also connected with Indian engineer Vidyut Mohan, who became Takachar\u2019s co-founder.)",
              "\u201cIt was very important for Kevin to be there walking about, experimenting, and interviewing farmers,\u201d Stoner says.",
              "\u201cHe learned about the lives of farmers.",
              "\u201d These experiences helped instill in Kung an appreciation for small farmers that still drives him today as Takachar rolls out its first pilot programs, tinkers with the technology, grows its team (now up to 10), and endeavors to build a revenue stream.",
              "So, while Takachar has gotten a lot of attention and accolades \u2014 from the IDEAS award to the Earthshot Prize \u2014 Kung says what motivates him is the prospect of improving people\u2019s lives.",
              "The dream, he says, is to empower communities to help both the planet and themselves.",
