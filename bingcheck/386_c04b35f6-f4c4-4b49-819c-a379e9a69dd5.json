    "query": "Can you explain the process and technology behind the creation of lab-grown meat, and what are some potential benefits and drawbacks of this innovation for the food industry and the environment?",
    "response": "Lab-grown meat is a genetically engineered product that uses biotechnology to produce meat from animal cells without raising and slaughtering animals[^1^] [^2^]. The process involves taking a sample of stem cells from a live animal, putting them in a bioreactor with a nutrient-rich culture medium, and stimulating them to grow and differentiate into muscle, fat, and connective tissue[^1^] [^2^]. The resulting meat can be shaped into various forms, such as burgers, nuggets, or steaks[^2^].\n\nSome potential benefits of lab-grown meat are:\n\n- It is more sustainable. Lab-grown meat could reduce the environmental impact of animal agriculture, which is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, and pollution[^2^] [^3^] [^7^]. Lab-grown meat could also save energy and resources by producing only the edible parts of the animal, without bones, organs, or waste[^7^].\n- It is more animal-friendly. Lab-grown meat could spare billions of animals from suffering and death in factory farms and slaughterhouses[^2^] [^3^] [^7^]. Lab-grown meat could also reduce the risk of zoonotic diseases that can spread from animals to humans[^3^].\n- It is more healthy. Lab-grown meat could reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses, such as salmonella or E. coli, that can contaminate conventional meat products[^2^] [^10^]. Lab-grown meat could also be modified to enhance its nutritional value, such as adding vitamins, minerals, or omega-3 fatty acids[^2^] [^10^].\n\nSome potential drawbacks of lab-grown meat are:\n\n- It is more expensive. Lab-grown meat is still in its early stages of development and has not reached commercial scale yet. The production cost of lab-grown meat is currently much higher than that of conventional meat, which could limit its accessibility and affordability for consumers[^2^] [^7^].\n- It is more uncertain. Lab-grown meat faces many technical, regulatory, and social challenges before it can become widely available and accepted. The safety, quality, and taste of lab-grown meat are still being tested and evaluated. The legal status and labeling of lab-grown meat are still unclear and vary by country. The consumer perception and acceptance of lab-grown meat are still uncertain and depend on factors such as culture, religion, ethics, and education[^2^] [^7^] [^8^].\n- It is more controversial. Lab-grown meat raises ethical and moral questions about the role and value of animals in society. Some people may oppose lab-grown meat on the grounds that it is unnatural, unnatural or violates the sanctity of life. Some people may also prefer traditional meat for its cultural, historical, or personal significance[^2^] [^7^] [^9^].",

              "This article explains what it is, how it\u2019s made, and the barriers that will need to be overcome if we\u2019re ever going to find it in supermarkets in Europe.",
              "Lab-grown meat refers to meat developed from animal cell culture, and not via traditional raising and slaughter of living animals.",
              "1 It is not an imitation of meat made with other ingredients, like plant-based burgers that are made from plant-based proteins.",
              "The production process can be broken down into four steps:1 The first time a cultivated beef patty was introduced to the world was in August 2013.",
              "The meat was developed by a team led by Mark Post, of Maastricht University.",
              "At the moment, there are about 60 start-ups aiming to produce and sell cultivated meat, and not just beef, but also chicken, duck, seafood, foie gras, kangaroo, and more.",
              "Animal welfare is one reason for producing lab-grown meat.",
              "This production method can produce meat without the need for raising and slaughtering a large number of animals and therefore, has the potential to increase animal welfare within the food system.",
              "2 However, the process currently still relies on stem cells obtained from a live animal, and the most widely used culture medium contains fetal bovine serum (FBS), which is collected from foetal blood at animal slaughterhouses, so it is not yet entirely slaughter-free.",
              "3 Some advocates of lab-based meat also consider improved food safety as an advantage of lab-grown meat.",
              "This is because, in the controlled lab environment, meat products will not face the traditional risk of contamination with illness-causing bacteria like E.",
              "coli or Campylobacter, which usually come from the gut of livestock.",

              "4 More sustainable production of protein will be crucial in the next 30 years, considering that the world population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050 and sustainability is an important motivation to produce lab-grown meat.",
              "However, it is not clear yet whether mass-scale production of meat in the lab will be more environmentally sustainable than traditional animal husbandry.",
              "While less of some resources such as water, land and fertilizers, are needed compared to what is needed to grow feed crops and livestock,5,6 other aspects are more complicated.",
              "For example: Lab-grown meat is an old food produced in a new way, which raises a few questions.",
              "In the early days, vegans and vegetarians would have rejected lab-grown meat completely, because it used foetal bovine serum (FBS) as the growth medium.",
              "However since then, companies have been working to replace FBS with a growth medium that doesn\u2019t come from animals, and this was achieved for the first time in 2022.",
              "8 While lab-grown meat is still considered meat, those who refuse to eat meat for animal welfare reasons may choose to eat it when produced in this way.",
              "While Jewish and Muslim religious authorities have yet to express an official opinion on this, some believe that it could eventually be considered kosher or halal.",
              "9,10 Others disagree.",
              "Meat that is kosher or halal must come from an animal that has been slaughtered following specific rules, that can be complicated to apply to this non-traditional production method.",
              "It remains to be seen whether these types of products will be generally accepted as kosher or halal.",
              "As a novel food, cultivated meat must be approved by national food safety authorities before it can be sold to consumers.",
              "The only country in the world where this has happened so far is Singapore, although the US is also making progress towards this goal.",
              "Singapore has introduced strict measures for the safety assessment of cultured meat which is currently regarded as a novel food.",
              "11 In Europe, before a novel food is sold, it must be approved by the European Commission.",
              "Until now, no company or organization has applied for approval, although this is likely to happen in 2023.",
              "Then, the European Safety Authority (EFSA) will review the novel food to determine whether it\u2019s safe for humans.",
              "This review process can last a few years.",

              "12 For now, people seem more likely to prefer plant-based options when considering alternative proteins.",
              "12 However, most available consumer research on lab-based meat is based upon hypothetical situations and very few consumers have had the opportunity to taste cultivated meat so far.",
              "There are not many studies on the sensorial properties, so we don\u2019t have much information about how the taste and texture compares to traditional meat.",
              "It is also difficult to say whether the nutritional value of these novel products will be the same.",
              "The reason for the uncertainty is that producing lab grown meat is complex and expensive and most of the knowledge is owned by the companies who have invested in developing the technology.",
              "There are not many samples available for independent researchers, so much of the available data is so far either theoretical or based on information provided by start-ups themselves.",

              "Here\u2019s what we know so far.",
              "According to researchers in the Journal of Integrative Agriculture, lab-grown meat is made by using the more-than-100-year-old technique of in vitro muscle tissue growth.",
              "\u201cThe process of making cultivated meat is similar to brewing beer, in that this is an industrial cell culture process based upon well-hewn fermentation technology,\u201d says Schuzle.",
              "\u201cHowever, instead of growing yeast or bacteria, we grow animal cells.",
              "We start by taking a small amount of cells from high-quality livestock animals, like a cow or chicken, and then figure out which of those cells have the ability to multiply and form delicious meat food products.",
              "\u201cFrom there, we put the cells in a clean-and-controlled environment and provide them with the essential nutrients they need to naturally replicate and mature.",
              "In essence, we can recreate the conditions that naturally exist inside an animal\u2019s body so that the cells can continue growing.",
              "Once the meat is ready, we harvest it, process it like conventional meat products, and then package, cook or otherwise prepare it for consumption.",
              "\u201d Schuzle adds: \u201cWe\u2019re excited about this as a new way to produce meat because our cells can continue growing many times over as compared to those in the animal.",
              "In effect, we can grow many animals from the cells of just one animal for many years to come.",
              "\u201d Rearing livestock comes with a huge environmental impact.",

              "Research states the production of one kilogram of beef requires 15,414 liters of water on average, while nearly 80% of the world\u2019s agricultural land is used for beef production, according to an article published by the University of Oxford\u2019s Our World in Data.",
              "Improved GHG emission efficiency has been proposed as one of the biggest potential advantages of cultured meat compared with conventional livestock systems. However, this is still a matter of controversy.",
              "According to a 2019 study in the Journal of Scientific Research, \u201creplacing conventionally produced meat with cultured meat could potentially help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, because instead of using larger land for the necessary agricultural crops required for livestock farming, large areas could be released and redeveloped or used for other purposes, such as carbon capture.",
              "\u201d And a 2011 comparative study in the Environmental Science & Technology journal agreed, stating: \u201cIn comparison to conventionally produced European meat, cultured meat involves approximately 7%-45% lower energy use, 78%-96% lower GHG emissions, 99% lower land use, and 82%-96% lower water use depending on the product compared.",
              "\u201d However, a 2020 research article, which contrasted the temperature impact of beef cattle and cultured meat production at all times up to 1,000 years in the future, believes the jury is still out on whether lab-grown meat can provide a more \u201cclimatically sustainable alternative\u201d.",

              "There is a need for detailed and transparent life cycle assessments of real cultured meat production systems. Based on currently available data, cultured production does not necessarily give license for unrestrained meat consumption.",
              "\u201d When lab-grown meat reaches the shelves, it could be healthier than meat reared from livestock.",
              "According to researchers in the Journal of Scientific Research, \u201cthis is due to the capability of the technology to modify the profile of essential amino acids and fats, and to be enriched in vitamins, minerals and bioactive compounds.",

              "This article explains what it is, how it\u2019s made, and the barriers that will need to be overcome if we\u2019re ever going to find it in supermarkets in Europe.",
              "Lab-grown meat refers to meat developed from animal cell culture, and not via traditional raising and slaughter of living animals.",
              "1 It is not an imitation of meat made with other ingredients, like plant-based burgers that are made from plant-based proteins.",
              "The production process can be broken down into four steps:1 The first time a cultivated beef patty was introduced to the world was in August 2013.",
              "The meat was developed by a team led by Mark Post, of Maastricht University.",
              "At the moment, there are about 60 start-ups aiming to produce and sell cultivated meat, and not just beef, but also chicken, duck, seafood, foie gras, kangaroo, and more.",
              "Animal welfare is one reason for producing lab-grown meat.",
              "This production method can produce meat without the need for raising and slaughtering a large number of animals and therefore, has the potential to increase animal welfare within the food system.",
              "2 However, the process currently still relies on stem cells obtained from a live animal, and the most widely used culture medium contains fetal bovine serum (FBS), which is collected from foetal blood at animal slaughterhouses, so it is not yet entirely slaughter-free.",
              "3 Some advocates of lab-based meat also consider improved food safety as an advantage of lab-grown meat.",
              "This is because, in the controlled lab environment, meat products will not face the traditional risk of contamination with illness-causing bacteria like E.",
              "coli or Campylobacter, which usually come from the gut of livestock.",
              "However, as with any industrial food production, microbiological or chemical contamination can still occur at different stages.",

              "4 More sustainable production of protein will be crucial in the next 30 years, considering that the world population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050 and sustainability is an important motivation to produce lab-grown meat.",
              "However, it is not clear yet whether mass-scale production of meat in the lab will be more environmentally sustainable than traditional animal husbandry.",
              "While less of some resources such as water, land and fertilizers, are needed compared to what is needed to grow feed crops and livestock,5,6 other aspects are more complicated.",
              "For example: Lab-grown meat is an old food produced in a new way, which raises a few questions.",
              "In the early days, vegans and vegetarians would have rejected lab-grown meat completely, because it used foetal bovine serum (FBS) as the growth medium.",
              "However since then, companies have been working to replace FBS with a growth medium that doesn\u2019t come from animals, and this was achieved for the first time in 2022.",
              "8 While lab-grown meat is still considered meat, those who refuse to eat meat for animal welfare reasons may choose to eat it when produced in this way.",
              "While Jewish and Muslim religious authorities have yet to express an official opinion on this, some believe that it could eventually be considered kosher or halal.",
              "9,10 Others disagree.",
              "Meat that is kosher or halal must come from an animal that has been slaughtered following specific rules, that can be complicated to apply to this non-traditional production method.",
              "It remains to be seen whether these types of products will be generally accepted as kosher or halal.",
              "As a novel food, cultivated meat must be approved by national food safety authorities before it can be sold to consumers.",
              "The only country in the world where this has happened so far is Singapore, although the US is also making progress towards this goal.",
              "Singapore has introduced strict measures for the safety assessment of cultured meat which is currently regarded as a novel food.",
              "11 In Europe, before a novel food is sold, it must be approved by the European Commission.",
              "Until now, no company or organization has applied for approval, although this is likely to happen in 2023.",
              "Then, the European Safety Authority (EFSA) will review the novel food to determine whether it\u2019s safe for humans.",

              "If lab-grown meat is going to replace a significant percentage of the meat that we eat, consumer acceptance will be key.",
              "Current studies indicate that people are still quite reluctant to accept cultured meat, although acceptance can be increased by the way information about the product is presented.",
              "12 For now, people seem more likely to prefer plant-based options when considering alternative proteins.",
              "12 However, most available consumer research on lab-based meat is based upon hypothetical situations and very few consumers have had the opportunity to taste cultivated meat so far.",
              "There are not many studies on the sensorial properties, so we don\u2019t have much information about how the taste and texture compares to traditional meat.",
              "It is also difficult to say whether the nutritional value of these novel products will be the same.",
              "The reason for the uncertainty is that producing lab grown meat is complex and expensive and most of the knowledge is owned by the companies who have invested in developing the technology.",
              "There are not many samples available for independent researchers, so much of the available data is so far either theoretical or based on information provided by start-ups themselves.",

              "And the emissions from cultivated meat might be significant.",
              "Some of the early work in the field has relied on materials and techniques borrowed from the biopharmaceutical industry, where companies sometimes grow cells in order to produce drugs.",
              "It\u2019s a painstaking and tightly regulated process involving high-purity ingredients, expensive reactors, and a whole lot of energy, says Edward Spang, an associate professor of food science and technology at the University of California, Davis.",
              "Spang and his team set out to estimate the climate impacts of cultivated meat assuming current production techniques.",
              "To quantify the potential climate benefits, the researchers examined the total environmental impacts of both animal agriculture and cultivated meat in an analysis known as a life-cycle assessment.",
              "This type of analysis adds up all the energy, water, and materials needed to make a product, putting everything in terms of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions.",
              "In a recent preprint study that hasn\u2019t yet been peer-reviewed, Spang estimated the total global-warming potential of cultivated meat in several scenarios based on assumptions about the current state of the industry.",
              "The scenarios were divided into two categories.",
              "The first set assumed that cultivated meat would be produced with processes and materials similar to those used in the biopharmaceutical industry\u2014specifically including an energy-intensive purification step to remove contaminants.",
              "The other scenarios assumed that cultivated meat production wouldn\u2019t require ultra-high-purity ingredients and would instead rely on inputs like those used in the food industry today, meaning lower energy requirements and emissions.",
              "The two sets of results have very different climate outcomes.",
              "A food-grade process results in the equivalent of 10 to 75 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions\u2014lower than the global average emissions from beef and in line with production in some countries today.",
              "But in the biopharmaceutical-like process, cultivated meat leads to significantly more emissions than beef production today: between 250 and 1,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent for every kilogram of beef, depending on the specific scenario.",
              "Spang\u2019s preprint, which appeared in April, sparked splashy news headlines about the potential for sky-high emissions.",
              "The study also drew quick criticism from some in the industry, including a widely circulated open letter questioning its assumptions.",
              "Experts particularly took issue with the assumption that materials used in producing cultivated meat would need to use pharmaceutical-grade ingredients and go through intense purification steps to remove contaminants called endotoxins.",
              "Endotoxins are pieces of the outer membranes of some bacteria, and they\u2019re shed as the microbes grow and when they die.",
              "Removing them is often necessary in biopharmaceutical processes, since even very small quantities can harm the growth of some cell types and provoke immune responses.",
              "The process that removes those contaminants is the major contributor to the high emissions seen in one group of the preprint\u2019s scenarios.",
              "However, that purification step won\u2019t be necessary in commercial production of cultivated meat, says Elliot Swartz, a principal scientist at the industry group Good Food Institute and one of the authors of the open letter.",
              "Different cell types are affected by endotoxins differently, and the ones that will be used for cultivated meat should be able to tolerate higher levels, meaning less purification is needed, Swartz says.",
              "The study\u2019s results do differ from those of many previous analyses in the field, which generally found that cultivated meat would reduce emissions compared with conventional beef production.",
              "Most of those studies assume that producers of cultivated meat will be able to avoid the energy-intensive methods described in the preprint, and will instead scale up to large commercial facilities and progress toward using more widely available, food-grade ingredients.",
              "Experience will provide a better picture of the industry\u2019s potential climate impact, says Pelle Sinke, a researcher at CE Delft, an independent research firm and consultancy focusing on energy and the environment.",
              "\u201cIn all innovative technologies, there\u2019s an enormous learning curve,\u201d Sinke says.",
              "\u201cI\u2019m not sure we should worry that much that [cultivated meat] will add an enormous burden to the climate globally.",
              "\u201d In an analysis published in January 2023, he and his team set out to estimate emissions associated with cultivated meat in 2030, assuming that the production process can use food-grade ingredients and will reach commercial scale sometime in the next decade.",
              "That study put the potential climate impact at between three and 14 kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilogram of cultivated meat.",
              "Where the total emissions from cultivated meat production will fall in this range depends largely on where the energy comes from to run the bioreactors: if it comes from the electrical grid, which will still rely partly on fossil fuels, the carbon impact will be much higher than it will be if renewables are used to power the facility.",
              "It also depends on what ingredients are in the media used to grow the cells.",
              "In any case, Sinke\u2019s study found that total emissions would be significantly lower than emissions from beef production, which his study estimated as equivalent to 35 kilograms of carbon dioxide in an optimized system in western Europe.",
              "(Chicken and pork came in at roughly three and five kilograms of carbon dioxide, respectively.)",
              "Sinke\u2019s analysis is far from the first to estimate that cultivated meat could have a smaller climate impact than conventional agriculture.",
              "An early analysis in the field, published in 2011, estimated that cultivated meat production would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by between 78% and 96% compared with meat production in Europe, assuming production took place at commercial scale.",
              "Cultivated meat could eventually have major climate benefits, says Hanna Tuomisto, an associate professor at the University of Helsinki and the lead author of the 2011 study.",
              "Tuomisto recently published another study that also found potential climate benefits for cultivated meat.",
              "However, she adds, the industry\u2019s true climate impacts are yet to be determined.",
              "\u201cThere are many, many open questions still, because not very many companies have built anything at larger scale,\u201d Tuomisto says.",
              "Scaling up to make cultivated meat in larger production facilities is an ongoing process.",
              "Upside Foods, one of the two companies that received the recent USDA nod, currently runs a pilot facility with a maximum capacity of about 400,000 pounds (180,000 kilograms) per year, though its current production capability is closer to 50,000 pounds.",
              "The company\u2019s first commercial facility, which it\u2019s currently in the process of designing, will be much larger, with a capacity of millions of pounds per year.",
              "\"In all innovative technologies, there\u2019s an enormous learning curve.\"",
              "According to internal estimates, Upside\u2019s products should take less water and land to produce than conventional meat, said Eric Schulze, the company\u2019s VP of global scientific and regulatory affairs, in an email.",
              "However, he added, \u201cwe will need to be producing at a larger scale to truly measure and start to see the impact that we want to have.",
              "\u201d Eat Just is currently operating a demonstration plant in the US and constructing one in Singapore.",
              "Those facilities include reactors with capacities of 3,500 and 6,000 liters, respectively.",
              "Eventually, the company plans to produce millions of pounds of meat each year in a future commercial facility containing 10 reactors with a capacity of 250,000 liters each.",
              "There are already \u201cplenty of reasons to be hopeful\u201d about the climate impacts of cultivated meat, said Andrew Noyes, VP of communications at Eat Just, in an email.",
              "\u201cHowever, achieving those goals is dependent on several factors tied to the optimization and scale-up of our production process, as well as the design of future large-scale manufacturing facilities.",
              "\u201d Even though recent regulatory approvals have been celebrated as a milestone for the cultivated meat industry, these products won\u2019t be in your burger joint anytime soon.",
              "To cut their production costs, companies still need to build those larger facilities and get them running smoothly.",
              "Part of that growth will mean turning away from the more expensive equipment and ingredients the industry has borrowed from other businesses, says Jess Krieger, founder and CEO of Ohayo Valley, a cultivated meat company: \u201cThis is not how we\u2019re going to be doing it in the future.",
              "\u201d The factors that led to Spang\u2019s worst-case emissions scenario, like intensive purification, expensive reactors, and pharmaceutical-grade media, aren\u2019t necessary for production, she says.",
              "Growing meat in a lab is still way too expensive.",
              "But mixing it with plants could help finally get it onto our plates.",
              "It is true that early-stage companies still often use pharmaceutical-grade ingredients, says Elliot Swartz of the Good Food Institute.",
              "However, there are already cheaper, food-grade options available on the market.",
              "Both Eat Just and Upside Foods say they plan to use these nonpharmaceutical ingredients in their eventual commercial operations.",
              "Energy-intensive methods aren\u2019t just unsustainable for the planet, says Sinke, the researcher with CE Delft.",
              "Many processes that lean on biopharmaceutical techniques won\u2019t be used in industry not just because they\u2019d produce high emissions, he says, but \u201cbecause nobody can afford them.",
              "\u201d For his part, Spang agrees that economics will likely keep cultivated meat from following the type of production path that would lead to extreme climate impacts.",
              "\u201cIf it requires pharmaceutical inputs, I don\u2019t think there will be much of an industry,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cIt will be too expensive;",
              "I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s a viable pathway.",
              "\u201d But for him, there are still many open questions to answer, and plans to execute, before the industry can start taking credit as a climate solution.",
              "\u201cThe leap from lab-scale science to cost-effective climate impact\u2014there\u2019s a substantial amount of distance there, in my opinion,\u201d Spang says.",
              "It\u2019s still possible for cultivated meat to become a major positive for the climate, especially as renewables like wind and solar become more widely available.",
              "An industry where cells can be grown efficiently in massive reactors while being fed widely available ingredients, in a process all powered by renewable electricity, could be a significant way to help clean up our food system.",
              "But the facilities that would make that possible are mostly still in the planning phases\u2014and it\u2019s not yet clear which path cultivated meat might take to reach our plates.",

              "Spang and his team set out to estimate the climate impacts of cultivated meat assuming current production techniques.",
              "To quantify the potential climate benefits, the researchers examined the total environmental impacts of both animal agriculture and cultivated meat in an analysis known as a life-cycle assessment.",
              "This type of analysis adds up all the energy, water, and materials needed to make a product, putting everything in terms of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions.",
              "In a recent preprint study that hasn\u2019t yet been peer-reviewed, Spang estimated the total global-warming potential of cultivated meat in several scenarios based on assumptions about the current state of the industry.",
              "The scenarios were divided into two categories.",
              "The first set assumed that cultivated meat would be produced with processes and materials similar to those used in the biopharmaceutical industry\u2014specifically including an energy-intensive purification step to remove contaminants.",
              "The other scenarios assumed that cultivated meat production wouldn\u2019t require ultra-high-purity ingredients and would instead rely on inputs like those used in the food industry today, meaning lower energy requirements and emissions.",
              "The two sets of results have very different climate outcomes.",
              "A food-grade process results in the equivalent of 10 to 75 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions\u2014lower than the global average emissions from beef and in line with production in some countries today.",
              "But in the biopharmaceutical-like process, cultivated meat leads to significantly more emissions than beef production today: between 250 and 1,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent for every kilogram of beef, depending on the specific scenario.",
              "Spang\u2019s preprint, which appeared in April, sparked splashy news headlines about the potential for sky-high emissions.",
              "The study also drew quick criticism from some in the industry, including a widely circulated open letter questioning its assumptions.",
              "Experts particularly took issue with the assumption that materials used in producing cultivated meat would need to use pharmaceutical-grade ingredients and go through intense purification steps to remove contaminants called endotoxins.",
              "Endotoxins are pieces of the outer membranes of some bacteria, and they\u2019re shed as the microbes grow and when they die.",
              "Removing them is often necessary in biopharmaceutical processes, since even very small quantities can harm the growth of some cell types and provoke immune responses.",
              "The process that removes those contaminants is the major contributor to the high emissions seen in one group of the preprint\u2019s scenarios.",
              "However, that purification step won\u2019t be necessary in commercial production of cultivated meat, says Elliot Swartz, a principal scientist at the industry group Good Food Institute and one of the authors of the open letter.",
              "Different cell types are affected by endotoxins differently, and the ones that will be used for cultivated meat should be able to tolerate higher levels, meaning less purification is needed, Swartz says.",
              "The study\u2019s results do differ from those of many previous analyses in the field, which generally found that cultivated meat would reduce emissions compared with conventional beef production.",
              "Most of those studies assume that producers of cultivated meat will be able to avoid the energy-intensive methods described in the preprint, and will instead scale up to large commercial facilities and progress toward using more widely available, food-grade ingredients.",
              "Experience will provide a better picture of the industry\u2019s potential climate impact, says Pelle Sinke, a researcher at CE Delft, an independent research firm and consultancy focusing on energy and the environment.",
              "\u201cIn all innovative technologies, there\u2019s an enormous learning curve,\u201d Sinke says.",
              "\u201cI\u2019m not sure we should worry that much that [cultivated meat] will add an enormous burden to the climate globally.",
              "\u201d In an analysis published in January 2023, he and his team set out to estimate emissions associated with cultivated meat in 2030, assuming that the production process can use food-grade ingredients and will reach commercial scale sometime in the next decade.",
              "That study put the potential climate impact at between three and 14 kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilogram of cultivated meat.",
              "Where the total emissions from cultivated meat production will fall in this range depends largely on where the energy comes from to run the bioreactors: if it comes from the electrical grid, which will still rely partly on fossil fuels, the carbon impact will be much higher than it will be if renewables are used to power the facility.",
              "It also depends on what ingredients are in the media used to grow the cells.",
              "In any case, Sinke\u2019s study found that total emissions would be significantly lower than emissions from beef production, which his study estimated as equivalent to 35 kilograms of carbon dioxide in an optimized system in western Europe.",
              "(Chicken and pork came in at roughly three and five kilograms of carbon dioxide, respectively.)",
              "Sinke\u2019s analysis is far from the first to estimate that cultivated meat could have a smaller climate impact than conventional agriculture.",
              "An early analysis in the field, published in 2011, estimated that cultivated meat production would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by between 78% and 96% compared with meat production in Europe, assuming production took place at commercial scale.",
              "Cultivated meat could eventually have major climate benefits, says Hanna Tuomisto, an associate professor at the University of Helsinki and the lead author of the 2011 study.",
              "Tuomisto recently published another study that also found potential climate benefits for cultivated meat.",
              "However, she adds, the industry\u2019s true climate impacts are yet to be determined.",
              "\u201cThere are many, many open questions still, because not very many companies have built anything at larger scale,\u201d Tuomisto says.",
              "Scaling up to make cultivated meat in larger production facilities is an ongoing process.",
              "Upside Foods, one of the two companies that received the recent USDA nod, currently runs a pilot facility with a maximum capacity of about 400,000 pounds (180,000 kilograms) per year, though its current production capability is closer to 50,000 pounds.",
              "The company\u2019s first commercial facility, which it\u2019s currently in the process of designing, will be much larger, with a capacity of millions of pounds per year.",
              "\"In all innovative technologies, there\u2019s an enormous learning curve.\"",
              "According to internal estimates, Upside\u2019s products should take less water and land to produce than conventional meat, said Eric Schulze, the company\u2019s VP of global scientific and regulatory affairs, in an email.",
              "However, he added, \u201cwe will need to be producing at a larger scale to truly measure and start to see the impact that we want to have.",
              "\u201d Eat Just is currently operating a demonstration plant in the US and constructing one in Singapore.",
              "Those facilities include reactors with capacities of 3,500 and 6,000 liters, respectively.",
              "Eventually, the company plans to produce millions of pounds of meat each year in a future commercial facility containing 10 reactors with a capacity of 250,000 liters each.",
              "There are already \u201cplenty of reasons to be hopeful\u201d about the climate impacts of cultivated meat, said Andrew Noyes, VP of communications at Eat Just, in an email.",
              "\u201cHowever, achieving those goals is dependent on several factors tied to the optimization and scale-up of our production process, as well as the design of future large-scale manufacturing facilities.",
              "\u201d Even though recent regulatory approvals have been celebrated as a milestone for the cultivated meat industry, these products won\u2019t be in your burger joint anytime soon.",
              "To cut their production costs, companies still need to build those larger facilities and get them running smoothly.",
              "Part of that growth will mean turning away from the more expensive equipment and ingredients the industry has borrowed from other businesses, says Jess Krieger, founder and CEO of Ohayo Valley, a cultivated meat company: \u201cThis is not how we\u2019re going to be doing it in the future.",
              "\u201d The factors that led to Spang\u2019s worst-case emissions scenario, like intensive purification, expensive reactors, and pharmaceutical-grade media, aren\u2019t necessary for production, she says.",
              "Growing meat in a lab is still way too expensive.",
              "But mixing it with plants could help finally get it onto our plates.",
              "It is true that early-stage companies still often use pharmaceutical-grade ingredients, says Elliot Swartz of the Good Food Institute.",
              "However, there are already cheaper, food-grade options available on the market.",
              "Both Eat Just and Upside Foods say they plan to use these nonpharmaceutical ingredients in their eventual commercial operations.",
              "Energy-intensive methods aren\u2019t just unsustainable for the planet, says Sinke, the researcher with CE Delft.",
              "Many processes that lean on biopharmaceutical techniques won\u2019t be used in industry not just because they\u2019d produce high emissions, he says, but \u201cbecause nobody can afford them.",
              "\u201d For his part, Spang agrees that economics will likely keep cultivated meat from following the type of production path that would lead to extreme climate impacts.",
              "\u201cIf it requires pharmaceutical inputs, I don\u2019t think there will be much of an industry,\u201d he says.",

              "It takes about 100 billion muscle cells to produce a single kilogram, or 2.",
              "2 pounds, of cultured meat.",
              "Growing larger volumes of cultured meat at a faster pace involves making a paste or slurry of cells in a container called a bioreactor.",
              "Unfortunately, without a stiff substrate, meat grown this way lacks the muscle-like structure and therefore, texture and consistency, of what people are used to eating.",
              "Current types of microcarriers can be used to provide a scaffold for cells to attach to, and to organize suspension-grown tissues, but they\u2019re inedible and must be removed from the meat before consumption.",
              "UCLA\u2019s microcarriers can be eaten along with the cultured meat they help grow.",
              "The structure and texture of microcarriers could be tuned to speed up the growth of muscle tissue and to optimize meat texture, Rowat said.",
              "The edible microcarriers also supported growth of bovine muscle cells and yielded beef that browned nicely when cooked.",
              "Rowat and her UCLA lab of students and postdoctoral scholars Sam Norris, Stephanie Kawecki, Ashton Davis and Kathleen Chen, adapted established water-in-oil emulsion techniques to produce edible particles.",
              "They used food ingredients including gelatin and transglutaminase, an enzyme that occurs naturally in meat and mass-produced by bacteria for use as a binding agent in many food products.",
              "This helped them create microcarriers of varying stiffness and stabilize the gelatin.",
              "To customize the microcarrier surface texture for cell attachment and growth, they devised a way to emboss grooves onto the particles.",
              "The group seeded the microcarriers with mouse precursor muscle cells for an initial test run.",
              "They compared the embossed microcarriers to ones with a smooth surface.",
              "As a control, they seeded conventional inedible microcarriers with the same type of cells in a separate flask of growth medium.",
              "After eight days the cells had formed small clumps.",
              "There was no significant difference in the size of clumps on embossed and smooth microcarriers, although cells on the embossed carriers had an initially faster growth spurt.",
              "\u201cWe were excited to see a trend toward quicker growth of muscle cells cultured on the grooved microcarriers,\u201d said Kawecki, the study\u2019s co-author who is one of Rowat\u2019s doctoral students.",
              "\u201cAny time reduction of cell culture time can significantly reduce the cost of cultured meat production, especially when these processes are brought to scale.",
              "\u201d The internal structure of the tissue grown on edible microcarriers looked more like natural muscle tissue than that grown on inedible carriers, suggesting that the edible microcarriers encouraged more natural growth.",
              "Norris, who is a postdoctoral scholar, was surprised to find that cells and microcarriers spontaneously combined to form microtissues that contained a significant amount of myotubes, which are precursors to muscle fibers.",
              "Next, they seeded fresh edible microcarriers with bovine cells and achieved similar results.",
              "\u201cThe fact that we can grow large amounts of protein-rich muscle tissue in a stirred bioreactor is a major step in upscaling the production of true cultured meat,\u201d Norris said.",
              "To harvest the tissues, a centrifuge separated the cell clumps from the growth medium.",
              "They were rinsed to remove traces of growth medium, compressed into a disc two centimeters, or about 3/4 inch, in diameter, and cooked in a frying pan with olive oil.",
              "The cooked patty had the rough, brown surface texture and overall appearance of a tiny hamburger patty.",
              "The researchers said that the microcarrier manufacturing process could be used to produce large amounts of meat quickly and cheaply.",
              "Meat of different textures could be produced by manipulating microcarrier stiffness and texture.",

              "Nonetheless, Singer\u2019s central strategy is to weigh the benefits associated with factory farming against the costs imposed on the animals to determine whether the practice is justified, and he would be willing to regard the slaughter and consumption of animals as morally permissible if the benefits that it secured were significant.",

              "Therefore, for the purposes of this chapter, I\u2019m going to regard a vegan agricultural system as the primary alternative to agricultural systems in which meat is produced.",
              "Growing crops imposes harm on sentient animals\u2014especially rodents\u2014through various field activities like plowing and the use of pesticides, so a purely plant-based agricultural system still causes significant harm to animals.",

              "Similar criteria have been articulated elsewhere by Jeff Sebo.",
              "When considering the desirable alternative to industrialized animal agriculture, he states, \u201cWhat we need, then, is an alternative to conventional meat that provides as many people as possible with healthy, affordable food that they actually want to eat, without causing unnecessary harm to animals, public health, or the environment\u201d (Sebo 2018, p.",

              "Beyond the practical reasons to avoid this narrative, it should also be noted that portraying lab-cultured meat as a standalone solution is at best unrealistic and at worst deceptively misleading.",
              "Lab-cultured meat may be a crucial part of mitigating these problems, but given the remaining hurdles to scaling up lab-cultured meat production and gaining widespread public endorsement of it, more will be needed to properly alter our current agricultural production practices.",
              "Earlier, I noted that the dairy industry involves many of the same moral problems as industrialized meat production.",
              "If the arguments I have made thus far are correct, then we might make an analogous claim with respect to the dairy industry\u2014namely, that we should support the production of animal-free milk.",

              "Can Cultivated Meat Be Truly Slaughter-Free? Omeat Thinks So",
              "Meat made from animals, but without the slaughter \u2014 that\u2019s the vision of the nearly 160 cultivated meat companies working to grow meat from cells rather than sourcing it from factory farms. But the nascent industry isn\u2019t entirely slaughter-free, at least, not yet.",
              "When the handful of start-ups in the industry first began formulating lab grown meat, most used something called fetal bovine serum or FBS, the liquid part of the blood that is primarily sourced from unborn cow fetuses.",
              "It\u2019s a powerful ingredient for growth, but it\u2019s also expensive and controversial.",
              "Many companies in the space have been working on eliminating it from their process entirely, all with varying degrees of success.",
              "Now, one new contender \u2013 Omeat \u2013 is hoping to leave FBS behind, with a different approach to the animals bound up in its system.",
              "\u201cIt all goes to the basic assumptions that we have about what it takes to meet this challenge.",
              "\u201d says Ali Khademhosseini, the founder of Omeat \u2013 a cultivated meat company launching out of stealth today.",
              "\u201cOther companies are mostly trying to fully eliminate animals,\u201d says the biomedical researcher whose resume includes MIT, UCLA and Harvard.",
              "Omeat has a different strategy.",
              "\u201cWe try to address the challenges without having to do that,\u201d he says.",
              "Can animals be part of the process of creating meat without suffering harm?",
              "Omeat thinks the answer is yes.",
              "And the company\u2019s launch coincides with some important industry news: Upside Foods and Good Meat have now both been approved to sell cultivated meat in the United States.",
              "To grow a piece of cultivated meat, researchers usually need two forms of cells: starter cells and growth serums. Starter cells come from whatever animal you want to recreate \u2014 it could be a chicken or a cow or a pig.",
              "These cells need only be collected once, in a process that is relatively painless for the animal.",
              "One cow could theoretically feed millions, because the cells are capable of dividing indefinitely.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s literally billions and billions of times expansion,\u201d explains Khademhosseini.",
              "What happens next is the growth stage.",
              "Scientists take the initial clump of cells and grow it into a bigger blob, aiming for a burger or a nugget.",
              "In order to do that, the cells need the same boost of material that any growing body needs \u2014 a goopy sludge of salts, amino acids and serums that trigger the starter cells to begin the growth process.",
              "Also called \u201cbasal media,\u201d this sludge-like growth medium has been around for decades, typically used to cultivate transplant organs.",
              "Historically, the basal media was made from fetal bovine serum, often referred to as FBS in the industry.",
              "FBS is normally collected from unborn cow fetuses when the mother is slaughtered.",
              "The way FBS is sourced poses a thorny ethical challenge \u2014 and an enormous cost \u2014 for the cultivated meat industry.",
              "Can a product truly be called \u201cslaughter-free\u201d when it uses something sourced from a dead cow?",
              "According to Khademhosseini, nearly all cultivated meat companies are now trying to replace FBS in the same way \u2014 by using recombinant proteins \u2014 strings of amino acids that have been genetically tinkered with in order to stimulate growth in the same way that the FBS does.",
              "Omeat has a different approach, one that involves keeping the cows \u2014 who are very much alive \u2014 in the picture.",
              "Says Khademhosseini, \u201cadult organisms have a lot of regenerative capability.",
              "\u201d Just like all other animals, cows possess \u201cgrowth factors\u201d in their blood that enable them to grow and repair damage.",
              "Could these growth factors be the key to scaling up the industry?",
              "And, is there a way to be able to retrieve them from animals in a way that doesn\u2019t really cause harm, wonders Khademhosseini.",
              "Even better, could it be done so that \u201cthe animal can live a full life and actually create conditions that solve all of the challenges that we\u2019re trying to solve?",
              "\u201d A tall order, perhaps, but Khademhosseini sounds confident.",
              "Omeat plans to extract proteins from the blood plasma of living cows on a continual basis, using the animals as a renewable source of basal media from which the company can cultivate beef.",
              "These same proteins can theoretically be used to create cultivated chicken or pork too, though for now, Omeat is focused solely on beef.",
              "The Southern-California-based company currently has their own farm with 75 cows \u2014 each of whom donates plasma cells on a weekly or biweekly basis.",

              "According to Henrich, native Americans had learned to soak corn with a mixture of burnt shells, or ashes from fire, before cooking and eating it.",
              "This apparently allowed the corn to release essential vitamins.",
              "When Spaniards decided to skip the seemingly strange process and go straight to eating the corn, they developed sometimes deadly vitamin deficiencies.",
              "This illustrates how our willingness to eat new foods can be beneficial but sometimes only if it\u2019s paired with social taboos against certain practices\u2014in this case, against eating corn without going through the proper rituals.",
              "From an evolutionary standpoint, disgust toward novel foods makes sense, as does a disposition to eat novel foods only after performing the right rituals or following the predominant social norms. Food preferences form and crystallize at an early age and mostly reflect the foods we are exposed to (Birch 1999).",
              "Most importantly for clean meat, food neophobia\u2014the aversion to unfamiliar foods\u2014is greater for animal-based foods than plant-based foods (C\u0327\u0131nar, Karinen, and Tybur 2021).",
              "This almost certainly reflects the fact that many of humanity\u2019s deadliest pathogens have come from eating animals rather than plants (Greger 2007).",
              "Thus, it is not surprising that more familiar conventional meat production is generally considered more palatable and less disgusting to the average person than the alternative, since no one grew up with this kind of food (Siegrist and Hartmann 2020).",
              "It is likely that this consideration was part of the branding of cultured meat as \u201cclean meat\u201d rather than \u201clab meat\u201d or \u201cin vitro meat,\u201d which it is sometimes called.",

              "In one survey of American adults, 65 per cent were willing to try clean meat and about one-third said they would be willing to eat clean meat as a replacement for farmed meat (Wilks and Phillips 2017).",
              "Men, who tend to eat more meat than women, also had a more positive view of clean meat in this American sample.",
              "In a sample of over three thousand participants from the United States, India, and China, 93 per cent of Chinese participants said they were likely to purchase clean meat, as were 86 per cent of Indian participants and 75 per cent of American participants (Bryant and Barnett 2020).",
              "In keeping with ideas about sex differences and food aversions, men and those who are less disgust-sensitive are more favourable towards clean meat (Bryant and Barnett 2020).",
              "If clean meat is going to become an important solution to the many problems caused by the global animal industry we must consider how to address the prudential problems of disgust.",
              "One of the main obstacles to producing clean meat is managing contamination, since the animal cells that comprise clean meat do not have a functioning immune system.",
              "Any contamination of clean meat on the market or a recall could have long-term effects on attitudes to clean meat.",
              "This could mean that people will continue to buy more familiar meat, for example from CAFOs, for decades, unless we can maintain high sanitation standards for synthetic meat.",
              "People are often more concerned with what\u2019s delicious than what is virtuous (Bryant and Barnett 2018).",
              "That\u2019s why making sure that clean meat is both safer and tastier than conventional meat can go a long way to inducing ordinary people to want to eat it.",
              "Still, we think that the rise of zoonotic diseases associated with conventional meat production can turn the tide of disgust against forms of animal agriculture that can cause pandemics, and make clean meat more psychologically palatable.",
              "Future marketing campaigns may even be able to make use of video material of the disgusting features of large-scale industrial animal farming, which is not at all appetizing to most people, and compare it to the clean and futuristic looking synthetic meat labs cropping up in places like Holland and Israel.",
              "That is, by highlighting disgusting features of farmed meat, we may be able to reduce the visceral revulsion some may have toward synthetic meat.",
              "Part of our efforts must be directed against an anti-scientific attitude toward \u201cartificial\u201d foods.",
              "\u201cNatural\u201d does not automatically mean good, and highlighting how cruel large-scale industrial farming is toward animals, along with the public health risks it poses to people, may help to reduce the stigma against clean meat.",
              "So far, we have argued that there are good reasons to consume clean meat in order to promote public health and reduce animal cruelty.",
              "But whereas animal suffering can plausibly be reduced with any person choosing to forego meat from slaughterhouses for \u201cbloodless\u201d clean meat, the public health benefits associated with clean meat are largely a function of how many people make the switch away from animal consumption and toward either clean meat or plant-based protein.",
              "Footnote 5 Whether such a significant threshold will be reached is questionable under current conditions, since there may be some reluctance to switch to clean meat to the extent that the benefits of consumption accrue mostly to other people, while the costs are borne by the individual consumer.",
              "The costs might be monetary (until the price of clean meat falls) or aesthetic (to the extent that the taste or texture differs from traditional meat).",
              "In other words, for those who are not already excited by the prospect of eating clean meat, the shift from consuming traditional meat to clean meat may generate a collective action problem deserving of public attention.",
              "Collective action problems occur when there are benefits to a group from each of their members contributing to some collective good but when there are incentives for each to refrain from contributing.",
              "They are close cousins of \u201cpublic goods\u201d problems or \u201ccommons tragedies\u201d in economics and are often modelled by game theorists as multi-player prisoner\u2019s dilemmas or assurance games.",
              "Which model we use to capture a collective action problem depends on the motivations of the people we\u2019re modelling and on what we think the collective benefits and costs of their actions are likely to be.",
              "If clean meat scales in a way that it becomes as cheap and healthy as \u201cnatural\u201d meat, and if it also has collective health and environmental benefits, we might expect everyone to change their eating habits and consume it.",
              "But this is optimistic scenario may not come to pass.",
              "First, as discussed above, many people might need to overcome resistance to what they regard as \u201cartificial\u201d food.",
              "We think this is likely to happen as clean meat becomes a cheap alternative, is understood to be healthy, and social norms change.",
              "But the second reason people might resist clean meat even if the collective benefits are large is that we often ignore the external costs or benefits of our consumption habits.",
              "When the consequences of our actions are borne by other people, we often fail to include them in the implicit cost-benefit analysis each of us does before we act.",
              "For example, when we think about which road to drive on in order to get home quickly, we fail to include the cost we impose on others by increasing congestion on one road and decreasing it on other roads.",
              "When each of us discounts these external effects, it makes little difference.",
              "But when all of us do so, the aggregate effect is big\u2014it is the difference between heavy traffic and light traffic.",
              "In the case of traffic, it\u2019s hard to know what the total effects of our decisions are likely to be.",
              "So it\u2019s both rational and morally excusable to ignore these effects.",
              "However, in the case of other aggregate harms, like the air pollution we cause when we use certain sources of energy, or the public health risks we impose when we consume meat from factory farms, the consequences of our choices are a little clearer.",
              "It\u2019s true that in any given case of contributing to a public health problem like air pollution, we are unlikely to impose any discrete harms on other people.",
              "But it\u2019s also true that in cases like this we are imposing probabilistic harms on others, especially when many other people make the same choices.",
              "Our moral psychology evolved to solve small-scale collective action problems. Our ancestors constantly faced situations in which they could contribute to a collective good, such as banding together to hunt large animals or free ride on the efforts of others.",
              "Moral emotions like shame and guilt for violating pro-social norms, and esteem and pride for following pro-social norms, facilitate the emergence and stability of cooperation (Bowles and Gintis 2013).",
              "But our moral psychology tends to be more effective in getting small groups to cooperate, especially when the harms from not cooperating are immediate and easy to detect.",
              "But when harms are invisible, diffuse, and probabilistic, people tend to ignore them.",
              "Worse still, people are perfectly rational (in the economic sense) to ignore such harms. To the extent that rationality involves using our time and energy to efficiently satisfy our goals, it makes little sense for ordinary people to try to figure out the total consequences of their actions\u2014whether they\u2019re contributing imperceptibly to traffic on the freeway or pollution in the air or public health risks like antibiotic resistance.",
              "It\u2019s virtually impossible for us to calculate the external harms and benefits of our actions, and in many cases we are unlikely to make a significant difference to a cumulative outcome through our individual actions.",
              "For example, if I buy a single slab of roast beef from a butchered cow raised on a factory farm, and thereby slightly increase demand for factory farmed meat, my individual action is unlikely to impose public health risks on other people.",
              "Because most people implicitly understand this, so many don\u2019t investigate the connection between eating factory farmed animal meat and zoonotic viruses or antibiotic resistant bacteria, even if many people are disturbed the cruelty involved in factory farming.",
              "Many Americans think that they should consume less meat, in part because of the cruelty they associate with factory farms. According to a recent survey, 49 per cent of U.",
              "S.",
              "adults supported a ban on factory farming, and 54 per cent said they are trying to consume less meat, dairy, and eggs.",
              "Footnote 6 If consumer behaviour was consistent with these sentiments, we would expect a large proportion of the population to boycott animal products.",
              "But the reality is very different, perhaps because many understand that their personal responsibility for the aggregate harms of factory farming is relatively low.",
              "Indeed, protein-rich alternatives to meat are a niche product, not especially popular outside of affluent parts of rich countries, despite their low price.",
              "This could suggest people will also resist consuming clean meat, despite it having a similar taste and the same amino acid profile as meat from farmed animals.",
              "Moreover, if, as some evidence shows (Herzog 2010), many who label themselves vegetarian are just avoiding red meat for health reasons, it doesn\u2019t seem like the costs associated with factory farming will be solved by the individual actions of consumers.",
              "For this reason, we think it is important to focus on how to harness social norms, information, and marketing to help nudge people from the individually rational to the collectively beneficial action.",
              "When influential people publicly change their actions and attitudes, this can create preference cascades that nudge ordinary people from reluctant to willing consumers.",
              "We do not advocate psychological manipulation to change people\u2019s behaviour, least of all manipulation that comes from government actors, who are especially prone to abusing their power.",
              "But we do want to highlight that most people do not change their minds about how they eat or dress or act by carefully reviewing the arguments and then forging their own path.",
              "The psychological literature is clear that most people copy the behaviour of those they admire, or whose word they consider authoritative.",
              "In other words, they copy the behaviour of elites, or \u201cnorm entrepreneurs\u201d (Ellickson 2001).",
              "Footnote 7 This insight about psychology can be used for malevolent ends.",
              "History is replete with examples of malevolent tyrants or mundane bureaucrats who use their intuitive understanding of human psychology to achieve their own private ends.",
              "But it is perfectly reasonable\u2014even praiseworthy\u2014for influential elites to try to shape public opinion when they have strong reasons to believe that reluctance to adopt a new but socially beneficial norm has resulted from an unjustifiable prejudice.",
              "We think this is clearly the case when it comes to reluctance to consume clean meat.",
              "In this article, we have tried to make a concise case for clean meat by highlighting the immense animal suffering that occurs on factory farms, and the public health consequences of intensive animal farming.",
              "Recent pandemics have made us painfully aware of the potential dangers of diseases \u201cjumping hosts\u201d between animals and humans.",
              "We think it is imperative for animal advocacy organizations and public health advocates to support research into making clean meat significantly cheaper and more widely available.",
              "Nevertheless, we have also acknowledged that resistance to radically new kinds of food poses a psychological barrier that will need to be overcome for clean meat to fulfil its potential as one of the single greatest triumphs of the human species in reducing the suffering of animals, and people.",

              "This happens in a production facility that looks a lot like a brewery: When you picture it, don\u2019t think of people in white coats and hairnets peering through microscopes into petri dishes, but instead people in white coats and hairnets wandering between giant vats.",
