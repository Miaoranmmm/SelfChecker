              "[26] A possible alternative way of rhythmizing the Seikilos song, in order to preserve the iambic ('rising', di-dum) feel of the rhythm, was suggested by Armand D'Angour, with the barlines displaced one quaver to the right, as in the following transcription:[27][28] Stefan Hagel, discussing an example in the Anonymus Bellermanni, suggests the possibility of a similar transcription with displaced barlines of a line of music with this same rhythm.",

              "[29] However, Tosca Lynch argues that this assumption is contradicted by ancient rhythmical theory and practice.",
              "[30] She notes that the song in its conventional transcription corresponds to the rhythm referred to by ancient Greek rhythmicians as an \"iambic dactyl\" (\u03b4\u03b1\u0301\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4 \u0313 \u03b9\u0313\u0301\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bd (da\u0301ktulos kat \u0313 i\u0301ambon) (\u23d1\u23d4 \u205d \u23d1\u23d4) (using the term \"dactyl\" in the rhythmicians' sense of a foot in which the two parts are of equal length) (cf.",

              "[22] Armand D'Angour argues, however, that this does not rule out the possibility of a dynamic stress.",
              "[23] Another view, by Solomon, is that the stigmai \"signify a rhythmical emphasis\".",
              "[24] According to Mathiesen, The meaning of the stigme has been debated for years by scholars.",
              "Is it an ictus mark, does it indicate stress, does it show arsis or thesis, and which part of the foot ought to be called arsis?",
              "[25] A stigme appears on all the syllables of the second half of each bar as it is printed above (for example on \u03bf\u0314\u0301\u03bb\u03c9\u03c2, -\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u0313\u0301\u03c3-, and \u03bf\u0314 \u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u0301\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2).",
              "If the Anonymus Bellermanni source is correct, this implies that whole of the first half of each double-foot bar or measure is the thesis, and the whole of the second half is the arsis.",
              "Stefan Hagel, however, argues that this does not preclude the possibility that within the thesis and arsis there was a further hierarchy of strong and weak notes.",
              "[26] A possible alternative way of rhythmizing the Seikilos song, in order to preserve the iambic ('rising', di-dum) feel of the rhythm, was suggested by Armand D'Angour, with the barlines displaced one quaver to the right, as in the following transcription:[27][28] Stefan Hagel, discussing an example in the Anonymus Bellermanni, suggests the possibility of a similar transcription with displaced barlines of a line of music with this same rhythm.",
              "[29] His hypothesis is based on an assumption about ancient rhythmical theory and practice, namely that \"the regular iambic environment precluded accented shorts altogether;",
              "in other words, the accent of the iambic foot fell on its long\".",
              "[29] However, Tosca Lynch argues that this assumption is contradicted by ancient rhythmical theory and practice.",
              "[30] She notes that the song in its conventional transcription corresponds to the rhythm referred to by ancient Greek rhythmicians as an \"iambic dactyl\" (\u03b4\u03b1\u0301\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4 \u0313 \u03b9\u0313\u0301\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bd (da\u0301ktulos kat \u0313 i\u0301ambon) (\u23d1\u23d4 \u205d \u23d1\u23d4) (using the term \"dactyl\" in the rhythmicians' sense of a foot in which the two parts are of equal length) (cf.",
