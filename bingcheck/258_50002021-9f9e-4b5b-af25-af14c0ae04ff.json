This was also the first comic book to feature advertisements[^5^].\n- The first comic book to introduce a superhero was **Action Comics #1**, published by DC Comics in 1938, featuring the debut of Superman[^1^] [^5^]. This sparked the Golden Age of Comic Books, which lasted until the early 1950s and saw the emergence of other iconic characters like Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain America, and Spider-Man[^4^] [^5^].\n- The first comic book to challenge the Comics Code Authority, a self-regulatory body that imposed censorship on comic books from 1954 to 2011, was **Amazing Spider-Man #96**, published by Marvel Comics in 1971, which dealt with the issue of drug abuse without the CCA's approval[^4^] [^5^]. This marked the beginning of the Bronze Age of Comic Books, which lasted until the mid-1980s and explored more mature and realistic themes[^4^] [^5^].\n- The first comic book to win a Pulitzer Prize was **Maus**, by Art Spiegelman, published by Pantheon Books in 1986 and 1991, which depicted the Holocaust through anthropomorphic animals[^4^] [^5^]. This was a landmark achievement for graphic novels, a term that refers to longer and more literary comic books[^4^] [^5^].\n\nComic books have evolved over time to become a popular form of entertainment worldwide, influenced by various cultural, social, and technological factors.

              "The precursor to comic books, cartoons have been popular in England and America since the early 1800s, originating as satirical and political cartoons printed in newspapers and periodicals.",
              "The most influential cartoonist of this period, Thomas Nast played a large role in bringing down \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed\u2019s corrupt political machine in 1870s New York through a series of cartoons heavily critical of Tweed.",
              "Through a natural evolution, cartoons developed into comic books, first through publications containing compilations of cartoon re-prints, then as books with original cartoon artwork, before reaching critical mass through the creation of superheroes in 1938.",
              "Platinum Age 1897-1938 Published in 1897, The Yellow Kid in McFadden\u2019s Flats is considered to be the first comic book, insomuch that it bore the phrase \u201ccomic book\u201d on its back cover.",
              "Although images of caricatures with related wording have existed since the Middle Ages, comics gained popularity through publication in the British humor magazine, Punch, where a number of Golden Age illustrators honed their craft.",

              "The use of sequential panels and word balloons in the comic strip had a tremendous influence on the future of cartoons and the comic book industry.",
              "Far from the full-color glossy comic books of today, The Yellow Kid in McFadden\u2019s Flats featured black and white reprints of popular newspaper comic strips.",
              "Subsequent comic strip compilation books included reprints of The Katzenjammer Kids, Happy Hooligan, Buster Brown, and Mutt & Jeff.",

              "Silver Age 1956-1970 In 1954, psychiatrist Fredric Wertham wrote in his bestselling book Seduction of the Innocent that comic books of all types were corrupting the youth of America.",
              "Wertham posited that Superman represented fascist ideals, Batman and Robin promoted a homosexual lifestyle, and Wonder Woman was a lesbian with a bondage fixation.",
              "Members of Congress were so alarmed that they called Wertham to testify before the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency.",
              "Sensing public backlash, that same year comic book publishers created the Comics Code Authority in order to self-regulate their industry, much as the Motion Picture Association of America was formed to prevent government involvement in film production.",

              "They revamped existing superheroes and created new superhero characters.",
              "The return of Flash, albeit an updated version of Flash, in Showcase #4 (October 1956) marks the beginning of the Silver Age, when superhero comic books saw a renewed commercial success.",
              "The late 1950s through the 1960s saw a change from dark and supernatural comic book themes to the other end of the spectrum with books containing silly plots and a high degree of camp.",
              "Such plots involved Superbaby and \u201cThe Super-Monkey from Krypton\u201d in Superboy #76 (October 1959) and Batman and Robin teaming up with comedian Jerry Lewis to fight the Joker in Jerry Lewis #97 (December 1966).",
              "Heralding the outrageousness of the Batman television series in the mid-1960s, Batman comic books introduced ridiculous characters such as Batbaby, Bat-Ape, Bat-Mite, and Ace the Bat Hound.",
              "Also during this time, taking the place of serious villains to battle Superman, numerous forms of kryptonite were brought forth\u2014gold, blue, Jewel, red-green, Magno, red-gold kryptonite and Kryptonite Plus.",
              "Bronze Age 1970-1985 The Bronze Age signaled a more realistic style within comic books as a younger generation of artists, including Neal Adams, John Byrne, George Perez, Frank Miller, and others, replaced aging artists who had helped to create the superhero comic books of the 1930s and 1940s.",
              "The beginning of the Bronze Age of comic books is marked by the shocking murder of Peter Parker\u2019s girlfriend Gwen Stacy at the hands of the Green Goblin in Amazing Spider-Man #121-122 (June-July 1973).",
              "In a genre where heroes are relied upon to surmount almost any challenge, it was revolutionary to illustrate the brutal murder of an innocent character alongside the ultimate failure of her anticipated savior.",
              "In 1971, the Comics Code Authority relaxed some standards, going so far as to state, \u201cVampires, ghouls, and werewolves shall be permitted to be used when handled in the classic tradition .",

              ".",

              "Additional supernatural characters Man-Bat, Swamp Thing, and Blade were introduced in the early 1970s.",
              "In addition, socially conscious stories became more numerous in the 1970s, most famously during the collaborative adventures of Green Lantern and Green Arrow as they fought against racism, pollution, and social injustice.",
              "Green Arrow also confronted his sidekick Speedy\u2019s heroin addiction while Iron Man came to terms with his alcoholism.",
              "Understanding that a vast majority of their superheroes were Caucasian men, DC and Marvel introduced a slew of minority superheroes such as Storm, Black Lightning, Blade, and the Green Lantern John Stewart.",
              "Dark Age 1985-1996 Kicking off the Dark Age of comic books was the publication of the monumental series Crisis on Infinite Earths.",
              "To commemorate DC Comics\u2019 50th anniversary, DC published Crisis on Infinite Earths as a 12-issue comic book event.",
              "In this series, DC planned to clear up decades of plot inconsistencies, as well as bring together conflicting characters from the Golden Age and the Silver Age.",
              "The idea was to have multiple alternate realities brought together to make one consistent reality, as in reconciling how Green Lantern Alan Scott from the 1940s can exist in the same reality as Green Lantern Hal Jordan of the 1960s.",
              "To wit, the Justice Society of the 1940s (with their Green Lantern) could exist at the same time as the Justice League of the 1960s (with a different Green Lantern).",
              "To solve some of the inconsistencies, certain major characters were killed off and characters long out of play were brought back with new storylines.",
              "Ultimately Crisis on Infinite Earths was a major success for DC Comics.",
              "From the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, anti-heroes were popular.",
              "Dark, pessimistic stories reigned, as in Alan Moore\u2019s Watchmen, where a world looks down on once mighty superheroes or in Frank Miller\u2019s Batman: The Dark Knight Returns where a 55-year-old Batman has retired from crime-fighting, leaving criminals to terrorize Gotham City.",
              "Readers witnessed Superman dying, Batman becoming critically injured, and Green Lantern Hal Jordan slaughtering his fellow Green Lanterns.",
              "The Dark Age also saw the publication of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus, Art Spiegelman\u2019s moving, autobiographical tale of a Jewish family in Poland living through the reign of Nazi Germany.",
              "This period ends with a massive sales slump and industry downsizing caused by a speculator\u2019s market where excess merchandise, too many collector\u2019s editions, and too many series were produced in an inflated market.",
              "The sales slump contributed to the bankruptcy of Marvel Comics in 1996.",
              "Modern Age 1996-Present The publication of Alex Ross\u2019s Kingdom Come in 1996, which harkened back to the optimism and strength of Silver Age superheroes, marks the beginning of the Modern Age.",
              "During this period, comic book publishers attempted to rectify their mistakes by creating a leaner business plan and putting more effort into a fewer number of projects.",
              "Following the dismal failure of the motion picture Batman and Robin (1997), superhero films were put on ice for retooling.",
              "In 2000, the modest success of The X-Men helped put the popularity of the superhero movie back on track.",
              "Over eighty years since the debut of Superman, the comic book industry has remained relevant through the early adoption of digital comics, successful saturation into the film and television markets, and maintaining a strong connection to their fan-base.",

              "Following a tumultuous decade of assassinations, riots, advances in civil rights, and increasing mistrust of government largely due to the Vietnam War, the first revision of the Code since its 1954 implementation allowed comics to inch somewhat closer to gritty reality.",

              "\u201d Indeed, the rejection of the anti-drug storyline simply highlighted the absurdity of the Code, which was revised again that same year to clarify that drug addiction could be mentioned as long as it was portrayed \u201cas a vicious habit.",

              "Instead, a number of events at the beginning of the 1970s, taken together, can be seen as a shift away from the tone of comics in the previous decade.",

              "The series, written by Denny O'Neil and penciled by Neal Adams (inking was by Adams or Dick Giordano), focused on \"relevance\" as Green Lantern was exposed to poverty and experienced self-doubt.",

              "The beginning of the Bronze Age coincided with the end of the careers of many of the veteran writers and artists of the time, or their promotion to management positions and retirement from regular writing or drawing, and their replacement with a younger generation of editors and creators, many of whom knew each other from their experiences in comic book fan conventions and publications.",
              "At the same time, publishers began the era by scaling back on their superhero publications, canceling many of the weaker-selling titles, and experimenting with other genres such as horror and sword and sorcery.",

              "Newer publishers, such as Pacific Comics and Eclipse Comics, negotiated contracts in which creators retained copyright to their creations.",

              "Before the 1970s, there had been very few non-white superheroes (Marvel Comics' Black Panther and Falcon introduced in 1966 and 1969, respectively, being notable exceptions) but starting in the early 1970s this began to change with the introduction of characters such as Marvel's Luke Cage (who was the first black superhero featured in his own comic book in 1972) of the Defenders, Storm of the X-Men, Blade, Monica Rambeau of the Avengers, Misty Knight, Shang-Chi, and DC's Green Lantern John Stewart, Bronze Tiger, Black Lightning, Vixen and Cyborg of Teen Titans, many of whom were black (with the exception of Shang-Chi himself).",
              "Additionally, Jewish superheroes became more visible with the appearances of Marvel's Kitty Pryde of the X-Men and Moon Knight, respectively.",
              "Characters such as Luke Cage, Mantis, Misty Knight, Shang-Chi and Iron Fist have been seen by some as an attempt by Marvel Comics to cash in on the 1970s crazes for kung fu films. However, these and other minority characters came into their own after these film trends faded, and became increasingly popular and important as time progressed.",
              "By the mid-1980s, Storm and Cyborg had become leaders of the X-Men and Teen Titans, respectively, and John Stewart briefly replaced Hal Jordan as the lead character of the Green Lantern title.",

              "A secondary line of comics at DC, headed by former EC Comics artist Joe Orlando and devoted to horror titles, established a differing set of styles and aggressively sought talent from Asia and Latin America.",
              "[citation needed] The X-Men were originally created in 1963 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.",
              "However, the title never achieved the popularity of other Lee/Kirby creations, and by 1970, after a brief run with Neal Adams' more realistic Silver Age style, Marvel ceased publishing new material and the title was turned over to reprints.",
              "But in 1975 an \"all-new, all-different\" version of the X-Men was introduced by Len Wein and Dave Cockrum in Giant-Size X-Men #1, with Chris Claremont as uncredited assistant co-plotter.",
              "[4] Claremont stayed as writer on just about all X-Men-related titles, including spinoffs, for the next sixteen years, after which other regular writers such as Louise Simonson, Fabian Nicieza and Scott Lobdell joined and Claremont eventually left.",
              "One of the most apparent influences from this series was the creation of what became DC Comics' answer to X-Men's character-based storytelling style, The New Teen Titans by Marv Wolfman and George Pe\u0301rez, which became a highly successful and influential property in its own right.",
              "Wolfman would associate himself with the title for sixteen years, while Perez established a large fan base and a sought-after pencilling style.",
              "A successful cartoon based on the Titans of the Bronze Age of Comics was launched in 2003, and lasted for four years.",
              "[citation needed] During the Silver Age, comic books frequently had several features, a form harkening back to the Golden Age when the first comics were anthologies.",
              "In 1968, Marvel graduated its double feature characters appearing in their anthologies to full-length stories in their own comic.",
              "But several of these characters could not sustain their own title and were cancelled.",

              "It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor.",
              "The work employs postmodern techniques, and represents Jews as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs.",

              "Her grief-stricken husband destroyed her written accounts of Auschwitz.",
              "The book uses a minimalist drawing style and displays innovation in its pacing, structure, and page layouts.",
              "A three-page strip also called \"Maus\" that he made in 1972 gave Spiegelman an opportunity to interview his father about his life during World War II.",

              "[44] Around this time, Spiegelman read in fanzines about such graphic artists as Frans Masereel who had made wordless novels.",
              "The discussions in those fanzines about making the Great American Novel in comics inspired him.",
              "[45] Spiegelman became a key figure in the underground comix movement of the 1970s, both as cartoonist and editor.",
              "[46] In 1972 Justin Green produced the semi-autobiographical comic book Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary, which inspired other underground cartoonists to produce more personal and revealing work.",
              "[47] The same year, Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three-page strip for the first issue of Funny Aminals, which Green edited.",
              "[46] Spiegelman wanted to do a strip about racism, and at first considered focusing on African Americans,[48] with cats as Ku Klux Klan members chasing African-American mice.",
              "[49] Instead, he turned to the Holocaust and depicted Nazi cats persecuting Jewish mice in a strip he titled \"Maus\".",
              "The tale was narrated to a mouse named \"Mickey\".",
              "[46] After finishing the strip, Spiegelman visited his father to show him the finished work, which he had based in part on an anecdote he had heard about his father's Auschwitz experience.",
              "His father gave him further background information, which piqued Spiegelman's interest.",
              "Spiegelman recorded a series of interviews over four days with his father, which was to provide the basis of the longer Maus.",
              "[50] Spiegelman followed up with extensive research, reading survivors' accounts and talking to friends and family who had also survived.",
              "He got detailed information about Sosnowiec from a series of Polish pamphlets published after the war which detailed what happened to the Jews by region.",
              "[51] In 1973, Spiegelman produced a strip for Short Order Comix #1[52] about his mother's suicide called \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\".",
              "The same year, he edited a pornographic, psychedelic book of quotations, and dedicated it to his mother.",
              "[37] He spent the rest of the 1970s building his reputation making short avant-garde comics.",
              "He moved back to New York from San Francisco in 1975, which he admitted to his father only in 1977, by which time he had decided to work on a \"very long comic book\".",
              "[15] He began another series of interviews with his father in 1978,[44] and visited Auschwitz in 1979.",
              "[53] He serialized the story in a comics and graphics magazine he and his wife Mouly began in 1980 called Raw.",
              "[54] American comic books were big business with a diversity of genres in the 1940s and 1950s, but had reached a low ebb by the late 1970s.",
              "[55][56] By the time Maus began serialization, the \"Big Two\" comics publishers, Marvel and DC Comics, dominated the industry with mostly superhero titles.",
              "[57] The underground comix movement that had flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s also seemed moribund.",
              "[58] The public perception of comic books was as adolescent power fantasies, inherently incapable of mature artistic or literary expression.",
              "[59] Most discussion focused on comics as a genre rather than as a medium.",
              "[60] Maus came to prominence when the term \"graphic novel\" was beginning to gain currency.",
              "Will Eisner popularized the term with the publication in 1978 of A Contract with God.",
              "The term was used partly to rise above the low cultural status that comics had in the English-speaking world, and partly because the term \"comic book\" was being used to refer to short-form periodicals, leaving no accepted vocabulary with which to talk about book-form comics.",
              "[61] The first chapter of Maus appeared in December 1980 in the second issue of Raw[45] as a small insert;",
              "a new chapter appeared in each issue until the magazine came to an end in 1991.",
              "Every chapter but the last appeared in Raw.",
              "[62] Spiegelman struggled to find a publisher for a book edition of Maus,[41] but after a rave New York Times review of the serial in August 1986, Pantheon Books published the first six chapters in a volume[63] called Maus: A Survivor's Tale and subtitled My Father Bleeds History.",
              "Spiegelman was relieved that the book's publication preceded the theatrical release of the animated film An American Tail by three months, as he believed that the film, produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, was inspired by Maus and wished to avoid comparisons with it.",
              "[64] The book found a large audience, partly because of its distribution through bookstores rather than the direct market comic shops where comic books were normally sold.",
              "[65] Maus was difficult for critics and reviewers to classify, and also for booksellers, who needed to know on which shelves to place it.",
              "Though Pantheon pushed for the term \"graphic novel\", Spiegelman was not comfortable with this, as many book-length comics were being referred to as \"graphic novels\" whether or not they had novelistic qualities.",
              "He suspected the term's use was an attempt to validate the comics form, rather than to describe the content of the books.",
              "[61] Spiegelman later came to accept the term, and with Drawn & Quarterly publisher Chris Oliveros successfully lobbied the Book Industry Study Group in the early 2000s to include \"graphic novel\" as a category in bookstores.",
              "[66] Pantheon collected the last five chapters in 1991 in a second volume subtitled And Here My Troubles Began.",
              "Pantheon later collected the two volumes into soft- and hardcover two-volume boxed sets and single-volume editions.",
              "[67] In 1994 the Voyager Company released The Complete Maus on CD-ROM, a collection which contained the original comics, Vladek's taped transcripts, filmed interviews, sketches, and other background material.",
              "[68] The CD-ROM was based on HyperCard, a Macintosh and Apple IIGS application that has since become obsolete.",
              "[69] In 2011 Pantheon Books published a companion to The Complete Maus entitled MetaMaus, with further background material, including filmed footage of Vladek.",
              "[41] The centerpiece of the book is a Spiegelman interview conducted by Hillary Chute.",
              "It also has interviews with Spiegelman's wife and children, sketches, photographs, family trees, assorted artwork, and a DVD with video, audio, photos, and an interactive version of Maus.",
              "[70] Spiegelman dedicated Maus to his brother Richieu and his first daughter Nadja.",
              "[71] The book's epigraph is a quote from Adolf Hitler: \"The Jews are undoubtedly a race, but they are not human\".",
              "[72] Penguin Books obtained the rights to publish the initial volume in the Commonwealth in 1986.",
              "In support of the African National Congress's cultural boycott in opposition to apartheid, Spiegelman refused to \"compromise with fascism\" by allowing publication of his work in South Africa.",
              "[73] By 2011, Maus had been translated into about 30 languages.",
              "Three translations were particularly important to Spiegelman: French, as his wife was French, and because of his respect for the sophisticated Franco-Belgian comics tradition;",
              "German, given the book's background;",
              "and Polish.",
              "Poland was the setting for most of the book, and Polish was the language of his parents and his own mother tongue.",
              "[74] The publishers of the German edition had to convince the German culture ministry of the work's serious intent to have the swastika appear on the cover, per laws prohibiting the display of Nazi symbolism.",
              "[75] Reception in Germany was positive\u2014Maus was a best-seller and was taught in schools.",
              "The Polish translation encountered difficulties;",
              "as early as 1987, when Spiegelman planned a research visit to Poland, the Polish consulate official who approved his visa questioned him about the Poles' depiction as pigs, and pointed out how serious an insult it was.",
              "Publishers and commentators refused to deal with the book for fear of protests and boycotts.",
              "[74] Piotr Bikont, a journalist for Gazeta Wyborcza, set up his own publishing house to publish Maus in Polish in 2001.",
              "Demonstrators protested Maus's publication and burned the book in front of Gazeta's offices.",
              "Bikont's response was to don a pig mask and wave to the protesters from the office windows.",
              "[76] The magazine-sized Japanese translation was the only authorized edition with larger pages.",
              "[77] Long-standing plans for an Arabic translation have yet to come to fruition.",
              "[49] A Russian law passed in December 2014 prohibiting the display of Nazi propaganda led to the removal of Maus from Russian bookstores leading up to Victory Day due to the swastika appearing on the book's cover.",
              "[75] Now the book is wildely avialable again, with a slightly modified cover.",
              "[78] A few panels were changed for the Hebrew edition of Maus.",
              "Based on Vladek's memory, Spiegelman portrayed one of the minor characters as a member of the Nazi-installed Jewish Police.",
              "An Israeli descendant objected and threatened to sue for libel.",
              "Spiegelman redrew the character with a fedora in place of his original police hat, but appended a note to the volume voicing his objection to this \"intrusion\".",
              "[79] This version of the first volume appeared in 1990 from the publishing house Zmora Bitan.",
              "It had an indifferent or negative reception, and the publisher did not release the second volume.",
              "[80] Another Israeli publisher put out both volumes, with a new translation by poet Yehuda Vizan that included Vladek's broken language, which Zmora Bitan had refused to do.",
              "[81] Marilyn Reizbaum saw this as highlighting a difference between the self-image of the Israeli Jew as a fearless defender of the homeland, and that of the American Jew as a feeble victim,[82] something that one Israeli writer disparaged as \"the diaspora sickness\".",
              "[83][f] Spiegelman, like many of his critics, has expressed concern that \"[r]eality is too much for comics .",

              "[84] He takes a postmodern approach;",
              "Maus \"feeds on itself\", telling the story of how the story was made.",
              "It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to make.",
              "For example, when his French wife converts to Judaism, Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal.",

              "Art's \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\" is also encompassed by the frame, and stands in visual and thematic contrast with the rest of the book as the characters are in human form[52] in a surreal, German Expressionist woodcut style inspired by Lynd Ward.",

              "Maus - Wikipedia",
              "Maus,[a] often published as Maus: A Survivor's Tale, is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman, serialized from 1980 to 1991.",
              "It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor.",
              "The work employs postmodern techniques, and represents Jews as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs respectively.",
              "Critics have classified Maus as memoir, biography, history, fiction, autobiography, or a mix of genres.",
              "In 1992 it became the first graphic novel to win a Pulitzer Prize.",
              "In the frame-tale timeline in the narrative present that begins in 1978 in New York City, Spiegelman talks with his father Vladek about his Holocaust experiences, gathering material and information for the Maus project he is preparing.",
              "In the narrative past, Spiegelman depicts these experiences, from the years leading up to World War II to his parents' liberation from the Nazi concentration camps.",
              "Much of the story revolves around Spiegelman's troubled relationship with his father and the absence of his mother, who died by suicide when Spiegelman was 20.",
              "Her grief-stricken husband destroyed her written accounts of Auschwitz.",
              "The book uses a minimalist drawing style and displays innovation in its pacing, structure, and page layouts.",
              "A three-page strip also called \"Maus\" that he made in 1972 gave Spiegelman an opportunity to interview his father about his life during World War II.",
              "The recorded interviews became the basis for the book, which Spiegelman began in 1978.",
              "He serialized Maus from 1980 until 1991 as an insert in Raw, an avant-garde comics and graphics magazine published by Spiegelman and his wife, Franc\u0327oise Mouly, who also appears in Maus.",
              "A collected volume of the first six chapters that appeared in 1986, Maus I: My Father Bleeds History, brought the book mainstream attention;",
              "a second volume, Maus II: And Here My Troubles Began, collected the remaining chapters in 1991.",
              "Maus was one of the first books in graphic novel format to receive significant academic attention in the English-speaking world.",
              "Most of the book weaves in and out of two timelines.",
              "In the frame tale of the narrative present, Spiegelman interviews his father Vladek in the Rego Park neighborhood of Queens in New York City in 1978\u201379.",
              "[1][2][3] The story that Vladek tells unfolds in the narrative past, which begins in the mid-1930s, and continues until the end of the Holocaust in 1945.",
              "[2][4] In Rego Park in 1958,[3] a young Art Spiegelman is skating with his friends when he falls down and hurts himself, but his friends keep going.",
              "When he returns home, he finds his father Vladek, who asks him why he is upset, and Art proceeds to tell him that his friends left him behind.",
              "His father responds in broken English, \"Friends?",
              "Your friends?",
              "If you lock them together in a room with no food for a week, then you could see what it is, friends!\"",
              "[5] As an adult, Art visits his father, from whom he has become estranged.",
              "[6] Vladek has remarried to a woman called Mala since the suicide of Art's mother Anja in 1968.",
              "[7] Art asks Vladek to recount his Holocaust experiences.",
              "[6] Vladek tells of his time in the Polish city of Cze\u0328stochowa[8] and how he came to marry into Anja's wealthy family in 1937 and move to Sosnowiec to become a manufacturer.",
              "Vladek begs Art not to include this in the book and Art reluctantly agrees.",
              "[9] Anja suffers a breakdown due to postpartum depression after giving birth to their first son Richieu,[b] and the couple go to a sanitarium in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia for her to recover.",
              "After they return, political and anti-Semitic tensions build until Vladek is drafted just before the Nazi invasion of Poland.",
              "Vladek is captured at the front and forced to work as a prisoner of war.",
              "After his release, he finds Germany has annexed Sosnowiec, and he is dropped off on the other side of the border in the German protectorate.",
              "He sneaks across the border and reunites with his family.",
              "[12] During one of Art's visits, he finds that a friend of Mala's has sent the couple one of the underground comix magazines Art contributed to.",
              "Mala had tried to hide it, but Vladek finds and reads it.",
              "In \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\", Art is traumatized by his mother's suicide three months after his release from the mental hospital, and in the end depicts himself behind bars saying, \"You murdered me, Mommy, and left me here to take the rap!\"",
              "[13][14] Though it brings back painful memories, Vladek admits that dealing with the issue in such a way was for the best.",
              "[15] In 1943, the Nazis move the Jews of the Sosnowiec Ghetto to Srodula and march them back to Sosnowiec to work.",
              "The family splits up\u2014Vladek and Anja send Richieu to Zawiercie to stay with an aunt for safety.",
              "As more Jews are sent from the ghettos to Auschwitz, the aunt poisons herself, her children and Richieu to death to escape the Gestapo and not die in the gas chamber.",
              "In Srodula, many Jews build bunkers to hide from the Germans.",
              "Vladek's bunker is discovered and he is placed into a \"ghetto inside the ghetto\" surrounded by barbed wire.",
              "The remnants of Vladek and Anja's family are taken away.",
              "[12] Srodula is cleared of its Jews, except for a group Vladek hides with in another bunker.",
              "When the Germans depart, the group splits up and leaves the ghetto.",
              "[16] In Sosnowiec, Vladek and Anja move from one hiding place to the next, making occasional contact with other Jews in hiding.",
              "Vladek disguises himself as an ethnic Pole and hunts for provisions.",
              "The couple arrange with smugglers to escape to Hungary, but it is a trick\u2014the Gestapo arrest them on the train (as Hungary is invaded) and take them to Auschwitz, where they are separated until after the war.",
              "[16] Art asks after Anja's diaries, which Vladek tells him were her account of her Holocaust experiences and the only record of what happened to her after her separation from Vladek at Auschwitz and which Vladek says she had wanted Art to read.",
              "Vladek comes to admit that he burned them after she killed herself.",
              "Art is enraged and calls Vladek a \"murderer\".",
              "[17] The story jumps to 1986, after the first six chapters of Maus have appeared in a collected edition.",
              "Art is overcome with the unexpected attention the book receives[4] and finds himself \"totally blocked\".",
              "Art talks about the book with his psychiatrist Paul Pavel, a Czech Holocaust survivor.",
              "[18] Pavel suggests that, as those who perished in the camps can never tell their stories, \"maybe it's better not to have any more stories\".",
              "Art replies with a quote from Samuel Beckett: \"Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness\", but then realizes, \"on the other hand, he said it\".",
              "[19] Vladek tells of his hardship in the camps, of starvation and abuse, of his resourcefulness, of avoiding the selektionen\u2014the process by which prisoners were selected for further labor or execution.",
              "[20] Despite the danger, Anja and Vladek exchange occasional messages.",
              "As the war progresses and the German front is pushed back, the prisoners are marched from Auschwitz in occupied Poland to Gross-Rosen within the Reich and then to Dachau, where the hardships only increase and Vladek catches typhus.",
              "[21] The war ends, the camp survivors are freed and Vladek and Anja reunite.",
              "The book closes with Vladek turning over in his bed as he finishes his story and telling Art, \"I'm tired from talking, Richieu, and it's enough stories for now\".",
              "[22] The final image is of Vladek and Anja's tombstone[23]\u2014Vladek died in 1982, before the book was completed.",
              "[24] Art Spiegelman was born on February 15, 1948, in Sweden to Polish Jews and Holocaust survivors Vladek and Anja Spiegelman.",
              "An aunt poisoned his parents' first son Richieu to avoid capture by the Nazis, four years before Spiegelman's birth.",
              "[41] He and his parents emigrated to the United States in 1951.",
              "[42] During his youth his mother occasionally talked about Auschwitz, but his father did not want him to know about it.",
              "[27] Spiegelman developed an interest in comics early and began drawing professionally at 16.",
              "[43] He spent a month in Binghamton State Mental Hospital in 1968 after a nervous breakdown.",
              "Shortly after he got out, his mother died by suicide.",
              "[2] Spiegelman's father was not happy with his son's involvement in the hippie subculture.",
              "Spiegelman said that when he bought himself a German Volkswagen it damaged their already-strained relationship \"beyond repair\".",
              "[44] Around this time, Spiegelman read in fanzines about such graphic artists as Frans Masereel who had made wordless novels.",
              "The discussions in those fanzines about making the Great American Novel in comics inspired him.",
              "[45] Spiegelman became a key figure in the underground comix movement of the 1970s, both as cartoonist and editor.",
              "[46] In 1972 Justin Green produced the semi-autobiographical comic book Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary, which inspired other underground cartoonists to produce more personal and revealing work.",
              "[47] The same year, Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three-page strip for the first issue of Funny Aminals, which Green edited.",
              "[46] Spiegelman wanted to do a strip about racism, and at first considered focusing on African Americans,[48] with cats as Ku Klux Klan members chasing African-American mice.",
              "[49] Instead, he turned to the Holocaust and depicted Nazi cats persecuting Jewish mice in a strip he titled \"Maus\".",
              "The tale was narrated to a mouse named \"Mickey\".",
              "[46] After finishing the strip, Spiegelman visited his father to show him the finished work, which he had based in part on an anecdote he had heard about his father's Auschwitz experience.",
              "His father gave him further background information, which piqued Spiegelman's interest.",
              "Spiegelman recorded a series of interviews over four days with his father, which was to provide the basis of the longer Maus.",
              "[50] Spiegelman followed up with extensive research, reading survivors' accounts and talking to friends and family who had also survived.",
              "He got detailed information about Sosnowiec from a series of Polish pamphlets published after the war which detailed what happened to the Jews by region.",
              "[51] In 1973, Spiegelman produced a strip for Short Order Comix #1[52] about his mother's suicide called \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\".",
              "The same year, he edited a pornographic, psychedelic book of quotations, and dedicated it to his mother.",
              "[37] He spent the rest of the 1970s building his reputation making short avant-garde comics.",
              "He moved back to New York from San Francisco in 1975, which he admitted to his father only in 1977, by which time he had decided to work on a \"very long comic book\".",
              "[15] He began another series of interviews with his father in 1978,[44] and visited Auschwitz in 1979.",
              "[53] He serialized the story in a comics and graphics magazine he and his wife Mouly began in 1980 called Raw.",
              "[54] American comic books were big business with a diversity of genres in the 1940s and 1950s, but had reached a low ebb by the late 1970s.",
              "[55][56] By the time Maus began serialization, the \"Big Two\" comics publishers, Marvel and DC Comics, dominated the industry with mostly superhero titles.",
              "[57] The underground comix movement that had flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s also seemed moribund.",
              "[58] The public perception of comic books was as adolescent power fantasies, inherently incapable of mature artistic or literary expression.",
              "[59] Most discussion focused on comics as a genre rather than as a medium.",
              "[60] Maus came to prominence when the term \"graphic novel\" was beginning to gain currency.",
              "Will Eisner popularized the term with the publication in 1978 of A Contract with God.",
              "The term was used partly to rise above the low cultural status that comics had in the English-speaking world, and partly because the term \"comic book\" was being used to refer to short-form periodicals, leaving no accepted vocabulary with which to talk about book-form comics.",
              "[61] The first chapter of Maus appeared in December 1980 in the second issue of Raw[45] as a small insert;",
              "a new chapter appeared in each issue until the magazine came to an end in 1991.",
              "Every chapter but the last appeared in Raw.",
              "[62] Spiegelman struggled to find a publisher for a book edition of Maus,[41] but after a rave New York Times review of the serial in August 1986, Pantheon Books published the first six chapters in a volume[63] called Maus: A Survivor's Tale and subtitled My Father Bleeds History.",
              "Spiegelman was relieved that the book's publication preceded the theatrical release of the animated film An American Tail by three months, as he believed that the film, produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, was inspired by Maus and wished to avoid comparisons with it.",
              "[64] The book found a large audience, partly because of its distribution through bookstores rather than the direct market comic shops where comic books were normally sold.",
              "[65] Maus was difficult for critics and reviewers to classify, and also for booksellers, who needed to know on which shelves to place it.",
              "Though Pantheon pushed for the term \"graphic novel\", Spiegelman was not comfortable with this, as many book-length comics were being referred to as \"graphic novels\" whether or not they had novelistic qualities.",
              "He suspected the term's use was an attempt to validate the comics form, rather than to describe the content of the books.",
              "[61] Spiegelman later came to accept the term, and with Drawn & Quarterly publisher Chris Oliveros successfully lobbied the Book Industry Study Group in the early 2000s to include \"graphic novel\" as a category in bookstores.",
              "[66] Pantheon collected the last five chapters in 1991 in a second volume subtitled And Here My Troubles Began.",
              "Pantheon later collected the two volumes into soft- and hardcover two-volume boxed sets and single-volume editions.",
              "[67] In 1994 the Voyager Company released The Complete Maus on CD-ROM, a collection which contained the original comics, Vladek's taped transcripts, filmed interviews, sketches, and other background material.",
              "[68] The CD-ROM was based on HyperCard, a Macintosh and Apple IIGS application that has since become obsolete.",
              "[69] In 2011 Pantheon Books published a companion to The Complete Maus entitled MetaMaus, with further background material, including filmed footage of Vladek.",
              "[41] The centerpiece of the book is a Spiegelman interview conducted by Hillary Chute.",
              "It also has interviews with Spiegelman's wife and children, sketches, photographs, family trees, assorted artwork, and a DVD with video, audio, photos, and an interactive version of Maus.",
              "[70] Spiegelman dedicated Maus to his brother Richieu and his first daughter Nadja.",
              "[71] The book's epigraph is a quote from Adolf Hitler: \"The Jews are undoubtedly a race, but they are not human\".",
              "[72] Penguin Books obtained the rights to publish the initial volume in the Commonwealth in 1986.",
              "In support of the African National Congress's cultural boycott in opposition to apartheid, Spiegelman refused to \"compromise with fascism\" by allowing publication of his work in South Africa.",
              "[73] By 2011, Maus had been translated into about 30 languages.",
              "Three translations were particularly important to Spiegelman: French, as his wife was French, and because of his respect for the sophisticated Franco-Belgian comics tradition;",
              "German, given the book's background;",
              "and Polish.",
              "Poland was the setting for most of the book, and Polish was the language of his parents and his own mother tongue.",
              "[74] The publishers of the German edition had to convince the German culture ministry of the work's serious intent to have the swastika appear on the cover, per laws prohibiting the display of Nazi symbolism.",
              "[75] Reception in Germany was positive\u2014Maus was a best-seller and was taught in schools.",
              "The Polish translation encountered difficulties;",
              "as early as 1987, when Spiegelman planned a research visit to Poland, the Polish consulate official who approved his visa questioned him about the Poles' depiction as pigs, and pointed out how serious an insult it was.",
              "Publishers and commentators refused to deal with the book for fear of protests and boycotts.",
              "[74] Piotr Bikont, a journalist for Gazeta Wyborcza, set up his own publishing house to publish Maus in Polish in 2001.",
              "Demonstrators protested Maus's publication and burned the book in front of Gazeta's offices.",
              "Bikont's response was to don a pig mask and wave to the protesters from the office windows.",
              "[76] The magazine-sized Japanese translation was the only authorized edition with larger pages.",
              "[77] Long-standing plans for an Arabic translation have yet to come to fruition.",
              "[49] A Russian law passed in December 2014 prohibiting the display of Nazi propaganda led to the removal of Maus from Russian bookstores leading up to Victory Day due to the swastika appearing on the book's cover.",
              "[75] Now the book is wildely avialable again, with a slightly modified cover.",
              "[78] A few panels were changed for the Hebrew edition of Maus.",
              "Based on Vladek's memory, Spiegelman portrayed one of the minor characters as a member of the Nazi-installed Jewish Police.",
              "An Israeli descendant objected and threatened to sue for libel.",
              "Spiegelman redrew the character with a fedora in place of his original police hat, but appended a note to the volume voicing his objection to this \"intrusion\".",
              "[79] This version of the first volume appeared in 1990 from the publishing house Zmora Bitan.",
              "It had an indifferent or negative reception, and the publisher did not release the second volume.",
              "[80] Another Israeli publisher put out both volumes, with a new translation by poet Yehuda Vizan that included Vladek's broken language, which Zmora Bitan had refused to do.",
              "[81] Marilyn Reizbaum saw this as highlighting a difference between the self-image of the Israeli Jew as a fearless defender of the homeland, and that of the American Jew as a feeble victim,[82] something that one Israeli writer disparaged as \"the diaspora sickness\".",
              "[83][f] Spiegelman, like many of his critics, has expressed concern that \"[r]eality is too much for comics .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "so much has to be left out or distorted\", admitting that his presentation of the story may not be accurate.",
              "[84] He takes a postmodern approach;",
              "Maus \"feeds on itself\", telling the story of how the story was made.",
              "It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to make.",
              "For example, when his French wife converts to Judaism, Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal.",
              "[85] The book portrays humans with the heads and tails of different species of animals;",
              "Jews are drawn as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs,[2] among others.",
              "Spiegelman took advantage of the way Nazi propaganda films depicted Jews as vermin,[86] though he was first struck by the metaphor after attending a presentation where Ken Jacobs showed films of minstrel shows along with early American animated films, abundant with racial caricatures.",
              "[87] Spiegelman derived the mouse as symbol for the Jew from Nazi propaganda, emphasized in a quote from a German newspaper in the 1930s that prefaces the second volume: \"Mickey Mouse is the most miserable idea ever revealed .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "Healthy emotions tell every independent young man and every honorable youth that the dirty and filth-covered vermin, the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom, cannot be the ideal type of animal .",

              ".",
              "Away with Jewish brutalization of the people!",

              "[88] Jewish characters try to pass themselves off as ethnic Poles by tying pig masks to their faces, with the strings showing at the back.",
              "[89] Vladek's disguise was more convincing than Anja's\u2014\"you could see she was more Jewish\", Vladek says.",
              "Spiegelman shows this Jewishness by having her tail hang out of her disguise.",
              "[90] This literalization of the genocidal stereotypes that drove the Nazis to their Final Solution may risk reinforcing racist labels,[91] but Spiegelman uses the idea to create anonymity for the characters.",
              "According to art historian Andrea Liss, this may paradoxically enable the reader to identify with the characters as human, preventing the reader from observing racial characteristics based on facial traits, while reminding readers that racist classification is ever present.",
              "[92] In making people of each ethnicity look alike, Spiegelman hoped to show the absurdity of dividing people along such lines.",
              "Spiegelman has stated that \"these metaphors .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "are meant to self-destruct\"[93] and \"reveal the inanity of the notion itself\".",
              "[94] Animals signified the characters' roles in the story rather than their races\u2014the gentile Franc\u0327oise is a mouse because of her identification with her husband, who identifies with the Holocaust victims. When asked what animal he would make Israeli Jews, Spiegelman suggests porcupines.",
              "[88] When Art visits his psychiatrist, the two wear mouse masks.",
              "[95] Spiegelman's perceptions of the animal metaphor seem to have evolved over the book's making\u2014in the original publication of the first volume, his self-portrait showed a mouse head on a human body, but by the time the second volume arrived, his self-portrait had become that of a man wearing a mouse mask.",

              "In every respect other than their heads and tails, they act and speak as ordinary humans.",
              "[96] Further complicating the animal metaphor, Anja is ironically shown to be afraid of mice, while other characters appear with pet dogs and cats, and the Nazis with attack dogs.",
              "[97] To Marianne Hirsch, Spiegelman's life is \"dominated by memories that are not his own\".",

              "[102] The eighth chapter, made after the publication and unexpected success of the first volume, opens with a guilt-ridden Spiegelman (now in human form, with a strapped-on mouse mask) atop a pile of corpses\u2014the corpses of the six million Jews upon whom Maus' success was built.",
              "[103] He is told by his psychiatrist that his father feels guilt for having survived and for outliving his first son, and that some of Art's guilt may spring from painting his father in such an unflattering way.",
              "[104][105] As he had not lived in the camps himself, he finds it difficult to understand or visualize this \"separate universe\", and feels inadequate in portraying it.",

              "[107] Spiegelman gradually deconstructs the animal metaphor throughout the book, especially in the second volume, showing where the lines cannot be drawn between races of humans.",
              "[108] The Germans are depicted with little difference between them, but there is great variety among the Poles and Jews who dominate the story.",
              "[109] Sometimes Jews and the Jewish councils are shown complying with the occupiers;",
              "some trick other Jews into capture, while others act as police for the Nazis.",

              "The German word Maus is cognate to the English word \"mouse\",[116] and also reminiscent of the German verb mauscheln, which means \"to speak like a Jew\"[117] and refers to the way Jews from Eastern Europe spoke German[118]\u2014a word etymologically related not to Maus but, distantly, to Moses.",
              "[117] Spiegelman's perceived audacity in using the Holocaust as his subject was compounded by his telling the story in comics.",
              "The prevailing view in the English-speaking world held comics as inherently trivial,[119] thus degrading Spiegelman's subject matter, especially as he used animal heads in place of recognizably human ones.",
              "[120] Talking animals have been a staple of comics, and while they have a traditional reputation as children's fare, the underground had long made use of them in adult stories,[121] for example in Robert Crumb's Fritz the Cat, which comics critic Joseph Witek asserts shows that the genre could \"open up the way to a paradoxical narrative realism\" that Maus exploited.",
              "[122] Ostensibly about the Holocaust, the story entwines with the frame tale of Art interviewing and interacting with his father.",
              "Art's \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\" is also encompassed by the frame, and stands in visual and thematic contrast with the rest of the book as the characters are in human form[52] in a surreal, German Expressionist woodcut style inspired by Lynd Ward.",
              "[123] Spiegelman blurs the line between the frame and the world, such as when neurotically trying to deal with what Maus is becoming for him, he says to his wife: \"In real life you'd never have let me talk this long without interrupting\".",
              "[124] When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German, Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character as a cat or a mouse.",
              "[125] Throughout the book, Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father's tales, sometimes humorous or ironic, giving a lightness and humanity to the story which \"helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities\".",
              "[5] Spiegelman started taking down his interviews with Vladek on paper, but quickly switched to a tape recorder,[126] face-to-face or over the phone.",
              "[51] Spiegelman often condensed Vladek's words, and occasionally added to the dialogue[126] or synthesized multiple retellings into a single portrayal.",
              "[51] Spiegelman worried about the effect that his organizing of Vladek's story would have on its authenticity.",
              "In the end, he eschewed a Joycean approach and settled on a linear narrative he thought would be better at \"getting things across\".",
              "[51] He strove to present how the book was recorded and organized as an integral part of the book itself, expressing the \"sense of an interview shaped by a relationship\".",

              "Spiegelman planned to draw Maus in such a manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate.",
              "Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies.",
              "[36] Spiegelman wanted to get away from the rendering of the characters in the original \"Maus\", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, \"tells you how to feel, tells you how to think\".",
              "[130] He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments.",
              "[131] He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions.",
              "[89] Spiegelman wanted the artwork to have a diary feel to it, and so drew the pages on stationery with a fountain pen and typewriter correction fluid.",
              "It was reproduced at the same size it was drawn, unlike his other work, which was usually drawn larger and shrunk down, which hides defects in the art.",
              "[49] Spiegelman has published articles promoting a greater knowledge of his medium's history.",
              "Chief among his early influences were Harvey Kurtzman, Will Eisner,[132] and Bernard Krigstein's \"Master Race\".",
              "[133] Though he acknowledged Eisner's early work as an influence, he denied that Eisner's first graphic novel, A Contract with God (1978), had any impact on Maus.",
              "[134] He cited Harold Gray's comic strip Little Orphan Annie as having \"influenced Maus fairly directly\", and praised Gray's work for using a cartoon-based storytelling vocabulary, rather than an illustration-based one.",
              "[135] Justin Green's Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary (1972) inspired Spiegelman to include autobiographical elements in his comics.",
              "Spiegelman stated, \"without Binky Brown, there would be no Maus\".",
              "[47] Among the graphic artists who influenced Maus, Spiegelman cited Frans Masereel, who had made early wordless novels in woodcuts such as Passionate Journey (1919).",
              "[45] Spiegelman's work as cartoonist and editor had long been known and respected in the comics community, but the media attention after the first volume's publication in 1986 was unexpected.",
              "[136] Hundreds of overwhelmingly positive reviews appeared, and Maus became the center of new attention focused on comics.",
              "[137] It was considered one of the \"Big Three\" book-form comics from around 1986\u201387, along with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns, that are said to have brought the term \"graphic novel\" and the idea of comics for adults into mainstream consciousness.",
              "[138] It was credited with changing the public's perception of what comics could be at a time when, in the English-speaking world, they were considered to be for children, and strongly associated with superheroes.",
              "[139][58] Initially, critics of Maus showed a reluctance to include comics in literary discourse.",

              "[141] After its Pulitzer Prize win, it won greater acceptance and interest among academics.",
              "[142] The Museum of Modern Art staged an exhibition on the making of Maus in 1991\u201392.",
              "[143] Maus proved difficult to classify to a genre,[144] and has been called biography, fiction, autobiography, history, and memoir.",

              "The Times eventually acquiesced.",
              "[146] The Pulitzer committee sidestepped the issue by giving the completed Maus a Special Award in Letters in 1992.",
              "[147] Maus ranked highly on comics and literature lists.",

              "[151] Praise for the book also came from contemporaries such as Jules Feiffer and literary writers such as Umberto Eco.",

              "[47] In 2022, the board of trustees for McMinn County Schools in east Tennessee voted unanimously to remove Maus from the curriculum over concerns including profanity, violence, and nudity.",
              "[155][156][157][158] The decision led to a backlash[159][160] and attracted attention the day before Holocaust Remembrance Day, and was covered by media in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa.",

              "[172] A cottage industry of academic research has built up around Maus,[173] and schools have frequently used it as course material in a range of fields, including history, dysfunctional family psychology,[2] language arts, and social studies.",
              "[174] The volume of academic work published on Maus far surpasses that of any other work of comics.",

              "Few approached Maus who were familiar with comics, largely because of the lack of an academic comics tradition\u2014Maus tended to be approached as Holocaust history or from a film or literary perspective.",

              "[177] Literary critics such as Hillel Halkin objected that the animal metaphor was \"doubly dehumanizing\", reinforcing the Nazi belief that the atrocities were perpetrated by one species on another, when they were actually done by humans against humans.",
              "[178] Comics writer and critic Harvey Pekar and others saw Spiegelman's use of animals as potentially reinforcing stereotypes.",
              "[179][180] Pekar was also disdainful of Spiegelman's overwhelmingly negative portrayal of his father,[181] calling him disingenuous and hypocritical for such a portrayal in a book that presents itself as objective.",

              "[191] Scholar Paul Buhle asserted: \"More than a few readers have described [Maus] as the most compelling of any [Holocaust] depiction, perhaps because only the caricatured quality of comic art is equal to the seeming unreality of an experience beyond all reason\".",
