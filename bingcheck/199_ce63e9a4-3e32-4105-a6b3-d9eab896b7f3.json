    "query": "What is the most intriguing unsolved mystery in history, and what evidence or theories have been proposed to explain it?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question, but also a very difficult one to answer. There are so many unsolved mysteries in history that it's hard to pick just one. However, based on the search results, some of the most intriguing ones are:\n\n- **The Incident at Dyatlov Pass**: In 1959, nine ski-hikers died mysteriously in the mountains of Russia. Their bodies showed signs of strange injuries and some of their clothing was radioactive. No one knows what caused their deaths or why they left their tent in the middle of the night[^1^].\n- **The Havana Syndrome**: Since 2016, dozens of American and Canadian diplomats and spies have reported suffering from various symptoms such as nausea, hearing loss, vertigo, and nosebleeds after hearing a strange noise in their homes or hotel rooms in Cuba and other countries. The cause and source of the noise and the illness remain unknown[^3^].\n- **The Disappearance of MH370**: In 2014, a Malaysia Airlines flight with 239 people on board vanished from radar screens while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Despite extensive searches, no trace of the plane or its passengers has been found. Many theories have been proposed to explain what happened, but none have been confirmed[^4^].\n- **The Assassination of JFK**: In 1963, President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas by Lee Harvey Oswald, who was himself killed by Jack Ruby two days later. Many people believe that Oswald was not the only shooter or that he was part of a larger conspiracy involving the CIA, the Mafia, Cuba, or others. The official investigation and its findings have been disputed by many experts and witnesses[^5^].\n- **The SS Ourang Medan**: According to various sources, this was a ship that became a wreck in the 1940s or 1950s after its entire crew had died under suspicious circumstances. Some reports claim that the crew members had expressions of horror on their faces and that there were no signs of injury or damage on the ship. The cause of their deaths and the fate of the ship are unknown[^6^].\n\nThese are just some examples of the many unsolved mysteries that history has to offer. What do you think about them?",

              "\"Death of the Dyatlov Group\") was an event in which nine Soviet hikers died in the northern Ural Mountains between February 1 and 2, 1959, under uncertain circumstances.",
              "The experienced trekking group from the Ural Polytechnical Institute, led by Igor Dyatlov, had established a camp on the eastern slopes of Kholat Syakhl in the Russian SFSR of the Soviet Union.",
              "Overnight, something caused them to cut their way out of their tent and flee the campsite while inadequately dressed for the heavy snowfall and sub-zero temperatures.",
              "After the group's bodies were discovered, an investigation by Soviet authorities determined that six of them had died from hypothermia while the other three had been killed by physical trauma.",
              "One victim had major skull damage, two had severe chest trauma, and another had a small crack in his skull.",
              "Four of the bodies were found lying in running water in a creek, and three of these four had damaged soft tissue of the head and face \u2013 two of the bodies had missing eyes, one had a missing tongue, and one had missing eyebrows.",
              "The investigation concluded that a \"compelling natural force\" had caused the deaths.",
              "Numerous theories have been put forward to account for the unexplained deaths, including animal attacks, hypothermia, an avalanche, katabatic winds, infrasound-induced panic, military involvement, or some combination of these factors.",
              "Russia opened a new investigation into the incident in 2019, and its conclusions were presented in July 2020: that an avalanche had led to the deaths.",
              "Survivors of the avalanche had been forced to suddenly leave their camp in low-visibility conditions with inadequate clothing, and had died of hypothermia.",
              "Andrey Kuryakov, deputy head of the regional prosecutor's office, said: \"It was a heroic struggle.",
              "There was no panic.",
              "But they had no chance to save themselves under the circumstances.\"",
              "[1] A study led by scientists from EPFL and ETH Zu\u0308rich, published in 2021, suggested that a type of avalanche known as a slab avalanche could explain some of the trekkers' injuries.",
              "[2][3] A mountain pass in the area was later named \"Dyatlov Pass\" in memory of the group.",
              "In many languages, the incident is now referred to as the \"Dyatlov Pass incident\".",
              "However, the incident occurred about 1,700 metres (5,600 ft) away, on the eastern slope of Kholat Syakhl.",
              "[2] A prominent rock outcrop in the area now serves as a memorial to the group.",
              "It is located about 500 metres (1,600 ft) to the east-southeast of the actual site of the final camp.",
              "In 1959, a group was formed for a skiing expedition across the northern Urals in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Soviet Union.",
              "According to Prosecutor Tempalov, documents that were found in the tent of the expedition suggest that the expedition was named for the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and was possibly dispatched by the local Komsomol organisation.",
              "[4] Igor Dyatlov, a 23-year-old radio engineering student at the Ural Polytechnical Institute (now Ural Federal University), the leader, assembled a group of nine others for the trip, most of whom were fellow students and peers at the university.",
              "[5] The initial group consisted of eight men and two women, but one member later turned back due to health issues.",
              "Each member of the group was an experienced Grade II-hiker with ski tour experience and would be receiving Grade III certification upon their return.",
              "[6] At the time, Grade III was the highest certification available in the Soviet Union and required candidates to traverse 300 kilometres (190 mi).",
              "[6] The route was designed by Dyatlov's group to reach the far northern regions of the Sverdlovsk Oblast and the upper streams of the Lozva river.",
              "[7] The route was approved by the Sverdlovsk city route commission.",
              "This was a division of the Sverdlovsk Committee of Physical Culture and Sport, and they confirmed the group of 10 people on January 8, 1959.",
              "[7] The goal of the expedition was to reach Otorten (\u041e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043d), a mountain 10 kilometres (6.",
              "2 mi) north of the site where the incident occurred.",
              "This route, estimated as Category III, was undertaken in February, the most difficult time to traverse.",
              "On 23 January 1959, the Dyatlov group was issued their route book, which listed their course as following the No.",
              "5 trail.",
              "At that time, the Sverdlovsk City Committee of Physical Culture and Sport listed approval for 11 people.",
              "[7] The 11th person listed was Semyon Zolotaryov, who was previously certified to go with another expedition of similar difficulty (the Sogrin expedition group).",
              "[7] The Dyatlov group left Sverdlovsk city (today Yekaterinburg) on the same day they received the route book.",
              "The group arrived by train at Ivdel (\u0418\u0432\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c), a town at the centre of the northern province of Sverdlovsk Oblast in the early morning hours of January 25, 1959.",
              "[13] They then took a truck to Vizhai (\u0412\u0438\u0436\u0430\u0438\u0306), a lorry village that is the last inhabited settlement to the north.",
              "[14] While spending the night in Vizhai, the skiers purchased and ate loaves of bread to keep their energy levels up for the following day's hike.",
              "[15] On January 27, they began their trek toward Gora Otorten.",
              "On January 28, one member, Yuri Yudin, who had several health ailments (including rheumatism and a congenital heart defect) turned back due to knee and joint pain that made him unable to continue the hike.",
              "[16][17] The remaining nine hikers continued the trek.",
              "Diaries and cameras found around their last campsite made it possible to track the group's route up to the day preceding the incident.",
              "[18] On 31 January, the group arrived at the edge of a highland area and began to prepare for climbing.",
              "In a wooded valley, they cached surplus food and equipment that would be used for the trip back.",
              "The next day, the hikers started to move through the pass.",
              "It seems they planned to get over the pass and make camp for the next night on the opposite side, but because of worsening weather conditions\u2014snowstorms and decreasing visibility\u2014they lost their direction and deviated west, toward the top of Kholat Syakhl.",
              "When they realised their mistake, the group decided to set up camp there on the slope of the mountain, rather than move 1.",
              "5 kilometres (0.",
              "93 mi) downhill to a forested area that would have offered some shelter from the weather.",
              "[17] Yudin speculated, \"Dyatlov probably did not want to lose the altitude they had gained, or he decided to practice camping on the mountain slope.\"",
              "[17] Before leaving, Dyatlov had agreed he would send a telegram to their sports club as soon as the group returned to Vizhai.",
              "It was expected that this would happen no later than 12 February, but Dyatlov had told Yudin, before he departed from the group, that he expected it to be longer.",
              "When the 12th passed and no messages had been received, there was no immediate reaction, as delays of a few days were common with such expeditions.",
              "On 20 February, the travellers' relatives demanded a rescue operation, and the head of the institute sent the first rescue groups, consisting of volunteer students and teachers.",
              "[17] Later, the army and militsiya (police) forces became involved, with planes and helicopters ordered to join the operation.",
              "On 26 February, the searchers found the group's abandoned and badly damaged tent on Kholat Syakhl.",
              "The campsite baffled the search party.",
              "Mikhail Sharavin, the student who found the tent, said \"the tent was half torn down and covered with snow.",
              "It was empty, and all the group's belongings and shoes had been left behind.\"",
              "[17] Investigators said the tent had been cut open from inside.",
              "Nine sets of footprints, left by people wearing only socks or a single shoe or even barefoot, could be followed, leading down to the edge of a nearby wood, on the opposite side of the pass, 1.",
              "5 kilometres (0.",
              "93 mi) to the north-east.",
              "[19] After 500 metres (1,600 ft) these tracks were covered with snow.",
              "At the forest's edge, under a large Siberian pine, the searchers found the visible remains of a small fire.",
              "There were the first two bodies, those of Krivonishenko and Doroshenko, shoeless and dressed only in underwear.",
              "The branches on the tree were broken up to five meters high, suggesting that one of the skiers had climbed up to look for something, perhaps the camp.",
              "Between the pine and the camp, the searchers found three more corpses: Dyatlov, Kolmogorova, and Slobodin, who died in poses suggesting that they were attempting to return to the tent.",
              "[17] They were found at distances of 300, 480, and 630 metres (980, 1,570, and 2,070 ft) from the tree.",
              "Finding the remaining four travelers took more than two months.",
              "[19] They were finally found on 4 May under four metres (13 ft) of snow in a ravine 75 metres (246 ft) further into the woods from the pine tree.",
              "Three of the four were better dressed than the others, and there were signs that some clothing of those who had died first had been removed for use by the others.",
              "Dubinina was wearing Krivonishenko's burned, torn trousers, and her left foot and shin were wrapped in a torn jacket.",
              "[20] A legal inquest started immediately after the first five bodies were found.",
              "A medical examination found no injuries that might have led to their deaths, and it was concluded that they had all died of hypothermia.",
              "Slobodin had a small crack in his skull, but it was not thought to be a fatal wound.",
              "[21] An examination of the four bodies found in May shifted the narrative of the incident.",
              "Three of the hikers had fatal injuries: Thibeaux-Brignolles[21] had major skull damage, and Dubinina and Zolotaryov had major chest fractures.",
              "[22] According to Boris Vozrozhdenny, the force required to cause such damage would have been extremely high, comparable to that of a car crash.",
              "Notably, the bodies had no external wounds associated with the bone fractures, as if they had been subjected to a high level of pressure.",
              "[19] All four bodies found at the bottom of the creek in a running stream of water had soft tissue damage to their head and face.",
              "For example, Dubinina was missing her tongue, eyes, part of the lips, as well as facial tissue and a fragment of skullbone,[23] while Zolotaryov had his eyeballs missing,[24] and Aleksander Kolevatov his eyebrows.",
              "[25] V.",
              "A.",
              "Vozrozhdenny, the forensic expert performing the post-mortem examination, judged that these injuries happened post-mortem due to the location of the bodies in a stream.",
              "There was initial speculation that the indigenous Mansi people, reindeer herders local to the area, had attacked and murdered the group for encroaching upon their lands.",
              "Several Mansi were interrogated,[26] but the investigation indicated that the nature of the deaths did not support this hypothesis: only the hikers' footprints were visible, and they showed no sign of hand-to-hand struggle.",
              "[17] Although the temperature was very low, around \u221225 to \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221213 to \u221222 \u00b0F) with a storm blowing, the dead were only partially dressed.",
              "Some had only one shoe, while others wore only socks.",
              "[17] Some were found wrapped in snips of ripped clothes that seemed to have been cut from those who were already dead.",
              "Journalists reporting on the available parts of the inquest files claim that it states: At the time, the official conclusion was that the group members had died because of a compelling natural force.",
              "[28] The inquest officially ceased in May 1959 as a result of the absence of a guilty party.",
              "The files were sent to a secret archive.",
              "[17] In 1997, it was revealed that the negatives from Krivonishenko's camera were kept in the private archive of one of the investigators, Lev Nikitich Ivanov.",
              "The film material was donated by Ivanov's daughter to the Dyatlov Foundation.",
              "The diaries of the hiking party fell into Russia's public domain in 2009.",
              "On 12 April 2018, Zolotaryov's remains were exhumed on the initiative of journalists of the Russian tabloid newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.",
              "Contradictory results were obtained: one of the experts said that the character of the injuries resembled a person knocked down by a car, and the DNA analysis did not reveal any similarity to the DNA of living relatives.",
              "In addition, it turned out that Zolotaryov's name was not on the list of those buried at the Ivanovskoye Cemetery.",
              "Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the face from the exhumed skull matched postwar photographs of Zolotaryov, although journalists expressed suspicions that another person was hiding under Zolotaryov's name after World War II.",

              "At some point, some of the clothes may have been recovered or swapped from the dead, but at any rate, the group of four whose bodies was most severely damaged were caught in an avalanche and buried under 4 meters (13 ft) of snow (more than enough to account for the 'compelling natural force' the medical examiner described).",
              "Dubinina's tongue was likely removed by scavengers and ordinary predation.",

              "First of all, the ICRF investigators (one of them an experienced alpinist) confirmed that the weather on the night of the tragedy was very harsh, with wind speeds up to hurricane force, 20\u201330 metres per second (45\u201367 mph;",
              "72\u2013108 km/h), a snowstorm and temperatures reaching \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F).",
              "These factors were not considered by the 1959 investigators who arrived at the scene of the accident three weeks later when the weather had much improved and any remains of the snow slide had settled and been covered with fresh snowfall.",
              "The harsh weather at the same time played a critical role in the events of the tragic night, which have been reconstructed as follows:[45][46] According to the ICRF investigators, the factors contributing to the tragedy were extremely bad weather and lack of experience of the group leader in such conditions, which led to the selection of a dangerous camping place.",
              "After the snow slide, another mistake of the group was to split up, rather than building a temporary camp down in the forest and trying to survive through the night.",
              "Negligence of the 1959 investigators contributed to their report creating more questions than answers, as well as inspiring numerous alternative and conspiracy theories.",
              "[47][46] In 2021, a team of physicists and engineers led by Alexander Puzrin and Johan Gaume published in Communications Earth & Environment[48] a new model that demonstrated how even a relatively small slide of snow slab on the Kholat Syakhl slope could cause tent damage and injuries consistent with those suffered by the Dyatlov team.",
              "[49][50][51] In 2019, a Swedish-Russian expedition was made to the site, and after investigations, they proposed that a violent katabatic wind was a plausible explanation for the incident.",
              "[52] Katabatic winds are somewhat rare events and can be extremely violent.",
              "They were implicated in a 1978 case at Anaris Mountain in Sweden, where eight hikers were killed and one was severely injured.",
              "[53] The topography of these locations was noted to be very similar according to the expedition.",
              "[52] A sudden katabatic wind would have made it impossible to remain in the tent, and the most rational course of action would have been for the hikers to cover the tent with snow and seek shelter behind the treeline.",
              "[52] On top of the tent, there was also a flashlight left turned on, possibly left there intentionally so that the hikers could find their way back to the tent once the winds subsided.",
              "The expedition proposed that the group of hikers constructed two bivouac shelters, one of which collapsed, leaving four of the hikers buried with the severe injuries observed.",
              "[52] Another hypothesis popularised by Donnie Eichar's 2013 book Dead Mountain is that wind going around Kholat Syakal created a Ka\u0301rma\u0301n vortex street, which can produce infrasound capable of inducing panic attacks in humans.",
              "[54][55] According to Eichar's theory, the infrasound generated by the wind as it passed over the top of the Holatchahl mountain was responsible for causing physical discomfort and mental distress in the hikers.",
              "[54] Eichar claims that, because of their panic, the hikers were driven to leave the tent by whatever means necessary, and fled down the slope.",
              "By the time they were further down the hill, they would have been out of the infrasound's path and would have regained their composure, but in the darkness would have been unable to return to their shelter.",
              "[54] The traumatic injuries suffered by three of the victims were the result of their stumbling over the edge of a ravine in the darkness and landing on the rocks at the bottom.",
              "In one speculation, the campsite fell within the path of a Soviet parachute mine exercise.",
              "This theory alleges that the hikers, woken by loud explosions, fled the tent in a shoeless panic and found themselves unable to return for supply retrieval.",
              "After some members froze to death attempting to endure the bombardment, others commandeered their clothing only to be fatally injured by subsequent parachute mine concussions.",
              "There are indeed records of parachute mines being tested by the Soviet military in the area around the time the hikers were there.",
              "[56] Parachute mines detonate while still in the air rather than upon striking the Earth's surface and produce signature injuries similar to those experienced by the hikers: heavy internal damage with relatively little external trauma.",
              "The theory coincides with reported sightings of glowing, orange orbs floating or falling in the sky within the general vicinity of the hikers and allegedly photographed by them,[57] potentially military aircraft or descending parachute mines.",
              "This theory (among others) uses scavenging animals to explain Dubinina's injuries.",
              "[58] Some speculate that the bodies were unnaturally manipulated, on the basis of characteristic livor mortis markings discovered during an autopsy, as well as burns to hair and skin.",
              "Photographs of the tent allegedly show that it was erected incorrectly, something the experienced hikers were unlikely to have done.",
              "[59] A similar theory alleges the testing of radiological weapons and is based partly on the discovery of radioactivity on some of the clothing as well as the descriptions of the bodies by relatives as having orange skin and grey hair.",
              "However, radioactive dispersal would have affected all, not just some, of the hikers and equipment, and the skin and hair discoloration can be explained by a natural process of mummification after three months of exposure to the cold and wind.",
              "The initial suppression by Soviet authorities of files describing the group's disappearance is sometimes mentioned as evidence of a cover-up, but the concealment of information about domestic incidents was standard procedure in the USSR and thus far from peculiar.",
              "And by the late 1980s, all Dyatlov files had been released in some manner.",
              "[60] International Science Times posited that the hikers' deaths were caused by hypothermia, which can induce a behavior known as paradoxical undressing in which hypothermic subjects remove their clothes in response to perceived feelings of burning warmth.",
              "[61] It is undisputed that six of the nine hikers died of hypothermia.",
              "However, others in the group appear to have acquired additional clothing (from those who had already died), which suggests that they were of a sound enough mind to try to add layers.",
              "Keith McCloskey, who has researched the incident for many years and has appeared in several TV documentaries on the subject, traveled to the Dyatlov Pass in 2015 with Yuri Kuntsevich of the Dyatlov Foundation and a group.",
              "At the Dyatlov Pass he noted: McCloskey also noted: Donnie Eichar, who investigated and made a documentary about the incident, evaluated several other theories that are deemed unlikely or have been discredited:[60]"

              "But as Robin George Andrews reports for National Geographic, new research published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment points toward a more \u201csensible\u201d explanation, drawing on advanced computer modeling to posit that an unusually timed avalanche sealed the hikers\u2019 fate.",

              "This simulation tool, coupled with data from cadaver tests conducted by General Motors in the 1970s to determine what happened to the human body when struck at different speeds, enabled the pair to show that heavy blocks of solid snow could have landed on the hikers as they slept, crushing their bones and causing injuries not typically associated with avalanches.",

              "\u201cWe use data on snow friction and local topography to prove that a small slab avalanche could occur on a gentle slope, leaving few traces behind.",
              "With the help of computer simulations, we show that the impact of a snow slab can lead to injuries similar to those observed.",
              "And then, of course, there\u2019s the time lag between the team cutting into the slope and the triggering of the event.",
              "That\u2019s the main focus of our article.",
              "Previous investigators have been unable to explain how, in the absence of any snowfall that evening, an avalanche could have been triggered in the middle of the night.",
              "We had to come up with a new theory to explain it,\u201d says Gaume.",
              "On the night of the tragedy, one of the most important contributing factors was the presence of katabatic winds\u2014i.",
              "e., winds that carry air down a slope under the force of gravity.",
              "These winds could have transported the snow, which would have then accumulated uphill from the tent due to a specific feature of the terrain that the team members were unaware of.",
              "\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t made a cut in the slope, nothing would have happened.",
              "That was the initial trigger, but that alone wouldn\u2019t have been enough.",
              "The katabatic wind probably drifted the snow and allowed an extra load to build up slowly.",
              "At a certain point, a crack could have formed and propagated, causing the snow slab to release,\u201d says Puzrin.",
              "Both scientists are nevertheless cautious about their findings and make it clear that much about the incident remains a mystery.",
              "\u201cThe truth, of course, is that no one really knows what happened that night.",
              "But we do provide strong quantitative evidence that the avalanche theory is plausible,\u201d Puzrin continues.",
              "The two models developed for this study\u2014an analytical one for estimating the time required to trigger an avalanche, created by ETH Zurich, and SLAB\u2019s numerical one for estimating the effect of avalanches on the human body\u2014will be used to better understand natural avalanches and the associated risks.",

              "The Dyatlov Pass Incident: Can Science Explain What Happened to the Hikers?",
              "In the wintry Ural Mountains in 1959, rescuers found the bodies of nine Russian hikers strewn across the landscape.",
              "The search team had been sent out after the group of travelers had failed to show up at their planned destination more than a week earlier.",
              "As the rescuers uncovered all the evidence, they grew more and more perplexed \u2014 and the strange circumstances and bizarre constellation of evidence at the site has prevented anyone from definitively announcing a cause of death to this day, more than 60 years later.",
              "The Dyatlov Pass Incident, as it is now known, has inspired a plethora of conspiracy theories, like yetis or military experiments run amok, and even copycat expeditions.",
              "Nobody has a conclusive answer, despite decades of scrutiny.",
              "But new research published in Nature aims to explain their deaths by looking at the mountains\u2019 topography and simulating weather dynamics to come to a more natural, snowy conclusion.",
              "To properly explain the Dyatlov Pass Incident, any theory needs to reconcile all the peculiar bits of evidence found up on that mountainside.",
              "Rescuers found the hikers\u2019 tent buried in snow with supplies still neatly set up.",
              "But the tent was slashed from the inside, evidence of a quick escape.",
              "Outside the tent were a jumble of footprints, some made with socks, some with boots, some barefoot \u2014 alarming in the winter, especially as it had been at least -5 degrees Fahrenheit at the time.",
              "It took three months of searching to find all nine bodies, located 0.",
              "5 mile to 1 mile from the tent.",
              "Some were barely clothed, while others showed discoloration in their limbs.",
              "Five seemed merely bruised, but four of them had more severe injuries \u2014 one had a twisted neck, another a fractured skull.",
              "Two had multiple broken ribs and were missing their eyes;",
              "one was also missing her tongue.",
              "Autopsies and inspection revealed more seemingly inexplicable findings.",
              "Some of the students\u2019 clothing had traces of radiation.",
              "No evidence of foul play within the group or by an outside party could be found.",
              "According to the BBC, the lead investigator at the time also received reports of bright, burning objects in the sky that night.",
              "The investigation came to a close in 1959, with official reports stating the cause of death as hypothermia and frostbite, though that explanation does not account for many of these strange and gruesome details.",
              "In the decades after the incident, people have grasped for an explanation.",
              "Popular theories include everything from failed military experiments, government cover-ups, involvement with the Mansi people (an Indigenous group from the area), nuclear testing, yetis and even aliens.",
              "But one of the more plausible theories is an avalanche \u2014 the same explanation put forth by the scientists in the new study.",
              "Skeptics of the avalanche theory \u2014 which purports that a slab of tightly-packed snow was thrust onto the hikers\u2019 tent by heavy winds \u2014 cite four main counterarguments that the study authors attempted to refute.",
              "First is that the snow slope was too shallow to cause an avalanche.",
              "Alexander Purzin, a geotechnical engineer at ETH Zurich and co-author of the new paper, says that it\u2019s important to look at the topography beneath the surface.",
              "\u201cIt's not about how steep the slope is,\u201d he explains.",
              "\u201cIt's important that the weak layer below has the right angle of internal friction.",
              "\u201d When you examine that, he adds, you see it\u2019s very possible to have an avalanche with such a mild looking slope.",
              "Beyond that, skeptics say that there was too little snow at the site to indicate an avalanche.",
              "And if there was not enough snow, critics also argue, how could an avalanche have created such grisly injuries?",
              "Lastly, the only possible trigger for this avalanche would have been when the hikers cut into the snow to set up some shelter for their tent.",
              "But the travelers didn\u2019t die until many hours after their tent was pitched, so why the delay?",
              "Puzrin and his co-author write that while the slope was destabilized by the hikers\u2019 tent, it did not hold enough snow to immediately set off a snow slide.",
              "But that evening, katabatic winds, heavy gusts of freezing winds, transported more snow to the shaky slope.",
              "This, they theorize, led to a slab avalanche, where a 16-foot slab of hard, densely packed snow dislodged and fell on the campsite.",
              "To assess how much bodily harm this slab could inflict, Puzrin and his co-author Johan Gaume created a computer model, inspired by the code used to animate the snow in Disney\u2019s Frozen, to analyze how, exactly, the snow and ice would have behaved under that night's weather conditions.",
              "(According to National Geographic, Gaume was so dazzled by the movie's portrayal of snow that he flew out to Hollywood to ask Disney's animators how they did it.)",
              "Combined with data on cadaver strength taken from a General Motors experiment from the 1970s, Puzrin says the model demonstrated that the winds and dynamics of the proposed slab avalanche would lead to \u201cexactly the trauma that was described in the autopsy report.",
              "\u201d These injuries, while terrible, Puzrin says, were probably not immediately fatal, which explains how the hikers were found so far away from the tent \u2014 the less injured of the group likely tried to move and help their friends after the event.",
              "Other evidence, like the missing eyes and tongue, could be explained by scavenging animals.",
              "And Russian officials released information about a radioactive contamination accident two years prior in a neighboring area that could explain the traces of contamination, Puzrin adds.",
              "The avalanche theory has been around for a long time, but Puzrin says this time \u201cthe difference here is the quantification.",
              "\u201d And responses to the model have been largely positive, he says, \u201cincluding the Russian experts .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "which was surprising to me.",
              "\u201d But even with this level of modeling, not everyone is in agreement.",
              "\u201cI don't agree at all with this [avalanche] theory,\" says archaeologist Richard Holmgren.",
              "\"Even if there was a slab it doesn't explain everything.\"",
              "Holmgren has turned the Dyatlov Pass Incident into something of an obsession since he heard about it about 10 years ago.",
              "He was so taken by the tale that he recreated the hikers\u2019 original expedition with a friend in the winter of 2019.",
              "They did it as precisely as they could, down to the dates they left, and where they pitched their tents.",
              "\u201cIt was really how it was in the diaries and photos at the time, except it was in color,\u201d he recalls.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s like time stood still.",
              "Nothing changed.",
              "\u201d Puzrin\u2019s paper includes katabatic winds in their theory, arguing that the heavy winds deposited snow to the slope, providing fuel for the avalanche.",
              "But Holmgren believes that katabatic winds alone were responsible for the travelers\u2019 deaths.",
              "He thinks the heavy, forceful winds picked up so quickly that the travelers ran out abruptly as their tent was tipped, covering it with snow to keep it grounded.",
              "He also posits that the most of the injuries occurred after their deaths.",
              "\u201cWe can never find any truth because it was so long ago,\u201d says Holmgren.",
              "Working off of old reports and autopsies can only do so much.",
              "But more than that, he says \u201cit will never get solved because we don't want it to get solved.",
              "\u201d In other words, people thrive off of mystery, and we like it that way.",
              "Puzrin agrees that the mystery is enticing, and that the avalanche theory is probably the most boring conclusion.",

              "With all 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard presumed dead, the disappearance of Flight 370 was the deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777 and the deadliest in Malaysia Airlines' history until it was surpassed in both regards by Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down while flying over Ukraine four months later on 17 July 2014.",
              "The combined loss caused significant financial problems for Malaysia Airlines, which was renationalised by the Malaysian government in August 2014.",
              "The search for the missing airplane became the most expensive search in the history of aviation.",
              "It focused initially on the South China Sea and Andaman Sea, before a novel analysis of the aircraft's automated communications with an Inmarsat satellite indicated that the plane had traveled far southward over the southern Indian Ocean.",

              "It's not easy for a ship to simply disappear, as nautical travel usually involves records of departures, stops, and arrivals, among other evidence.",
              "The first and most concerning detail of the Medan story is that the ship was never registered with Lloyda\u0302\u0080\u0099s Shipping, which kept records of ships.",
              "But ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s certainly possible that the history of the vessel may have prevented an accurate chronicle of its whereabouts.",
              "a\u0302\u0080\u009cMedana\u0302\u0080\u009d refers to a Sumatran island, where the ship may have been registered.",
              "Others believed the Medan was a Dutch ship that was commandeered by Indonesian pirates, who proceeded to ferry illicit cargo and would therefore have every reason to avoid being documented.",
              "Of equal concern is how, exactly, the Medana\u0302\u0080\u0099s story spread.",
              "According to Brooks, the tale spun out of Indonesia before arriving in the most popular Holland periodical, Elseviera\u0302\u0080\u0099s Weekly, in January 1948.",
              "(Elsevier eventually grew to include a publishing arm in science that continues to this day.)",
              "That account was purportedly taken from the unnamed Italian officer who was part of the crew who responded to the distress call.",
              "The editor of Elseviera\u0302\u0080\u0099s said he had bought the rights to the mana\u0302\u0080\u0099s story as well as a photograph of a body found on the Medan.",
              "The officer, the editor said, then disappeared and was not reachable.",
              "The account then circulated in England and the United States, with detailsa\u0302\u0080\u0094like the exact words of the radio operatora\u0302\u0080\u0094sometimes varying.",
              "In fact, Brooks and Elseviera\u0302\u0080\u0099s Weekly were rather late with the news.",
              "The earliest British reports of the Medana\u0302\u0080\u0099s fate were actually circa 1940.",
              "In these accounts, the distress call was similar, but the Medana\u0302\u0080\u0099s radio operator soon abandoned a request for medical help and demanded a warship come to assist them.",
              "A British merchant ship responded and found roughly 12 dead bodies.",
              "Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s possible, one officer said, that there were more crew members, but the imminent explosion forced them to abandon the search.",
              "In this telling, the crew didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t possess any frozen faces of terror, and requests for a a\u0302\u0080\u009cwarshipa\u0302\u0080\u009d may have implied an attack by pirates.",
              "As the story spread, the most frequent speculation was that the ship had been subject to some kind of gas or chemical leak that had seen its crew members overcomea\u0302\u0080\u0094possibly a release of fumes after a rocky time at sea jostled their cargo.",
              "This theory was put forth in a 1953 German booklet titled Das Totenschiffin der SA\u03031\u20444dsee (a\u0302\u0080\u009cThe Death Ship in the South Seasa\u0302\u0080\u009d) by a man named Otto Milke, who wrote that potassium cyanide and nitroglycerine could have prompted an explosion and were also controversial enough cargo for the shipa\u0302\u0080\u0099s handlers to avoid scrutiny.",
              "But none of the rescuers were affected by any such fumes.",
              "But remember that the Medan was found with one lifeboat missing.",
              "According to Brooks, the story of the Medan grew to involve speculation that there had been one survivor.",
              "After rowing away from the catastrophe, he was found alive on a Pacific island, where he told occupants that two gases had accidentally been mixed together to create a deadly toxic cloud.",
              "He was warned not to abandon ship, ignored it, and reached safety.",
              "He lived long enough to relate his tale and then died as a result of either chemical inhalation or time adrift at sea.",
              "As Medium author Michael East pointed out in 2020, one name comes up repeatedly: Silvio Scherli.",
              "It was Scherli who told Dutch news outlets of the ship in 1940, and Scherli who may have been the source for accounts that same year.",
              "Did Scherli speak with Indonesian or Dutch newspapers again in 1948?",
              "Was Scherli also the man Elseviera\u0302\u0080\u0099s Weekly spoke with in 1948, and who claimed to be an Italian officer on board the rescue ship?",
              "If so, it may be that Scherli simply fed a tall tale to reporters greedy for a compelling story.",
              "That would make his subsequent disappearance understandable.",
              "If the Ourang Medan existed, it's certainly possible the crew tried to maintain a low profile.",
              "It's also conceivable a gas explosion was embellished by Scherli and others.",
              "Without conclusive proof for or against its existence, the idea of a lone radio operator pleading for help as crew members fell around him has endured for decades.",
              "It could be true.",
              "And where horror is concerned, that's often enough.",

              " The SS Ourang Medan was a supposed ghost ship which, according to various sources, became a shipwreck in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) in the Straits of Malacca waters, or elsewhere, after its entire crew had died under suspicious circumstances, either in 1940,[1] 1947 or 1948, depending on the newspaper source.",
              "[2] Some argue that the story of the Ourang Medan is an urban legend due to the fact that there were never records of a ship named the Ourang Medan.",
              "[3] One English reference to the ship and the incident was published in the May 1952 issue of the Proceedings of the Merchant Marine Council, published by the United States Coast Guard.",
              "[4] An earlier English reference was published on October 10, 1948 in The Albany Times of Albany, New York and references its original source as Elsevier's Weekly.",
              "[5] The word Ourang (also written Orang) is Malay or Indonesian for \"man\" or \"person\",[6] whereas Medan is the largest city on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, giving an approximate translation of \"Man of Medan\".",
              "Accounts of the ship's accident have appeared in various books and magazines, mainly on Forteana.",
              "Their factual accuracy and even the ship's existence, however, are unconfirmed, and details of the vessel's construction and history, if any, remain unknown.",
              "Searches for any official registration or accident investigation recorded have proven unsuccessful.",
              "[3] The story's first appearance was a series of three articles in the Dutch-Indonesian newspaper De locomotief: Samarangsch handels- en advertentie-blad (February 3, 1948, with two photographs,[7] February 28, 1948,[8] and March 13, 1948).",
              "[9] The name of the ship that found the Ourang Medan is never mentioned, but the location of the encounter is described as 400 nautical miles (740 km;",
              "460 mi) southeast of the Marshall Islands.",
              "The second and third articles describe the experiences of the sole survivor of the Ourang Medan crew, who was found by an Italian missionary and natives on Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands.",
              "The man, before perishing, tells the missionary that the ship was carrying a badly stowed cargo of oil of vitriol, and that most of the crew perished because of the poisonous fumes escaping from broken containers.",
              "According to the story, the Ourang Medan was sailing from an unnamed small Chinese port to Costa Rica, and deliberately avoided the authorities.",
              "The survivor, an unnamed German, died after telling his story to the missionary, who told the story to the author, Silvio Scherli of Trieste, Italy.",
              "The Dutch newspaper concludes with a disclaimer: \"This is the last part of our story about the mystery of the Ourang Medan.",
              "We must repeat that we don't have any other data on this 'mystery of the sea'.",
              "Nor can we answer the many unanswered questions in the story.",
              "It may seem obvious that the entire story is a fantasy, a thrilling romance of the sea.",
              "On the other hand, the author, Silvio Scherli, assures us of the authenticity of the story.\"",
              "[9] Silvio Scherli is said to have produced a report on Trieste \"Export Trade\" on September 28, 1959.",
              "[10] New evidence found by The Skittish Library shows there were 1940 newspaper reports of the incident taken from the Associated Press in British newspapers the Daily Mirror and the Yorkshire Evening Post.",
              "Again, there were differences in the story: the location being the Solomon Islands, and the SOS messages different from later reports.",
              "The story still appears to originate with Silvio Scherli in Trieste.",
              "[11] According to the story, at some point of time in or around June 1947[3] (Gaddis and others list the approximate date as early February 1948[12][13]), two American vessels navigating the Straits of Malacca, the City of Baltimore and the Silver Star, among others passing by, picked up several distress messages from the nearby Dutch merchant ship Ourang Medan.",
              "[3][14] A radio operator aboard the troubled vessel sent the following message in Morse code: \"S.",
              "O.",
              "S.",
              "from Ourang Medan * * * We float.",

              "were received.",
              "After this message, there was nothing more heard of.",
              "[4] When the Silver Star crew eventually located and boarded the apparently-undamaged Ourang Medan in an attempt at a rescue, the ship was found littered with corpses (including the carcass of a dog) everywhere, with the dead bodies found sprawled on their backs, the frozen (and allegedly badly-frightened) faces of the deceased upturned to the sun above with mouths gaping open and eyes staring straight ahead, with the corpses resembling horrible caricatures.",
              "[4] No survivors were located and no visible signs of injuries on the dead bodies were observed.",
              "[12][13] Just as the ship was to be prepared for a tow by the Silver Star to a nearby port, a fire then suddenly broke out in the ship's No.",
              "4 cargo-hold, forcing the boarding party to hastily evacuate the doomed Dutch freighter, thus preventing any further investigations to be carried out.",
              "Soon after, the Ourang Medan was witnessed exploding before finally sinking.",
              "[12][15] Bainton and others hypothesize that Ourang Medan might have been involved in smuggling operations of chemical substances such as a combination of potassium cyanide and nitroglycerin or even wartime stocks of nerve agents.",
              "According to these theories, sea water would have entered the ship's hold, reacting with the cargo to release toxic gases, which then caused the crew to succumb to asphyxia and/or poisoning.",
              "Later, the sea water would have reacted with the nitroglycerin, causing the reported fire and explosion.",
              "[3] Another theory is that the ship was transporting nerve gas which the Japanese military had been storing in China during the war, and which was handed over to the U.",
              "S.",
              "military at the end of the war.",
              "No U.",
              "S.",

              "It was therefore loaded onto a non-registered ship for transport to the U.",
              "S.",
              "or an island in the Pacific.",
              "Gaddis puts forward the theory that an undetected smouldering fire or malfunction in the ship's boiler system might have been responsible for the shipwreck.",
              "Escaping carbon monoxide would have caused the deaths of all aboard, with the fire slowly spreading out of control, leading to the vessel's ultimate destruction.",
              "[12] Several authors note their inability to find any mention of the case in Lloyd's Shipping Register.",
              "[3][14][15] Furthermore, no registration records for a ship by the name of Ourang Medan could be located in various countries, including the Netherlands.",
              "While author Roy Bainton states that the identity of the Silver Star, reported to have been involved in the failed rescue attempt, has been established with high probability, the complete lack of information on the sunken ship itself has given rise to suspicion about the origins and credibility of the account.",
              "Ships logs for the Silver Star did not show a record of any such rescue attempt.",
              "Bainton and others have put forward the possibility that accounts of, among others, the date, location, names of the ships involved, and circumstances of the accident might have been inaccurate or exaggerated, or that the story might be completely fictitious.",
              "[3] One British researcher has found the story of the Ourang Medan, transposed to the Solomon Islands, but also with a Trieste connection, in two British newspapers in 1940 (The Yorkshire Evening Post for 21 November 1940[16] and The Daily Mirror for 22 November 1940[17]), both quoting AP (The Associated Press) news agency.",
