The first attempts to classify the elements were based on their properties, such as gases, metals, non-metals and earths[^1^]. Later, some chemists noticed that certain groups of elements had similar chemical behaviors, such as the triads of lithium, sodium and potassium[^1^]. However, it was not until a more accurate list of the atomic masses of the elements was available that the periodic table as we know it today started to take shape[^1^].\n\nThe most influential person in the development of the periodic table was Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist who published his version of the table in 1869[^1^] [^2^]. He arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic mass and grouped them according to their chemical and physical properties. He also left gaps for elements that were not yet discovered and predicted their properties based on the patterns in his table[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. His predictions were later confirmed by the discovery of elements such as gallium, scandium and germanium[^2^].\n\nThe periodic table revolutionized the field of chemistry by providing a systematic way of organizing the elements and understanding their relationships.

              "Probably not, but a French Geology Professor made a significant advance towards it, even though at the time few people were aware of it.",
              "Alexandre Be\u0301guyer de Chancourtois was a geologist, but this was at a time when scientists specialised much less than they do today.",
              "His principal contribution to chemistry was the 'vis tellurique' (telluric screw), a three-dimensional arrangement of the elements constituting an early form of the periodic classification, published in 1862.",
              "The telluric screw plotted the atomic weights of the elements on the outside of a cylinder, so that one complete turn corresponded to an atomic weight increase of 16.",
              "As the diagram shows, this arrangement means that certain elements with similar properties appear in a vertical line.",
              "Although the telluric screw did not correctly display all the trends that were known at the time, de Chancourtois was the first to use a periodic arrangement of all of the known elements, showing that similar elements appear at periodic atom weights.",
              "The vis tellurique from De Chancourtois\u2019s original publication (right) and a copy drawn out with modern symbols (left).",
              "John Newlands was British;",
              "his father was a Scottish Presbyterian minister.",
              "He was educated by his father at home, and then studied for a year (1856) at the Royal College of Chemistry, which is now part of Imperial College London.",
              "Later he worked at an agricultural college trying to find patterns of behaviour in organic chemistry.",
              "However, he is remembered for his search for a pattern in inorganic chemistry.",
              "Just four years before Mendeleev announced his periodic table, Newlands noticed that there were similarities between elements with atomic weights that differed by seven.",
              "He called this The Law of Octaves, drawing a comparison with the octaves of music.",
              "The noble gases (Helium, Neon, Argon etc.)",
              "were not discovered until much later, which explains why there was a periodicity of 7 and not 8 in Newlands table.",
              "Newlands did not leave any gaps for undiscovered elements in his table, and sometimes had to cram two elements into one box in order to keep the pattern.",
              "Because of this, the Chemical Society refused to publish his paper, with one Professor Foster saying he might have equally well listed the elements alphabetically.",
              "Even when Mendeleev had published his table, and Newlands claimed to have discovered it first, the Chemical Society would not back him up.",
              "In 1884 he was asked to give a lecture of the Periodic Law by the Society, which went some way towards making amends.",
              "Finally, in 1998 the Royal Society of Chemistry oversaw the placing a blue commemorative plaque on the wall of his birthplace, recognising his discovery at last.",
              "The blue commemorative plaque placed at Newlands\u2019 birthplace, declaring him the \u201cdiscoverer of the Periodic Law for the chemical elements\u201d.",
              "Meyer trained at Heidelberg University under Bunsen and Kirchhoff, as did Mendeleev.",
              "So the two scientists would certainly have known each other although neither was aware of all the work done by the other.",
              "Meyer's roots, however, were firmly in Germany.",
              "Meyer was just four years older than Mendeleev, and produced several Periodic Tables between 1864-1870.",
              "His first table contained just 28 elements, organised by their valency (how many other atoms they can combine with).",
              "These elements were almost entirely main group elements, but in 1868 he incorporated the transition metals in a much more developed table.",
              "This 1868 table listed the elements in order of atomic weight, with elements with the same valency arranged in vertical lines, strikingly similar to Mendeleev\u2019s table.",
              "Unfortunately for Meyer, his work wasn\u2019t published until 1870, a year after Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table had been published.",
              "Even after 1870, Meyer and Mendeleev were still unaware of each other\u2019s work, although Meyer later admitted that Mendeleev had published his version first.",
              "Meyer did contribute to the development of the periodic table in another way though.",
              "He was the first person to recognise the periodic trends in the properties of elements, and the graph shows the pattern he saw in the atomic volume of an element plotted against its atomic weight.",
              "A modern version of Meyer\u2019s graph demonstrating the periodic trends in the atomic volume of the elements, plotted against atomic weight.",
              "As we have seen, Mendeleev was not the first to attempt to find order within the elements, but it is his attempt that was so successful that it now forms the basis of the modern periodic table.",
              "Mendeleev did not have the easiest of starts in life.",
              "He was born at Tobolsk in 1834, the youngest child of a large Siberian family.",
              "His father died while he was young, and so his mother moved the family 1500 km to St.",
              "Petersburg, where she managed to get Dmitri into a \u201cgood school\u201c, recognising his potential.",
              "In his adult life he was a brilliant scientist, rising quickly in academic circles.",
              "He wrote a textbook, Chemical Principles, because he couldn\u2019t find an adequate Russian book.",
              "Mendeleev discovered the periodic table (or Periodic System, as he called it) while attempting to organise the elements in February of 1869.",
              "He did so by writing the properties of the elements on pieces of card and arranging and rearranging them until he realised that, by putting them in order of increasing atomic weight, certain types of element regularly occurred.",
              "For example, a reactive non-metal was directly followed by a very reactive light metal and then a less reactive light metal.",
              "Initially, the table had similar elements in horizontal rows, but he soon changed them to fit in vertical columns, as we see today.",
              "Not only did Mendeleev arrange the elements in the correct way, but if an element appeared to be in the wrong place due to its atomic weight, he moved it to where it fitted with the pattern he had discovered.",
              "For example, iodine and tellurium should be the other way around, based on atomic weights, but Mendeleev saw that iodine was very similar to the rest of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine), and tellurium similar to the group 6 elements (oxygen, sulphur, selenium), so he swapped them over.",
              "The real genius of Mendeleev\u2019s achievement was to leave gaps for undiscovered elements.",
              "He even predicted the properties of five of these elements and their compounds.",
              "And over the next 15 years, three of these elements were discovered and Mendeleev\u2019s predictions shown to be incredibly accurate.",
              "The table below shows the example of Gallium, which Mendeleev called eka-aluminium, because it was the element after aluminium.",
              "Scandium and Germanium were the other two elements discovered by 1886, and helped to cement the reputation of Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table.",
              "The final triumph of Mendeleev\u2019s work was slightly unexpected.",

              "one such reaction is as follows: \\[\\ce{Xe(g) + 2F2(g) -> XeF4(s)} \\label{Eq2}\\] The ionization energies of helium, neon, and argon are so high (Table \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)) that no stable compounds of these elements are known.",

              "This can be considered as a failure of quantum mechanics to predict or explain a global property or a relationship between sets of elements rather than any failure to predict precise numerical data on any of the elements.",
              "The frequently given account of the periodic table is that it results from analogies between the electronic configurations of atoms. It is claimed that, broadly speaking, the elements that fall within a particular group do so because they share the same number of outer-shell electrons.",
              "But this account only serves as a first approximation.",
              "Moreover, as I have argued previously, there is a semi-empirical aspect that is usually not conceded in textbook accounts of this alleged full reduction (Scerri 2007).",
              "Admittedly, the particular combination of four quantum numbers that may be assigned to each electron in a many-electron atom can be derived from first principles and this leads naturally to a prediction of the shell capacity for each electron shell, namely 2, 8, 18, and 32 for the first four shells.",
              "However, it is not the closing of shells that is chemically relevant but the closing of periods.",
              "The latter takes place at the cumulative electron counts of 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, etc.",
              "(the noble gases) and not at the cumulative totals that one would expect if the shells were filled in a strictly sequential manner (2, 10, 28, 50, etc.)",
              ".",
              "One can summarize the situation by saying that the problem of the closing of the shells is deductively solved by using the Pauli principle and the values that the four quantum numbers can adopt.",
              "But that the problem of the closing of the periods remains to be solved.",
              "The latter follows an empirical rule called the Madelung, or n + l rule, whereby electron orbits are filled in order of increasing n + l quantum numbers rather than just an order of increasing n quantum numbers as would be the case if the shells were to fill in a strictly sequential manner.",
              "Footnote 3 The Madelung rule, which describes the closing of the periods, has not yet been theoretically deduced in spite of a number of claims to the contrary (Bent 2006;",
              "Ostrovsky 2005).",
              "Moreover, we reject Schwarz\u2019s recent suggestion that the n + l rule is irrelevant to chemistry because chemistry deals with bonded atoms rather than isolated ground state atoms (Schwarz 2007, 2009).",
              "We suggest that the \u2018elements\u2019, as represented in the periodic table, are as much a reflection of bonded atoms as they are of isolated atoms that are mainly of interest to physicists and astrophysicists.",
              "It is too easy to uphold the reduction of the periodic table to quantum mechanics, as Schwarz does, by merely declaring that the Madelung rule is of no importance to chemistry and that the more chemically relevant n rule has been successfully reduced to quantum mechanics.",
              "Footnote 4 Contrary to Schwarz\u2019s claim, I maintain that the periodic table is as much concerned with neutral atoms as it is with bonded atoms. After all, the periodic table is as much the province of physics as it is that of chemistry even if it originated historically in the field of chemistry.",
              "Nevertheless, quantum mechanical calculations which go well beyond the independent electron approximation, on which electronic configurations are based, are quite capable of high accuracy in reproducing the periodic behavior in any number of properties displayed by a group of elements.",
              "For example, the characteristic plot of ionization energies against atomic numbers for the elements shows maxima at elements in the alkali metals.",
              "Quantum mechanical calculations can reproduce these graphs very accurately (Scerri 2007).",
              "Footnote 5 In this sense the periodicity of the elements is captured from first principles.",
              "But the problem of the closing of the periods, an example of what I take to be a global property of the periodic system, is not as I have argued above.",
              "When Do\u0308bereiner discovered that lithium, sodium and potassium formed a triad he used the atomic weights of these elements.",
              "He found the atomic weight of sodium was approximately the mean of the atomic weights of lithium and potassium.",
              "Some 40 years later atomic weights became the basis on which the elements were ordered in the early periodic systems of De Chancourtois, Newlands, Odling, Hinrichs, Lothar Meyer and Mendeleev (Scerri 2007).",
              "These early periodic table had two main ingredients.",
              "Atomic weights were used to order the elements into a continuous sequence (primary classification) and chemical properties such as valences were used to mark periodicity between certain elements (secondary classification) within the primary sequence of elements.",
              "Footnote 6 The triad of lithium, sodium and potassium represents such a case of periodicity in that these elements have similar chemical properties including their valences of one unit.",
              "But in a few isolated cases an interesting problem arose.",
              "If the elements were ordered strictly according to increasing atomic weight, there would be a problem in achieving the demands of chemical similarity.",
              "The best known of these cases involved the elements iodine and tellurium.",
              "These elements should follow each other according to their atomic weight values and yet chemically speaking tellurium should be placed before iodine.",
              "The solution to this conundrum remained elusive until well beyond the turn of the twentieth century and was provided by van den Broek and Moseley (Scerri 2007).",
              "Footnote 7 It turned out that another property that is highly correlated with atomic weight, although not perfectly so, offered a superior ordering principle for the elements.",
              "This property was the number of positive charges in the nucleus of any particular atom, later termed atomic number.",
              "If this ordering parameter was used instead of atomic weight, there was no clash with the chemical demands of secondary classification.",
              "Both tellurium and iodine fell into their natural chemical groups since the atomic number of tellurium, unlike its atomic weight, is less than that of iodine.",
              "It is tempting to re-examine the notion of triads in terms of atomic number instead of atomic weight.",
              "Doing so reveals a remarkable outcome.",
              "Many of the triads of elements that the nineteenth century chemists had found to be approximately correct are now found to be exact.",
              "Sodium with atomic number 11 represents the exact mean between that of lithium (3) and potassium (19).",
              "Moreover the reason why atomic number triads are exact rather than approximate can be explained by recourse to long formsFootnote 8 of the periodic table rather than the short-form tables that the nineteenth century chemists discovered.",
              "Footnote 9 But atomic number triads have seldom been put to much use in chemistry or indeed in the study of the periodic system.",
              "The first mention of them in the literature, as far as I am aware, is a very short note in the Journal of Chemical Education in 1931, although it is not clear whether the author understood the full significance of atomic number triads (Montgomery 1931).",
              "More recently they were used by Ibrahim to predict the atomic weights of the transuranium elements (Ibrahim 2005).",
              "In papers published in 2008 I suggested that atomic number triads could be used in an attempt to resolve a question that quantum mechanics has not been able to settle, namely the placement of hydrogen and helium in the periodic system (Scerri 2008a, b).",
              "It is clearly a requirement that triads of elements should be embedded in any correct periodic table.",
              "This embedding feature explains why they were so instrumental in the early historical steps towards mature periodic systems as well as being important to pioneers of the system such as Mendeleev even though he may have denied that he was focusing on triads specifically.",
              "Footnote 10 It is also the basis for suggesting that triads may be further exploited in contemporary efforts to obtain a more definitive placement for elements such as hydrogen, helium and the elements of group 3.",
              "Quantum mechanical calculations do not provide answers to these questions even though they provide exceptionally accurate calculations for the properties of the individual elements concerned.",
              "However, any embedding relationship that may exist regarding triads is not as straightforward as one might believe.",
              "Even if one uses atomic number triads, it is not clear that all possible triads are valid.",
              "This is especially controversial in the case of triads involving hydrogen and helium that some authors consider as not belonging to any triads whatsoever (Bent 2006).",
              "To consider that triads are embedded in the periodic table in an invariable fashion would be to pre-judge the very question being addressed in parts of the present article, namely whether hydrogen and helium actually belong to genuine triads.",
              "The reason for the recent neglect of triads is not difficult to discern and is relevant to the present issue.",
              "In spite of their early fruitful role, triads of elements fell into disrepute for a number of reasons.",
              "While triads were still based on atomic weights, the relationship between the elements remained approximate, thus suggesting the lack of any fundamental status for triads.",
              "Secondly, many authors became so enamored with triads that they attempted to create new triads even among elements, which did not show chemical similarities.",
              "Thirdly, Mendeleev, the leading discoverer of the periodic system took pains to distance himself from the use of triads although he was not averse to making interpolations among groups of three elements when in the course of predicting new elements.",
              "Nevertheless, triads can retrospectively said to have made a \u2018comeback\u2019, a point first made explicitly by Imre Lakatos (1980).",
              "With the advent of atomic number as the key criterion for identifying each element, atomic number triads become exact rather than approximate as they are when dealing with atomic weights.",
              "Furthermore, their existence follows naturally from the expanded, or long-form of the periodic table, as compared with the original short-form tables of Mendeleev and other pioneers of the periodic system.",
              "But to the best of my knowledge, nobody has previously embraced atomic number triads in order to clear up any remaining issues concerning the placement of difficult elements like hydrogen and helium.",
              "This is because at the same time as atomic number triads were making a comeback, the attention had turned towards the electronic structure of atoms as the means to examine the classification of elements in the periodic table.",
              "However, electronic configurations show many exceptions, whereas the property of atomic number progresses smoothly and regularly as one moves through the elements.",
              "I therefore suggest that atomic number is a more fundamental means to finalize the classification of the elements, a process begun by classical chemistry by concentrating on the macroscopic properties of the elements and their compounds.",
              "Atomic number is also more fundamental in an ontological sense of referring to a \u2018deeper\u2019 level of reality, namely the nucleus, whose energy is orders of magnitude higher than those of electronic processes.",

              "Alexandre Be\u0301guyer de Chancourtois was a geologist, but this was at a time when scientists specialised much less than they do today.",
              "His principal contribution to chemistry was the 'vis tellurique' (telluric screw), a three-dimensional arrangement of the elements constituting an early form of the periodic classification, published in 1862.",
              "The telluric screw plotted the atomic weights of the elements on the outside of a cylinder, so that one complete turn corresponded to an atomic weight increase of 16.",
              "As the diagram shows, this arrangement means that certain elements with similar properties appear in a vertical line.",
              "Although the telluric screw did not correctly display all the trends that were known at the time, de Chancourtois was the first to use a periodic arrangement of all of the known elements, showing that similar elements appear at periodic atom weights.",

              "He was educated by his father at home, and then studied for a year (1856) at the Royal College of Chemistry, which is now part of Imperial College London.",
              "Later he worked at an agricultural college trying to find patterns of behaviour in organic chemistry.",
              "However, he is remembered for his search for a pattern in inorganic chemistry.",
              "Just four years before Mendeleev announced his periodic table, Newlands noticed that there were similarities between elements with atomic weights that differed by seven.",
              "He called this The Law of Octaves, drawing a comparison with the octaves of music.",
              "The noble gases (Helium, Neon, Argon etc.)",
              "were not discovered until much later, which explains why there was a periodicity of 7 and not 8 in Newlands table.",
              "Newlands did not leave any gaps for undiscovered elements in his table, and sometimes had to cram two elements into one box in order to keep the pattern.",
              "Because of this, the Chemical Society refused to publish his paper, with one Professor Foster saying he might have equally well listed the elements alphabetically.",
              "Even when Mendeleev had published his table, and Newlands claimed to have discovered it first, the Chemical Society would not back him up.",
              "In 1884 he was asked to give a lecture of the Periodic Law by the Society, which went some way towards making amends.",
              "Finally, in 1998 the Royal Society of Chemistry oversaw the placing a blue commemorative plaque on the wall of his birthplace, recognising his discovery at last.",

              "Meyer's roots, however, were firmly in Germany.",
              "Meyer was just four years older than Mendeleev, and produced several Periodic Tables between 1864-1870.",
              "His first table contained just 28 elements, organised by their valency (how many other atoms they can combine with).",
              "These elements were almost entirely main group elements, but in 1868 he incorporated the transition metals in a much more developed table.",
              "This 1868 table listed the elements in order of atomic weight, with elements with the same valency arranged in vertical lines, strikingly similar to Mendeleev\u2019s table.",
              "Unfortunately for Meyer, his work wasn\u2019t published until 1870, a year after Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table had been published.",
              "Even after 1870, Meyer and Mendeleev were still unaware of each other\u2019s work, although Meyer later admitted that Mendeleev had published his version first.",
              "Meyer did contribute to the development of the periodic table in another way though.",
              "He was the first person to recognise the periodic trends in the properties of elements, and the graph shows the pattern he saw in the atomic volume of an element plotted against its atomic weight.",
              "A modern version of Meyer\u2019s graph demonstrating the periodic trends in the atomic volume of the elements, plotted against atomic weight.",
              "As we have seen, Mendeleev was not the first to attempt to find order within the elements, but it is his attempt that was so successful that it now forms the basis of the modern periodic table.",
              "Mendeleev did not have the easiest of starts in life.",
              "He was born at Tobolsk in 1834, the youngest child of a large Siberian family.",
              "His father died while he was young, and so his mother moved the family 1500 km to St.",
              "Petersburg, where she managed to get Dmitri into a \u201cgood school\u201c, recognising his potential.",
              "In his adult life he was a brilliant scientist, rising quickly in academic circles.",
              "He wrote a textbook, Chemical Principles, because he couldn\u2019t find an adequate Russian book.",
              "Mendeleev discovered the periodic table (or Periodic System, as he called it) while attempting to organise the elements in February of 1869.",
              "He did so by writing the properties of the elements on pieces of card and arranging and rearranging them until he realised that, by putting them in order of increasing atomic weight, certain types of element regularly occurred.",
              "For example, a reactive non-metal was directly followed by a very reactive light metal and then a less reactive light metal.",
              "Initially, the table had similar elements in horizontal rows, but he soon changed them to fit in vertical columns, as we see today.",
              "Not only did Mendeleev arrange the elements in the correct way, but if an element appeared to be in the wrong place due to its atomic weight, he moved it to where it fitted with the pattern he had discovered.",
              "For example, iodine and tellurium should be the other way around, based on atomic weights, but Mendeleev saw that iodine was very similar to the rest of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine), and tellurium similar to the group 6 elements (oxygen, sulphur, selenium), so he swapped them over.",
              "The real genius of Mendeleev\u2019s achievement was to leave gaps for undiscovered elements.",
              "He even predicted the properties of five of these elements and their compounds.",
              "And over the next 15 years, three of these elements were discovered and Mendeleev\u2019s predictions shown to be incredibly accurate.",
              "The table below shows the example of Gallium, which Mendeleev called eka-aluminium, because it was the element after aluminium.",
              "Scandium and Germanium were the other two elements discovered by 1886, and helped to cement the reputation of Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table.",
              "The final triumph of Mendeleev\u2019s work was slightly unexpected.",
              "The discovery of the noble gases during the 1890s by William Ramsay initially seemed to contradict Mendeleev\u2019s work, until he realised that actually they were further proof of his system, fitting in as the final group on his table.",
              "This gave the table the periodicity of 8 which we know, rather than 7 as it had previously been.",
              "Mendeleev never received a Nobel Prize for his work, but element 101 was named Mendelevium after him, an even rarer distinction.",

              "The periodic table was arranged by atomic mass, and this nearly always gives the same order as the atomic number.",
              "However, there were some exceptions (like iodine and tellurium, see above), which didn\u2019t work.",
              "Mendeleev had seen that they needed to be swapped around, but it was Moseley that finally determined why.",
              "He fired the newly-developed X-ray gun at samples of the elements, and measured the wavelength of X-rays given.",
              "He used this to calculate the frequency and found that when the square root of this frequency was plotted against atomic number, the graph showed a perfect straight line.",
              "He\u2019d found a way to actually measure atomic number.",
              "When the First World War broke out, Moseley turned down a position as a professor at Oxford and became an officer in the Royal Engineers.",
              "He was killed by a sniper in Turkey in August 15, and many people think that Britain lost a future Nobel prize winner.",
              "Within 10 years of his work, the structure of the atom had been determined through the work of many prominent scientists of the day, and this explained further why Moseley\u2019s X-rays corresponded so well with atomic number.",
              "The idea behind the explanation is that when an electron falls from a higher energy level to a lower one, the energy is released as electromagnetic waves, in this case X-rays.",
              "The amount of energy that is given out depends on how strongly the electrons are attracted to the nucleus.",
              "The more protons an atom has in its nucleus, the more strongly the electrons will be attracted and the more energy will be given out.",
              "As we know, atomic number is also known as proton number, and it is the amount of protons that determine the energy of the X-rays.",
              "After years of searching, at last we had a periodic table that really worked, and the fact that we still use it today is testament to the huge achievement of these and many other great minds of the last two centuries of scientific discovery."

              "Instead, he deliberately left blanks in his table at atomic masses 44, 68, 72, and 100, in the expectation that elements with those atomic masses would be discovered.",
              "Those blanks correspond to the elements we now know as scandium, gallium, germanium, and technetium.",
              "The groups in Mendeleev's table are determined by how many oxygen or hydrogen atoms are needed to form compounds with each element.",
              "For example, in Group I, two atoms of hydrogen, lithium, Li, sodium, Na, and potassium form compounds with one atom of oxygen.",
              "In Group VII, one atom of fluorine, F, chlorine, Cl, and bromine, Br, react with one atom of hydrogen.",
              "Notice how this approach has trouble with the transition metals.",
              "Until roughly 1960, a rectangular table developed from Mendeleev's table and based on reactivity was standard at the front of chemistry lecture halls.",
              "The most convincing evidence in support of Mendeleev\u2019s arrangement of the elements was the discovery of two previously unknown elements whose properties closely corresponded with his predictions (Table 2.",

              "Two of the blanks Mendeleev had left in his original table were below aluminum and silicon, awaiting the discovery of two as-yet-unknown elements, eka-aluminum and eka-silicon (from the Sanskrit eka, meaning \u201cone,\u201d as in \u201cone beyond aluminum\u201d).",
              "The observed properties of gallium and germanium matched those of eka-aluminum and eka-silicon so well that once they were discovered, Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table rapidly gained acceptance.",
              "When the chemical properties of an element suggested that it might have been assigned the wrong place in earlier tables, Mendeleev carefully reexamined its atomic mass.",
              "He discovered, for example, that the atomic masses previously reported for beryllium, indium, and uranium were incorrect.",
              "The atomic mass of indium had originally been reported as 75.",
              "6, based on an assumed stoichiometry of InO for its oxide.",

              "Mendeleev\u2019s greatest achievement was not the periodic table so much as the recognition of the periodic system on which it was based.",
              "This year marks the 100th anniversary of the death of one of the most famous scientists of all time, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev (1834\u20131907).",
              "The periodic table that he introduced in 1869 was a monumental achievement\u2014a wonderful mnemonic and a tool that serves to organize the whole of chemistry.",
              "No longer were students of chemistry obliged to memorize the properties of all the known elements;",
              "hereafter they could learn the properties of at least one element from each column and could, in principle, make sound predictions about the other group members.",
              "Arguably, however, Mendeleev\u2019s greatest achievement was not the periodic table so much as the recognition of the periodic system on which it was based.",
              "Of the nearly 1,000 variations that have been published since, all are attempts to represent the fundamental rule that after certain but varying intervals the chemical elements show an approximate repetition in their properties.",
              "Mendeleev was hardly the first to arrive at a periodic system.",
              "The observation that certain types of elements prefer to combine with certain other types prompted early chemists to classify the elements in tables of chemical affinities.",
              "In 1817 the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Do\u0308bereiner noticed the existence of groupings of elements in threes, subsequently called triads.",
              "The elements in these groupings displayed an important numerical relationship to each other: the equivalent weight (an early substitute for atomic weight) of the middle element had the approximate mean of the values of the two flanking elements.",
              "Although Do\u0308bereiner worked with the rather crude approximations of atomic weight available at the time, he successfully identified four such groups: strontium, calcium, and barium;",
              "bromine, iodine, and chlorine;",
              "sodium, lithium, and potassium;",
              "and selenium, sulfur, and tellurium.",
              "His triads\u2014which would eventually appear on the periodic table in vertical columns\u2014represented the first step in fitting the elements into a system that would account for their chemical properties and reveal their physical relationships.",
              "By the 1860s a number of scientists had moved beyond the triad concept to produce some very respectable periodic systems. The French geologist Alexandre-E\u0301mile Be\u0301guyer de Chancourtois achieved the first true periodic system in 1862 by arranging the elements by atomic weight in a spiral line wrapped around a metal cylinder.",
              "Periodic relationships could be seen by moving vertically down the screw.",
              "In 1863 and 1864 two British chemists, John Newlands and William Olding (coincidentally, both born in the same London borough of Southwark), independently published periodic tables that used atomic weight to arrange the elements into groups with analogous properties.",
              "A more eccentric spiral periodic system was created by the Danish-born polymath Gustavus Hinrichs in 1864.",
              "Hinrichs was intrigued that atomic spectral frequencies, like planetary distances, show whole number ratios, and he concluded that atomic spectra must therefore be an indication of atomic size.",
              "The closest precursor to Mendeleev\u2019s table in both chronological and philosophical terms was developed by Julius Lothar Meyer, a German chemist, in 1864.",
              "Although Meyer stressed physical rather than chemical properties, his table bears remarkable similarity to the one that Mendeleev would develop five years later.",
              "For a number of reasons, Meyer\u2019s prominence in the history books never matched Mendeleev\u2019s.",
              "There was an untimely delay in the publication of his most elaborate periodic table, and, perhaps more importantly, Meyer\u2014unlike Mendeleev\u2014hesitated to make predictions about unknown elements.",
              "Notwithstanding these earlier scientists\u2019 contributions to the idea of periodicity, Mendeleev remains the undisputed champion of the periodic system in the literal sense of its defense, propagation, and elaboration.",
              "Mendeleev\u2019s version of the periodic table left the biggest impact on the scientific community, both at the time it was produced and thereafter.",
              "In the popular imagination the periodic system invariably and justifiably connects to his name, to the same extent that the theory of evolution connects to Darwin\u2019s name and the theory of relativity to Einstein\u2019s.",
              "But what really set Mendeleev\u2019s contribution apart?",
              "By organizing the elements as he did Mendeleev took a stand on the centuries-old question of the philosophical status of the elements.",
              "Unlike some of his contemporaries Mendeleev rejected the suggestion that the periodic system implied the existence of any form of primary matter of which all the elements were composed.",
              "He maintained that all elements were strictly individual, indestructible, and irreducible, yet he acknowledged the seeming challenge posed by chemical reactions.",
              "Consider the familiar example of sodium chloride: common white table salt does not seem to include either poisonous grey metallic sodium or poisonous green gaseous chlorine.",
              "Aristotle had maintained that all matter was composed of some combination of four abstract elements: earth, fire, water, and air.",
              "Although the four elements were themselves unobservable, their relative proportions within a specific substance governed its properties.",
              "Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his contemporaries challenged this view in the 18th century with new concepts of simple substances.",
              "They created a list of 37 simple substances that could be isolated from the decomposition of compounds and could not be further decomposed by any known means.",
              "More than any of the other discoverers of the periodic system, Mendeleev was concerned with the philosophical status of the elements.",
              "At the beginning of the first volume of his landmark Principles of Chemistry (first English translation, New York, 1891;",
              "Osnovy Khimii, first edition, Saint Petersburg, 1869), he wrote, \u201cIt is useful in this sense to make a clear distinction between the conception of an element as a separate homogenous substance and as a material but invisible part of a compound\u201d (p.",
              "23).",
              "For Mendeleev an element was an entity that was essentially unobservable but formed the inner essence of simple bodies.",
              "Whereas a particular element was to be regarded as unchanging, its corresponding simple-body aspect could take many forms such as charcoal, diamond, and graphite in the case of carbon.",
              "His periodic table classified abstract elements, not simple substances.",
              "Mendeleev\u2019s genius lay in recognizing that just as it was the element in the abstract sense that survived intact in the course of compound formation, so atomic weight was the only quantity that survived in measurable amounts.",
              "He therefore took the step of associating these two features: an element\u2014a \u2014basic substance\u2014was to be characterized by its atomic weight.",
              "In a sense an abstract element had acquired a single measurable attribute that would remain unchanged in all its chemical combinations.",
              "Here, then, was a profound justification for using atomic weight as the basis for the classification of the elements, unlike any of the precursors to the periodic system.",
              "Toward the end of Mendeleev\u2019s life a growing body of evidence began to challenge his conception of the nature of the elements.",
              "Several revolutionary discoveries in physics showed that atoms were, in fact, reducible, and that there was a sense in which all elements are composed of the same primary matter: protons, neutrons, and electrons.",
              "Most alarmingly, there was even evidence to suggest that certain elements could be transformed into others through radioactivity.",
              "In 1879 J.",
              "J.",
              "Thomson identified electrons as the particles constituting cathode rays.",
              "By repeating his experiments with cathode rays produced by different elements, he concluded that the same particle was produced in every case, and that this particle was therefore a fundamental constituent of all matter.",
              "Shortly thereafter Henri Becquerel and the Curies began to explore the phenomenon of radioactivity.",
              "One of the most talented researchers attracted to the study of radioactivity was Ernest Rutherford, who suggested in 1902 that radioactive reactions had the power to transform certain elements into entirely different elements.",
              "While fully aware of the possible criticism that such a notion might bring, Rutherford and his colleague Frederick Soddy went so far as to describe this new phenomenon as chemical transmutation, thus evoking the age-old dream of the alchemists.",
              "As if the threat of transmutation were not enough, the discovery of isotopy nearly unraveled the entire periodic system.",
              "Scientists\u2019 failure to separate radioisotopes by chemical means threatened both the traditional notion of the elements and the utility of atomic weight as an elemental characteristic.",
              "Reflecting on this sad situation in the Annual Report to the London Chemical Society in 1911, Soddy wrote, \u201cChemical homogeneity is no longer a guarantee that any supposed element is not a mixture of several different atomic weights, or that any atomic weight is not merely a mean number.",
              "The constancy of atomic weight, whatever the source of the material, is not a complete proof of homogeneity.",
              "\u201d This situation was clarified somewhat when Soddy and Kasimir Fajans, a Polish-born chemist, independently suggested what became known as the group displacement laws in 1913.",
              "Each found that the emission of an alpha particle from an element produces an element located two places to the left on the periodic table, while the emission of a beta particle resulted in a movement one position to the right.",
              "For example if an atom of uranium-235 undergoes alpha decay, it forms an atom of thorium-231;",
              "meanwhile, an atom of actinium-230 can undergo a beta decay to form an atom of thorium-230.",
              "Today we would recognize both products as atoms of the same elements with different atomic weights, but at the time the matter of elemental identity had not yet been settled.",
              "By the 1920s the periodic system was in crisis.",
              "Many new isotopes had been discovered over a short period of time so that the number of \u201catoms,\u201d or fundamental units, suddenly seemed to have multiplied.",
              "At this point some chemists, including Fajans, called for abandoning Mendeleev\u2019s periodic system in favor of a more complicated table of isotopes.",
              "A way out appeared in the form of atomic numbers assigned by nuclear charge.",
              "The Austrian chemist Fritz Paneth championed the atomic number\u2014instead of atomic weight\u2014as the primary characteristic of the elements.",
              "Paneth, along with Hungarian chemist Gyo\u0308rgy Hevesy, showed that the chemical properties of isotopes of the same element were, for all intents and purposes, identical.",
              "Chemists could therefore regard the isotopes of any element as being the same simple substance, even though individual atoms might appear in different isotopic forms. If the discovery of isotopes threatened to undermine the periodic system, the discovery of the electron explained many of the periodic properties on which the table was based.",
              "J.",
              "J.",
              "Thomson attempted to explain the periodic system by postulating rings of electrons embedded in the positive charge that comprised his plum pudding model of the atom.",
              "Thomson\u2019s model was quickly superseded by more sophisticated and elaborate models of atomic structure.",
              "However, the origin of our current conception of electronic configurations\u2014an explanatory paradigm in much of chemistry\u2014can be traced to his ideas.",
              "Because of Thompson we know that the key to an atom\u2019s properties lies in the number of outer-shell electrons, and that in turn can be deduced\u2014with some exceptions\u2014from an element\u2019s position on the periodic table.",
              "The origin of electronic configuration is frequently and inaccurately attributed to Niels Bohr, who introduced quantum theory to the study of the atom.",
              "But Bohr essentially tidied up Thomson\u2019s pre-quantum configurations and took advantage of a more accurate knowledge of the number of electrons each of the elements actually possessed.",
              "Further developments in quantum theory, including Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle and Schro\u0308dinger\u2019s equation, led to a more rigorous theoretical explanation of the form of the periodic system.",
              "Collectively, these theories established the basic principles by which electronic configurations are assigned: as one moves from left to right on the periodic table, each element contains one additional electron (Bohr\u2019s aufbau principle);",
              "each additional electron, with certain exceptions, is added to the atom\u2019s outermost electron shell;",
              "only two electrons can fill a single orbital;",
              "when electrons fill orbitals of equal energy, they occupy as many different orbitals as possible;",
              "and no two electrons in an atom can share the same set of quantum numbers.",
              "The rules that govern the assignment of quantum numbers are rigorously explained by quantum theory, with the outcome that the first two shells contain a maximum of two and eight electrons\u2014at long last an explanation for the lengths of the first two periods of the table!",
              "Similar considerations for the third and fourth shells predict 18 and 32 electrons respectively, but this is not in accordance with the arrangement of the elements in the periodic table.",
              "The problem is this: the third row of the period table contains 8, not 18, electrons.",
              "It turns out that while quantum numbers provide a satisfying deductive explanation of the total number of electrons that any shell can hold, the correspondence of these values with the number of elements that occur in any particular period is something of a coincidence.",
              "The familiar sequence in which the s, p, d, and f orbitals are filled has essentially been determined by empirical means.",
              "Indeed, Bohr\u2019s failure to derive the order for the filling of the orbitals has been described by some as one of the outstanding problems of quantum mechanics.",
              "The simple textbook explanation\u2014that orbitals are filled in order of their relative energies \u2014has its limitations, as illustrated by the cases of chromium and copper.",
              "Both copper and chromium are anomalies in that electrons are added to the 3d orbital before the 4s orbital is closed;",
              "that is, their outer shells have configurations of 4s13d5 and 4s13d10 instead of the expected 4s23d4 and 4s23d9.",
              "Scholars have offered various simple explanations for this experimental finding, the most common of which is that the stability of a half-filled or fully-filled d shell offers the most energetically stable arrangement of electrons.",
              "However, since the configurations of the elements in the second transition series follow an even more \u201canomalous\u201d pattern\u2014not necessarily involving half-filled or fully filled shells\u2014it is clear that the explanation is specific to chromium and copper.",
              "Quantum mechanics can generally be used to explain a particular atom\u2019s empirical electronic configuration but that configuration usually cannot be deduced from quantum mechanics alone.",
              "It is something of a miracle that quantum mechanics explains the period table to the extent that it does;",
              "we should not let this fact seduce us into believing that it is a deductive explanation.",
              "Attempts to explain the details of the periodic table continue to challenge the ingenuity of quantum physicists and quantum chemists, and the periodic table will continue to present a test case for the adequacy of new methods developed in quantum chemistry.",
              "Our story has now been brought up to date.",
              "From its humble beginnings as a set of isolated triads of elements, the periodic system has grown to embody well over 100 elements, and it has survived the discovery of isotopes and the quantum revolution in the study of matter.",
              "Rather than being swept aside, it has continued to provide a challenge to the development of ever-more accurate means of calculating the basic properties of the atoms of the chemical elements.",
              "A century\u2019s worth of science has consolidated, rather than chipped away at the periodic system\u2019s central role in modern chemistry.",
              "The problem is no longer the validity of Mendeleev\u2019s system, but the best way to represent it.",
              "Should it be the original short-form table with 8 columns, the familiar medium-long form with 18 column, or perhaps even a long-form table with 32-column, which more naturally accommodates the rare earth elements into the main body of the table?",
              "Alternatively, some favor pyramidal tables while others advocate the left-step form proposed by Charles Janet in the 1920s.",
              "Theodor Benfey and Philip Stewart have proposed continuous spiral models.",
              "Hundreds, possibly even thousands, of periodic systems have been proposed, and each has its ardent supporters.",
              "Is there one best periodic table?",
              "Many chemists argue that the form of the table is of little importance, and that one\u2019s choice depends on what particular aspect of periodicity one wants to depict.",
              "But surely this is not the case if, for example, rival versions put helium and hydrogen in radically different places.",
              "Such debates will continue for a long time.",

              "After studying the alkaline earths, Mendeleev established that the order of atomic weights could be used not only to arrange the elements within each group but also to arrange the groups themselves.",
              "Thus, in his effort to make sense of the extensive knowledge that already existed of the chemical and physical properties of the chemical elements and their compounds, Mendeleev discovered the periodic law.",

              "In another department of physical chemistry, he investigated the expansion of liquids with heat, and devised a formula similar to Gay-Lussac's law of the uniformity of the expansion of gases, while in 1861 he anticipated Thomas Andrews' conception of the critical temperature of gases by defining the absolute boiling-point of a substance as the temperature at which cohesion and heat of vaporization become equal to zero and the liquid changes to vapor, irrespective of the pressure and volume.",

              "The English chemist John Newlands (1838\u20131898), who hypothesized that the chemistry of the elements might be related to their masses, arranged the known elements in order of increasing atomic mass and discovered that every seventh element had similar properties.",

              "Instead, he deliberately left blanks in his table at atomic masses 44, 68, 72, and 100\u2014in the expectation that elements with those atomic masses would be discovered.",

              "Mendeleev had predicted an atomic mass of 100 for eka-manganese in 1871, and the most stable isotope of technetium is 98Tc.",
              "[4] Germanium was isolated in 1886 and provided the best confirmation of the theory up to that time, due to its contrasting more clearly with its neighboring elements than the two previously confirmed predictions of Mendeleev do with theirs.",
              "The existence of an element between thorium (90) and uranium (92) was predicted by Mendeleev in 1871.",
              "In 1900, William Crookes isolated protactinium (91) as a radioactive material deriving from uranium that he could not identify.",
              "Different isotopes of protactinium were identified in Germany in 1913 and in 1918,[5] but the name protactinium was not given until 1948.",
              "Since the acceptance of Glenn T.",
              "Seaborg's actinide concept in 1945, thorium, uranium and protactinium have been classified as actinides;",
              "hence, protactinium does not occupy the place of eka-tantalum (under 73) in group 5.",
              "Eka-tantalum is actually the synthetic superheavy element dubnium (105).",
              "Mendeleev's 1869 table had implicitly predicted a heavier analog of titanium (22) and zirconium (40), but in 1871 he placed lanthanum (57) in that spot.",
              "The 1923 discovery of hafnium (72) validated Mendeleev's original 1869 prediction.",
              "Some other predictions were unsuccessful because he failed to recognise the presence of the lanthanides in the sixth row.",
              "[6] In 1902, having accepted the evidence for elements helium and argon, Mendeleev placed these noble gases in Group 0 in his arrangement of the elements.",
              "[7] As Mendeleev was doubtful of atomic theory to explain the law of definite proportions, he had no a priori reason to believe hydrogen was the lightest of elements, and suggested that a hypothetical lighter member of these chemically inert Group 0 elements could have gone undetected and be responsible for radioactivity.",
              "Currently some periodic tables of elements put lone neutrons in this place (see neutronium), and it matches Mendeleev's predictions fairly well.",
              "The heavier of the hypothetical proto-helium elements Mendeleev identified with coronium, named by association with an unexplained spectral line in the Sun's corona.",
              "A faulty calibration gave a wavelength of 531.",
              "68 nm, which was eventually corrected to 530.",

              "The kinetic velocity of this gas was calculated by Mendeleev to be 2,500,000 meters per second.",
              "Nearly massless, these gases were assumed by Mendeleev to permeate all matter, rarely interacting chemically.",
              "The high mobility and very small mass of the trans-hydrogen gases would result in the situation that they could be rarefied, yet appear to be very dense.",
              "[10][11] Mendeleev later published a theoretical expression of the ether in a small booklet entitled A Chemical Conception of the Ether (1904).",
              "His 1904 publication again contained two atomic elements smaller and lighter than hydrogen.",
              "He treated the \"ether gas\" as an interstellar atmosphere composed of at least two elements lighter than hydrogen.",
              "He stated that these gases originated due to violent bombardments internal to stars, the Sun being the most prolific source of such gases.",
              "According to Mendeleev's booklet, the interstellar atmosphere was probably composed of several additional elemental species."

              "Probably not, but a French Geology Professor made a significant advance towards it, even though at the time few people were aware of it.",
              "Alexandre Be\u0301guyer de Chancourtois was a geologist, but this was at a time when scientists specialised much less than they do today.",
              "His principal contribution to chemistry was the 'vis tellurique' (telluric screw), a three-dimensional arrangement of the elements constituting an early form of the periodic classification, published in 1862.",
              "The telluric screw plotted the atomic weights of the elements on the outside of a cylinder, so that one complete turn corresponded to an atomic weight increase of 16.",
              "As the diagram shows, this arrangement means that certain elements with similar properties appear in a vertical line.",
              "Although the telluric screw did not correctly display all the trends that were known at the time, de Chancourtois was the first to use a periodic arrangement of all of the known elements, showing that similar elements appear at periodic atom weights.",
              "The vis tellurique from De Chancourtois\u2019s original publication (right) and a copy drawn out with modern symbols (left).",
              "John Newlands was British;",
              "his father was a Scottish Presbyterian minister.",
              "He was educated by his father at home, and then studied for a year (1856) at the Royal College of Chemistry, which is now part of Imperial College London.",
              "Later he worked at an agricultural college trying to find patterns of behaviour in organic chemistry.",
              "However, he is remembered for his search for a pattern in inorganic chemistry.",
              "Just four years before Mendeleev announced his periodic table, Newlands noticed that there were similarities between elements with atomic weights that differed by seven.",
              "He called this The Law of Octaves, drawing a comparison with the octaves of music.",
              "The noble gases (Helium, Neon, Argon etc.)",
              "were not discovered until much later, which explains why there was a periodicity of 7 and not 8 in Newlands table.",
              "Newlands did not leave any gaps for undiscovered elements in his table, and sometimes had to cram two elements into one box in order to keep the pattern.",
              "Because of this, the Chemical Society refused to publish his paper, with one Professor Foster saying he might have equally well listed the elements alphabetically.",
              "Even when Mendeleev had published his table, and Newlands claimed to have discovered it first, the Chemical Society would not back him up.",
              "In 1884 he was asked to give a lecture of the Periodic Law by the Society, which went some way towards making amends.",
              "Finally, in 1998 the Royal Society of Chemistry oversaw the placing a blue commemorative plaque on the wall of his birthplace, recognising his discovery at last.",
              "The blue commemorative plaque placed at Newlands\u2019 birthplace, declaring him the \u201cdiscoverer of the Periodic Law for the chemical elements\u201d.",
              "Meyer trained at Heidelberg University under Bunsen and Kirchhoff, as did Mendeleev.",
              "So the two scientists would certainly have known each other although neither was aware of all the work done by the other.",
              "Meyer's roots, however, were firmly in Germany.",
              "Meyer was just four years older than Mendeleev, and produced several Periodic Tables between 1864-1870.",
              "His first table contained just 28 elements, organised by their valency (how many other atoms they can combine with).",
              "These elements were almost entirely main group elements, but in 1868 he incorporated the transition metals in a much more developed table.",
              "This 1868 table listed the elements in order of atomic weight, with elements with the same valency arranged in vertical lines, strikingly similar to Mendeleev\u2019s table.",
              "Unfortunately for Meyer, his work wasn\u2019t published until 1870, a year after Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table had been published.",
              "Even after 1870, Meyer and Mendeleev were still unaware of each other\u2019s work, although Meyer later admitted that Mendeleev had published his version first.",
              "Meyer did contribute to the development of the periodic table in another way though.",
              "He was the first person to recognise the periodic trends in the properties of elements, and the graph shows the pattern he saw in the atomic volume of an element plotted against its atomic weight.",
              "A modern version of Meyer\u2019s graph demonstrating the periodic trends in the atomic volume of the elements, plotted against atomic weight.",
              "As we have seen, Mendeleev was not the first to attempt to find order within the elements, but it is his attempt that was so successful that it now forms the basis of the modern periodic table.",
              "Mendeleev did not have the easiest of starts in life.",
              "He was born at Tobolsk in 1834, the youngest child of a large Siberian family.",
              "His father died while he was young, and so his mother moved the family 1500 km to St.",
              "Petersburg, where she managed to get Dmitri into a \u201cgood school\u201c, recognising his potential.",
              "In his adult life he was a brilliant scientist, rising quickly in academic circles.",
              "He wrote a textbook, Chemical Principles, because he couldn\u2019t find an adequate Russian book.",
              "Mendeleev discovered the periodic table (or Periodic System, as he called it) while attempting to organise the elements in February of 1869.",
              "He did so by writing the properties of the elements on pieces of card and arranging and rearranging them until he realised that, by putting them in order of increasing atomic weight, certain types of element regularly occurred.",
              "For example, a reactive non-metal was directly followed by a very reactive light metal and then a less reactive light metal.",
              "Initially, the table had similar elements in horizontal rows, but he soon changed them to fit in vertical columns, as we see today.",
              "Not only did Mendeleev arrange the elements in the correct way, but if an element appeared to be in the wrong place due to its atomic weight, he moved it to where it fitted with the pattern he had discovered.",
              "For example, iodine and tellurium should be the other way around, based on atomic weights, but Mendeleev saw that iodine was very similar to the rest of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine), and tellurium similar to the group 6 elements (oxygen, sulphur, selenium), so he swapped them over.",
              "The real genius of Mendeleev\u2019s achievement was to leave gaps for undiscovered elements.",
              "He even predicted the properties of five of these elements and their compounds.",
              "And over the next 15 years, three of these elements were discovered and Mendeleev\u2019s predictions shown to be incredibly accurate.",
              "The table below shows the example of Gallium, which Mendeleev called eka-aluminium, because it was the element after aluminium.",
              "Scandium and Germanium were the other two elements discovered by 1886, and helped to cement the reputation of Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table.",

              "Throughout its long history, the periodic table has been disputed, altered and improved as science has progressed and as new elements have been discovered [see \u201cMaking New Elements,\u201d by Peter Armbruster and Fritz Peter Hessberger].",

              "In an early attempt to organize the elements into a meaningful array, German chemist Johann Do\u0308bereiner pointed out in 1817 that many of the known elements could be arranged by their similarities into groups of three, which he called triads.",
              "Do\u0308bereiner singled out triads of the elements lithium, sodium and potassium as well as chlorine, bromine and iodine.",
              "He noticed that if the three members of a triad were ordered according to their atomic weights, the properties of the middle element fell in between those of the first and third elements.",
              "For example, lithium, sodium and potassium all react vigorously with water.",
              "But lithium, the lightest of the triad, reacts more mildly than the other two, whereas the heaviest of the three, potassium, explodes violently.",
              "In addition, Do\u0308bereiner showed that the atomic weight of the middle element is close to the average of the weights for the first and third members of the triad.",
              "Do\u0308bereiner\u2019s work encouraged others to search for correlations between the chemical properties of the elements and their atomic weights.",
              "One of those who pursued the triad approach further during the 19th century was Peter Kremers of Cologne, who suggested that certain elements could belong to two triads placed perpendicularly.",
              "Kremers thus broke new ground by comparing elements in two directions, a feature that later proved to be an essential aspect of Mendeleev\u2019s system.",
              "In 1857 French chemist Jean-Baptiste- Andre\u0301 Dumas turned away from the idea of triads and focused instead on devising a set of mathematical equations that could account for the increase in atomic weight among several groups of chemically similar elements.",
              "But as chemists now recognize, any attempt to establish an organizing pattern based on an element\u2019s atomic weight will not succeed, because atomic weight is not the fundamental property that characterizes each of the elements.",
              "Periodic Properties The crucial characteristic of Mendeleev\u2019s system was that it illustrated a periodicity, or repetition, in the properties of the elements at certain regular intervals.",
              "This feature had been observed previously in an arrangement of elements by atomic weight devised in 1862 by French geologist Alexandre- Emile Be\u0301guyer de Chancourtois.",
              "The system relied on a fairly intricate geometric configuration: de Chancourtois positioned the elements according to increasing atomic weight along a spiral inscribed on the surface of a cylinder and inclined at 45 degrees from the base.",
              "The first full turn of the spiral coincided with the element oxygen, and the second full turn occurred at sulfur.",
              "Elements that lined up vertically on the surface of the cylinder tended to have similar properties, so this arrangement succeeded in capturing some of the patterns that would later become central to Mendeleev\u2019s system.",
              "Yet for a number of reasons, de Chancourtois\u2019s system did not have much effect on scientists of the time: his original article failed to include a diagram of the table, the system was rather complicated, and the chemical similarities among elements were not displayed very convincingly.",
              "Several other researchers put forward their own versions of a periodic table during the 1860s.",
              "Using newly standardized values for atomic weights, English chemist John Newlands suggested in 1864 that when the elements were arranged in order of atomic weight, any one of the elements showed properties similar to those of the elements eight places ahead and eight places behind in the list\u2014a feature that Newlands called \u201cthe law of octaves.",
              "\u201d In his original table, Newlands left empty spaces for missing elements, but his more publicized version of 1866 did not include these open slots.",
              "Other chemists immediately raised objections to the table because it would not be able to accommodate any new elements that might be discovered.",
              "In fact, some investigators openly ridiculed Newlands\u2019s ideas.",
              "At a meeting of the Chemical Society in London in 1866, George Carey Foster of University College London asked Newlands whether he had considered ordering the elements alphabetically, because any kind of arrangement would present occasional coincidences.",
              "As a result of the meeting, the Chemical Society refused to publish Newlands\u2019s paper.",
              "Despite its poor reception, however, Newlands\u2019s work does represent the first time anyone used a sequence of ordinal numbers (in this case, one based on the sequence of atomic weights) to organize the elements.",
              "In this respect, Newlands anticipated the modern organization of the periodic table, which is based on the sequence of so-called atomic numbers.",
              "(The concept of atomic number, which indicates the number of protons present within an atom\u2019s nucleus, was not established until the early 20th century.)",
              "The Modern Periodic Table Chemist Julius Lothar Meyer of Breslau University in Germany, while in the process of revising his chemistry textbook in 1868, produced a periodic table that turned out to be remarkably similar to Mendeleev\u2019s famous 1869 version\u2014although Lothar Meyer failed to classify all the elements correctly.",
              "But the table did not appear in print until 1870 because of a publisher\u2019s delay\u2014a factor that contributed to an acrimonious dispute for priority that ensued between Lothar Meyer and Mendeleev.",
              "Around the same time, Mendeleev assembled his own periodic table while he, too, was writing a textbook of chemistry.",
              "Unlike his predecessors, Mendeleev had sufficient confidence in his periodic table to use it to predict several new elements and the properties of their compounds.",
              "He also corrected the atomic weights of some already known elements.",
              "Interestingly, Mendeleev admitted to having seen certain earlier tables, such as those of Newlands, but claimed to have been unaware of Lothar Meyer\u2019s work when developing his chart.",
              "Although the predictive aspect of Mendeleev\u2019s table was a major advance, it seems to have been overemphasized by historians, who have generally suggested that Mendeleev\u2019s table was accepted especially because of this feature.",
              "These scholars have failed to notice that the citation from the Royal Society of London that accompanied the Davy Medal (which Mendeleev received in 1882) makes no mention whatsoever of his predictions.",
              "Instead Mendeleev\u2019s ability to accommodate the already known elements may have contributed as much to the acceptance of the periodic system as did his striking predictions.",
              "Although numerous scientists helped to develop the periodic system, Mendeleev receives most of the credit for discovering chemical periodicity because he elevated the discovery to a law of nature and spent the rest of his life boldly examining its consequences and defending its validity.",
              "Defending the periodic table was no simple task\u2014its accuracy was frequently challenged by subsequent discoveries.",
              "One notable occasion arose in 1894, when William Ramsay of University College London and Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt) of the Royal Institution in London discovered the element argon;",
              "over the next few years, Ramsay announced the identification of four other elements\u2014helium, neon, krypton and xenon\u2014known as the noble gases.",
              "(The last of the known noble gases, radon, was discovered in 1900 by German physicist Friedrich Ernst Dorn.)",
              "The name \u201cnoble\u201d derives from the fact that all these gases seem to stand apart from the other elements, rarely interacting with them to form compounds.",
              "As a result, some chemists suggested that the noble gases did not even belong in the periodic table.",
              "These elements had not been predicted by Mendeleev or anyone else, and only after six years of intense effort could chemists and physicists successfully incorporate the noble gases into the table.",
              "In the new arrangement, an additional column was introduced between the halogens (the gaseous elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine and astatine) and the alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium and francium).",
              "A second point of contention surrounded the precise ordering of the elements.",
              "Mendeleev\u2019s original table positioned the elements according to atomic weight, but in 1913 Dutch amateur theoretical physicist Anton van den Broek suggested that the ordering principle for the periodic table lay instead in the nuclear charge of each atom.",
              "Physicist Henry Moseley, working at the University of Manchester, tested this hypothesis, also in 1913, shortly before his tragic death in World War I.",
              "Moseley began by photographing the x-ray spectrum of 12 elements, 10 of which occupied consecutive places in the periodic table.",
              "He discovered that the frequencies of features called K-lines in the spectrum of each element were directly proportional to the squares of the integers representing the position of each successive element in the table.",
              "As Moseley put it, here was proof that \u201cthere is in the atom a fundamental quantity, which increases by regular steps as we pass from one element to the next.",
              "\u201d This fundamental quantity, first referred to as atomic number in 1920 by Ernest Rutherford, who was then at the University of Cambridge, is now identified as the number of protons in the nucleus.",
              "Moseley\u2019s work provided a method that could be used to determine exactly how many empty spaces remained in the periodic table.",
              "After this discovery, chemists turned to using atomic number as the fundamental ordering principle for the periodic table, instead of atomic weight.",
              "This change resolved many of the lingering problems in the arrangement of the elements.",
              "For example, when iodine and tellurium were ordered according to atomic weight (with iodine first), the two elements appeared to be incorrectly positioned in terms of their chemical behavior.",
              "When ordered according to atomic number (with tellurium first), however, the two elements were in their correct positions.",
              "Understanding the Atom The periodic table inspired the work not only of chemists but also of atomic physicists struggling to understand the structure of the atom.",
              "In 1904, working at Cambridge, physicist J.",
              "J.",
              "Thomson (who also discovered the electron) developed a model of the atom, paying close attention to the periodicity of the elements.",
              "He proposed that the atoms of a particular element contained a specific number of electrons arranged in concentric rings.",
              "Furthermore, according to Thomson, elements with similar configurations of electrons would have similar properties;",
              "Thomson\u2019s work thus provided the first physical explanation for the periodicity of the elements.",
              "Although Thomson imagined the rings of electrons as lying inside the main body of the atom, rather than circulating around the nucleus as is believed today, his model does represent the first time anyone addressed the arrangement of electrons in the atom, a concept that pervades the whole of modern chemistry.",
              "Danish physicist Niels Bohr, the first to bring quantum theory to bear on the structure of the atom, was also motivated by the arrangement of the elements in the periodic system.",
              "In Bohr\u2019s model of the atom, developed in 1913, electrons inhabit a series of concentric shells that encircle the nucleus.",
              "Bohr reasoned that elements in the same group of the periodic table might have identical configurations of electrons in their outermost shell and that the chemical properties of an element would depend in large part on the arrangement of electrons in the outer shell of its atoms. Bohr\u2019s model of the atom also served to explain why the noble gases lack reactivity: noble gases possess full outer shells of electrons, making them unusually stable and unlikely to form compounds.",
              "Indeed, most other elements form compounds as a way to obtain full outer electron shells.",
              "More recent analysis of how Bohr arrived at these electronic configurations suggests that he functioned more like a chemist than has generally been credited.",
              "Bohr did not derive electron configurations from quantum theory but obtained them from the known chemical and spectroscopic properties of the elements.",
              "In 1924 another physicist, Austrianborn Wolfgang Pauli, set out to explain the length of each row, or period, in the table.",
              "As a result, he developed the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two electrons can exist in exactly the same quantum state, which is defined by what scientists call quantum numbers.",
              "The lengths of the various periods emerge from experimental evidence about the order of electron-shell filling and from the quantum-mechanical restrictions on the four quantum numbers that electrons can adopt.",
              "The modifications to quantum theory made by Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schro\u0308dinger in the mid-1920s yielded quantum mechanics in essentially the form used to this day.",
              "But the influence of these changes on the periodic table has been rather minimal.",
              "Despite the efforts of many physicists and chemists, quantum mechanics cannot explain the periodic table any further.",
              "For example, it cannot explain from first principles the order in which electrons fill the various electron shells.",
              "The electronic configurations of atoms, on which our modern understanding of the periodic table is based, cannot be derived using quantum mechanics (this is because the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics, the Schro\u0308dinger equation, cannot be solved exactly for atoms other than hydrogen).",
              "As a result, quantum mechanics can only reproduce Mendeleev\u2019s original discovery by the use of mathematical approximations\u2014it cannot predict the periodic system.",
              "Variations on a Theme In more recent times, researchers have proposed different approaches for displaying the periodic system.",
              "For instance, Fernando Dufour, a retired chemistry professor from Colle\u0300ge Ahuntsic in Montreal, has developed a three-dimensional periodic table, which displays the fundamental symmetry of the periodic law, unlike the common two-dimensional form of the table in common use.",
              "The same virtue is also seen in a version of the periodic table shaped as a pyramid, a form suggested on many occasions but most recently refined by William B.",
              "Jensen of the University of Cincinnati.",
              "Another departure has been the invention of periodic systems aimed at summarizing the properties of compounds rather than elements.",
              "In 1980 Ray Hefferlin of Southern Adventist University in Collegedale, Tenn.",
              ", devised a periodic system for all the conceivable diatomic molecules that could be formed between the first 118 elements (only 112 have been discovered to date).",
              "Hefferlin\u2019s chart reveals that certain properties of molecules\u2014the distance between atoms and the energy required to ionize the molecule, for instance\u2014occur in regular patterns.",

              "Dias\u2019s classification system is analogous to Do\u0308bereiner\u2019s triads of elements: any central molecule of a triad has a total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms that is the mean of the flanking entries, both downward and across the table.",
              "This scheme has been applied to a systematic study of the properties of benzenoid aromatic hydrocarbons and, with the use of graph theory, has led to predictions of the stability and reactivity of some of these compounds.",

              "After evolving for over 200 years through the work of many people, the periodic table remains at the heart of the study of chemistry.",

              "All members of a particular group have analogous outermost (valence) electron configurations, suggesting that all members of a group should show a family relationship in the types and numbers of the chemical bonds that they are able to form.",
              "The horizontal rows of the periodic table are called periods.",
              "Each period corresponds to the successive occupation of the orbitals in a valence shell of the atom, with the long periods corresponding to the occupation of the orbitals of a d subshell.",
              "Successive periods down the table correspond to successively higher values of n for the valence shell.",
              "The first period (consisting of only hydrogen and helium) corresponds to n = 1, the second period (from lithium to neon) to n = 2, and so on.",
              "These successive periods correspond to atoms in which the valence shell is outside a more electron-rich core of inner completed shells.",
              "Each of the first six periods terminates at a noble gas, with a closed-shell electron configuration.",
              "The replication of analogous electron configurations that characterizes the periodic table is an example of the periodicity of the elements and is responsible for the overall pattern of the elements when arranged as Dmitri Mendeleev, with chemical insight and without the benefit of quantum mechanics, had originally proposed.",
              "The elements show a rich variety of periodicities.",
              "Emphasis will be placed on the periodicity of the properties that are of direct relevance to the formation of chemical bonds.",
              "These properties are essentially the size of atoms and the energy required to remove electrons from or attach them to neutral atoms. Broadly speaking, the radii of atoms increase from the top to the bottom of the periodic table and decrease from left to right.",
              "Hence, the largest atoms are found at the lower left of the table, and the smallest ones are found at the upper right.",
              "The increase in radius down each group stems from the fact that in successive periods one more layer of the atomic \u201conion\u201d is being formed;",
              "that is, electrons are being added to a new shell outside a closed-shell core of the atom.",
              "Thus, lithium consists of one electron outside a compact, helium-like core, sodium consists of a single electron outside a neon-like core (which itself has a helium-like core deep within its structure), and so on down the group.",
              "The decrease in atomic radius from left to right across a period is perhaps more surprising, for a contraction in size occurs despite the presence of more electrons in each successive element.",
              "Thus, lithium has three electrons and beryllium (Be) has four, but beryllium is slightly smaller than lithium.",
              "Fluorine, with nine electrons, might be expected to be a significantly larger atom than lithium, but the opposite is true.",
              "The explanation of this seemingly counterintuitive trend is that, although successive elements have a larger number of electrons, they also have a higher nuclear charge because of the increasing number of protons.",
              "That positive charge draws in the surrounding electrons to make the atom more compact.",
              "The inner-shell, or core, electrons, which do not increase upon going across a period, effectively shield the outer-shell electrons from the positive charge of the nucleus.",
              "The outer-shell electrons that are added upon going across a period, however, do not shield other valence electrons from the increasing charge of the nucleus as well as the core electrons do.",
              "Thus, the outer-shell electrons are pulled in more closely by the greater charge of the nucleus.",
              "There is clearly competition (as is so often the case in chemistry) between the inflating effects of the presence of more electrons and the contracting effects of the stronger nuclear charge.",
              "With a few exceptions, the latter influence dominates slightly, and successive atoms are smaller on moving across a period.",
              "Ions, both cations and anions, show a similar variation in size with the position of their parent elements in the periodic table.",
              "However, there are two gross differences.",
              "First, cations (which are formed by the loss of electrons from the valence shell of the parent atom) are invariably smaller than their parent atoms. In some cases the difference can be considerable (more than 50 percent).",
              "In effect, the outer layer of the atomic \u201conion\u201d is discarded when the valence electrons are lost, so the radius of the cation is that of the compact atomic core.",
              "Anions, which are formed by the gain of electrons by an atom\u2014most commonly into the incomplete valence shell\u2014are invariably larger than the parent atoms. In this case, the additional electrons repel the electrons that are already present, and the entire atom inflates.",
              "Next in order of importance for determining the number and type of chemical bonds that an atom may form is the ionization energy of the element.",
              "It is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from an atom of the element.",
              "The energy is required because all the electrons of an atom are attracted by the positive charge of the nucleus, and work must be done to drag the electron off the atom to produce a cation.",
              "Chemical bond formation stems from the transfer or sharing of electrons, and so the energy required to remove an electron is a crucial criterion in the ability of an atom to form a bond.",
              "In broad terms, the variation of ionization energies throughout the periodic table mirrors the variation in atomic radii, with small atoms typically having high ionization energies and large atoms usually having small ones.",
              "Thus, the elements with the lowest ionization energies (and hence from which an electron is most readily removed) are found at the lower left of the periodic table, near cesium and francium, and elements with the highest ionization energies are found at the upper right of the table, close to fluorine and helium.",
              "The variation in ionization energy correlates with the variation in atomic radius because a valence electron in a bulky atom is on average far from the nucleus and therefore experiences only a weak attraction to it.",
              "On the other hand, a valence electron in a small atom is close to its parent nucleus and is subject to a strong attractive force.",
              "At this point the relative inertness of the noble gases can in part be explained.",
              "They lie on the right in the periodic table, and the members of the family that are closest to helium (namely, neon and argon) have ionization energies that are among the highest of all the elements.",
              "Thus, their electrons are not readily available for bond formation.",
              "Only lower in the group, at krypton and xenon, do the ionization energies become comparable to those of other elements, and these elements can be coaxed into compound formation by sufficiently aggressive reagents (most notably by fluorine).",
              "An important feature of the ionization energy is that the energy required to remove a second electron from an atom is always higher than the energy needed to remove the first electron.",
              "Once an electron has been removed, there are fewer electrons to repel one another in the cation, so more work must be done to drag the next electron away from the nucleus.",
              "The same is true of the third electron, which is even less available than the second electron.",
              "However, an important point is that, if an electron needs to be removed from the core of the atom (as is the case for a second electron removed from sodium), then the ionization energy may be exceedingly high and not attainable in the course of a typical chemical reaction (as will be justified below).",
              "The reason for the high ionization energies of core electrons is largely that these electrons lie much closer to the nucleus than do the valence electrons, and thus they are gripped by it much more strongly.",
              "It is a general rule that for elements on the left in the periodic table, which have one, two, or three electrons in their valence shells, sufficient energy is attainable in chemical reactions for their removal, but not enough energy is available for removing any electrons from inner shells.",
              "Hence, sodium can form Na+ ions, magnesium can form Mg2+ ions, and aluminum can form Al3+ ions.",
              "One reason for the importance of noble gas configurations in chemical bond formation now becomes apparent.",
              "Once a noble gas, closed-shell configuration is obtained, the ready removal of electrons to form cations ceases (as does the opportunity for the partial removal of electrons for the sharing required in the formation of covalent bonds, as discussed below).",
              "A large energy barrier is encountered when going beyond the removal of the valence electrons of an atom.",
              "Ionization energies do not correlate with atomic radii exactly, because there are other influences beyond the distance of the electron from the nucleus that determine the energy needed to remove an electron.",
              "These influences include the details of the occupation of the orbitals in the valence shell.",
              "Once again, the origin of a further possibility for competition becomes apparent, in this case between effects that stem from size alone and those that are determined by the energy requirements for ionization."

              "The periodic table has gone through many changes since Dmitri Mendeleev drew up its original design in 1869, yet both the first table and the modern periodic table are important for the same reason: The periodic table organizes elements according to similar properties so you can tell the characteristics of an element just by looking at its location on the table.",
              "Before all naturally occurring elements were discovered, the periodic table was used to predict the chemical and physical properties of elements in the gaps on the table.",
              "Today, the table can be used to predict properties of elements yet to be discovered, although these new elements are all highly radioactive and break down into more familiar elements almost instantly.",
              "Now, the table is useful for modern students and scientists because it helps predict the types of chemical reactions that a particular element is likely to participate in.",
              "Rather than memorizing facts and figures for each element, students and scientists need only glance at the table to learn much about the reactivity of an element, whether it is likely to conduct electricity, whether it is hard or soft, and many other characteristics.",
              "Elements in the same column as one other are known as groups and they share similar properties.",
              "For example, the elements in the first column (the alkali metals) are all metals that usually carry a 1+ charge in reactions, react vigorously with water, and combine readily with nonmetals.",
              "Elements in the same row as one other are known as periods and they share the same highest unexcited electron energy level.",
              "Another useful feature of the periodic table is that most tables provide all the information you need to balance chemical reactions at a glance.",
              "The table tells each element's atomic number and usually its atomic weight.",
              "The typical charge of an element is indicated by its group.",
              "The periodic table is organized according to trends in element properties.",
              "As you move from left to right across a row of elements, the atomic radius (the size of an element's atoms) decreases, ionization energy (the energy required to remove an electron from an atom) increases, electron affinity (the amount of energy released when an atom forms a negative ion) generally increases, and electronegativity (an atom's tendency to attract a pair of electrons) increases.",
              "As you move from top to bottom down a column of elements, the atomic radius increases, ionization energy decreases, electron affinity usually decreases, and electronegativity decreases.",
              "To summarize, the periodic table is important because it is organized to provide a great deal of information about elements and how they relate to one another in one easy-to-use reference.",

          "Alkali metals react with water to produce hydrogen gas and alkali metal hydroxides; this is a very exothermic reaction (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)).  ",
          "In chemistry the discovery of numerical regularities among groups of three elements such as lithium, sodium and potassium produced the concept of triads as first discussed by Do\u0308bereiner (1829).",
          "Many triads were then assembled together to produce some early periodic systems by Lothar Meyer and Mendeleev among others.",
          "The triad of lithium, sodium and potassium represents such a case of periodicity in that these elements have similar chemical properties including their valences of one unit.",
          "When Do\u0308bereiner discovered that lithium, sodium and potassium formed a triad he used the atomic weights of these elements.",
          "He found the atomic weight of sodium was approximately the mean of the atomic weights of lithium and potassium.",

          "These early periodic table had two main ingredients. Atomic weights were used to order the elements into a continuous sequence (primary classification) and chemical properties such as valences were used to mark periodicity between certain elements (secondary classification) within the primary sequence of elements."

          "The English chemist John Newlands (1838\u20131898), hypothesizing that the chemistry of the elements might be related to their masses, arranged the known elements in order of increasing atomic mass and discovered that every seventh element had similar properties (Figure 2. 4. 1).",
          "Newlands therefore suggested that the elements could be classified into octaves A group of seven elements, corresponding to the horizontal rows in the main group elements (not counting the noble gases, which were unknown at the time).",
