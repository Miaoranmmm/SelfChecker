    "query": "What inspired the creation of the periodic table and how has it evolved over time to become the universally recognized tool for understanding the properties and behaviors of elements?",
    "response": "The periodic table is a tool for understanding the properties and behaviors of elements based on their atomic structure. The creation of the periodic table was inspired by the discovery of many new elements and the observation of patterns and trends among them. The periodic table has evolved over time as more elements were discovered, new atomic theories were developed, and new technologies were invented.\n\nThe first person to publish a version of the periodic table that we would recognize today was **Dmitri Mendeleev**, a Russian chemist, in **1869**[^1^] [^4^]. He arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and grouped them by their chemical and physical properties. He also left gaps for elements that he predicted would be discovered later and corrected some of the atomic weights based on his table[^5^]. Mendeleev's table was widely accepted by the scientific community and he was recognized as the father of the periodic table.\n\nHowever, Mendeleev was not the only one who contributed to the development of the periodic table. Before him, several other chemists tried to classify the elements based on their properties, such as Antoine Lavoisier, Johann D\u00f6bereiner, Alexandre-Emile B\u00e9guyer de Chancourtois, John Newlands, Julius Lothar Meyer, and William Odling[^2^]. Some of them used different criteria or methods to arrange the elements, such as triads, octaves, spirals, or graphs. Some of them also noticed the periodicity or repetition of properties among the elements.\n\nAfter Mendeleev, the periodic table underwent several changes and expansions as new discoveries were made. Some of the major milestones include:\n\n- The discovery of **inert gases** or noble gases, such as helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon, by William Ramsay and others in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These elements were added to a new group at the end of each period in the periodic table[^2^].\n- The discovery of **radioactivity** and **isotopes** by Henri Becquerel, Marie Curie, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Soddy, and others in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These phenomena showed that some elements can decay into other elements and that some elements can have different forms with different atomic weights but the same chemical properties[^2^].\n- The discovery of **atomic number** by Henry Moseley in 1913. He showed that each element has a unique number of protons in its nucleus and that this number determines its chemical properties. He also rearranged the periodic table based on atomic number instead of atomic weight, which solved some of the anomalies and inconsistencies in Mendeleev's table[^2^].\n- The development of **quantum mechanics** and **electron shell** theory by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Wolfgang Pauli, Linus Pauling, and others in the early 20th century. They explained how electrons are arranged in different energy levels around the nucleus and how this affects the chemical bonding and reactivity of elements. They also introduced the concept of blocks (s,p,d,f) to group elements by their outermost electron configuration[^2^].\n- The discovery of **proton** and **neutron** by Ernest Rutherford and James Chadwick in 1919 and 1932 respectively. They showed that the nucleus consists of two types of particles with different charges and masses and that these determine the atomic number and mass number of an element[^2^].\n- The discovery of **lanthanides** and **actinides**, two series of elements with similar properties that are placed below the main body of the periodic table. The lanthanides were mostly discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by various chemists who isolated them from rare-earth minerals. The actinides were mostly discovered in the mid-20th century by various physicists who synthesized them by nuclear reactions[^2^].\n- The discovery of **transuranium elements**, or elements with higher atomic numbers than uranium (92), by various teams of scientists in different countries using particle accelerators or nuclear reactors. These elements are mostly unstable and have very short half-lives. The most recent element to be confirmed is oganesson (118), which was first reported in 2006 by a Russian-American collaboration[^2^].\n- The exploration of **relativistic effects** and **expansions beyond period 7** by various theorists and experimentalists in the late 20th and early 21",

              "Within these two groups of dissimilar elements, he discovered similarities in the progression of atomic weights, and he wondered if other groups of elements exhibited similar properties.",
              "After studying the alkaline earths, Mendeleev established that the order of atomic weights could be used not only to arrange the elements within each group but also to arrange the groups themselves.",
              "Thus, in his effort to make sense of the extensive knowledge that already existed of the chemical and physical properties of the chemical elements and their compounds, Mendeleev discovered the periodic law.",

              "The following year, German chemist Lothar Meyer independently published a very similar table.",
              "Mendeleev is generally given more credit than Meyer because his table was published first, and because of several key insights that he made regarding the table.",
              "Mendeleev was writing a chemistry textbook for his students and wanted to organize all of the known elements at that time according to their chemical properties.",
              "He famously organized the information for each element onto separate note cards that were then easy to rearrange as needed.",
              "He discovered that when he placed them in order of increasing atomic mass, certain similarities in chemical behavior repeated at regular intervals.",
              "This type of a repeating pattern is called \"periodic\".",
              "A pendulum that swings back and forth in a given time interval is periodic, as is the movement of the moon around the Earth.",
              "In the figure above, atomic mass increases from top to bottom of vertical columns, with successive columns going left to right.",
              "As a result, elements that are in the same horizontal row are groups of elements that were known to exhibit similar chemical properties.",
              "One of Mendeleev's insights is illustrated by the elements tellurium \\(\\left( \\ce{Te} \\right)\\) and iodine \\(\\left( \\ce{I} \\right)\\).",
              "Notice that tellurium is listed before iodine even though its atomic mass is higher.",
              "Mendeleev reversed the order because he knew that the properties of iodine were much more similar to those of fluorine \\(\\left( \\ce{F} \\right)\\), chlorine \\(\\left( \\ce{Cl} \\right)\\), and bromine \\(\\left( \\ce{Br} \\right)\\) than they were to oxygen \\(\\left( \\ce{O} \\right)\\), sulfur \\(\\left( \\ce{S} \\right)\\), and selenium \\(\\left( \\ce{Se} \\right)\\).",

              "In these places he not only predicted there were as-yet-undiscovered elements, but he predicted their atomic weights and their characteristics.",
              "The discovery of new elements in the 1870s that fulfilled several of his predictions brought increased interest to the periodic system and it became not only an object of study but a tool for research.",

              "In the 1890s, William Ramsay discovered an entirely new and unpredicted set of elements, the noble gases.",
              "After uncovering the first two, argon and helium, he quickly discovered three more elements after using the periodic system to predict their atomic weights.",
              "The noble gases had unusual characteristics\u2014they were largely inert and resistant to combining with other substances\u2014but the entire set fit easily into the system.",
              "The discovery of radioactivity in 1896 seemed poised to destroy the periodic system.",

              "Rather than atomic weight, atomic number\u2014the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom\u2014determined the characteristics of an element.",

              "Mendeleev\u2019s early periodic system \u2013 shown here in its 1871 form \u2013 looked much different from the modern periodic table known to today\u2019s chemistry students.",
              "The majority of these tables look fantastical in comparison with the castle-like table that is found in classrooms. Curved forms such as spirals, helices, and three-dimensional figures-of-eight were wildly popular amongst educators well into the twentieth century.",

              "He received a master\u2019s degree in 1856 and began to conduct research in organic chemistry.",
              "Financed by a government fellowship, he went to study abroad for two years at the University of Heidelberg.",
              "Instead of working closely with the prominent chemists of the university, including Robert Bunsen, Emil Erlenmeyer, and August Kekule\u0301, he set up a laboratory in his own apartment.",
              "In September 1860 he attended the International Chemistry Congress in Karlsruhe, convened to discuss such crucial issues as atomic weights, chemical symbols, and chemical formulas.",
              "There he met and established contacts with many of Europe\u2019s leading chemists.",
              "In later years Mendeleev would especially remember a paper circulated by the Italian chemist Stanislao Cannizzaro that clarified the notion of atomic weights.",
              "In 1861 Mendeleev returned to St.",
              "Petersburg, where he obtained a professorship at the Technological Institute in 1864.",

              "Petersburg (now St.",
              "Petersburg State University).",
              "He became professor of general chemistry in 1867 and continued to teach there until 1890.",
              "As he began to teach inorganic chemistry, Mendeleev could not find a textbook that met his needs.",
              "Since he had already published a textbook on organic chemistry in 1861 that had been awarded the prestigious Demidov Prize, he set out to write another one.",
              "The result was Osnovy khimii (1868\u201371;",
              "The Principles of Chemistry), which became a classic, running through many editions and many translations.",
              "When Mendeleev began to compose the chapter on the halogen elements (chlorine and its analogs) at the end of the first volume, he compared the properties of this group of elements to those of the group of alkali metals such as sodium.",
              "Within these two groups of dissimilar elements, he discovered similarities in the progression of atomic weights, and he wondered if other groups of elements exhibited similar properties.",
              "After studying the alkaline earths, Mendeleev established that the order of atomic weights could be used not only to arrange the elements within each group but also to arrange the groups themselves.",
              "Thus, in his effort to make sense of the extensive knowledge that already existed of the chemical and physical properties of the chemical elements and their compounds, Mendeleev discovered the periodic law.",
              "His newly formulated law was announced before the Russian Chemical Society in March 1869 with the statement \u201celements arranged according to the value of their atomic weights present a clear periodicity of properties.",
              "\u201d Mendeleev\u2019s law allowed him to build up a systematic table of all the 70 elements then known.",
              "He had such faith in the validity of the periodic law that he proposed changes to the generally accepted values for the atomic weight of a few elements and predicted the locations within the table of unknown elements together with their properties.",
              "At first the periodic system did not raise interest among chemists.",
              "However, with the discovery of the predicted elements, notably gallium in 1875, scandium in 1879, and germanium in 1886, it began to win wide acceptance.",
              "Gradually the periodic law and table became the framework for a great part of chemical theory.",
              "By the time Mendeleev died in 1907, he enjoyed international recognition and had received distinctions and awards from many countries."

              "This year marks the 100th anniversary of the death of one of the most famous scientists of all time, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev (1834\u20131907).",
              "The periodic table that he introduced in 1869 was a monumental achievement\u2014a wonderful mnemonic and a tool that serves to organize the whole of chemistry.",
              "No longer were students of chemistry obliged to memorize the properties of all the known elements;",
              "hereafter they could learn the properties of at least one element from each column and could, in principle, make sound predictions about the other group members.",
              "Arguably, however, Mendeleev\u2019s greatest achievement was not the periodic table so much as the recognition of the periodic system on which it was based.",
              "Of the nearly 1,000 variations that have been published since, all are attempts to represent the fundamental rule that after certain but varying intervals the chemical elements show an approximate repetition in their properties.",
              "Mendeleev was hardly the first to arrive at a periodic system.",
              "The observation that certain types of elements prefer to combine with certain other types prompted early chemists to classify the elements in tables of chemical affinities.",
              "In 1817 the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Do\u0308bereiner noticed the existence of groupings of elements in threes, subsequently called triads.",
              "The elements in these groupings displayed an important numerical relationship to each other: the equivalent weight (an early substitute for atomic weight) of the middle element had the approximate mean of the values of the two flanking elements.",
              "Although Do\u0308bereiner worked with the rather crude approximations of atomic weight available at the time, he successfully identified four such groups: strontium, calcium, and barium;",
              "bromine, iodine, and chlorine;",
              "sodium, lithium, and potassium;",
              "and selenium, sulfur, and tellurium.",
              "His triads\u2014which would eventually appear on the periodic table in vertical columns\u2014represented the first step in fitting the elements into a system that would account for their chemical properties and reveal their physical relationships.",
              "By the 1860s a number of scientists had moved beyond the triad concept to produce some very respectable periodic systems. The French geologist Alexandre-E\u0301mile Be\u0301guyer de Chancourtois achieved the first true periodic system in 1862 by arranging the elements by atomic weight in a spiral line wrapped around a metal cylinder.",
              "Periodic relationships could be seen by moving vertically down the screw.",
              "In 1863 and 1864 two British chemists, John Newlands and William Olding (coincidentally, both born in the same London borough of Southwark), independently published periodic tables that used atomic weight to arrange the elements into groups with analogous properties.",
              "A more eccentric spiral periodic system was created by the Danish-born polymath Gustavus Hinrichs in 1864.",
              "Hinrichs was intrigued that atomic spectral frequencies, like planetary distances, show whole number ratios, and he concluded that atomic spectra must therefore be an indication of atomic size.",
              "The closest precursor to Mendeleev\u2019s table in both chronological and philosophical terms was developed by Julius Lothar Meyer, a German chemist, in 1864.",
              "Although Meyer stressed physical rather than chemical properties, his table bears remarkable similarity to the one that Mendeleev would develop five years later.",
              "For a number of reasons, Meyer\u2019s prominence in the history books never matched Mendeleev\u2019s.",
              "There was an untimely delay in the publication of his most elaborate periodic table, and, perhaps more importantly, Meyer\u2014unlike Mendeleev\u2014hesitated to make predictions about unknown elements.",
              "Notwithstanding these earlier scientists\u2019 contributions to the idea of periodicity, Mendeleev remains the undisputed champion of the periodic system in the literal sense of its defense, propagation, and elaboration.",
              "Mendeleev\u2019s version of the periodic table left the biggest impact on the scientific community, both at the time it was produced and thereafter.",
              "In the popular imagination the periodic system invariably and justifiably connects to his name, to the same extent that the theory of evolution connects to Darwin\u2019s name and the theory of relativity to Einstein\u2019s.",
              "But what really set Mendeleev\u2019s contribution apart?",
              "By organizing the elements as he did Mendeleev took a stand on the centuries-old question of the philosophical status of the elements.",
              "Unlike some of his contemporaries Mendeleev rejected the suggestion that the periodic system implied the existence of any form of primary matter of which all the elements were composed.",
              "He maintained that all elements were strictly individual, indestructible, and irreducible, yet he acknowledged the seeming challenge posed by chemical reactions.",

              "It turns out that while quantum numbers provide a satisfying deductive explanation of the total number of electrons that any shell can hold, the correspondence of these values with the number of elements that occur in any particular period is something of a coincidence.",

              "Unfortunately for Meyer, his work wasn\u2019t published until 1870, a year after Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table had been published.",
              "Even after 1870, Meyer and Mendeleev were still unaware of each other\u2019s work, although Meyer later admitted that Mendeleev had published his version first.",
              "Meyer did contribute to the development of the periodic table in another way though.",
              "He was the first person to recognise the periodic trends in the properties of elements, and the graph shows the pattern he saw in the atomic volume of an element plotted against its atomic weight.",

              "As we have seen, Mendeleev was not the first to attempt to find order within the elements, but it is his attempt that was so successful that it now forms the basis of the modern periodic table.",
              "Mendeleev did not have the easiest of starts in life.",
              "He was born at Tobolsk in 1834, the youngest child of a large Siberian family.",

              "He wrote a textbook, Chemical Principles, because he couldn\u2019t find an adequate Russian book.",
              "Mendeleev discovered the periodic table (or Periodic System, as he called it) while attempting to organise the elements in February of 1869.",
              "He did so by writing the properties of the elements on pieces of card and arranging and rearranging them until he realised that, by putting them in order of increasing atomic weight, certain types of element regularly occurred.",
              "For example, a reactive non-metal was directly followed by a very reactive light metal and then a less reactive light metal.",
              "Initially, the table had similar elements in horizontal rows, but he soon changed them to fit in vertical columns, as we see today.",
              "Not only did Mendeleev arrange the elements in the correct way, but if an element appeared to be in the wrong place due to its atomic weight, he moved it to where it fitted with the pattern he had discovered.",
              "For example, iodine and tellurium should be the other way around, based on atomic weights, but Mendeleev saw that iodine was very similar to the rest of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine), and tellurium similar to the group 6 elements (oxygen, sulphur, selenium), so he swapped them over.",
              "The real genius of Mendeleev\u2019s achievement was to leave gaps for undiscovered elements.",
              "He even predicted the properties of five of these elements and their compounds.",
              "And over the next 15 years, three of these elements were discovered and Mendeleev\u2019s predictions shown to be incredibly accurate.",
              "The table below shows the example of Gallium, which Mendeleev called eka-aluminium, because it was the element after aluminium.",
              "Scandium and Germanium were the other two elements discovered by 1886, and helped to cement the reputation of Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table.",
              "The final triumph of Mendeleev\u2019s work was slightly unexpected.",
              "The discovery of the noble gases during the 1890s by William Ramsay initially seemed to contradict Mendeleev\u2019s work, until he realised that actually they were further proof of his system, fitting in as the final group on his table.",
              "This gave the table the periodicity of 8 which we know, rather than 7 as it had previously been.",
              "Mendeleev never received a Nobel Prize for his work, but element 101 was named Mendelevium after him, an even rarer distinction.",

              "Within 10 years of his work, the structure of the atom had been determined through the work of many prominent scientists of the day, and this explained further why Moseley\u2019s X-rays corresponded so well with atomic number.",
              "The idea behind the explanation is that when an electron falls from a higher energy level to a lower one, the energy is released as electromagnetic waves, in this case X-rays.",
              "The amount of energy that is given out depends on how strongly the electrons are attracted to the nucleus.",
              "The more protons an atom has in its nucleus, the more strongly the electrons will be attracted and the more energy will be given out.",
              "As we know, atomic number is also known as proton number, and it is the amount of protons that determine the energy of the X-rays.",
              "After years of searching, at last we had a periodic table that really worked, and the fact that we still use it today is testament to the huge achievement of these and many other great minds of the last two centuries of scientific discovery."

              "Seaborg wondered if these elements belonged to a different series, which would explain why their chemical properties, in particular the instability of higher oxidation states, were different from predictions.",
              "[106] In 1945, against the advice of colleagues, he proposed a significant change to Mendeleev's table: the actinide series.",
              "[105][107] Seaborg's actinide concept of heavy element electronic structure proposed that the actinides form an inner transition series analogous to the rare-earth series of lanthanide elements\u2014they would comprise the second row of the f-block (the 5f series), in which the lanthanides formed the 4f series.",

              "However, these studies could not unambiguously determine the first element with 5f electrons and therefore the first element in the actinide series;",
              "[106] it was thus also referred to as the \"thoride\" or \"uranide\" series until it was later found that the series began with actinium.",
              "[105][108] In light of these observations and an apparent explanation for the chemistry of transuranic elements, and despite fear among his colleagues that it was a radical idea that would ruin his reputation, Seaborg nevertheless submitted it to Chemical & Engineering News and it gained widespread acceptance;",
              "new periodic tables thus placed the actinides below the lanthanides.",
              "[107] Following its acceptance, the actinide concept proved pivotal in the groundwork for discoveries of heavier elements, such as berkelium in 1949.",
              "[109] It also supported experimental results for a trend towards +3 oxidation states in the elements beyond americium\u2014a trend observed in the analogous 4f series.",
              "[105] Seaborg's subsequent elaborations of the actinide concept theorized a series of superheavy elements in a transactinide series comprising elements from 104 to 121 and a superactinide series of elements from 122 to 153.",
              "[106] He proposed an extended periodic table with an additional period of 50 elements (thus reaching element 168);",
              "this eighth period was derived from an extrapolation of the Aufbau principle and placed elements 121 to 138 in a g-block, in which a new g subshell would be filled.",
              "[110] Seaborg's model, however, did not take into account relativistic effects resulting from high atomic number and electron orbital speed.",
              "Burkhard Fricke in 1971[111] and Pekka Pyykko\u0308 in 2010[112] used computer modeling to calculate the positions of elements up to Z = 172, and found that the positions of several elements were different from those predicted by Seaborg.",
              "Although models from Pyykko\u0308 and Fricke generally place element 172 as the next noble gas, there is no clear consensus on the electron configurations of elements beyond 120 and thus their placement in an extended periodic table.",
              "It is now thought that because of relativistic effects, such an extension will feature elements that break the periodicity in known elements, thus posing another hurdle to future periodic table constructs.",
              "[112] The discovery of tennessine in 2010 filled the last remaining gap in the seventh period.",
              "Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period.",

              "In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at University of California, Berkeley observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and between dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups 4 and 5.",
              "More recent experiments on copernicium and flerovium have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas radon rather than mercury and lead, their respective congeners.",

              "Rather, as we go down a list of elements in order of atomic weights, corresponding properties are observed at regular intervals.",

              "Mendeleev therefore left blank spaces for undiscovered elements and predicted their properties by averaging the characteristics of other elements in the same group.",

              "For example, Mendeleev\u2019s fourth and fifth rows are both contained in the fourth period of the modern table.",
              "This ends up placing gallium, not scandium underneath boron in the periodic table.",

              "Winner of the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Ramsay helped establish the noble gases as a new group in the periodic table.",
              "He first discovered argon and then helium, followed by the other noble gases.",
              "The Scottish chemist William Ramsay (1852\u20131916) is known for work that introduced a whole new group to the periodic table, variously called over time the inert, rare, or noble gases.",
              "In the last decade of the 19th century he and the famous physicist Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt, 1842\u20131919)\u2014already known for his work on sound, light, and other electromagnetic radiation\u2014carried out separate investigations, for which they received Nobel Prizes in 1904, Ramsay in chemistry and Lord Rayleigh in physics.",
              "Ramsay began his studies in his native city of Glasgow and completed a doctorate in chemistry at Tu\u0308bingen, focusing on organic chemistry.",
              "On his return to Great Britain and his appointment to academic posts at the University of Bristol and then at University College London, he became known for the inventiveness and scrupulousness of his experimental techniques, especially for his methods for determining the molecular weights of substances in the liquid state.",
              "In 1892 Ramsay\u2019s curiosity was piqued by Lord Rayleigh\u2019s observation that the density of nitrogen extracted from the air was always greater than nitrogen released from various chemical compounds.",
              "Ramsay then set about looking for an unknown gas in air of greater density, which\u2014when he found it\u2014he named argon.",
              "While investigating for the presence of argon in a uranium-bearing mineral, he instead discovered helium, which since 1868 had been known to exist, but only in the sun.",
              "This second discovery led him to suggest the existence of a new group of elements in the periodic table.",
              "He and his coworkers quickly isolated neon, krypton, and xenon from the earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
              "The remarkable inertness of these elements resulted in their use for special purposes, for example, helium instead of highly flammable hydrogen for lighter-than-air craft and argon to conserve the filaments in light bulbs.",
              "Their inertness also contributed to the \u201coctet rule\u201d in the theory of chemical bonding (see Gilbert Newton Lewis).",
              "But in 1933 Linus Pauling suggested that compounds of the noble gases should be possible.",
              "In 1962 Neil Bartlett, working at the University of British Columbia and later at Princeton University, prepared the first noble gas compound\u2014xenon hexafluoroplatinate, XePtF6.",

              "23 November 1887 \u2013 10 August 1915) was an English physicist, whose contribution to the science of physics was the justification from physical laws of the previous empirical and chemical concept of the atomic number.",
              "This stemmed from his development of Moseley's law in X-ray spectra.",
              "Moseley's law advanced atomic physics, nuclear physics and quantum physics by providing the first experimental evidence in favour of Niels Bohr's theory, aside from the hydrogen atom spectrum which the Bohr theory was designed to reproduce.",
              "That theory refined Ernest Rutherford's and Antonius van den Broek's model, which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table.",

              "J.",
              "Moseley, known to his friends as Harry,[5] was born in Weymouth in Dorset in 1887.",
              "His father Henry Nottidge Moseley (1844\u20131891), who died when Moseley was quite young, was a biologist and also a professor of anatomy and physiology at the University of Oxford, who had been a member of the Challenger Expedition.",

              "[6] She was also the British women's champion of chess in 1913.",
              "[7][8][a] Moseley had been a very promising schoolboy at Summer Fields School (where one of the four \"leagues\" is named after him), and he was awarded a King's scholarship to attend Eton College.",
              "[9] In 1906 he won the chemistry and physics prizes at Eton.",
              "[10] In 1906, Moseley entered Trinity College of the University of Oxford, where he earned his bachelor's degree.",
              "While an undergraduate at Oxford, Moseley became a Freemason by joining the Apollo University Lodge.",
              "[11] Immediately after graduation from Oxford in 1910, Moseley became a demonstrator in physics at the University of Manchester under the supervision of Sir Ernest Rutherford.",
              "During Moseley's first year at Manchester, he had a teaching load as a graduate teaching assistant, but following that first year, he was reassigned from his teaching duties to work as a graduate research assistant.",
              "He declined a fellowship offered by Rutherford, preferring to move back to Oxford, in November 1913, where he was given laboratory facilities but no support.",
              "[12]: 95 Experimenting with the energy of beta particles in 1912, Moseley showed that high potentials were attainable from a radioactive source of radium, thereby inventing the first atomic battery, though he was unable to produce the 1MV necessary to stop the particles.",
              "[13] In 1913, Moseley observed and measured the X-ray spectra of various chemical elements (mostly metals) that were found by the method of diffraction through crystals.",
              "[14] This was a pioneering use of the method of X-ray spectroscopy in physics, using Bragg's diffraction law to determine the X-ray wavelengths.",
              "Moseley discovered a systematic mathematical relationship between the wavelengths of the X-rays produced and the atomic numbers of the metals that were used as the targets in X-ray tubes.",
              "This has become known as Moseley's law.",
              "Before Moseley's discovery, the atomic numbers (or elemental number) of an element had been thought of as a semi-arbitrary sequential number, based on the sequence of atomic masses, but modified somewhat where chemists found this modification to be desirable, such as by the Russian chemist, Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev.",
              "In his invention of the Periodic Table of the Elements, Mendeleev had interchanged the orders of a few pairs of elements to put them in more appropriate places in this table of the elements.",
              "For example, the metals cobalt and nickel had been assigned the atomic numbers 27 and 28, respectively, based on their known chemical and physical properties, even though they have nearly the same atomic masses.",
              "In fact, the atomic mass of cobalt is slightly larger than that of nickel, so nickel would be placed in the Periodic Table before cobalt if they were placed purely according to atomic mass.",
              "However Moseley's experiments in X-ray spectroscopy showed directly from their physics that cobalt and nickel have the different atomic numbers, 27 and 28, and that they are placed in the Periodic Table correctly by Moseley's objective measurements of their atomic numbers.",
              "Hence, Moseley's discovery demonstrated that the atomic numbers of elements are not just rather arbitrary numbers based on chemistry and the intuition of chemists, but rather, they have a firm experimental basis from the physics of their X-ray spectra.",
              "In addition, Moseley showed that there were gaps in the atomic number sequence at numbers 43, 61, 72, and 75.",
              "These spaces are now known, respectively, to be the places of the radioactive synthetic elements technetium and promethium, and also the last two quite rare naturally occurring stable elements hafnium (discovered 1923) and rhenium (discovered 1925).",
              "Nothing was known about these four elements in Moseley's lifetime, not even their very existence.",
              "Based on the intuition of a very experienced chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted the existence of a missing element in the Periodic Table, which was later found to be filled by technetium, and Bohuslav Brauner had predicted the existence of another missing element in this Table, which was later found to be filled by promethium.",
              "Henry Moseley's experiments confirmed these predictions, by showing exactly what the missing atomic numbers were, 43 and 61.",
              "In addition, Moseley predicted the existence of two more undiscovered elements, those with the atomic numbers 72 and 75, and gave very strong evidence that there were no other gaps in the Periodic Table between the elements aluminium (atomic number 13) and gold (atomic number 79).",
              "This latter question about the possibility of more undiscovered (\"missing\") elements had been a standing problem among the chemists of the world, particularly given the existence of the large family of the lanthanide series of rare earth elements.",
              "Moseley was able to demonstrate that these lanthanide elements, i.",
              "e. lanthanum through lutetium, must have exactly 15 members \u2013 no more and no less.",
              "The number of elements in the lanthanides had been a question that was very far from being settled by the chemists of the early 20th Century.",
              "They could not yet produce pure samples of all the rare-earth elements, even in the form of their salts, and in some cases they were unable to distinguish between mixtures of two very similar (adjacent) rare-earth elements from the nearby pure metals in the Periodic Table.",
              "For example, there was a so-called \"element\" that was even given the chemical name of \"didymium\".",
              "\"Didymium\" was found some years later to be simply a mixture of two genuine rare-earth elements, and these were given the names neodymium and praseodymium, meaning \"new twin\" and \"green twin\".",
              "Also, the method of separating the rare-earth elements by the method of ion exchange had not been invented yet in Moseley's time.",
              "Moseley's method in early X-ray spectroscopy was able to sort out the above chemical problems promptly, some of which had occupied chemists for a number of years.",
              "Moseley also predicted the existence of element 61, a lanthanide whose existence was previously unsuspected.",
              "Quite a few years later, this element 61 was created artificially in nuclear reactors and was named promethium.",
              "[15][16][17][18][19] Before Moseley and his law, atomic numbers had been thought of as a semi-arbitrary ordering number, vaguely increasing with atomic weight but not strictly defined by it.",
              "Moseley's discovery showed that atomic numbers were not arbitrarily assigned, but rather, they have a definite physical basis.",
              "Moseley postulated that each successive element has a nuclear charge exactly one unit greater than its predecessor.",
              "Moseley redefined the idea of atomic numbers from its previous status as an ad hoc numerical tag to help sorting the elements into an exact sequence of ascending atomic numbers that made the Periodic Table exact.",
              "(This was later to be the basis of the Aufbau principle in atomic studies.)",
              "As noted by Bohr, Moseley's law provided a reasonably complete experimental set of data that supported the (new from 1911) conception by Ernest Rutherford and Antonius van den Broek of the atom, with a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons in which the atomic number is understood to be the exact physical number of positive charges (later discovered and called protons) in the central atomic nuclei of the elements.",
              "Moseley mentioned the two scientists above in his research paper, but he did not actually mention Bohr, who was rather new on the scene then.",
              "Simple modifications of Rydberg's and Bohr's formulas were found to give a theoretical justification for Moseley's empirically derived law for determining atomic numbers.",
              "X-ray spectrometers are the foundation-stones of X-ray crystallography.",
              "The X-ray spectrometers as Moseley knew them worked as follows.",
              "A glass-bulb electron tube was used, similar to that held by Moseley in the photo here.",
              "Inside the evacuated tube, electrons were fired at a metallic substance (i.",
              "e. a sample of pure element in Moseley's work), causing the ionization of electrons from the inner electron shells of the element.",
              "The rebound of electrons into these holes in the inner shells next causes the emission of X-ray photons that were led out of the tube in a semi-beam, through an opening in the external X-ray shielding.",
              "These are next diffracted by a standardized salt crystal, with angular results read out as photographic lines by the exposure of an X-ray film fixed at the outside the vacuum tube at a known distance.",
              "Application of Bragg's law (after some initial guesswork of the mean distances between atoms in the metallic crystal, based on its density) next allowed the wavelength of the emitted X-rays to be calculated.",
              "Moseley participated in the design and development of early X-ray spectrometry equipment,[20][21] learning some techniques from William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg at the University of Leeds, and developing others himself.",
              "Many of the techniques of X-ray spectroscopy were inspired by the methods that are used with visible light spectroscopes and spectrograms, by substituting crystals, ionization chambers, and photographic plates for their analogs in light spectroscopy.",
              "In some cases, Moseley found it necessary to modify his equipment to detect particularly soft (lower frequency) X-rays that could not penetrate either air or paper, by working with his instruments in a vacuum chamber.",
              "Sometime in the first half of 1914, Moseley resigned from his position at Manchester, with plans to return to Oxford and continue his physics research there.",
              "However, World War I broke out in August 1914, and Moseley turned down this job offer to instead enlist with the Royal Engineers of the British Army.",
              "His family and friends tried to persuade him not to join, but he thought it was his duty.",
              "[22] Moseley served as a technical officer in communications during the Battle of Gallipoli, in Turkey, beginning in April 1915, where he was killed by a sniper on 10 August 1915.",
              "Only twenty-seven years old at the time of his death, Moseley could, in the opinion of some scientists, have contributed much to the knowledge of atomic structure had he survived.",

              "He is one of the immortals of science, and though he would have made many other additions to our knowledge if his life had been spared, the contributions already credited to him were of such fundamental significance, that the probability of his surpassing himself was extremely small.",

              "Moseley\u2018s contribution to the science of physics was the justification from physical laws of the previous empirical and chemical concept of the atomic number.",
              "This stemmed from his development of Moseley\u2019s law in X-ray spectra.",
              "\u201cWe have now got what seems to be definite proof that an X ray which spreads out in a spherical form from a source as a wave through the aether can when it meets an atom collect up all its energy from all round and concentrate it on the atom.",
              "It is as if when a circular wave on water met an obstacle, the wave were all suddenly to travel round the circle and disappear all round and concentrate its energy on attacking the obstacle.",
              "Mechanically of course this is absurd, but mechanics have in this direction been for some time a broken reed.",
              "\u201d \u2014 Henry Moseley, Letter to Margery Moseley (2 Feb 1913).",
              "For sure you do remember that poster from your classroom with all the chemical elements ordered in the so-called periodic table.",
              "But, certainly only a few of you will have heard about Henry Moseley and his concept of the atomic numbers.",
              "In chemistry and physics, the existence of a periodic table creates an ordering for the elements, and was first proposed by Russian chemist and inventor Dimitri Mendeleev.",
              "[6] The atomic number (also known as the proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus.",
              "The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element.",
              "This discovery is thanked to the British physicist Henry Moseley, who justified this empirical and chemical concept of the atomic number also from physical laws.",
              "Henry Moseley discovered that the wavelength (energy) of an X-ray depended upon the nuclear charge of an atom.",
              "Henry Moseley was born in Weymouth in Dorset in 1887.",
              "His father Henry Nottidge Moseley (1844\u201391), who died when Henry Moseley was quite young, was a biologist and also a professor of anatomy and physiology at the University of Oxford, who had been a member of the Challenger ExpeditionIn 1906 Henry Moseley entered Trinity College at Oxford University.",
              "After graduating, he worked at the University of Manchester with Ernest Rutherford.",
              "In his first years there he was mainly occupied with teaching, after a few years he was released from his teaching duties and began to devote himself entirely to research.",
              "In 1913, almost fifty years after Mendeleev has proposed his periodic table of chemical elements, Henry Moseley at the University of Manchester observed and measured the X-ray spectra of 10 elements that occupied consecutive places in the periodic table.",
              "These spectra were found by the method of diffraction of X-rays through crystals.",
              "Moseley discovered a systematic mathematical relationship between the wavelengths of the X-rays produced in the diffraction process by the targeted elements and their atomic numbers.",
              "He concluded that there was \u201ca fundamental quantity which increases by regular steps as we pass from one element to the next.",
              "\u201c This relationship has become known as Moseley\u2019s law.",
              "In 1920, Ernest Rutherford at Cambridge identified this quantity as the atomic number.",
              "[5] The diagram published by Moseley in 1914, which shows linear relationships between an atom\u2019s atomic number and the square root of the frequency of its characteristic x-rays.",
              "Atomic Weight and Isotopes Moseley\u2019s formula, on account of Nobel laureate Niels Bohr,[7] not only established atomic number as a measurable experimental quantity, but gave it a physical meaning as the positive charge on the atomic nucleus, i.",
              "e. the number of protons of the nucleus.",
              "With the discovery of isotopes of the elements, it became apparent that atomic weight was not the significant player in the periodic law as Mendeleev and others had proposed, but rather, the properties of the elements varied periodically with atomic number.",
              "When atoms were arranged according to increasing atomic number, the few problems with Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table had disappeared.",
              "Because of Moseley\u2019s x-ray work, elements could be ordered in the periodic system in order of atomic number rather than atomic weight.",

              "Some people suggested that atomic weights should increase in proportion by approximately two units for each successive element.",

              "[3] By 1920, isotopes of chemical elements had been discovered, the atomic masses had been determined to be (approximately) integer multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom,[4] and the atomic number had been identified as the charge on the nucleus.",

              "[1]: 298 The essential nature of the atomic nucleus was established with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932[6] and the determination that it was a new elementary particle, distinct from the proton.",
              "[7][8]: 55 The uncharged neutron was immediately exploited as a new means to probe nuclear structure, leading to such discoveries as the creation of new radioactive elements by neutron irradiation (1934) and the fission of uranium atoms by neutrons (1938).",
              "[9] The discovery of fission led to the creation of both nuclear power and nuclear weapons by the end of World War II.",
              "Both the proton and the neutron were presumed to be elementary particles until the 1960s, when they were determined to be composite particles built from quarks.",
              "[10] At the start of the 20th century, the vigorous debate as to the existence of atoms had not yet been resolved.",
              "Philosophers such as Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald denied that atoms were real, viewing them as a convenient mathematical construct, while scientists such as Arnold Sommerfeld and Ludwig Boltzmann saw that physical theories required the existence of atoms.[9]: 13\u201314 Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by the French scientist Henri Becquerel, while working with phosphorescent materials.",
              "In 1898, Ernest Rutherford at Cavendish Laboratory distinguished two types of radioactivity, alpha rays and beta rays, which differed in their ability to penetrate, or travel into, ordinary objects or gases.",

              "[1]: 61\u201362, 87 These radiations had also been identified as emanating from atoms, hence they provided clues to processes occurring within atoms. Conversely, the radiations were also recognized as tools that could be exploited in scattering experiments to probe the interior of atoms.[11]: 112\u2013115 At the University of Manchester between 1908 and 1913, Rutherford directed Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden in a series of experiments to determine what happens when alpha particles scatter from metal foil.",
              "Now called the Rutherford gold foil experiment, or the Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment, these measurements made the extraordinary discovery that although most alpha particles passing through a thin gold foil experienced little deflection, a few scattered to a high angle.",
              "The scattering indicated that some of the alpha particles ricocheted back from a small, but dense, component inside the atoms. Based on these measurements, by 1911 it was apparent to Rutherford that the atom consisted of a small, massive nucleus with positive charge surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged electrons.",
              "The concentrated atomic mass was required to provide the observed deflection of the alpha particles, and Rutherford developed a mathematical model that accounted for the scattering.",
              "[2] The Rutherford model was very influential, motivating the Bohr model for electrons orbiting the nucleus in 1913[12] and eventually leading to quantum mechanics by the mid-1920s.",

              "Also, those radioelements that reside in the same places in the periodic system are chemically identical.",

              "Aston discovered that the masses of all the particles are whole numbers (the whole number rule): that is, the masses of all the isotopes are whole number multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom.",

              "Aston and others quickly realized that the discrepancy is due to the binding energy of atoms, that is, when the contents of a number of hydrogen atoms are bound into a single atom, the latter's mass must be less than the sum of the masses of the separate hydrogen atoms.[4] Aston's work on isotopes won him the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of isotopes in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the whole number rule.",
              "[18] Noting Aston's recent discovery of nuclear binding energy, in 1920 Arthur Eddington suggested that stars may obtain their energy by fusing hydrogen (protons) into helium and that the heavier elements may form in stars.",

              "[a][21]: 180 At the University of Manchester in 1913 Henry Moseley discussed the new Bohr model of the atom with the visiting Bohr.",
              "[20] The model accounted for the electromagnetic emission spectrum from the hydrogen atom, and Moseley and Bohr wondered if the electromagnetic emission spectra of heavier elements such as cobalt and nickel would follow their ordering by weight, or by their position in the periodic table.",

              "He found that the most intense short-wavelength line in the X-ray spectrum of a particular element, known as the K-alpha line, was related to the element's position in the periodic table, that is, its atomic number, Z.",

              "[24]: 87 Moseley's result, by Bohr's later account, not only established atomic number as a measurable experimental quantity, but gave it a physical meaning as the positive charge on the atomic nucleus.",
              "The elements could be ordered in the periodic system in order of atomic number, rather than atomic weight.",
              "[25]: 127 The result tied together the organization of the periodic table, the Bohr model for the atom,[26]: 56 and Rutherford's model for alpha scattering from nuclei.",
