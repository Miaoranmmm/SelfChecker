    "query": "How has the development of artificial intelligence impacted the job market and what measures can governments and businesses take to mitigate negative effects on workers?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. According to some studies, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly disrupt labor markets by augmenting the productivity of some workers, replacing the work done by others, and transforming almost all occupations at least to some degree[^1^]. AI has made the most progress in abilities that are required to perform non-routine, cognitive tasks, such as information ordering, memorization, perceptual speed, and deductive reasoning[^2^]. This means that the occupations that have been most exposed to advances in, and automation by, AI have tended to be high-skilled, white-collar ones, such as business professionals, managers, science and engineering professionals, and legal, social and cultural professionals[^2^]. This contrasts with the impact of previous automating technologies, such as robots, that have primarily affected low- and middle-skilled workers whose tasks tended to be routine[^2^].\n\nHowever, higher exposure to AI may not necessarily imply negative effects on workers. New OECD research finds that, over the period 2012-19, greater exposure to AI was associated with higher employment in occupations where computer use is high[^2^]. This suggests that workers who have strong digital skills may have a greater ability to adapt to and use AI at work and, hence, to reap the benefits that these technologies bring[^2^]. By contrast, there is some indication that higher exposure to AI is associated with lower growth in average hours worked in occupations where computer use is low[^2^]. On the whole, these findings suggest that the adoption of AI may increase labor market disparities between workers who have the skills to use AI effectively and those who do not[^2^].\n\nTherefore, one of the key policy challenges is to make sure that workers have the right skills to work with new technologies. Some possible measures that governments and businesses can take to mitigate negative effects on workers are[^1^]:\n\n- Investing in education and training systems that foster lifelong learning and help workers acquire and update skills that are complementary to AI.\n- Providing income support and social protection for workers who are displaced or face reduced hours or wages due to AI.\n- Promoting labor mobility and job creation in sectors and regions that can benefit from AI.\n- Encouraging social dialogue and stakeholder involvement in designing and implementing policies related to AI and work.\n- Developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.\n\nI hope this answer was helpful.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "In fact, since ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, various potential applications of large language models to the work environment have emerged \u2013 from co-authoring scientific papers (Stokel-Walker, 2023[2]) to passing graduate-level exams in law and business (Murphy Kelly, 2023[3]), assisting in clinical decision-making (Science Media Centre, 2023[4]) and helping to make court decisions (Jamal, 2023[5]).",

              "AI can already answer 80% of the literacy questions of the OECD Survey of Adult Skills of the Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), and two-thirds of the numeracy questions (OECD, 2023[6]).",
              "Even more astonishing is the short time span in which this progress has been made.",
              "Just six years ago, the biggest AI news story was that it had defeated the world champion at Go, a relatively simple game that follows a clear set of rules (BBC, 2017[7]).",

              "In 2022, through new surveys and case studies, the OECD gathered data on the impact of AI on workers and the workplace in the manufacturing and finance sectors of eight OECD countries.",
              "3 The research, which pre-dates some of the latest developments in generative AI, collected many interesting examples of AI use in the workplace, including: an image recognition technology that identifies spare auto parts from photos uploaded by customers;",
              "a production tracking and monitoring system that uses a computer vision system to locate tools and bring them to the correct place in the factory at the right time;",
              "and a natural language processing tool that assists maintenance workers in troubleshooting the root causes of machine breakdowns by querying a database of past service issues and their resolutions.",
              "While the adoption of AI still remains relatively low, rapid progress, falling costs and the increasing availability of workers with AI skills indicate that OECD economies might be on the brink of an AI revolution.",
              "The available data suggest that the share of firms that have adopted AI remains in the single digits, although large firms are more likely to have done so (approximately one in three) (Lane, Williams and Broecke, 2023[16]).",
              "Cost was the greatest barrier to AI adoption: it was cited by more than half of the finance and manufacturing firms the OECD surveyed in 2022 about AI use in the workplace (Lane, Williams and Broecke, 2023[16]).",
              "4 The second biggest barrier identified was a lack of skills to adopt AI (see also Chapter 5).",

              "6% (Zhang et al.",

              "Generative AI applications such as ChatGPT are becoming increasingly available at a low monthly fee or even for free.",
              "At the same time, the availability of workers with suitable skills is growing.",
              "OECD research suggests that the AI workforce has more than tripled between 2012 and 2019 (Green and Lamby, 2023[19]).",

              "e. a technology that can affect an entire economy \u2013 the indication is that AI may soon permeate workplaces, affecting all sectors and occupations.",
              "A key motivation for employers to adopt AI is to boost productivity, and workers may gain as well.",
              "As an automating technology, AI carries the promise of cost savings and productivity gains, helping employers gain a competitive advantage.",
              "Indeed, one works council member at a manufacturer of automotive parts told the OECD of the importance of AI adoption in his industry as follows: \u201cIf a company does not adopt new technologies, then sooner or later it will no longer be able to continue to exist\u201d (Milanez, 2023[20]).",
              "AI can also help companies improve product or service quality.",
              "At the same time, workers may benefit through improvements in job quality, worker well-being and job satisfaction.",
              "Indeed, AI has the potential to eliminate dangerous or tedious tasks and create more complex and interesting ones instead.",
              "It can boost worker engagement, give workers greater autonomy, and even improve their mental health.",
              "Some workers may also benefit from higher wages (Chapter 4).",
              "While there are potential benefits, there are also significant risks, including for employment.",
              "Firms do not hide the fact that one of their main motivations to invest in AI is to improve worker performance (i.",
              "e. productivity) and reduce staff costs (Lane, Williams and Broecke, 2023[16]).",
              "It is not surprising, therefore, that about 20% of workers in finance and manufacturing (across seven OECD countries) said that they were very or extremely worried about job loss in the next ten years (Lane, Williams and Broecke, 2023[16]).",
              "A key distinction between AI and previous technologies is that AI is capable of automating non-routine tasks.",
              "As such, AI has made most progress in areas like information ordering, memorisation, perceptual speed, and deductive reasoning \u2013 all of which are related to non-routine, cognitive tasks (see Chapter 3).",
              "As a result, high-skilled occupations have been most exposed to recent advances in AI, including: business professionals;",

              "and legal, social and cultural professionals.",

              "5 While to date there is little evidence of negative employment effects due to AI (Chapter 3), this may be because AI adoption is still relatively low and/or because firms prefer to rely on voluntary quits and retirement to make workforce adjustments.",
              "Any negative employment effects of AI may therefore take time to materialise.",
              "Moreover, the risks of automation are not equally spread across socio-demographic groups, which could harm inclusiveness.",
              "While the impact of the latest wave of generative AI is not entirely clear yet, early estimates of occupational AI exposure that take into account the capabilities of large language models like ChatGPT reach conclusions similar to those of previous estimates of AI exposure: it is primarily high-pay occupations requiring higher than average education or training that are most exposed to AI.",
              "There are also risks to job quality and AI raises a number of ethical questions.",
              "Although AI has the potential to improve certain aspects of job quality, there are also reports that AI can heighten work intensity and increase stress (Chapter 4).",
              "In addition, the use of AI in the workplace opens up, or amplifies, a whole set of ethical issues (Chapter 6), some of which can also negatively impact on job quality.",
              "For example, AI can change the way work is monitored or managed, which can increase perceived fairness, but poses risks to workers\u2019 privacy and autonomy to execute tasks.",
              "AI can also introduce or perpetuate bias.",
              "In addition, there are concerns around transparency and explainability, as well as around accountability.",
              "While many of these issues are not new, AI has the potential to amplify them.",
              "For example, even though human beings can be biased when making hiring decisions, the adverse impact of AI could be far greater by virtue of the volume and velocity of the decisions it takes, which could systematise and multiply bias.",
              "Once again, these risks tend to be greater for some socio-demographic groups who are often disadvantaged in the labour market already.",
              "While there is much uncertainty about the impact AI will have on labour markets, there is a need to avoid technological determinism.",
              "A key message of the OECD Employment Outlook 2019 was that \u201cThe future of work will largely depend on the policy decisions countries make.",
              "\u201d This message is also one brought by prominent labour economists like David Autor who argue that \u201cAs we ponder our uncertain AI future, our goal should not merely be to predict that future, but to create it.",
              "\u201d (Autor, 2022[21]).",
              "There is urgent need for policy action to ensure that AI is developed and used in a trustworthy way.",
              "This means that AI must be safe and respectful of fundamental rights such as privacy and fairness, the right of labour to organise, transparency and explainability.",
              "It also means that it must be clear who is accountable in case something goes wrong.",
              "Proactive and decisive action is not only important to protect workers, but also to promote AI innovation and diffusion because it reduces uncertainty.",
              "Principles like those developed by the OECD can help promote the use of AI that is innovative and trustworthy and that respects human rights and democratic values (OECD, 2019[22]).",
              "As an OECD legal instrument, the OECD AI principles represent a common aspiration for its adhering countries and were adopted in May 2019.",
              "Since then, other countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Malta, Peru, Romania, Singapore and Ukraine have adhered to the principles and, in June 2019, the G20 adopted human-centred AI Principles that draw from the OECD AI Principles.",

              "Making sure that such legislation is up to date and reflects the new realities and challenges brought by AI will be important.",

              "As for other major transformations in the past, this structural change and the related transition and adjustment process will arguably not be smooth and swift: it will unfold over a period of several years, and it will lead to important negative impacts in the short-run before the long-run economic and societal benefits will eventually emerge.",
              "Studying the effects of automation on employment, extant research has so far mostly focused on aggregate impacts that industrial robots and AI have on employment demand and wages for different industries and countries.",
              "The present paper has argued that it is important to shift the focus to the micro-level of analysis and study the impacts of automation technologies on individual workers\u2019 well-being.",

              "Ceteris paribus, workers that fear that their working tasks might be replaced by a smart machine in the future may have a lower job satisfaction at present than workers who have more secure job prospects and less uncertainty about the future.",
              "We have investigated this idea by considering a large sample of workers in Norway for the period 2016\u20132019, and studying the extent to which the introduction of industrial robots in local labor markets affect workers\u2019 fear of being replaced in the future, and in this way hamper their subjective well-being.",
              "Our data and results provide a quite striking picture.",
              "40% of Norwegian workers in our sample think their working tasks might be replaced by a machine, and our analysis shows that this fear of replacement significantly lowers their job satisfaction at present.",
              "We also find that this transmission mechanism is driven by low-skilled workers, which are those carrying out routine-based tasks, and who are therefore aware to be more exposed to the risks of automation.",
              "On the whole, we think that our empirical findings are not only relevant for Norway (the country to which our dataset refers), but they can in principle have more general lessons for other countries too.",
              "Automation is by now an important trend that is rapidly diffusing worldwide, and its effect on workers\u2019 health and well-being is therefore a topic of high societal relevance.",
              "Schwabe (2019) provides related evidence using a different dataset for a larger sample of European countries.",
              "The present work calls therefore for further research that may investigate and extend this research topic in a variety of different countries and continents.",
              "A first important policy implication of our results is that the current process of structural change and creative destruction will in the short-run likely lead to stronger fear of replacement and uncertainty about the future for low-skilled workers carrying out routine work in factories, thus possibly leading to further polarization not only in terms of employment and wages, but also in terms of subjective well-being.",
              "To mitigate these negative consequences, which are already visible at present, national authorities should actively support training and re-training policies in such a way that workers that are exposed to future replacement may build up new competencies that can increase their ability to work with smart machines, as well as increase their qualifications and the likelihood to find a new job if this will become necessary in the future.",
              "If fear of replacement triggers workers to participate in such training is an interesting question for future studies.",
              "In other words, by giving better future prospects to more vulnerable workers, training policies will also contribute to enhance their subjective well-being at present.",
              "Our results also suggest a second reflection and possible policy implication.",
              "As noted above, 40% of Norwegian workers in our sample think that their working tasks might be replaced by a machine.",
              "According to the Eurobarometer survey, the extent of fear of replacement is roughly the same for workers in other European countries [12].",
              "This number is quite high indeed.",
              "Is it reasonable that so many workers fear competition from smart machines, and why is it so?",
              "Extant research on automation and employment has not yet reached a consensus on the direction and size of these effects, and it still presents a vivid debate between those that emphasize negative consequences and those that point out positive economic and societal effects.",
              "Hence, there is no clear scientific evidence and consensus at present that could provide the basis for individual workers to form rational and well-informed assessments and expectations about their job prospects in the future.",
              "It is therefore reasonable to ask whether the generalized fear of competition from smart machines is actually exaggerated and not based on extant research and established knowledge.",
              "The concrete risk is that\u2013in the current phase of rapid and disruptive technological change\u2013societal debates in the media on robots, automation and AI may tend to exaggerate risks and depict gloomy future scenarios, while often neglecting possible long-run benefits for the economy and the society, which are indeed even hard to imagine at the moment [1].",
              "Since media debates on this topic are often biased and tend to overemphasize the negative impacts of automation (which are arguably more \u201ccatchy\u201d and attractive for the uninformed audience), this may contribute to explain why so many workers report to fear future machine replacement.",
              "However, our paper has shown that such subjective individual assessments about the future may indeed hamper job satisfaction at present.",
              "This can also lead to anxiety, mental stress and low motivation at work, which may in turn depress creativity, productivity and innovation in the workplace.",
              "In short, we should not disregard the possibility that a biased and uninformed presentation of this topic in the media may indeed have concrete negative consequences on workers\u2019 subjective well-being by affecting their beliefs about future job prospects.",
              "The policy implications of this are certainly not easy to draw.",
              "A major point, though, is to stress the importance of having better informed societal debates in the media, and particularly in State-owned channels, that take a more balanced view of the negative and positive consequences of automation, and that avoid spreading fears and gloomy scenarios that are not based on solid evidence and arguments.",

              "To harness this productivity effect, workers need to both learn to work effectively with the new technology and to adapt to a changing task composition that puts more emphasis on tasks that AI cannot yet perform.",
              "Such adaptation is costly and the cost will depend on worker characteristics.",
              "The areas where AI is currently making the most progress are associated with non-routine, cognitive tasks often performed by medium- to high-skilled, white collar workers.",
              "However, these workers also rely more than other workers on abilities AI does not currently possess, such as inductive reasoning or social intelligence.",
              "Moreover, highly educated workers often find it easier to adapt to new technologies because they are more likely to already work with digital technologies and participate more in training, which puts them in a better position than lower-skilled workers to reap the potential benefits of AI.",
              "That being said, more educated workers also tend to have more task-specific human capital4, which might make adaption more costly for them (Fossen and Sorgner, 2019).",

              "Spiking demand and labor scarcity forced many employers to consider nontraditional candidates with potential and train them if they lacked direct experience.",
              "While this may not hold in the future, employers and workers alike can draw on what they have learned about the potential for people to make quick pivots and add new skills.",

              "Together, theya\u0302\u0080\u0099ve changed the nature of work and jobs and inspired us to ask, a\u0302\u0080\u009cWhata\u0302\u0080\u0099s different now?",
              "a\u0302\u0080\u009d and, a\u0302\u0080\u009cWhat can we expect in the future?",
              "a\u0302\u0080\u009d Saurabh Sanghvi: I would add that the labor market looks different from what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve typically seen.",

              "Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s this confluence of factors that we really wanted to cover with this new piece around the future of work and generative AI.",
              "Roberta Fusaro: Are pandemic-era labor shortages here to stay?",
              "Kweilin Ellingrud: Right now we have two job openings for every person whoa\u0302\u0080\u0099s unemployed.",
              "So wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re quite out of balance compared with previous years.",
              "We do think that a tight labor market will persist.",
              "I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t think it will be quite as tight as it was maybe a year ago, as we were emerging from the pandemic.",
              "Some of the long-term trends we saw accelerate during the pandemic will persist, including people looking for greater flexibility in work, greater control over their career evolution, and greater meaning and connectivity in their jobs and workplaces.",
              "Roberta Fusaro: Which occupations or which occupational categories have been most affected during the pandemic era?",
              "Which are growing, and which are declining?",
              "Kweilin Ellingrud: There are a number of growing occupations.",
              "Those would be a lot of healthcare jobs, STEM jobs, transportation jobs, delivery.",
              "And then there are a lot of shrinking occupations.",
              "I think 80 percent of the occupational transitions between now and 2030 are in four occupational categories: customer service, food service, production or manufacturing, and office support.",
              "Those four occupations are going to need a lot of reskilling, upskilling, and support to encourage those workers to gain the skills so that they can re-pot in other occupations that are growing in our economy.",
              "Saurabh Sanghvi: To add, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re starting to see a steady rise in rebound, like builders, educators, and the creative economy.",
              "Some of that has been from federal infrastructure.",
              "When we start talking about builders and construction, a lot of that has been from major infrastructure builds that have been motivating and incentivizing infrastructure.",
              "But the other one that Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d want to underscore is the educator one, where the pandemic really put a structural hit on how we thought about education.",
              "But now wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going back to the long-term historical trend of the fact that we need a lot more educators at all levels.",
              "Roberta Fusaro: But then when you add automation and the specter of gen AI to the mix, what effect do we project that'll have on the labor market?",
              "Kweilin Ellingrud: The impact of gen AI alone could automate almost 10 percent of tasks in the US economy.",
              "That affects all spectrums of jobs.",
              "It is much more concentrated on lower-wage jobs, which are those earning less than $38,000.",
              "In fact, if youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re in one of those jobs, you are 14 times more likely to lose your job or need to transition to another occupation than those with wages in the higher range, above $58,000, for example.",
              "The impact of gen AI alone could automate almost 10 percent of tasks in the US economy.",
              "But it also does affect the jobs on the higher end of the wage range.",
              "Writers, creatives, lawyers, consultants, everybody is going to need to work differently, because parts of our jobs will be affected by gen AI.",
              "For some, it will be a more fundamental elimination of the job.",
              "For others, it will more remake how we spend our time.",
              "Roberta Fusaro: It is quite a significant number, and sort of frightening.",
              "But also, I know there are a lot of great opportunities associated with gen AI.",
              "When we were talking about the impact on lower-wage workers, in particular, what are the mechanisms by which we can ensure that there is a way to move up the ladder?",
              "Kweilin Ellingrud: Twelve million occupational transitionsA\u0302 are likely going to need to happen between now and 2030, with 80 percent of those in those four occupations that I mentioned: customer service, food service, production, and office support.",
              "How do we make sure that workers in those jobs can reskill and upskill?",
              "A lot of that depends on individual companies to do that at scale, not in the hundreds but in the thousands of workers.",
              "I think publica\u0302\u0080\u0093private partnerships between the federal government and educational institutions could help to train and build the skills of our workforce.",
              "How do we make sure that workers in those jobs can reskill and upskill?",
              "A lot of that depends on individual companies to do that at scale, not in the hundreds but in the thousands of workers.",
              "Then, as employers shift to more skills-based hiring, looking for the skills that they need as opposed to credentials, that will help as well.",
              "The silver lining of all of this is that we will have more jobs in the future than we do today, given demographic trends, given consumption trends, and GDP growth.",
              "On average, those jobs will be higher-paying jobs, but require higher levels of education.",
              "Roberta Fusaro: I like the positive outlook.",
              "I think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s what we all need.",
              "I am curious, though, how do we ensure that the future of work doesna\u0302\u0080\u0099t exclude traditionally disadvantaged groups?",
              "Kweilin Ellingrud: Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a great question because it is a danger, and if left unmanaged, it will affect lower-wage workers more.",
              "It will affect people of color more.",
              "It will affect women more.",
              "For instance, women are about 50 percent more likely to be in one of those occupations that needs to transition, compared with men.",
              "How we make sure that we support this need is to target reskilling and upskilling.",
              "There are certain programs that can help identify if you are in a customer service and sales role.",
              "They can help to identify the career paths that could build on those skills to help you move up the ladder and maybe reskill and upskill in a targeted way to find that next job.",
              "Federal programs could help as well.",
              "For example, on the infrastructure investments, we saw that contracts would be awarded to companies that provide childcare, for instance.",
              "And that will also help to be more inclusive to working mothers, as construction has at least historically been quite male and quite White.",
              "But with all the infrastructure investment, a lot of the jobs created there can now be more equal in terms of where the job growth goes.",
              "Saurabh Sanghvi: We really need intentional focus.",
              "As we think about the solution space, if you look in the higher-ed sector, for example, the ability to work with historically Black colleges and universities is a great way to really help Black learners, for instance, get into these high-wage, high-growth pathways and some of the occupations that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re highlighting.",
              "Similarly, when we think about some of the workforce development programs, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a lot of investment thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going into new regions that havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t really had vibrant innovation hubs.",
              "Investments like that can really help create some of these opportunities in the geographies that typically havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t had all of the job growth previously.",
              "Roberta Fusaro: How should employers think about the data in this report in terms of changing the way theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re thinking about talent development and so forth?",
              "Saurabh Sanghvi: Therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a huge role that employers can play in this.",
              "First, really thinking about how to hire for skills instead of looking at someonea\u0302\u0080\u0099s degree or the prerequisite of the job they previously had.",
              "The second thing is that therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a real opportunity to think about pipelines and pathways.",
              "Everybody is learning about these new technologies.",
              "Everybody needs to upskill.",
              "Companies can really think about opportunities to hire from within instead of externally for an open role.",
              "They can find pathways within the company that help someone move out of a role that is in less demand and into a role that has more of a demand.",
              "That would be probably far more cost-efficient, because you already have the human capital.",
              "Finally, even if we think a little beyond generative AI, what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing is that workers are demanding a new style and way of working.",
              "So, the other thing thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to be really important is, can employers really design new ways of working and working models that can be more flexible, that can really take advantage of in-person moments as well as remote moments?",
              "And can that be done in a way that actually becomes more inclusive and attractive to women workers and adult workers who are also maybe taking a college course?",
              "Roberta Fusaro: The report notes the role of the federal government in investing in infrastructure renewal and initiatives to achieve net-zero climate goals.",
              "What impact could this have on the labor market?",
              "Saurabh Sanghvi: We think net zero is going to be a tremendous opportunity for job growth.",
              "But similar to some of the things that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve talked about regarding automation and AI, it will require quite a bit of transition.",
              "Ultimately, what we will see is some labor demand declines in jobs that relate to the oil and gas industry and labor demand increases in things that we would call greener jobs around renewable energy, like solar and wind, and the entire infrastructure around that.",
              "Ultimately, what we will see is some labor demand declines in jobs that relate to the oil and gas industry and labor demand increases in things that we would call greener jobs around renewable energy, like solar and wind, and the entire infrastructure around that.",
              "The key thing thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to need to happen is, how do we help workers transition from categories that are potentially declining to those greener jobs?",
              "And how do we think about upskilling in those greener jobs?",
              "The infrastructure story is a little simpler to understand.",
              "A lot of the investments the federal government has been making in many ways are record-level.",
              "Theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re going toward construction, building, repairing roads, bridges, and other things like that.",
              "So the big area that this is going to directly impact is the construction sector.",
              "One of the big opportunities there is that ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a sector that has typically been quite male-dominated.",
              "So there are significant opportunities to think about, how can we expand those opportunities to women?",
              "Similarly, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s also a sector that isna\u0302\u0080\u0099t very diverse if we look at it from a race and ethnicity standpoint.",
              "How can we expand opportunities there for people of color as well?",
              "Kweilin Ellingrud: On the net-zero side, we see a net increase of about 700,000 jobs.",
              "But ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s actually displacing about 3.",
              "5 million jobs that either directly or indirectly would be eliminated.",
              "Then there are gains in renewable energy and other areas of over four million jobs.",
              "But thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s a lot of both displacement and then net new job creation.",
              "So there is a lot of disruption in the workplace in the overall job economy for that net creation of 700,000 jobs.",
              "But, hopefully, that will be a huge growth driver in the future.",
              "Roberta Fusaro: Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m already thinking that, as a female podcast host and editor, I should start thinking about a shift into the construction sector or some of these other opportunities that youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re citing, because ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s really compelling data.",
              "Saurabh Sanghvi: There could be many new green jobs, so therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a huge opportunity in the country to really start marketing the fact that therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s an entire sector of jobs that students and adult workers could be getting into, that could really go about saving the planet.",
              "If you start thinking about the next generation of student that wants to be more mission-driven and cares about the purpose of their job, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a tremendous opportunity to connect those two things.",
              "Kweilin Ellingrud: As we look over time, about 9 or 10 percent of the jobs every decade are net new occupations that didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t exist before.",
              "That could be in advanced analytics, renewable energy, as we were just describing, or a social media influencer.",
              "How do we think about these new jobs and the skills that they will need?",
              "Those new jobs, at least historically, have typically been more male-dominated than female-dominated, but how do we build the skills that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll need in the future both for the jobs we know we will need but also for the net new occupations that we havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t even imagined yet?",
              "Roberta Fusaro: Are there any other forces cited in the report that we havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t raised that could affect the labor market in the next two to five years?",
              "Saurabh Sanghvi: Some of the other factors that could impact the labor market are, one, we have an aging workforce.",
              "That will have an impact on everything as it relates to retirement and the fact that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve seen quit rates at an all-time high over the past two years.",
              "Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll see an impact on demand for healthcare in the US as well.",
              "Another finding that was probably my favorite of this report is that, over the past three years, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve seen 50 percent more occupational transitions than the previous three years.",
              "This is really positive news in my mind, because wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing the occupation transitions result in workers disproportionately being in higher-wage roles.",
              "If we could continue that trend over the next decade and through 2030, then we could be in a world where some of the disruptions that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re talking about end up being really positive and help workers get into higher-wage roles and opportunities for more fulfilling careers.",
              "And for the first time ever, we have real, hard evidence that ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s happening and at a scale thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s faster than what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve previously seen.",

              "Kweilin Ellingrud: The finding that shocked me most was that people in lower-wage jobs, below $38,000 a year, were 14 times more likely to need to transition occupations than those in the highest-wage jobs.",

              "I knew it would have a bit of a disproportionate effect.",

              "That 21 percent is having an impact on our findings more than some of the recent increase from generative AI.",
              "When we think about other technologies like robotics and kiosks coming into the fast-food sector, a lot of those technologies are having more of an impact on a lot of these sectors.",

              "Kweilin Ellingrud: Looking at the upside, looking at the increasing number of jobs, higher wages over time, yes, there are a lot of occupational switches that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll need to transition through, a lot of upskilling and reskilling at scale.",
              "But the GDP growth, the upside is that more jobs at higher wages gives me a lot of comfort that therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a better future as we get through that tumultuous and challenging transition period.",
              "Saurabh Sanghvi: All too often, as we talk about AI and generative AI, we jump to the conclusion of job loss.",

              "COVID-19 accelerated this effect in 2020 and will likely boost digitization, and perhaps establish it permanently, in some areas.",
              "However, the real picture is more nuanced: though these technologies will eliminate some jobs, they will create many others.",
              "Governments, companies, and individuals all need to understand these shifts when they plan for the future.",
              "BCG recently collaborated with Faethm, a firm specializing in AI and analytics, to study the potential impact of various technologies on jobs in three countries: the US, Germany, and Australia.",
              "Using the underlying demographics in each country, we developed detailed scenarios that model the effects of new technologies and consider the impact of the pandemic on GDP growth.",
              "(See Appendix A.)",
              "One key finding is that the net number of jobs lost or gained is an artificially simple metric to gauge the impact of digitization.",
              "For example, eliminating 10 million jobs and creating 10 million new jobs would appear to have negligible impact.",
              "In fact, however, doing so would represent a huge economic disruption for the country\u2014not to mention for the millions of people with their jobs at stake.",
              "Therefore, policymakers and countries that want to understand the implications of automation need to drill down and look at disaggregated effects.",
              "Understanding the future of jobs is a tall order, but the groundbreaking analysis we conducted helps governments, companies, and individuals take the critical first step to prepare for what is to come.",
              "Three Components of Workforce Imbalances In general, computers perform well in tasks that humans find difficult or time-consuming to do, but they tend to work less effectively in tasks that humans find easy to do.",
              "Although new technologies will eliminate some occupations, in many areas they will improve the quality of work that humans do by allowing them to focus on more strategic, value-creating, and personally rewarding tasks.",
              "To understand the potential impact of new technologies on future workforces, we looked at three components of imbalances in the US, Germany, and Australia: Looking at all of these factors gave us an aggregate impact of automation and economic growth on national workforces by 2030.",
              "Two economic forecasts, and three possible technology adoption rates, led to a total of six possible scenarios: Throughout this report, unless mentioned otherwise, we will refer to the midrange scenario, which comprises a baseline GDP forecast in response to the pandemic and a medium rate of technology adoption.",
              "We find that the US will likely experience a labor shortfall in its workforce of 0.",

              "(See Exhibit 2.)",
              "These consolidated gaps are the difference between the total supply and the total demand in the future workforce for each country.",
              "This net number, however, is only an initial indication, and policymakers and business leaders need to look at the disaggregated perspective to see the full picture.",
              "Our research also reveals that automation will reduce the number of both unskilled jobs and white-collar positions.",
              "The two additional sets of technology adoption circumstances that we considered would influence the labor curve accordingly.",
              "Faster adoption rates would lead to greater demand for people in specific occupations as well as greater surpluses in others that are more prone to automation.",
              "Slower adoption rates would lead to a less severe impact on the labor force.",
              "In total, the effect would be lower workforce demand.",

              "6 million.",
              "Technology and automation will also drive people out of work in the US, particularly in office and administrative support, where the surplus of workers will rise from 1.",

              "This is a very good example of the shift from jobs with repetitive tasks in production lines to those in the programming and maintenance of production technology\u2014and thus the need for significant reskilling (teaching employees entirely new skills needed for a different job or sector) and upskilling (giving employees upgraded skills to stay relevant in a current occupation).",

              "Growing Demand for Technological and Soft Skills For all three countries, the development of labor supply does not fully match the changes in demand, except for certain occupations.",
              "At the same time, in many sectors, severe shortages of skilled workers will mean that growth in demand for talent will be unmet.",
              "This is particularly true for computer-related occupations and jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math, since technology is fueling the rise of automation across all industries.",
              "This is why the computer and mathematics job family group is likely to suffer by far the greatest worker deficits in all three countries.",
              "Meanwhile, in job family groups that involve little or no automation but that do require compassionate human interaction tailored to specific groups\u2014such as health care, social services, and certain teaching occupations\u2014the demand for human skills will increase as well.",
              "Germany and the United States, given their overall human resource deficits, will face the greatest pressure for talent in these occupations.",
              "For example, Germany will suffer a shortfall of 346,000 people in the educational instruction and library sector by 2030.",
              "The deficit for health care practitioners and technical support will rise to 254,000.",

              "7 million, respectively, by 2030.",
              "Even Australia will suffer a significant shortfall, in health care practitioners and technical support: 168,000.",
              "Sensitivity of Outcomes Exhibit 6 provides an overview of all six potential scenarios and gives an indication of the possible situations that may occur across them.",
              "For example, Australia will face a shortfall in the baseline COVID-19 projection of approximately 800,000 workers, assuming a low rate of technology adoption.",
              "At the other end of the spectrum\u2014the severe COVID-19 projection, with a high rate of technology adoption\u2014Australia will face a labor surplus of about 800,000.",
              "Compared with the United States and Germany, Australia is projected to experience a substantial growth in labor supply.",
              "In 2002, the national government started offering cash subsidies to parents of newborns in an effort to lift the country\u2019s fertility rate.",
              "The increase resulted in a baby boom of people who will enter the job market over the next decade.",
              "At the same time, Australia has significantly cut immigration for the foreseeable future in response to the economic challenges of the pandemic\u2014a short-term effect that will lead to increased labor supply when immigration resumes.",
              "Nevertheless, the projected skills mismatch is unlikely to be fully resolved.",
              "Therefore, we expect higher levels of unemployment in some areas and more acute skills shortages in others.",
              "The shortfall is even more pronounced in Germany, where the analysis shows a talent shortfall in five of the six potential scenarios we identified.",
              "Only a severe impact by the pandemic on GDP, combined with high technology adoption, would generate a net surplus of approximately 1 million employees.",
              "Germany faces the dual challenge of a birth rate that has remained low, at an average of 1.",
              "6 children per woman, combined with aging baby boomers who will retire in the next decade.",
              "Exacerbating this is a demand for workers that we anticipate will either remain constant or increase.",
              "Similarly, five of the six potential scenarios in the US show a shortfall (up to 12.",
              "5 million people), and only the severe COVID-19 trajectory, combined with a high adoption rate of technology, indicates a surplus (up to 4.",
              "5 million).",
              "Although the adoption of technology is progressing at roughly the same pace in all three countries, demographic profiles suggest that they will face different challenges during the digital transition.",
              "However, they all share the need for a labor force that has the right composition of skills to meet the needs of the digital age, which will demand upskilling and reskilling on a large scale.",
              "In the baseline projection, all three countries will face a net workforce gap.",
              "In addition, a certain level of structural unemployment (defined as the difference between demand and supply) will prevail.",

              "On large, complex projects with a multitude of stakeholders, it may be impossible for the project manager to properly cater to all stakeholders.",
              "Therefore, the project manager must know who the most influential stakeholders are and who can provide the greatest support for using AI on the project.",
              "Typical questions to ask related to AI might include: Not all stakeholders are equal in influence, power, or authority to make decisions or support AI decisions in a timely manner.",
              "It is imperative for the project manager to know who sits on the top of the list as having these capabilities.",

              "Typical Stakeholder Mapping Stakeholder engagement is when you meet and engage with the stakeholders and determine their needs and expectations.",
              "Engagement is multi-modal and, in these post-pandemic times, many project teams are getting back into physical engagement processes rather than working or engaging virtually.",
              "Ideally given the growth in AI utilization, it is important that stakeholder engagement take place at the start of the project to understand their position on the use of AI and their comfort of using it as part of the decision-making and problem-solving process.",
              "As part of this engagement, you must: Even though stakeholder engagement follows stakeholder identification, it is often through stakeholder engagement that we determine which stakeholders are supporters, advocates, neutral, or opponents of the use of AI in decision-making.",
              "This may also be viewed as the first step in building a trusting relationship between the project manager and the stakeholders.",
              "AI releases this year such as ChatGPT and the explosion in its use have demonstrated the need to form clear objectives and criteria to determine what the appropriate level of AI use in project decision-making and problem-solving needs to be.",

              "Those who influence or \u2018speak\u2019 the loudest, may get heard.",
              "Deciding on the level of AI utilization will require agreement and transparency with impacted stakeholders.",

              "If stakeholder trust in the use of AI cannot be developed, it may be necessary to consider making decisions or solving problems in the project without using AI practices.",
              "This will become less possible in larger organizations that determine AI use as an efficiency provider.",
              "Companies must have a clear ethical position on giving stakeholders a choice at the onset of a project as to whether AI can or should be used and if so, to what extent.",
