              "The first direct observation of gravitational waves was made on 14 September 2015 and was announced by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations on 11 February 2016.",
              "[3][4][5] Previously, gravitational waves had been inferred only indirectly, via their effect on the timing of pulsars in binary star systems. The waveform, detected by both LIGO observatories,[6] matched the predictions of general relativity[7][8][9] for a gravitational wave emanating from the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes of around 36 and 29 solar masses and the subsequent \"ringdown\" of the single resulting black hole.",
              "[note 2] The signal was named GW150914 (from gravitational wave and the date of observation 2015-09-14).",
              "[3][11] It was also the first observation of a binary black hole merger, demonstrating both the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems and the fact that such mergers could occur within the current age of the universe.",
              "This first direct observation was reported around the world as a remarkable accomplishment for many reasons.",
              "Efforts to directly prove the existence of such waves had been ongoing for over fifty years, and the waves are so minuscule that Albert Einstein himself doubted that they could ever be detected.",
              "[12][13] The waves given off by the cataclysmic merger of GW150914 reached Earth as a ripple in spacetime that changed the length of a 4 km LIGO arm by a thousandth of the width of a proton,[11] proportionally equivalent to changing the distance to the nearest star outside the Solar System by one hair's width.",

              "[3][4][15][16][note 4] The observation confirms the last remaining directly undetected prediction of general relativity and corroborates its predictions of space-time distortion in the context of large scale cosmic events (known as strong field tests).",
              "It was also heralded as inaugurating a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy, which will enable observations of violent astrophysical events that were not previously possible and potentially allow the direct observation of the very earliest history of the universe.",
              "[3][18][19][20][21] On 15 June 2016, two more detections of gravitational waves, made in late 2015, were announced.",
              "[22] Eight more observations were made in 2017, including GW170817, the first observed merger of binary neutron stars, which was also observed in electromagnetic radiation.",
              "Albert Einstein originally predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916,[24][25] on the basis of his theory of general relativity.",
              "[26] General relativity interprets gravity as a consequence of distortions in space-time, caused by mass.",
              "Therefore, Einstein also predicted that events in the cosmos would cause \"ripples\" in space-time \u2013 distortions of space-time itself \u2013 which would spread outward, although they would be so minuscule that they would be nearly impossible to detect by any technology foreseen at that time.",
              "[13] It was also predicted that objects moving in an orbit would lose energy for this reason (a consequence of the law of conservation of energy), as some energy would be given off as gravitational waves, although this would be insignificantly small in all but the most extreme cases.",
              "[27] One case where gravitational waves would be strongest is during the final moments of the merger of two compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes.",
              "Over a span of millions of years, binary neutron stars, and binary black holes lose energy, largely through gravitational waves, and as a result, they spiral in towards each other.",
              "At the very end of this process, the two objects will reach extreme velocities, and in the final fraction of a second of their merger a substantial amount of their mass would theoretically be converted into gravitational energy, and travel outward as gravitational waves,[28] allowing a greater than usual chance for detection.",
              "However, since little was known about the number of compact binaries in the universe and reaching that final stage can be very slow, there was little certainty as to how often such events might happen.",
              "[29] Gravitational waves can be detected indirectly \u2013 by observing celestial phenomena caused by gravitational waves \u2013 or more directly by means of instruments such as the Earth-based LIGO or the planned space-based LISA instrument.",
              "[30] Evidence of gravitational waves was first deduced in 1974 through the motion of the double neutron star system PSR B1913+16, in which one of the stars is a pulsar that emits electro-magnetic pulses at radio frequencies at precise, regular intervals as it rotates.",
              "Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor, who discovered the stars, also showed that over time, the frequency of pulses shortened, and that the stars were gradually spiralling towards each other with an energy loss that agreed closely with the predicted energy that would be radiated by gravitational waves.",
              "[31][32] For this work, Hulse and Taylor were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993.",
              "[33] Further observations of this pulsar and others in multiple systems (such as the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039) also agree with General Relativity to high precision.",
              "[34][35] Direct observation of gravitational waves was not possible for the many decades after they were predicted due to the minuscule effect that would need to be detected and separated from the background of vibrations present everywhere on Earth.",
              "A technique called interferometry was suggested in the 1960s and eventually technology developed sufficiently for this technique to become feasible.",
              "In the present approach used by LIGO, a laser beam is split and the two halves are recombined after travelling different paths.",
              "Changes to the length of the paths or the time taken for the two split beams, caused by the effect of passing gravitational waves, to reach the point where they recombine are revealed as \"beats\".",
              "Such a technique is extremely sensitive to tiny changes in the distance or time taken to traverse the two paths.",
              "In theory, an interferometer with arms about 4 km long would be capable of revealing the change of space-time \u2013 a tiny fraction of the size of a single proton \u2013 as a gravitational wave of sufficient strength passed through Earth from elsewhere.",
              "This effect would be perceptible only to other interferometers of a similar size, such as the Virgo, GEO 600 and planned KAGRA and INDIGO detectors.",
              "In practice at least two interferometers would be needed because any gravitational wave would be detected at both of these but other kinds of disturbance would generally not be present at both.",
              "This technique allows the sought-after signal to be distinguished from noise.",
              "This project was eventually founded in 1992 as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).",
              "The original instruments were upgraded between 2010 and 2015 (to Advanced LIGO), giving an increase of around 10 times their original sensitivity.",

              "This model is now strongly supported by early fossils in Africa6,7,8, by genomic evidence of interbreeding with archaic human groups outside of Africa9,10 and by the major portion of genomic ancestry outside of Africa appearing to be nested within African ancestries, in the Holocene epoch (the past 12,000 years or so) closest to eastern African ancestry1,2,11,12,13,14,15.",

              "This time frame is apparent in the long Neanderthal segments that are observed in an approximately 45-thousand-year-old modern human genome from Siberia and other ancient genomes29,33, and further supported by the fact that mtDNA36,37 and Y-chromosome38,39 lineages outside of Africa diversified by around 45\u201355 ka.",

              "However, such analyses could be confounded by the divergent Denisovan ancestry in these populations, and other studies have found no support for this ancestry14,46,47,48,49.",
              "Thus, the fossil and archaeological records of modern humans outside both Africa and Southwest Asia that are older than around 60 ka are best reconciled with the genetic data by any earlier dispersals not contributing detectable ancestry to people living after the later, major expansion.",
              "A recent addition to our understanding of modern humans outside of Africa is \u2018basal Eurasian\u2019 ancestry, which diverged from other non-African ancestries before these diversified, and probably lacked Neanderthal admixture50,51.",
              "It probably diverged more than 60 ka52,53, is found as early and widely as around 15 ka in Morocco54 and about 26 ka in Georgia52, and expanded throughout west Eurasia and South Asia during the Holocene epoch50,51,55,56,57,58.",
              "Some ancestry in these regions thus derives from groups that diverged before the worldwide expansion of 50\u201360 ka.",
              "The origins of basal Eurasian ancestry most likely centred around Southwest Asia and North Africa, and are unlikely to be connected to evidence of humans further away from Africa before 60 ka.",
              "A large number of admixture events between Neanderthals and Denisovans and modern human populations have been proposed in the literature.",
              "However, we argue that currently only four of these events, one of which did not contribute to present-day ancestry, have a broad consensus and could be considered conclusively demonstrated.",
              "The first archaic admixture event resulted in approximately 2% Neanderthal ancestry in present-day populations outside of sub-Saharan Africa9,34,59 and is found in all non-African modern human genomes studied to date (up to around 45 ka), including early ancient individuals in Belgium27, western Siberia29 and China32,60.",
              "Neanderthal ancestry is also present in smaller amounts in East and West Africa61,62,63, reflecting later gene flow from Eurasia2,13,63,64,65,66.",
              "However, some African populations, such as the Central African Mbuti and the East African Dinka, lack detectable Neanderthal ancestry, as do ancient genomes of the Holocene period from Ethiopia67, South Africa13,68 and Malawi13.",
              "The geographical ubiquity of Neanderthal ancestry outside of Africa has suggested that the admixture occurred in or close to Southwest Asia9, but no explicit evidence is available so far.",
              "Despite co-occupation with modern humans for thousands of years69, late Neanderthals in Europe do not appear to have contributed ancestry to present-day populations, as these are not genetically closer to the source population than Neanderthals in the Caucasus are70.",
              "A central feature of the geographical distribution of Neanderthal ancestry today is an approximately one fifth to one tenth lower relative proportion in western compared to eastern Eurasian populations71,72,73, with intermediate levels in South and Central Asia35,62.",
              "This observation has been suggested to reflect multiple admixture events74,75,76,77, but currently, the most likely explanation is a process of dilution by \u2018basal Eurasian\u2019 groups that carried little to no Neanderthal ancestry50,51.",
              "Comparisons of Neanderthal DNA segments in present-day humans indicate that, while the diversity of the source population was low, more than a few individuals must have contributed49,78.",
              "Furthermore, Neanderthal ancestry today is depleted by about one third around genic regions and promoters79,80,81, probably due to genetic load accumulated because of low Neanderthal population sizes82,83.",
              "Little reduction in Neanderthal ancestry is observed across ancient genomes from the past 45 thousand years79, suggesting that natural selection rapidly brought an initial proportion as high as around 10% down to the present-day levels of about 2%81,83.",
              "Thus, we cannot presently rule out an \u2018assimilation\u2019 scenario in which Neanderthals were absorbed into a larger expanding modern human population.",
              "The second strongly supported admixture event gave rise to up to approximately 3.",
              "5% Denisovan-related ancestry in present-day Oceanian individuals10,49,62,71.",
              "Ancestry deriving from this admixture event is present across Southeast Asia and Oceania84,85, and in very small amounts (around 0.",
              "1%) in East Asian, South Asian and Native American populations35,61,72,86,87.",
              "A major enduring question is where this admixture took place, as the Denisovan individual from Siberia is only distantly related to the source population of hypothetical \u2018southern Denisovans\u201961,87,88.",
              "Denisovan segments in present-day Oceanian genomes are longer than Neanderthal segments, and it has therefore been estimated that this admixture occurred more recently than Neanderthal admixture35,46, around 45\u201355 ka.",
              "Like Neanderthal ancestry, Denisovan ancestry today is depleted around functional regions of the genome and was therefore probably subject to a similar process of negative selection35.",
              "The third strongly supported admixture event in the ancestry of present-day people is from a second, distinct Denisovan population into the ancestors of present-day East Asian people, found in proportions in the order of 0.",
              "1%49,87,89,90.",
              "This population appears to have been more closely related to the Denisovans from Siberia87.",
              "East Asian populations can thus trace very small amounts of ancestry to two distinct Denisovan-related groups.",
              "Another strongly supported archaic admixture event comes from analyses of an approximately 40-thousand-year-old individual from Pes\u0326tera cu Oase in Romania91, who had a Neanderthal ancestor in the previous 4\u20136 generations92.",
              "However, this Neanderthal admixture probably did not contribute to present-day ancestry92.",
              "Together with findings of admixture between Neanderthals and Denisovans61,93, these few, but direct, observations of admixture suggest no strong biological or behavioural barriers to admixture between modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans.",
              "Further archaic admixture events have been proposed, but lack consensus across the literature.",
              "These include additional pulses from Neanderthals46,71,73,74,75,76,77,86,94,95, Denisovans78,85,90 and unknown archaic ancestries96,97.",
              "An emerging notion, fuelled by the many hypothesized events in the literature, is that archaic admixture into modern human populations occurred frequently whenever these groups came into contact.",
              "Although such admixture complexity is certainly plausible, we argue that the currently well-supported events include only those described above.",
              "The current genomic data also do not support substantial unknown \u2018ghost\u2019 archaic ancestry in non-Africans89,98,99, for example from Homo erectus or other groups.",
              "More substantial amounts of such ancestry would give rise to an excess of ancestral variants in some non-African groups over others, detectable even without access to the source genome, a signal that can be confirmed for Denisovan ancestry10.",
              "The second key phase is the diversification of present-day human ancestries.",
              "Although Africa was probably the centre of this process, neighbouring parts of Southwest Asia cannot be excluded as key areas of the history of the human population during the past few hundred thousand years100.",
              "However, an origin of present-day modern human diversity further away in Eurasia now seems to be highly unlikely.",
              "Here, we discuss what is known about modern human history in Africa between around 60 and 300 ka in a conceptual framework of models (Fig.",
              "2a), among which only a complete replacement scenario inside Africa in the past 100 ka can currently be excluded.",
              "a, African ancestry origins can be conceptualized as a range of models, most of which cannot be rejected using the current data.",
              "Models along this spectrum (indicated by the colour gradient of the arrow) include, among others, a recent complete replacement from a single region (top), a recent expansion overlaid on older structure (middle), and long-term continuity and connectivity across all of Africa (bottom).",

              "Application of these classic methods was pioneered by Luca Cavalli-Sforza and his many collaborators.",
              "As early as 1964, Cavalli-Sforza et al.",

              "As we will discuss, analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) has been successful in answering several of these questions, but has also raised new questions in the process.",
              "Importantly, aDNA provides a temporal dimension to genetic studies that would be inaccessible with present-day genomes alone, and only now is the full significance of aDNA being explored.",
              "One of the major problems that prevented the widespread sequencing of hominin aDNA for several years was contamination.",
              "Genetic material extracted and sequenced from a tissue sample of a living individual will consist largely of DNA fragments from that individual (i.",
              "e., endogenous fragments) if standard laboratory practices are followed.",
              "In contrast, because aDNA is so scarce and fragmented, most of the genetic material extracted from fossils tends to be exogenous, usually either from environmental microbes or humans who handled the fossil (13).",
              "The latter type of DNA is especially troublesome, as present-day human DNA is similar in sequence to endogenous aDNA from hominin fossils, and can introduce biases in downstream analyses.",
              "Although some of the first studies of nuclear aDNA from archaic hominins had problems with contamination (14, 15), there have been substantial experimental and computational innovations for mitigating its effect in contemporary studies.",
              "In the past decade, researchers have developed two broad sets of approaches to correct for contamination in their aDNA samples, allowing for the study of previously unusable sequences.",
              "First, it is now a standard practice to extract aDNA under strict clean-room conditions\u2014including UV radiation, bleach treatment of surfaces, and filtered air systems\u2014so as to minimize the proportion of exogenous DNA in the fossil extracts (13).",
              "Additionally, at the time of DNA library construction, scientists incorporate unique adapters to tag molecules that are present at the moment of extraction (16), to prevent additional molecules accidentally added during subsequent sequencing steps from being confused with endogenous molecules.",
              "Second, after the DNA has been sequenced, several bioinformatic tools can be used to either remove contaminant reads or estimate the proportion of those reads present in a DNA library.",
              "A common practice is to estimate the rate of contamination using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is much more abundant than nuclear DNA and hence is sequenced to a much higher coverage than nuclear DNA.",
              "For highly divergent populations (e.",
              "g., Neanderthals), one can use diagnostic positions that distinguish the two groups and assess how many discordant reads are present at each position (17, 18).",
              "For modern human populations (e.",
              "g., ancient Europeans), one can check for reads that diverge from the consensus sequence or that do not contain molecular signatures consistent with aDNA (19, 20).",
              "There are also more sophisticated contamination rate estimation methods that use larger subsets of the data, including sex chromosomes (21, 22) and entire autosomal genomes (7, 23).",
              "Additionally, one can use patterns of cytosine deamination at the ends of fragments\u2014a postmortem chemical damage typical of aDNA\u2014to filter out sequenced reads that do not display this signature and are therefore not likely to be ancient (24).",
              "The sequencing and analysis of genomes from Neanderthals and their relatives has been nothing short of revolutionary.",
              "First, the question of interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans\u2014posed by paleoanthropologists over 30 y ago\u2014has now been convincingly answered (7, 8).",
              "Additionally, a sister group of Neanderthals, called Denisovans, was discovered and its relationship to Neanderthals and humans established (9, 10).",
              "Despite the overlapping ranges of Neanderthals and modern humans in Europe and western Asia for at least 10,000 y, there was no widely accepted archaeological evidence that Neanderthals and modern humans interacted or interbred.",
              "Krings et al.",
              "(25) found that mtDNA sequences obtained from a Neanderthal fossil lay outside the clade composed of all mtDNA sequences from modern humans.",
              "This pattern of reciprocal monyphyly has been confirmed in many later studies of Neanderthal mtDNA (17).",
              "Although the mtDNA tree was consistent with the hypothesis that there was no admixture between the two groups, it did not provide conclusive evidence against it.",
              "In fact, reciprocal monophyly would be seen with significant probability even if there had been substantial admixture (26).",
              "Before the sequencing of the first Neanderthal genome, an analysis of present-day human samples had indicated there might have been high levels of archaic ancestry in both European and West African genomes, likely stemming from a diverged hominin group (27).",
              "Nuclear aDNA from Neanderthals resolved this problem, and its analysis showed that the actual admixture was different from what had been expected by either geneticists or paleoanthropologists.",

              "Indeed, other hunter-gatherer populations that speak languages that use clicks, including the Hadza people and the Sandawe people, currently reside in Tanzania in eastern Africa, although they display limited genomic affinity with the San people of southern African15,18.",
              "The exact origin of anatomically modern humans in Africa remains unknown, mainly because of the scarcity of fossil and archaeological data in the tropical regions of the continent.",
              "However, a multiregional origin of modern humans in Africa24, in which modern features evolved in a fragmented manner in several areas connected by gene flow, is still possible, especially given the opportunity for migration and admixture across the continent.",

              "The characterization of genomes from individuals who lived in Africa more than 10 kyr ago is challenging because the environment of the samples from which DNA is extracted, including the local climatic conditions, is not favourable to the preservation of genetic material.",
              "However, the statistical analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from geographically diverse hunter-gatherer populations provides evidence of archaic human lineages that have undergone introgression (the exchange of genetic material through interbreeding) and that diverged from modern human lineages as long ago as 1.",

              "The dispersal of anatomically modern humans out of Africa (Figs 2 and 3), a notable event in human evolutionary history, left a strong signature on the genetic variation of all non-African populations, including lower levels of diversity29 and higher levels of linkage disequilibrium30.",
              "However, the number, the geographic origin and migratory routes and the timing of major dispersals remains elusive.",
              "For instance, there is evidence to support the origins of modern humans in eastern, central and southern Africa18,31,32,33, single and multiple dispersals out of Africa7,34,35,36, a north or south dispersal route37,38 and estimates for the timing of dispersals occurring about 50 kyr\u2013100 kyr ago20,39,40,41,42,43.",
              "Three studies44,45,46 that leverage fresh, high-quality whole-genome sequencing data from geographically diverse individuals from more than 270 locations worldwide help to resolve some of these questions.",
              "They also point to the occurrence of a single out-of-Africa dispersal in which all contemporary non-African peoples branched off from the same ancestral population that left Africa, possibly with minor genetic contributions from an earlier modern human migration wave into Oceania46.",
              "Furthermore, on leaving Africa, modern humans may have immediately separated into two waves of dispersal44.",
              "As proposed in refs 36 and 47, one wave led ultimately to the founding of Australasia and New Guinea and the other contributed to the ancestry of present-day mainland Eurasians.",
              "However, the exact routes of migration in the early diversification of people outside Africa remain a topic of research and controversy.",
              "It is now clear that the ancestors of all contemporary non-African people encountered, and admixed with, Neanderthals48.",
              "All non-African individuals studied so far contain around 2% Neanderthal ancestry49,50,51, suggesting that admixture mostly occurred shortly after the dispersal of anatomically modern humans from Africa, which is consistent with a single\u2013dispersal-based out-of-Africa model (Figs 2 and 3).",
              "On the basis of patterns of linkage disequilibrium, the date of hybridization has been estimated to be approximately 50\u201365 kyr ago52, and knowledge of the timing of admixture with Neanderthals helps to bound estimates of when the ultimately successful out-of-Africa dispersal occurred.",
              "Estimates of the proportion of Neanderthal ancestry that persists in the genomes of modern humans51,53 points towards a more complex history of interaction between Neanderthals and modern humans.",
              "Specifically, East Asian people have about 20% more Neanderthal sequences compared to European people, which may reflect the effects of natural selection, the occurrence of further admixture events in the ancestors of present-day East Asians after the population split from Europeans50,53,54 (Fig.",
              "2) or the dilution of Neanderthal ancestry in Europeans owing to admixture with populations that did not contain considerable levels of Neanderthal sequences.",
              "Strikingly, SNP genotyping in an early modern human from Romania who lived about 40 kyr ago provided further evidence that introgression occurred at several times and locations in Eurasia55, although the individual did not contribute detectable ancestry to present-day populations.",
              "Recent studies50 have suggested a more complex admixture history than previously thought, and we caution that our understanding of admixture models is fluid at present and that further demographic models are also compatible with the observed.",
              "European populations are likely to be composed of three or more genetic components, some of which entered Europe at different times56,57,58,59,60,61 (Figs 2 and 3).",
              "The first anatomically modern humans lived in Europe as early as 43 kyr ago11,62.",
              "These early Paleolithic Europeans have probably made little genetic contribution to the European people of today61 as there is evidence of turnover in the genetic composition of Europeans before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), possibly in relation to climate oscillations63 \u2014 although the exact contributions from early Europeans is still under debate61.",
              "Around 11 kyr ago, after the LGM had passed, a new way of life based on animal husbandry, agriculture and sedentarism \u2014 and known as a Neolithic lifestyle \u2014 started to emerge in several subregions of the Fertile Crescent64 (Fig.",
              "3).",
              "Analyses of ancient DNA showed that this population of farmers expanded from Central Anatolia into Europe;",
              "however, other regions of the Fertile Crescent contributed only limited genetic material to the early European farmers61.",
              "They reached the Iberian Peninsula (Fig.",
              "3) roughly 7 kyr ago and arrived in Britain and Scandinavia about 6 kyr ago61.",
              "Genomic data from the remains of Neolithic humans have shown that this process was driven by the mass migration of groups of farmers61 and the assimilation of local hunter-gatherers65, demonstrating that the Neolithic way of life spread across Europe through the migration of people rather than solely as an idea or a culture.",
              "The Neolithic lifestyle helped to increase the size of populations, as seen in the estimates of effective population sizes that were generated from genomic data66, although archaeological data suggests that the health of the individuals who lived as farmers was sometimes poor as there were ample signs of malnutrition and caries66,67.",
              "Another wave of migration into Europe, which introduced the third European genetic component, occurred during the late Neolithic period and the early Bronze Age.",
              "Herders from the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe who belonged to the Yamnaya culture were involved in a migration to central Europe about 4.",
              "5 kyr ago58,60.",
              "The herders themselves were descendants of various hunter-gatherer groups from (modern) Russia58 and the Caucasus68.",
              "This migration was probably linked to conquests and technological innovations such as horseback riding and may have spread Indo-European languages to Europe58,60, although some linguistics researchers suggest that these languages were already spoken by Neolithic farmers69.",
              "Clearly, the late Neolithic period and the Bronze Age were dynamic times that led to the spread of the genetic material of the steppe herders across western and northern Europe58,60.",
              "The three main genetic components of modern-day European populations reflect the contributions of hunter-gatherers to the recolonization of Europe after the LGM, the migration of Neolithic farmers from Anatolia to Europe and the late-Neolithic period and Bronze Age migration to Europe from the east.",
              "These components can explain much of the genetic diversity found in present-day Europe65.",
              "For example, the Neolithic genetic component seems to be most dominant in southern European populations such as the Sardinian people56,57,66.",
              "Genetic variation among modern-day Europeans is strongly correlated with geography70,71 and shows a gradient of decreasing diversity with increasingly northern latitudes72.",
              "Although the main components of genetic diversity were introduced into Europe in separate waves of migration, subsequent processes of gene flow that were limited by geography have shaped the present genetic landscape.",
              "Culture and lifestyle were therefore more important determinants of genomic differentiation and similarity in many periods during Prehistoric Europe than geography61.",
              "Most evidence indicates that Asia was colonized through at least two early waves of migration.",
              "One wave included the ancestors of Australians and the Papuan people and the other included other ancestors of East Asians, with admixing between the two47 (Figs 2 and 3), although other evidence suggests that there was only one dispersal event45.",
              "However, the details of how Asia was first colonized remain largely unknown.",
              "Two early modern human genomes from Asia have been sequenced.",
              "The first genome came from an individual of the Mal'ta-Buret' culture of southern central Siberia who lived about 24 kyr ago73 and shows a strong genetic affiliation to both western Eurasians and Native Americans but a weaker affiliation to East Asians and Siberians, implying that there was a very different geographic distribution of genetic signatures during the Upper Palaeolithic period in comparison to the present day.",
              "The second genome, which came from an individual who lived in the Ust'-Ishim region of western Siberia74 about 45 kyr ago, shows almost equal genetic affinity with western Eurasians, East Asians74 and Aboriginal Australians when differences in Denisovan admixture are accounted for44.",
              "Together with evidence from the 36\u201338-kyr-old genome of the Kostenki 14 individual from European Russia75, showing a close affinity to contemporary western Eurasians but not East Asians, this points to the occurrence of a divergence between East Asians and western Eurasians around 36\u201345 kyr ago.",
              "A study that included low-coverage sequencing of the genomes of 101 ancient humans from across Bronze Age Eurasia60 showed that two later population expansions into central Asia from Europe and western Asia resulted in mixing with and locally replacing the Mal'ta-like hunter-gatherers.",
              "The first event was an expansion of Yamnaya herders into Asia about 5 kyr ago, which occurred at the same time as the Yamnaya expansion into Europe.",
              "Subsequently, between 2.",
              "5 and 3.",
              "5 kyr ago, Yamnaya people in central Asia (forming the Afanasievo culture) were locally replaced by individuals from the Sintashta culture60, who moved in from the Urals and Europe and admixed with East Asians.",
              "Archaeological evidence shows that humans were present in Oceania around 47.",
              "5\u201355 kyr ago76,77.",
              "Morphological variation in ancient human skeletons from Australia has been used to propose that there were at least two independent migrations to the ancient continent of Sahul, which is comprised of modern Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania78.",
              "Similar claims have been put forward on the basis of linguistic data and lithic technology or the introduction of domesticated species such as the dingo36.",
              "However, the only extensive population genomic study so far on Aboriginal Australians and Papuans44 finds evidence for only a single founding event in Sahul, which was followed by a divergence of the Papuan and Aboriginal Australian ancestral population and further genetic diversification in the Aboriginal Australian population that could have coincided with environmental changes such as desertification.",
              "Aboriginal Australians therefore seem to have been living in a high level of isolation until only relatively recent times.",
              "A study79 of genome-wide SNP data from modern people in Oceania confirmed archaeological predictions that Polynesians, who are distributed across a triangle of islands in the South Pacific that is bounded by Rapa Nui (also known as Easter Island) to the east, represent an expansion into Oceania of individuals with mixed Melanesian and East Asian ancestry.",
              "The Melanesian ancestry was added to the original East Asian ancestry after the initial Polynesian expansion had begun80.",
              "Whether Polynesians reached the Americas and admixed with Native Americans during their eastward expansion that ended about 1 kyr ago remains controversial.",
              "A genetic study of ancient chicken remains from South America supports this scenario81 but has also been questioned82.",
              "Genome sequencing of the remains of humans from Brazil that date to around AD 1650, and therefore pre-date the recorded trade of Polynesian slaves to South America83, shows that the individuals are closely related to contemporary Polynesians.",
              "These data potentially provide further support for early contact between Polynesians and Native Americans but they could also be the result of the European-mediated transportation of people.",
              "More convincing are the results of a genome-wide study of the modern-day inhabitants of Easter Island84, which provided statistical support for Native American admixture that can be dated to 1280\u20131495, several hundred years before Europeans reached the islands in 1722.",
              "However, only evidence of Polynesian and Native American admixture in human remains that pre-date colonization in the Americas would settle the debate.",
              "The oldest most widely accepted evidence of humans in the Americas dates to about 15\u201314 kyr ago85, and widespread settlement of the Americas appeared with the emergence of the Clovis complex (around 12.",
              "6\u201313 kyr ago), which is the earliest well-characterized archaeological assemblage in the Americas.",

              "Changes in diet, particularly those that are associated with the emergence of new hunting technologies or agricultural practices, have also had a considerable impact on the human genome.",

              "126).",
              "Several lessons can be learned from genome-wide studies of selection in humans.",
              "First, although most of the initial scans for selection proposed that selection acts immediately on new mutations, it is becoming clear that in many cases, selection acts on standing variation \u2014 that is, alleles that were present for some time before they became favoured127.",
              "Furthermore, this variation has in many cases been introgressed by interbreeding with other hominins128,129.",
              "There is a growing list of genetic variants that were identified as introgressed from Neanderthals and Denisovans that have been favoured in anatomically modern humans by natural selection129.",
              "For example, the adaptive EPAS1 haplotype in Tibetans seems to be introgressed from Denisovans, and the selection on the major histocompatibility complex genes and the gene MC1R is probably facilitated by introgression from Neanderthals130,131.",
              "As humans migrated out of Africa and encountered new environments, introgression with other hominins that had already adapted to these environments seems to have been an important factor in facilitating rapid acceleration.",
              "This might be particularly true for genes related to immunity and defence against infection, as anatomically modern humans probably encountered pathogenic agents that could jump from other hominins, and to which humans did not yet have immunity.",
              "Second, much of the selection that has affected the human genome has been in response to changes in the environment that were induced by people.",
              "These include changes in diet that were driven by cultural innovations and an increase in the pathogen load of the population owing to changes in social structure and the emergence of cities132.",
              "As we modify our environment, the resulting changes in conditions induce new selective pressures.",
              "Biological evolution and cultural evolution are therefore intimately linked.",
              "Third, a close relationship often exists between genetic variants that have been under selection and those that have a strong influence on human health.",
              "Studies of human evolution are therefore of increasing relevance for medical genetics.",
              "For example, variants found to be selected for by adaptation to high altitudes provide a model for studying hypertension133.",
              "Similarly, variants shown to be under selection in relation to dietary adaptation, such as those in the gene family FADS, may facilitate the development of genomics-informed personalized diets.",
              "Fourth, the genes that show the greatest difference in allele frequency between continental groups (indigenous Africans, Europeans, Americans and Australians) are enriched for associations with visible traits such as skin, hair and eye pigmentation103.",
              "An interesting consequence is that the geographic groups are more different from each other in terms of pigmentation than they are, on average, at the level of the genome.",
              "Humans from various parts of the world are therefore more genetically similar than might be predicted on the basis of observed hair colour, skin colour or other visible traits.",
              "Last, genetic variants with large effects, such as those that influence eye colour, hair colour or lactase persistence, are unusual.",
              "Instead, such traits seem to be highly complex and may be influenced by many loci across the genome.",
              "Unlike selection at individual sites, polygenic adaptation \u2014 the result of selection acting on complex traits \u2014 can occur rapidly, even in a few generations, but the footprints of selection at individual loci are extremely weak and cannot be detected by standard methods134.",
              "The best characterized example of polygenic adaptation in humans is selection for an adaptive increase in the height of northern Europeans135, a smaller increase in the height of Europeans compared to non-Europeans136 and a decrease in the height in Sardinians137.",
              "Selection for height may have had small effects on loci across most of the human genome138.",
              "Polygenic adaptation may also have influenced a variety of other morphological traits, including increases in size of the head and body of infants in northern Europe138.",
              "It is probable that a considerable component of selection in humans is polygenic and is yet to be discovered by studies that scan for genomic regions that are under selection.",

              "Human evolution is a natural experiment that has been repeated only once, and the inference of past demography is therefore a historical science, with inherent limitations.",
              "Furthermore, the ancestral geographic locations of humans cannot be deduced directly from the genomes of modern humans;",
              "instead, they are typically inferred indirectly from the locations in which samples are found.",
              "Genetic analyses can inform knowledge of the ancestral relationships between individuals, but ancestral DNA is not inscribed with geographic locations.",
              "Also, the dating of divergence or admixture events is only as good as the clock by which dating is measured.",
              "Rates of mutation across the human genome and between individuals may be variable, and there has been considerably controversy regarding the mutations rates that should be used in demographic studies.",
              "Estimates of these rates vary depending on the methodology that is used for estimation, although a consensus rate of 0.",
              "5 \u00d7 109 base pairs per year has emerged in the past few years43.",
              "It is possible that this estimate will be revised further, which would affect the dating of events inferred by genomic data in previous studies.",
              "Despite these limitations, advances in the analysis of both modern and ancient human genomes have changed many aspects of our understanding of human evolution.",
              "The mounting evidence for interbreeding between Neanderthals, Denisovans and anatomically modern humans has put a focus on the role of introgression in human evolution.",
              "Such studies have found that anatomically modern humans did not evolve with complete independence from other hominins outside Africa, as proposed by the strictest versions of the out-of-Africa model that were often subscribed to after the publication of mtDNA evidence almost 30 years ago1.",
              "Levels of interbreeding suggest that the true model of human evolution \u2014 sometimes referred to as the leaky replacement model \u2014 lies between the multiregional model and the out-of-Africa model139.",
              "In fact, the levels of Neanderthal admixture in modern humans are probably strong underestimates of the amount of admixture that was present at the time of introgression55,140.",
              "There is considerable evidence that substantial amounts of Neanderthal DNA was purged by selection, through genetic incompatibilities51 or simply because the high level of inbreeding in Neanderthals caused the Neanderthal DNA to be enriched with deleterious mutations.",
              "A linear fit to the change in the proportion of Neanderthal admixture suggested that the original proportion, at the time at which admixture took place, was probably about 5%63.",
              "However, selection does not decrease the proportion of admixture linearly through time, and a more detailed mathematical analysis showed that the proportion of Neanderthal DNA in humans might originally have been as high as 10%140.",
              "As the effective population size of Neanderthals may have been around 10% of the human population of the time48, the observed proportion of introgression (when selection is taken into account) suggests that humans and Neanderthals could have mixed in proportion with their effective population sizes140.",
              "In other words, Neanderthals may not have become extinct because they lacked suitable ecological adaptations or through competition or warfare with humans.",
              "Instead, they may simply have been absorbed into the human species.",
              "Testing absorption models more directly, for example by sequencing older human remains from Eurasia, may finally resolve the much-debated disappearance of Neanderthals.",
              "Similar questions remain for Denisovans.",
              "For example, what is the contribution of purifying selection (negative selection against deleterious mutations) to present-day levels and patterns of Denisovan-like ancestry in Australasians?",
              "What was the geographic distribution of Denisovans?",
              "And where did the introgression between humans and Denisovans occur?",
              "The identification and genomic analysis of further Denisovan samples may help to answer these questions.",
              "Future studies of archaic hominin admixture are likely to reveal further twists in the story of human evolution.",
              "Perhaps of greatest interest is genomic data from under-sampled regions of the world, which may help to refine evolutionary theories, including the question of whether there are further, as-yet uncharacterized, lineages of archaic humans.",
              "Indeed, preliminary data from contemporary African populations suggest that gene flow occurred with at least one other archaic hominin lineage25,26,27.",
              "For over a century, researchers have discussed whether the biological and cultural variation that exists between groups of modern humans evolved as a result of the long-term isolation of populations, with innovation occurring through the spread of ideas141, or whether genetic variation and cultural changes were driven by human migration and the mixing of populations142.",
              "From the analyses of genomic data obtained so far, it is clear that the migration and admixture of populations has played a much larger part in generating genetic and cultural patterns of diversity than was previously thought56,57,58,60,66, although some groups have remained in isolation for a long period of time44,97.",
              "The genomic studies also suggest that the geographic distribution of genetic signatures in many modern populations were established relatively late in human history60.",
              "Yet for many regions of the world, especially Asia and Africa, our understanding of the historical events that led to the current distribution of genetic and cultural variation is still very fragmented.",
              "The study of ancient human genomes has progressed rapidly, and in the past few years we have moved from studies of single genomes to population genomic studies that include hundreds of ancient individuals.",
              "Although this has provided a wealth of insights into human evolutionary genomics, this field is still in its infancy.",
              "Continued efforts to sequence and analyse the genomes of both modern and ancient humans, with a focus on under-sampled areas of the world, will help us to form a more complete picture of the events that have shaped the cultural and genetic variation of contemporary humans.",

              "The hunt for signs of life in the atmospheres of planets outside the solar system orbiting distant stars \u2014 exoplanets \u2014 is akin to hunting for a needle in a cosmic haystack.",

              "And that's in the Milky Way alone.",
              "Yet, scientists at least have a good idea of what they should be hunting for as well as knowledge of signs that would potentially indicate life.",
              "\"We want to probe the atmospheres of these exoplanets to look for oxygen, methane, water vapor, and other chemicals that could signal the presence of life,\" NASA\u2019s Exoplanet Exploration Program chief technologist, Nick Siegler, said in a statement.",
              "\"We aren't going to see little green men but rather spectral signatures of these key chemicals, or what we call biosignatures.\"",
              "Related: NASA\u2019s exoplanet hunter TESS spots warm Jupiter with longest known year The HWO was first proposed as a top priority by the Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 (Astro2020), a roadmap of goals for the astronomy community to take on over the coming decade.",
              "This is because, in addition to hunting for signs of life outside the solar system and helping astronomers understand entire planetary systems, the observatory will also play a major role in astrophysics investigations.",
              "Though the mission is set to launch in the late 2030s or early 2040s, advancing technologies the telescope will use now could help prevent cost overruns later down the line, according to Dmitry Mawet, member of the HWO Technical Assessment Group (TAG).",
              "To perform deep investigations of exoplanet atmospheres in order to hunt for signs of life, the HWO will tap into its ability to block out the glares of stars those exoplanets orbit.",
              "Blocking strong light coming from these stars will allow fainter bits of starlight, reflecting off the atmospheres of orbiting planets around these stars, to be seen.",
              "Chemical elements and compounds absorb and emit light at unique wavelengths characteristic to their compositions, meaning light exposed to a planet's atmosphere carries fingerprints of elements it is made of.",
              "Scientists take this light and, using a process called spectroscopy, search for these fingerprints.",
              "Such chemical fingerprints could include biosignatures indicating chemical compounds exhaled or inhaled by living things.",
              "There are two main ways that the HWO could potentially block out excess starlight.",
              "On one hand, it could utilize a large external light block called a starshade, which would unfurl from the HWO after its launch into a massive sunflower-shaped umbrella.",
              "Or alternatively, it could use an internal starshade called a coronagraph, similar to instruments scientists use to block out light from the sun\u2019s bright photosphere to study its nebulous outer atmosphere, or corona.",
              "Siegler added that currently, NASA has decided to focus the HWO around coronagraph technology used on several other telescopes, including the JWST and forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Telescope.",

              "The coronagraph lets the KPIC picture thermal emissions from young and hot gas-giant exoplanets, allowing scientists to investigate how these planets and their planetary systems evolve.",
              "Earth-like planets that the HWO will set its sights on can emit light around 10 billion times fainter than that of their stars, meaning a coronagraph for the future space telescope would need to push starlight well past its current limits.",
              "\"As we get closer and closer to this required level of starlight suppression, the challenges become exponentially harder,\" Mawet added.",
              "One of the ideas put forward at the Caltech meeting to enhance suppression of light from a distant star is to put a mirror within a coronagraph that can be deformed to control light rays.",
              "Employing thousands of actuators to drive the shape of the mirror as well as push and pull on its reflective surfaces could stop stray light from making its way to the final image, thus preventing unwanted \"blobs\" of residual starlight.",
              "A deformable \"active\" mirror of this type is the kind set to be used by the Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope, in fact, an observatory set to launch no later than 2027.",
              "Roman should let astronomers see gas giants around a billion times fainter than their stars as well as debris around stars left over from the births of planets.",
              "This will be a vital stepping stone towards more powerful technology that will be needed by the HWO, bridging a gap in coronagraph masks and active mirrors too great to cover in a single proverbial bound.",
              "\"We need to be able to deform the mirrors to a picometer-level of precision,\" Mawet explained.",
              "\"We will need to suppress the starlight by another factor of roughly 100 compared to Roman\u2019s coronagraph.\"",

              "the Cas-9 nickase cuts the non-complementary strand of DNA three bases upstream from the PAM site, exposing a 3\u02b9-OH nick of genomic DNA.",
              "The reverse transcriptase then extends the 3\u02b9 nick by copying the edit sequence of pegRNA.",

              "The dCas-9 nuclease lacks DNA cleavage activity, but its DNA binding activity is not affected.",
              "Then, transcriptional activators or inhibitors can be fused with dCas-9 to form the CRISPR/dCas-9 complex.",
              "Therefore, catalytically inactive dCas-9 can be used to activate (CRISPRa) or silence (CRISPRi) the expression of a specific gene of interest.",
              "50 Moreover, the CRISPR/dCas-9 can be also used to visualize and pinpoint where specifically the gene of interest is located inside the cell (subcellular localization) by fusing a marker such as Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFP) with dCas-9 enzyme.",
              "This enables site-specific labeling and imaging of endogenous loci in living cells for further utilization.",
              "51 Despite its great promise as a genome-editing system CRISPR/Cas-9 technology had hampered by several challenges that should be addressed during the process of application.",
              "Immunogenicity, lack of a safe and efficient delivery system to the target, off-target effect, and ethical issues have been the major barriers to extend the technology in clinical applications.",

              "12 This approach and its applications are thought to be simpler than HR-based methods because (a) there is no need for a repair matrix and (b) the cell type has less impact on modification efficacy (contrary to HR, NHEJ may be active all through the cell cycle).",
              "13 Thus, similar to RNAi, NHEJ may be applied in immortalized cell lines to generate the inactivation of a single gene or multiple genes, but by creating loss-of-function mutations, it may lead to permanent gene inactivation.",

              "By virtue of the modular structure of ZFNs, both the DNA-binding and catalytic domains can be individually optimized, which enables scientists to develop novel modular assembly with sufficient affinity and specificity for genome engineering.",
              "In early studies, individual ZFNs containing 3\u20136 fingers were used to interact with a 9\u201318 nucleotide target, which enabled ZFN dimers to specify 18\u201336 bp of DNA at each cleavage site.",
              "31 Since the 18 bp sequence of DNA can render specificity within 68 billion bp of DNA, this approach facilitated the targeting of specific sequences in the human genome for the first time.",
              "A more recently developed strategy used architectural diversification to improve the targeting accuracy of ZFNs via \u201cselection-based methods\u201d32: this study developed a new linker option for spanning finger\u2013finger and finger\u2013FokI cleavage domain junctions, which produced a 64-fold total increase in the number of ZFN configurations available for targeting cleavage to any given base of DNA.",
