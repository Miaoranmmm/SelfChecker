              "Computer - Turing Machine, Algorithms, Automata | Britannica",
              "Alan Turing, while a mathematics student at the University of Cambridge, was inspired by German mathematician David Hilbert\u2019s formalist program, which sought to demonstrate that any mathematical problem can potentially be solved by an algorithm\u2014that is, by a purely mechanical process.",
              "Turing interpreted this to mean a computing machine and set out to design one capable of resolving all mathematical problems, but in the process he proved in his seminal paper \u201cOn Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [\u2018Halting Problem\u2019]\u201d (1936) that no such universal mathematical solver could ever exist.",
              "In order to design his machine (known to posterity as the \u201cTuring machine\u201d), he needed to find an unambiguous definition of the essence of a computer.",
              "In doing so, Turing worked out in great detail the basic concepts of a universal computing machine\u2014that is, a computing machine that could, at least in theory, do anything that a special-purpose computing device could do.",
              "In particular, it would not be limited to doing arithmetic.",
              "The internal states of the machine could represent numbers, but they could equally well represent logic values or letters.",
              "In fact, Turing believed that everything could be represented symbolically, even abstract mental states, and he was one of the first advocates of the artificial-intelligence position that computers can potentially \u201cthink.",
              "\u201d Turing\u2019s work up to this point was entirely abstract, entirely a theoretical demonstration.",
              "Nevertheless, he made it clear from the start that his results implied the possibility of building a machine of the sort he described.",
              "His work characterized the abstract essence of any computing device so well that it was in effect a challenge to actually build one.",
              "Turing\u2019s work had an immediate effect on only a small number of academics at a few universities who were interested in the concept of computing machinery.",
              "It had no immediate effect on the growing industry of business machines, all of which were special-purpose devices.",
              "But to the few who were interested, Turing\u2019s work was an inspiration to pursue something of which most of the world had not even conceived: a universal computing machine.",
              "It was generally believed that the first electronic digital computers were the Colossus, built in England in 1943, and the ENIAC, built in the United States in 1945.",
              "However, the first special-purpose electronic computer may actually have been invented by John Vincent Atanasoff, a physicist and mathematician at Iowa State College (now Iowa State University), during 1937\u201342.",
              "(Atanasoff also claimed to have invented the term analog computer to describe machines such as Vannevar Bush\u2019s Differential Analyzer.)",
              "Together with his graduate assistant Clifford E.",
              "Berry, Atanasoff built a successful small prototype in 1939 for the purpose of testing two ideas central to his design: capacitors to store data in binary form and electronic logic circuits to perform addition and subtraction.",
              "They then began the design and construction of a larger, more general-purpose computer, known as the Atanasoff-Berry Computer, or ABC.",
              "Various components of the ABC were designed and built from 1939 to 1942, but development was discontinued with the onset of World War II.",
              "The ABC featured about 300 vacuum tubes for control and arithmetic calculations, use of binary numbers, logic operations (instead of direct counting), memory capacitors, and punched cards as input/output units.",
              "(At Atanasoff\u2019s invitation, another early computer pioneer, John Mauchly, stayed at his home and was freely shown his work for several days in June 1941.",
              "For more on the ramifications of this visit, see BTW: Computer patent wars.)",
              "Between 1940 and 1946 George Stibitz and his team at Bell Laboratories built a series of machines with telephone technologies\u2014i.",
              "e., employing electromechanical relays.",
              "These were the first machines to serve more than one user and the first to work remotely over telephone lines.",
              "However, because they were based on slow mechanical relays rather than electronic switches, they became obsolete almost as soon as they were constructed.",
              "Meanwhile, in Germany, engineer Konrad Zuse had been thinking about calculating machines.",
              "He was advised by a calculator manufacturer in 1937 that the field was a dead end and that every computing problem had already been solved.",
              "Zuse had something else in mind, though.",
              "For one thing, Zuse worked in binary from the beginning.",
              "All of his prototype machines, built in 1936, used binary representation in order to simplify construction.",
              "This had the added advantage of making the connection with logic clearer, and Zuse worked out the details of how the operations of logic (e.",
              "g., AND, OR, and NOT) could be mapped onto the design of the computer\u2019s circuits.",
              "(English mathematician George Boole had shown the connection between logic and mathematics in the mid-19th century, developing an algebra of logic now known as Boolean algebra.)",
              "Zuse also spent more time than his predecessors and contemporaries developing software for his computer, the language in which it was to be programmed.",
              "(His contributions to programming are examined in the section Programming languages.)",
              "Although all his early prewar machines were really calculators\u2014not computers\u2014his Z3, completed in December 1941 (and destroyed on April 6, 1945, during an Allied air raid on Berlin), was the first program-controlled processor.",
              "Because all Zuse\u2019s work was done in relative isolation, he knew little about work on computers in the United States and England, and, when the war began, the isolation became complete.",
              "The following section, Developments during World War II, examines the development during the 1940s of the first fully functional digital computers.",
              "The exigencies of war gave impetus and funding to computer research.",
              "For example, in Britain the impetus was code breaking.",
              "The Ultra project was funded with much secrecy to develop the technology necessary to crack ciphers and codes produced by the German electromechanical devices known as the Enigma and the Geheimschreiber (\u201cSecret Writer\u201d).",
              "The first in a series of important code-breaking machines, Colossus, also known as the Mark I, was built under the direction of Sir Thomas Flowers and delivered in December 1943 to the code-breaking operation at Bletchley Park, a government research centre north of London.",
              "It employed approximately 1,800 vacuum tubes for computations.",
              "Successively larger and more elaborate versions were built over the next two years.",
              "The Ultra project had a gifted mathematician associated with the Bletchley Park effort, and one familiar with codes.",
              "Alan Turing, who had earlier articulated the concept of a universal computing device (described in the section The Turing machine), may have pushed the project farther in the direction of a general-purpose device than his government originally had in mind.",
              "Turing\u2019s advocacy helped keep up government support for the project.",
              "Although it lacked some characteristics now associated with computers, Colossus can plausibly be described as the first electronic digital computer, and it was certainly a key stepping stone to the development of the modern computer.",
              "Although Colossus was designed to perform specific cryptographic-related calculations, it could be used for more-generalized purposes.",
              "Its design pioneered the massive use of electronics in computation, and it embodied an insight from Flowers of the importance of storing data electronically within the machine.",
              "The operation at Bletchley foreshadowed the modern data centre.",
              "Colossus was successful in its intended purpose: the German messages it helped to decode provided information about German battle orders, supplies, and personnel;",
              "it also confirmed that an Allied deception campaign, Operation Fortitude, was working.",
              "The series of Colossus computers were disassembled after the war, and most information about them remained classified until the 1990s.",
              "In 1996 the basic Colossus machine was rebuilt and switched on at Bletchley Park.",
              "In Germany, Konrad Zuse began construction of the Z4 in 1943 with funding from the Air Ministry.",
              "Like his Z3 (described in the section Konrad Zuse), the Z4 used electromechanical relays, in part because of the difficulty in acquiring the roughly 2,000 necessary vacuum tubes in wartime Germany.",
              "The Z4 was evacuated from Berlin in early 1945, and it eventually wound up in Hinterstein, a small village in the Bavarian Alps, where it remained until Zuse brought it to the Federal Technical Institute in Zu\u0308rich, Switzerland, for refurbishing in 1950.",
              "Although unable to continue with hardware development, Zuse made a number of advances in software design.",
              "Zuse\u2019s use of floating-point representation for numbers\u2014the significant digits, known as the mantissa, are stored separately from a pointer to the decimal point, known as the exponent, allowing a very large range of numbers to be handled\u2014was far ahead of its time.",
              "In addition, Zuse developed a rich set of instructions, handled infinite values correctly, and included a \u201cno-op\u201d\u2014that is, an instruction that did nothing.",

              "Note that in its original form (Hilbert & Ackermann 1928), the problem was stated in terms of validity rather than derivability.",
              "Given Go\u0308del\u2019s completeness theorem (Go\u0308del 1929) proving that there is an effective procedure (or not) for derivability is also a solution to the problem in its validity form.",

              "The machine is an automatic machine (a-machine) which means that at any given moment, the behavior of the machine is completely determined by the current state and symbol (called the configuration) being scanned.",

              "These a-machines are contrasted with the so-called choice machines for which the next state depends on the decision of an external device or operator (Turing 1936\u20137: 232).",

              "One can think of this as assuming the availability of potentially infinite time to complete the computation.",
              "These two assumptions are intended to ensure that the definition of computation that results is not too narrow.",
              "This is, it ensures that no computable function will fail to be Turing-computable solely because there is insufficient time or memory to complete the computation.",
              "It follows that there may be some Turing computable functions which may not be carried out by any existing computer, perhaps because no existing machine has sufficient memory to carry out the task.",
              "Some Turing computable functions may not ever be computable in practice, since they may require more memory than can be built using all of the (finite number of) atoms in the universe.",
              "If we moreover assume that a physical computer is a finite realization of the Turing machine, and so that the Turing machine functions as a good formal model for the computer, a result which shows that a function is not Turing computable is very strong, since it implies that no computer that we could ever build could carry out the computation.",
              "In Section 2.",
              "4, it is shown that there are functions which are not Turing-computable.",
              "Turing\u2019s definition was standardized through (some of) Post\u2019s modifications of it in Post 1947.",
              "In that paper Post proves that a certain problem from mathematics known as Thue\u2019s problem or the word problem for semi-groups is not Turing computable (or, in Post\u2019s words, recursively unsolvable).",
              "Post\u2019s main strategy was to show that if it were decidable then the following decision problem from Turing 1936\u20137 would also be decidable: PRINT?",
              "The problem to decide for every Turing machine M whether or not it will ever print some symbol (for instance, 0).",

              "plays a central role in Post\u2019s proof, Post believed that Turing\u2019s proof of that was affected by the \u201cspurious Turing convention\u201d (Post 1947: 9), viz.",
              "the system of F and E-squares.",
              "Thus, Post introduced a modified version of the Turing machine.",
              "The most important differences between Post\u2019s and Turing\u2019s definition are: Post\u2019s Turing machine, when in a given state, either prints or moves and so its transition rules are more \u2018atomic\u2019 (it does not have the composite operation of moving and printing).",

              "(Some of) Post\u2019s modifications of Turing\u2019s definition became part of the definition of the Turing machine in standard works such as Kleene 1952 and Davis 1958.",

              "In situations where a formal analysis of Turing machines is required, it is appropriate to spell out the definition of the machinery and program in more mathematical terms. Purely formally a Turing machine can be specified as a quadruple \\(T = (Q,\\Sigma, s, \\delta)\\) where: \\(\\delta\\) is a transition function determining the next move: The transition function for the machine T is a function from computation states to computation states.",

              "It did this by combining the plaintext characters with a stream of key characters using the XOR Boolean function to produce the ciphertext.",
              "In August 1941, a blunder by German operators led to the transmission of two versions of the same message with identical machine settings.",

              "He deduced that the twelve wheels consisted of two groups of five, which he named the \u03c7 (chi) and \u03c8 (psi) wheels, the remaining two he called \u03bc (mu) or \"motor\" wheels.",
              "The chi wheels stepped regularly with each letter that was encrypted, while the psi wheels stepped irregularly, under the control of the motor wheels.",
              "[16] With a sufficiently random keystream, a Vernam cipher removes the natural language property of a plaintext message of having an uneven frequency distribution of the different characters, to produce a uniform distribution in the ciphertext.",
              "The Tunny machine did this well.",
              "However, the cryptanalysts worked out that by examining the frequency distribution of the character-to-character changes in the ciphertext, instead of the plain characters, there was a departure from uniformity which provided a way into the system.",
              "This was achieved by \"differencing\" in which each bit or character was XOR-ed with its successor.",
              "[17] After Germany surrendered, allied forces captured a Tunny machine and discovered that it was the electromechanical Lorenz SZ (Schlu\u0308sselzusatzgera\u0308t, cipher attachment) in-line cipher machine.",
              "[13] In order to decrypt the transmitted messages, two tasks had to be performed.",
              "The first was \"wheel breaking\", which was the discovery of the cam patterns for all the wheels.",

              "[20] It was this task for which Colossus was initially designed.",
              "To discover the start position of the chi wheels for a message, Colossus compared two character streams, counting statistics from the evaluation of programmable Boolean functions.",
              "The two streams were the ciphertext, which was read at high speed from a paper tape, and the keystream, which was generated internally, in a simulation of the unknown German machine.",
              "After a succession of different Colossus runs to discover the likely chi-wheel settings, they were checked by examining the frequency distribution of the characters in the processed ciphertext.",
              "[21] Colossus produced these frequency counts.",
              "By using differencing and knowing that the psi wheels did not advance with each character, Tutte worked out that trying just two differenced bits (impulses) of the chi-stream against the differenced ciphertext would produce a statistic that was non-random.",
              "This became known as Tutte's \"1+2 break in\".",
              "[25] It involved calculating the following Boolean function: and counting the number of times it yielded \"false\" (zero).",
              "If this number exceeded a pre-defined threshold value known as the \"set total\", it was printed out.",
              "The cryptanalyst would examine the printout to determine which of the putative start positions was most likely to be the correct one for the chi-1 and chi-2 wheels.",
              "[26] This technique would then be applied to other pairs of, or single, impulses to determine the likely start position of all five chi wheels.",
              "From this, the de-chi (D) of a ciphertext could be obtained, from which the psi component could be removed by manual methods.",
              "[27] If the frequency distribution of characters in the de-chi version of the ciphertext was within certain bounds, \"wheel setting\" of the chi wheels was considered to have been achieved,[21] and the message settings and de-chi were passed to the \"Testery\".",
              "This was the section at Bletchley Park led by Major Ralph Tester where the bulk of the decrypting work was done by manual and linguistic methods.",
              "[28] Colossus could also derive the start position of the psi and motor wheels.",
              "The feasibility of utilizing this additional capability regularly was made possible in the last few months of the war when there were plenty of Colossi available and the number of Tunny messages had declined.",

              "[34] He was not impressed by the system of a key tape that had to be kept synchronised with the message tape and, on his own initiative, he designed an electronic machine which eliminated the need for the key tape by having an electronic analogue of the Lorenz (Tunny) machine.",
              "[35] He presented this design to Max Newman in February 1943, but the idea that the one to two thousand thermionic valves (vacuum tubes and thyratrons) proposed, could work together reliably, was greeted with great scepticism,[36] so more Robinsons were ordered from Dollis Hill.",
              "Flowers, however, knew from his pre-war work that most thermionic valve failures occurred as a result of the thermal stresses at power-up, so not powering a machine down reduced failure rates to very low levels.",
              "[37] Additionally, if the heaters were started at a low voltage then slowly brought up to full voltage, thermal stress was reduced.",
              "The valves themselves could be soldered-in to avoid problems with plug-in bases, which could be unreliable.",
              "[citation needed] Flowers persisted with the idea and obtained support from the Director of the Research Station, W Gordon Radley.",
              "[38] Flowers and his team of some fifty people in the switching group[39][40] spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building a machine that dispensed with the second tape of the Heath Robinson, by generating the wheel patterns electronically.",

              "Colossus is thus regarded[2] as the world's first programmable, electronic, digital computer, although it was programmed by switches and plugs and not by a stored program.",
              "[3] Colossus was designed by General Post Office (GPO) research telephone engineer Tommy Flowers[1] to solve a problem posed by mathematician Max Newman at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park.",

              "It was deduced that the machine had twelve wheels and used a Vernam ciphering technique on message characters in the standard 5-bit ITA2 telegraph code.",
              "It did this by combining the plaintext characters with a stream of key characters using the XOR Boolean function to produce the ciphertext.",
              "In August 1941, a blunder by German operators led to the transmission of two versions of the same message with identical machine settings.",
              "These were intercepted and worked on at Bletchley Park.",
              "First, John Tiltman, a very talented GC&CS cryptanalyst, derived a key stream of almost 4000 characters.",
              "[15] Then Bill Tutte, a newly arrived member of the Research Section, used this keystream to work out the logical structure of the Lorenz machine.",
              "He deduced that the twelve wheels consisted of two groups of five, which he named the \u03c7 (chi) and \u03c8 (psi) wheels, the remaining two he called \u03bc (mu) or \"motor\" wheels.",
              "The chi wheels stepped regularly with each letter that was encrypted, while the psi wheels stepped irregularly, under the control of the motor wheels.",
              "[16] With a sufficiently random keystream, a Vernam cipher removes the natural language property of a plaintext message of having an uneven frequency distribution of the different characters, to produce a uniform distribution in the ciphertext.",
              "The Tunny machine did this well.",
              "However, the cryptanalysts worked out that by examining the frequency distribution of the character-to-character changes in the ciphertext, instead of the plain characters, there was a departure from uniformity which provided a way into the system.",
              "This was achieved by \"differencing\" in which each bit or character was XOR-ed with its successor.",
              "[17] After Germany surrendered, allied forces captured a Tunny machine and discovered that it was the electromechanical Lorenz SZ (Schlu\u0308sselzusatzgera\u0308t, cipher attachment) in-line cipher machine.",
              "[13] In order to decrypt the transmitted messages, two tasks had to be performed.",
              "The first was \"wheel breaking\", which was the discovery of the cam patterns for all the wheels.",
              "These patterns were set up on the Lorenz machine and then used for a fixed period of time for a succession of different messages.",
              "Each transmission, which often contained more than one message, was enciphered with a different start position of the wheels.",
              "Alan Turing invented a method of wheel-breaking that became known as Turingery.",

              "Colossi 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 had a \"gadget\" to aid this process.",
              "[19] The second task was \"wheel setting\", which worked out the start positions of the wheels for a particular message and could only be attempted once the cam patterns were known.",
              "[20] It was this task for which Colossus was initially designed.",
              "To discover the start position of the chi wheels for a message, Colossus compared two character streams, counting statistics from the evaluation of programmable Boolean functions.",
              "The two streams were the ciphertext, which was read at high speed from a paper tape, and the keystream, which was generated internally, in a simulation of the unknown German machine.",
              "After a succession of different Colossus runs to discover the likely chi-wheel settings, they were checked by examining the frequency distribution of the characters in the processed ciphertext.",
              "[21] Colossus produced these frequency counts.",
              "By using differencing and knowing that the psi wheels did not advance with each character, Tutte worked out that trying just two differenced bits (impulses) of the chi-stream against the differenced ciphertext would produce a statistic that was non-random.",
              "This became known as Tutte's \"1+2 break in\".",
              "[25] It involved calculating the following Boolean function: and counting the number of times it yielded \"false\" (zero).",
              "If this number exceeded a pre-defined threshold value known as the \"set total\", it was printed out.",
              "The cryptanalyst would examine the printout to determine which of the putative start positions was most likely to be the correct one for the chi-1 and chi-2 wheels.",
              "[26] This technique would then be applied to other pairs of, or single, impulses to determine the likely start position of all five chi wheels.",
              "From this, the de-chi (D) of a ciphertext could be obtained, from which the psi component could be removed by manual methods.",
              "[27] If the frequency distribution of characters in the de-chi version of the ciphertext was within certain bounds, \"wheel setting\" of the chi wheels was considered to have been achieved,[21] and the message settings and de-chi were passed to the \"Testery\".",
              "This was the section at Bletchley Park led by Major Ralph Tester where the bulk of the decrypting work was done by manual and linguistic methods.",
              "[28] Colossus could also derive the start position of the psi and motor wheels.",
              "The feasibility of utilizing this additional capability regularly was made possible in the last few months of the war when there were plenty of Colossi available and the number of Tunny messages had declined.",
              "[citation needed] Colossus was developed for the \"Newmanry\",[29] the section headed by the mathematician Max Newman that was responsible for machine methods against the twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ40/42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine (code-named Tunny, for tunafish).",
              "The Colossus design arose out of a prior project that produced a counting machine dubbed \"Heath Robinson\".",
              "Although it proved the concept of machine analysis for this part of the process, it was initially unreliable.",
              "The electro-mechanical parts were relatively slow and it was difficult to synchronise two looped paper tapes, one containing the enciphered message, and the other representing part of the keystream of the Lorenz machine,[30] also the tapes tended to stretch when being read at up to 2000 characters per second.",
              "Tommy Flowers MBE[d] was a senior electrical engineer and Head of the Switching Group at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill.",
              "Prior to his work on Colossus, he had been involved with GC&CS at Bletchley Park from February 1941 in an attempt to improve the Bombes that were used in the cryptanalysis of the German Enigma cipher machine.",
              "[32] He was recommended to Max Newman by Alan Turing, who had been impressed by his work on the Bombes.",
              "[33] The main components of the Heath Robinson machine were as follows.",
              "Flowers had been brought in to design the Heath Robinson's combining unit.",
              "[34] He was not impressed by the system of a key tape that had to be kept synchronised with the message tape and, on his own initiative, he designed an electronic machine which eliminated the need for the key tape by having an electronic analogue of the Lorenz (Tunny) machine.",
              "[35] He presented this design to Max Newman in February 1943, but the idea that the one to two thousand thermionic valves (vacuum tubes and thyratrons) proposed, could work together reliably, was greeted with great scepticism,[36] so more Robinsons were ordered from Dollis Hill.",
              "Flowers, however, knew from his pre-war work that most thermionic valve failures occurred as a result of the thermal stresses at power-up, so not powering a machine down reduced failure rates to very low levels.",
              "[37] Additionally, if the heaters were started at a low voltage then slowly brought up to full voltage, thermal stress was reduced.",
              "The valves themselves could be soldered-in to avoid problems with plug-in bases, which could be unreliable.",
              "[citation needed] Flowers persisted with the idea and obtained support from the Director of the Research Station, W Gordon Radley.",
              "[38] Flowers and his team of some fifty people in the switching group[39][40] spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building a machine that dispensed with the second tape of the Heath Robinson, by generating the wheel patterns electronically.",

              "[52] The Mark 2 Colossi were both five times faster and were simpler to operate than the prototype.",
              "[e] Data input to Colossus was by photoelectric reading of a paper tape transcription of the enciphered intercepted message.",

              "It did this by combining the plaintext characters with a stream of key characters using the XOR Boolean function to produce the ciphertext.",
              "In August 1941, a blunder by German operators led to the transmission of two versions of the same message with identical machine settings.",

              "[15] Then Bill Tutte, a newly arrived member of the Research Section, used this keystream to work out the logical structure of the Lorenz machine.",
              "He deduced that the twelve wheels consisted of two groups of five, which he named the \u03c7 (chi) and \u03c8 (psi) wheels, the remaining two he called \u03bc (mu) or \"motor\" wheels.",
              "The chi wheels stepped regularly with each letter that was encrypted, while the psi wheels stepped irregularly, under the control of the motor wheels.",
              "[16] With a sufficiently random keystream, a Vernam cipher removes the natural language property of a plaintext message of having an uneven frequency distribution of the different characters, to produce a uniform distribution in the ciphertext.",
              "The Tunny machine did this well.",
              "However, the cryptanalysts worked out that by examining the frequency distribution of the character-to-character changes in the ciphertext, instead of the plain characters, there was a departure from uniformity which provided a way into the system.",
              "This was achieved by \"differencing\" in which each bit or character was XOR-ed with its successor.",
              "[17] After Germany surrendered, allied forces captured a Tunny machine and discovered that it was the electromechanical Lorenz SZ (Schlu\u0308sselzusatzgera\u0308t, cipher attachment) in-line cipher machine.",
              "[13] In order to decrypt the transmitted messages, two tasks had to be performed.",
              "The first was \"wheel breaking\", which was the discovery of the cam patterns for all the wheels.",
              "These patterns were set up on the Lorenz machine and then used for a fixed period of time for a succession of different messages.",
              "Each transmission, which often contained more than one message, was enciphered with a different start position of the wheels.",
              "Alan Turing invented a method of wheel-breaking that became known as Turingery.",

              "Colossi 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 had a \"gadget\" to aid this process.",
              "[19] The second task was \"wheel setting\", which worked out the start positions of the wheels for a particular message and could only be attempted once the cam patterns were known.",
              "[20] It was this task for which Colossus was initially designed.",
              "To discover the start position of the chi wheels for a message, Colossus compared two character streams, counting statistics from the evaluation of programmable Boolean functions.",
              "The two streams were the ciphertext, which was read at high speed from a paper tape, and the keystream, which was generated internally, in a simulation of the unknown German machine.",
              "After a succession of different Colossus runs to discover the likely chi-wheel settings, they were checked by examining the frequency distribution of the characters in the processed ciphertext.",
              "[21] Colossus produced these frequency counts.",
              "By using differencing and knowing that the psi wheels did not advance with each character, Tutte worked out that trying just two differenced bits (impulses) of the chi-stream against the differenced ciphertext would produce a statistic that was non-random.",
              "This became known as Tutte's \"1+2 break in\".",
              "[25] It involved calculating the following Boolean function: and counting the number of times it yielded \"false\" (zero).",
              "If this number exceeded a pre-defined threshold value known as the \"set total\", it was printed out.",
              "The cryptanalyst would examine the printout to determine which of the putative start positions was most likely to be the correct one for the chi-1 and chi-2 wheels.",
              "[26] This technique would then be applied to other pairs of, or single, impulses to determine the likely start position of all five chi wheels.",
              "From this, the de-chi (D) of a ciphertext could be obtained, from which the psi component could be removed by manual methods.",
              "[27] If the frequency distribution of characters in the de-chi version of the ciphertext was within certain bounds, \"wheel setting\" of the chi wheels was considered to have been achieved,[21] and the message settings and de-chi were passed to the \"Testery\".",
              "This was the section at Bletchley Park led by Major Ralph Tester where the bulk of the decrypting work was done by manual and linguistic methods.",
              "[28] Colossus could also derive the start position of the psi and motor wheels.",
              "The feasibility of utilizing this additional capability regularly was made possible in the last few months of the war when there were plenty of Colossi available and the number of Tunny messages had declined.",
              "[citation needed] Colossus was developed for the \"Newmanry\",[29] the section headed by the mathematician Max Newman that was responsible for machine methods against the twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ40/42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine (code-named Tunny, for tunafish).",
              "The Colossus design arose out of a prior project that produced a counting machine dubbed \"Heath Robinson\".",
              "Although it proved the concept of machine analysis for this part of the process, it was initially unreliable.",
              "The electro-mechanical parts were relatively slow and it was difficult to synchronise two looped paper tapes, one containing the enciphered message, and the other representing part of the keystream of the Lorenz machine,[30] also the tapes tended to stretch when being read at up to 2000 characters per second.",
              "Tommy Flowers MBE[d] was a senior electrical engineer and Head of the Switching Group at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill.",
              "Prior to his work on Colossus, he had been involved with GC&CS at Bletchley Park from February 1941 in an attempt to improve the Bombes that were used in the cryptanalysis of the German Enigma cipher machine.",
              "[32] He was recommended to Max Newman by Alan Turing, who had been impressed by his work on the Bombes.",
              "[33] The main components of the Heath Robinson machine were as follows.",
              "Flowers had been brought in to design the Heath Robinson's combining unit.",
              "[34] He was not impressed by the system of a key tape that had to be kept synchronised with the message tape and, on his own initiative, he designed an electronic machine which eliminated the need for the key tape by having an electronic analogue of the Lorenz (Tunny) machine.",
              "[35] He presented this design to Max Newman in February 1943, but the idea that the one to two thousand thermionic valves (vacuum tubes and thyratrons) proposed, could work together reliably, was greeted with great scepticism,[36] so more Robinsons were ordered from Dollis Hill.",
              "Flowers, however, knew from his pre-war work that most thermionic valve failures occurred as a result of the thermal stresses at power-up, so not powering a machine down reduced failure rates to very low levels.",
              "[37] Additionally, if the heaters were started at a low voltage then slowly brought up to full voltage, thermal stress was reduced.",
              "The valves themselves could be soldered-in to avoid problems with plug-in bases, which could be unreliable.",
              "[citation needed] Flowers persisted with the idea and obtained support from the Director of the Research Station, W Gordon Radley.",
              "[38] Flowers and his team of some fifty people in the switching group[39][40] spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building a machine that dispensed with the second tape of the Heath Robinson, by generating the wheel patterns electronically.",
