    "query": "Can you explain the process and technology behind the creation of 3D printing, and how has this innovation impacted various industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and design?",
    "response": "Sure, I can explain the process and technology behind 3D printing and how it has impacted various industries. 3D printing is a process that uses computer-aided design (CAD) to create three-dimensional objects by depositing layers of material on top of one another[^2^]. 3D printing is also called additive manufacturing (AM) because it adds material rather than removing it like traditional subtractive methods such as CNC milling[^1^]. 3D printing has been around for about four decades, invented in the early 1980s by Charles W. Hull[^2^].\n\nThere are different types of 3D printing technologies, but they all follow a similar process. First, a digital model of the object is created using CAD software or scanned from an existing object. Then, the model is sliced into thin layers by a software called a slicer, which also generates instructions for the printer on how to move and deposit the material. Next, the printer heats up the material (such as plastic, metal, ceramic, etc.) and extrudes it through a nozzle or solidifies it with a laser or light source, following the instructions from the slicer. The printer repeats this process for each layer until the object is complete. Finally, the object may need some post-processing such as removing supports, sanding, polishing, painting, etc. to improve its appearance and functionality[^4^].\n\n3D printing has impacted various industries by enabling faster prototyping, customization, complex geometries, reduced waste and lower costs. Some examples of 3D printing applications are:\n\n- Manufacturing: 3D printing can be used to create tools, molds, jigs, fixtures and end-use parts for various industries such as aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, etc. 3D printing can also enable mass customization and on-demand production of products that meet specific customer needs[^2^].\n- Healthcare: 3D printing can be used to create medical devices, implants, prosthetics, surgical guides and models for diagnosis, treatment and education. 3D printing can also enable personalized medicine and bioprinting of tissues and organs[^2^].\n- Design: 3D printing can be used to create artistic sculptures, jewelry, fashion accessories and models for architecture, engineering and entertainment. 3D printing can also enable creative expression and innovation by allowing designers to experiment with different shapes, colors and materials[^2^].\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand 3D printing better. Do you have any questions or comments?",

              "3D printing, in manufacturing, any of several processes for fabricating three-dimensional objects by layering two-dimensional cross sections sequentially, one on top of another.",
              "The process is analogous to the fusing of ink or toner onto paper in a printer (hence the term printing) but is actually the solidifying or binding of a liquid or powder at each spot in the horizontal cross section where solid material is desired.",
              "In the case of 3D printing, the layering is repeated hundreds or thousands of times until the entire object has been finished throughout its vertical dimension.",
              "Frequently, 3D printing is employed in quickly turning out plastic or metal prototypes during the design of new parts, though it also can be put to use in making final products for sale to customers.",
              "Objects made in 3D printing range from plastic figurines and mold patterns to steel machine parts and titanium surgical implants.",
              "An entire 3D printing apparatus can be enclosed in a cabinet roughly the size of a large kitchen stove or refrigerator.",
              "The term 3D printing originally designated a specific process patented as 3DP by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1993 and licensed to several manufacturers.",
              "Today the term is used as a generic label for a number of related processes.",
              "Central to all of them is computer-aided design, or CAD.",
              "Using CAD programs, engineers develop a three-dimensional computer model of the object to be built up.",
              "This model is translated into a series of two-dimensional \u201cslices\u201d of the object and then into instructions that tell the printer exactly where to solidify the starting material on each successive slice.",
              "In most processes the starting material is a fine plastic or metal powder.",
              "Typically, the powder is stored in cartridges or beds from which it is dispensed in small amounts and spread by a roller or blade in an extremely thin layer (commonly only the thickness of the powder grains, which can be as small as 20 micrometres, or 0.",
              "0008 inch) over the bed where the part is being built up.",
              "In MIT\u2019s 3DP process this layer is passed over by a device similar to the head of an ink-jet printer.",
              "An array of nozzles sprays a binding agent in a pattern determined by the computer program, then a fresh layer of powder is spread over the entire build-up area, and the process is repeated.",
              "At each repetition the build-up bed is lowered by precisely the thickness of the new layer of powder.",
              "When the process is complete, the built-up part, embedded in unconsolidated powder, is pulled out, cleaned, and sometimes put through some post-processing finishing steps.",
              "The original 3DP process made mainly rough mock-ups out of plastic, ceramic, and even plaster, but later variations employed metal powder as well and produced more-precise and more-durable parts.",
              "A related process is called selective laser sintering (SLS);",
              "here the nozzle head and liquid binder are replaced by precisely guided lasers that heat the powder so that it sinters, or partially melts and fuses, in the desired areas.",
              "Typically, SLS works with either plastic powder or a combined metal-binder powder;",
              "in the latter case the built-up object may have to be heated in a furnace for further solidification and then machined and polished.",
              "These post-processing steps can be minimized in direct metal laser sintering (DMLS), in which a high-power laser fuses a fine metal powder into a more-solid and finished part without the use of binder material.",
              "Yet another variation is electron beam melting (EBM);",
              "here the laser apparatus is replaced by an electron gun, which focuses a powerful electrically charged beam onto the powder under vacuum conditions.",
              "The most-advanced DMLS and EBM processes can make final products of advanced steel, titanium, and cobalt-chromium alloys.",
              "Many other processes work on the building-up principle of 3DP, SLS, DMLS, and EBM.",
              "Some use nozzle arrangements to direct the starting material (either powder or liquid) only to the designated build-up areas, so that the object is not immersed in a bed of the material.",
              "On the other hand, in a process known as stereolithography (SLA), a thin layer of polymer liquid rather than powder is spread over the build area, and the designated part areas are consolidated by an ultraviolet laser beam.",
              "The built-up plastic part is retrieved and put through post-processing steps.",
              "All 3D printing processes are so-called additive manufacturing, or additive fabrication, processes\u2014ones that build up objects sequentially, as opposed to casting or molding them in a single step (a consolidation process) or cutting and machining them out of a solid block (a subtractive process).",
              "As such, they are considered to have several advantages over traditional fabrication, chief among them being an absence of the expensive tooling used in foundry and milling processes;",
              "the ability to produce complicated, customized parts on short notice;",
              "and the generating of less waste.",
              "On the other hand, they also have several disadvantages;",
              "these include low production rates, less precision and surface polish than machined parts, a relatively limited range of materials that can be processed, and severe limitations on the size of parts that can be made inexpensively and without distortion.",
              "For this reason, the principal market of 3D printing is in so-called rapid prototyping\u2014that is, the quick production of parts that eventually will be mass-produced in traditional manufacturing processes.",
              "Nevertheless, commercial 3D printers continue to improve their processes and make inroads into markets for final products, and researchers continue to experiment with 3D printing, producing objects as disparate as automobile bodies, concrete blocks, and edible food products.",
              "The term 3D bioprinting is used to describe the application of 3D printing concepts to the production of biological entities, such as tissues and organs.",
              "Bioprinting is based largely on existing printing technologies, such as ink-jet or laser printing, but makes use of \u201cbioink\u201d (suspensions of living cells and cell growth medium), which may be prepared in micropipettes or similar tools that serve as printer cartridges.",
              "Printing is then controlled via computer, with cells being deposited in specific patterns onto culture plates or similar sterile surfaces.",
              "Valve-based printing, which enables fine control over cell deposition and improved preservation of cell viability, has been used to print human embryonic stem cells in preprogrammed patterns that facilitate the cells\u2019 aggregation into spheroid structures.",
              "Such human tissue models generated through 3D bioprinting are of particular use in the field of regenerative medicine."

              "[1][2] It can be done in a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified under computer control,[3] with the material being added together (such as plastics, liquids or powder grains being fused), typically layer by layer.",
              "In the 1980s, 3D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes, and a more appropriate term for it at the time was rapid prototyping.",
              "[4] As of 2019[update], the precision, repeatability, and material range of 3D printing have increased to the point that some 3D printing processes are considered viable as an industrial-production technology, whereby the term additive manufacturing can be used synonymously with 3D printing.",

              "3D printing is an additive process whereby layers of material are built up to create a 3D part.",
              "This is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing processes, where a final design is cut from a larger block of material.",
              "As a result, 3D printing creates less material wastage.",
              "This article is one of a series of TWI frequently asked questions (FAQs).",

              "The earliest 3D printing manufacturing equipment was developed by Hideo Kodama of the Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute, when he invented two additive methods for fabricating 3D models.",
              "Building on Ralf Baker's work in the 1920s for making decorative articles (patent US423647A), Hideo Kodama's early work in laser cured resin rapid prototyping was completed in 1981.",
              "His invention was expanded upon over the next three decades, with the introduction of stereolithography in 1984.",
              "Chuck Hull of 3D Systems invented the first 3D printer in 1987, which used the stereolithography process.",
              "This was followed by developments such as selective laser sintering and selective laser melting, among others.",
              "Other expensive 3D printing systems were developed in the 1990s-2000s, although the cost of these dropped dramatically when the patents expired in 2009, opening up the technology for more users.",
              "There are three broad types of 3D printing technology;",
              "sintering, melting, and stereolithography.",
              "3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, processes have been categorised into seven groups by ISO/ASTM 52900 additive manufacturing - general principles - terminology.",
              "All forms of 3D printing fall into one of the following types: Binder jetting deposits a thin layer of powered material, for example metal, polymer sand or ceramic, onto the build platform, after which drops of adhesive are deposited by a print head to bind the particles together.",
              "This builds the part layer by layer and once this is complete post processing may be necessary to finish the build.",
              "As examples of post processing, metal parts may be thermally sintered or infiltrated with a low melting point metal such as bronze, while full-colour polymer or ceramic parts may be saturated with cyanoacrylate adhesive.",
              "Binder jetting can be used for a variety of applications including 3D metal printing, full colour prototypes and large scale ceramic moulds.",
              "Direct energy depositioning uses focussed thermal energy such as an electric arc, laser or electron beam to fuse wire or powder feedstock as it is deposited.",
              "The process is traversed horizontally to build a layer, and layers are stacked vertically to create a part.",
              "This process can be used with a variety of materials, including metals, ceramics and polymers.",
              "Material extrusion or fused deposition modelling (FDM) uses a spool of filament which is fed to an extrusion head with a heated nozzle.",
              "The extrusion head heats, softens and lays down the heated material at set locations, where it cools to create a layer of material, the build platform then moves down ready for the next layer.",
              "This process is cost-effective and has short lead times but also has a low dimensional accuracy and often requires post processing to create a smooth finish.",
              "This process also tends to create anisotropic parts, meaning that they are weaker in one direction and therefore unsuitable for critical applications.",
              "Material jetting works in a similar manner to inkjet printing except, rather than laying down ink on a page, this process deposits layers of liquid material from one or more print heads.",
              "The layers are then cured before the process begins again for the next layer.",
              "Material jetting requires the use of support structures but these can be made from a water-soluble material that can be washed away once the build is complete.",
              "A precise process, material jetting is one of the most expensive 3D printing methods, and the parts tend to be brittle and will degrade over time.",
              "However, this process allows for the creation of full-colour parts in a variety of materials.",
              "Powder bed fusion (PBF) is a process in which thermal energy (such as a laser or electron beam) selectively fuses areas of a powder bed to form layer, and layers are built upon each other to create a part.",
              "One thing to note is that PBF covers both sintering and melting processes.",
              "The basic method of operation of all powder bed systems is the same: a recoating blade or roller deposits a thin layer of the powder onto the build platform, the powder bed surface is then scanned with a heat source which selectively heats the particles to bind them together.",
              "Once a layer or cross-section has been scanned by the heat source, the platform moves down to allow the process to begin again on the next layer.",
              "The final result is a volume containing one or more fused parts surrounded by unaffected powder.",
              "When the build is complete, the bed is fully raised to allow the parts to be removed from the unaffected powder and any required post processing to begin.",
              "Selective laser sintering (SLS) is often used for manufacture of polymer parts and is good for prototypes or functional parts due to the properties produced, while the lack of support structures (the powder bed acts as a support) allows for the creation of pieces with complex geometries.",
              "The parts produced may have a grainy surface and inner porosity, meaning there is often a need for post processing.",
              "Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS), selective laser melting (SLM) and electron beam powder bed fusion (EBPBF) are similar to SLS, except these processes create parts from metal, using a laser to bond powder particles together layer-by-layer.",
              "While SLM fully melts the metal particles, DMLS only heats them to the point of fusion whereby they join on a molecular level.",
              "Both SLM and DMLS require support structures due to the high heat inputs required by the process.",
              "These support structures are then removed in post processing ether manually or via CNC machining.",
              "Finally, the parts may be thermally treated to remove residual stresses.",
              "Both DMLS and SLM produce parts with excellent physical properties - often stronger than the conventional metal itself, and good surface finishes.",
              "They can be used with metal superalloys and sometimes ceramics which are difficult to process by other means.",
              "However, these processes can be expensive and the size of the produced parts is limited by the volume of the 3D printing system used.",
              "Sheet lamination can be split into two different technologies, laminated object manufacturing (LOM) and ultrasonic additive manufacturing (UAM).",
              "LOM uses alternate layers of material and adhesive to create items with visual and aesthetic appeal, while UAM joins thin sheets of metal via ultrasonic welding.",
              "UAM is a low temperature, low energy process that can be used with aluminium, stainless steel and titanium.",
              "VAT photopolymerization can be broken down into two techniques;",
              "stereolithography (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP).",
              "These processes both create parts layer-by-layer through the use of a light to selectively cure liquid resin in a vat.",
              "SLA uses a single point laser or UV source for the curing process, while DLP flashes a single image of each full layer onto the surface of the vat.",
              "Parts need to be cleaned of excess resin after printing and then exposed to a light source to improve the strength of the pieces.",
              "Any support structures will also need to be removed and additional post-processing can be used to create a higher quality finish.",
              "Ideal for parts with a high level of dimensional accuracy, these processes can create intricate details with a smooth finish, making them perfect for prototype production.",
              "However, as the parts are more brittle than fused deposition modelling (FDM) they are less suited to functional prototypes.",
              "Also, these parts are not suitable for outdoor use as the colour and mechanical properties may degrade when exposed to UV light from the sun.",
              "The required support structures can also leave blemishes that need post processing to remove.",
              "The printing time depends on a number of factors, including the size of the part and the settings used for printing.",
              "The quality of the finished part is also important when determining printing time as higher quality items take longer to produce.",
              "3D printing can take anything from a few minutes to several hours or days - speed, resolution and the volume of material are all important factors here.",
              "The advantages of 3D printing include: The disadvantages of 3D printing include: An STL file is a simple, portable format used by computer aided design (CAD) systems to define the solid geometry for 3D printable parts.",
              "An STL file provides the input information for 3D printing by modelling the surfaces of the object as triangles that share edges and vertices with other neighbouring triangles for the build platform.",
              "The resolution of the STL file impacts the quality of the 3D printed parts - if the file resolution is too high the triangle may overlap, if it is too low the model will have gaps, making it unprintable.",
              "Many 3D printers require an STL file to print from, however these files can be created in most CAD programs. Due to the versatility of the process, 3D printing has applications across a range of industries, for example: 3D printing is used across the aerospace (and astrospace) industry due to the ability to create light, yet geometrically complex parts, such as blisks.",
              "Rather than building a part from several components, 3D printing allows for an item to be created as one whole component, reducing lead times and material wastage.",
              "The automotive industry has embraced 3D printing due to the inherent weight and cost reductions.",
              "It also allows for rapid prototyping of new or bespoke parts for test or small-scale manufacture.",
              "So, for example, if a particular part is no longer available, it can be produced as part of a small, bespoke run, including the manufacture of spare parts.",
              "Alternatively, items or fixtures can be printed overnight and are ready for testing ahead of a larger manufacturing run.",
              "The medical sector has found uses for 3D printing in the creation of made-to-measure implants and devices.",
              "For example, hearing aids can be created quickly from a digital file that is matched to a scan of the patient's body.",
              "3D printing can also dramatically reduce costs and production times.",
              "The rail industry has found a number of applications for 3D printing, including the creation of customised parts, such as arm rests for drivers and housing covers for train couplings.",
              "Bespoke parts are just one application for the rail industry, which has also used the process to repair worn rails.",
              "The speed of manufacture, design freedom, and ease of design customisation make 3D printing perfectly suited to the robotics industry.",

              "As 3D printing technology continues to improve it could democratise the manufacture of goods.",
              "With printers becoming faster, they will be able to work on larger scale production projects, while lowering the cost of 3D printing will help its use spread outside of industrial uses and into homes, schools and other settings.",
              "Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is commonly deemed to be the most flexible material available to the 3D printing industry.",

              "Resin printers are generally faster, much more accurate than FDM printers, and create parts with far smoother surface finishes and crisper edges.",
              "Though stats may show similar layer heights, or Z-resolutions, between FDM and resin printers, resin parts are noticeably better quality, with more precise X and Y resolutions.",
              "For this reason, resin printers are often used to make wax molds for 3D printed jewelry casting, and also for hearing aids and dental uses.",
              "The resins however are more expensive, the printers are more complex, and some resins can be irritant \u2014 so more stringent safety precautions should be taken.",
              "You\u2019re generally more restricted with the types of materials you can use than with FDM printing, and parts will degrade if left out in the sun.",
              "Brand new beginners to 3D printing would therefore be better off going with an FDM printer to learn the ropes, before diving into the deeper end with a resin printer.",

              "Additive manufacturing is the process of creating an object by building it one layer at a time.",
              "It is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing, in which an object is created by cutting away at a solid block of material until the final product is complete.",
              "Technically, additive manufacturing can refer to any process where a product is created by building something up, such as molding, but it typically refers to 3-D printing.",
              "Additive manufacturing was first used to develop prototypes in the 1980s \u2014 these objects were not usually functional.",
              "This process was known as rapid prototyping because it allowed people to create a scale model of the final object quickly, without the typical setup process and costs involved in creating a prototype.",
              "As additive manufacturing improved, its uses expanded to rapid tooling, which was used to create molds for final products.",
              "By the early 2000s, additive manufacturing was being used to create functional products.",
              "More recently, companies like Boeing and General Electric have begun using additive manufacturing as integral parts of their business processes.",
              "To create an object using additive manufacturing, someone must first create a design.",
              "This is typically done using computer aided design, or CAD, software, or by taking a scan of the object someone wants to print.",
              "Software then translates the design into a layer by layer framework for the additive manufacturing machine to follow.",
              "This is sent to the 3-D printer, which begins creating the object immediately.",
              "\u201cYou go directly from digital to physical, which is quite a change,\u201d said MIT Sloan senior lecturer Thomas Roemer, who is the executive director of MIT\u2019s Leaders for Global Operations program.",

              "\u201d Credit: Mimi Phan The actual process of additive manufacturing can be done in a number of ways, all of which can take several hours to several days, depending on the object\u2019s size.",
              "One common method uses a nozzle to lay successive layers of material on top of each other until the final product is complete.",
              "Another process uses powders, typically made from metal.",
              "This works by \u201cfilling a bed with powder, and melting the parts of the powder that you want to form a solid part layer by layer.",
              "After you do this, all the loose powder falls away from your final part,\u201d Kalidindi said.",
              "This is usually done using lasers or electron beams, but another technique involves using a polymer to adhere layers of powder together.",
              "The part is then placed in a furnace where the plastic melts away and the powders sinter together, forming the final part.",
              "Additive manufacturing has some distinct benefits.",
              "With traditional manufacturing, the entire supply chain can take months and require an investment \u2014 sometimes millions or billions of dollars \u2014 that can only be recouped by high-volume production.",
              "With additive manufacturing, much of the supply chain\u2019s intermediate steps are removed.",
              "\u201cThe speed at which you can get to a single part is much faster,\u201d said Roemer, since people can send a design directly from their computer to the 3-D printer.",
              "Manufacturing something additively also makes it possible to create objects with functionally-graded materials \u2014 meaning they can have different materials on the inside and outside.",
              "\u201cImagine you want something that has high conductivity, but also is abrasion resistant,\u201d said Roemer.",
              "\u201cOn the outside, you have the abrasion-resistant materials, like ceramics, and on the inside, you have the conductive materials, like metals.",
              "Creating something like that is quite difficult to do with conventional manufacturing.",
              "\u201dRoemer believes, though, that the two biggest advantages to additive manufacturing are creating complex geometries and producing small lot sizes.",

              "You can create 3-D entities that are much more complex and have different material properties,\u201d said Roemer.",
              "With subtractive manufacturing, some objects are too small or have too awkward an angle to subtract materials in the desired way.",
              "Additive manufacturing eliminates that barrier.",
              "This also means that manufacturers can eliminate weight from an object.",
              "This is particular important in the aerospace and automobile industries, where weight can affect the functionality of a final product.",
              "Additive manufacturing also makes it easier to create small amounts of something.",
              "With traditional manufacturing, setup costs mean producing small lots is not cost effective.",
              "But with additive manufacturing, setup costs are mostly eliminated, so creating just a handful of objects becomes more reasonable.",
              "This makes customizing products, like prosthetics or implants, easier, and could result in better outcomes for patients.",
              "Hearing aids, which are customized for each person, are almost entirely additively manufactured.",
              "Additive manufacturing has its share of challenges, too.",
              "Additive manufacturing machines are expensive, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
              "Using them to create large lot sizes takes longer than with traditional manufacturing.",
              "And many objects that are additively manufactured require some post-processing to clean and smooth out rough edges, among other things.",
              "One of the biggest challenges, though, according to Kalidindi, \u201cis making sure that your final part has good properties.",
              "From a material science perspective, that is probably the biggest challenge of additive manufacturing.",
              "How do you reduce the number of defects that could form?",
              "\u201d Kalidindi, who researches the chemistry of metal powders, says the metal, its properties, and the process used to create the object can all have an effect.",
              "\u201cIf powders don\u2019t quite sinter together, it forms defects that lead to failure,\u201d Kalidindi said.",
              "\u201cYou can get residual stress based on how you process your metal, and there can be some internal strain on the material that can lead to the part wanting to naturally bend.",
              "\u201d Defects in additively manufactured objects is not unique to metals.",
              "Given the relative newness of additive manufacturing, researchers are still trying to understand the many different aspects of it, how the materials work together, and how to decrease the likelihood of defects in final parts.",
              "Despite all the advantages of additive manufacturing, \u201cI don\u2019t see traditional manufacturing being replaced,\u201d said Roemer.",
              "That is because, aside from specific use cases, traditional manufacturing is still faster and less expensive.",
              "This is especially true when creating granular products.",
              "The smaller the layer size, the slower the manufacturing.",
              "While the initial units are cheaper and faster when made with additive manufacturing, in the long run, printing out every unit would take longer.",
              "For some companies, though, using additive manufacturing is worth it.",
              "Right now, \u201cwhenever we see small lot sizes and high demand for functionality, that\u2019s the sweet spot for additive manufacturing,\u201d Roemer said.",
              "Roemer believes there is a case to be made for a hybrid model of manufacturing.",
              "In this situation, the initial products would be additively manufactured, but traditional manufacturing would take over once the lot sizes increased to a certain point.",
              "That would continue while the product was in high demand, but instead of creating large amounts of excess inventory, companies could revert back to additive manufacturing to meet demand as needed once it slowed.",
              "This end of product-life use of additive manufacturing could be useful even for companies that have never used the technology before, said Roemer.",
              "Companies like Caterpillar, which ships replacement parts within 24 hours, could have 3-D printers set up at strategic locations to print and deliver those parts instead of keeping inventory stocked at those locations.",
              "Mercedes, which says it will always supply spare parts for any car, could 3-D print the parts for a 1928 SSK for significantly less than it would cost to produce them traditionally.",
              "There are a few industries where 3-D printing parts or products makes more sense than manufacturing them traditionally.",
              "Aerospace, racecars, and the medical field are all industries where additive manufacturing can make inroads.",
              "That is because they are all industries where function is more important than price.",
              "Or where small lot sizes or customization makes it less expensive to manufacture an object additively than traditionally.",
              "Many other businesses may have uses for additive manufacturing.",
              "According to Roemer, without the setup costs of creating a new product, entrepreneurs can quickly additively manufacture objects or parts to see if they work as needed.",
              "If they don\u2019t, they can iterate and try again, all using an additive manufacturing machine, until they find a product that does.",
              "They may not even need their own machine to do this \u2014 companies like UPS have set up 3-D printing machines at various locations that can be used by anyone.",
              "Established businesses can also evaluate whether additive manufacturing can be part of their business models.",
              "If a company produces products that are specialized or would benefit from the ability to have complex geometries, it will have to determine whether additive manufacturing would improve its products.",
              "Companies like Adidas are using additive manufacturing to create sneaker soles at speeds that may make it suitable for mass customization.",
              "With typical additive manufacturing, machines build a 3-D object that is fixed.",
              "4-D printing creates 3-D objects that have the ability to change or transform over time, without human interaction.",
              "There are several applications for 4-D printing.",
              "One is extreme environments, such as space, where self-configuring materials would be useful.",
              "Another is biomaterials, that would continue to evolve over time.",
              "Other uses of additive manufacturing will continue to present themselves \u2014 some companies are already experimenting with additive manufacturing to make everything from houses to food \u2014 especially as costs come down and the actual manufacturing speeds up.",

              "AM can take anything from a few minutes to several hours or days - speed, resolution and the volume of the material are all important factors here.",
              "There are a variety of materials used for AM, these include biochemicals, ceramics, metals and thermoplastics.",
              "Biochemicals used in AM include silicon, calcium phosphate and zinc while bio-inks fabricated from stem cells are also being explored.",
              "These materials are generally used for healthcare applications.",
              "A range of ceramics are used in AM, including alumina, tricalcium phosphate and zirconia as well as powdered glass which can be baked together with adhesives to create new types of glass product.",
              "A wide variety of metals and metal alloys are used for additive manufacturing, including gold and silver, stainless steels and titanium amongst others.",
              "These can be made to create a variety of different metal parts, ranging from jewellery to aerospace components.",
              "Thermoplastic polymers are the most commonly used of AM materials and include a variety of types with their own advantages and applications.",
              "These include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC) as well as water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) which can provide temporary support before being dissolved.",
              "AM is used to create a wide range of products across a growing number of industries, including: AM is particularly suited to aerospace applications due to its weight saving capability and ability to produce complex geometric parts such as blisks.",
              "A variety of materials are widely additive manufactured for the automotive industry as they can be rapidly prototyped while offering weight and cost reductions.",
              "The medical sector is finding an increasing number of applications for additively manufactured parts, especially for bespoke custom-fitted implants and devices.",
              "Visit our press release section to find out how TWI is helping industry with additive manufacturing.",
              "See TWI additive news Find out about TWI's case studies in AM and how we have helped our members with this technology over the years.",
              "See TWI additive insights Although the concept had been around since the 1940s, Hideo Kodama of the Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute developed the earliest 3D printing manufacturing equipment in 1980, when he invented two additive methods for fabricating 3D models.",
              "The concept of additive manufacturing dates back to 1945 and the publication of Murray Leinster\u2019s short story, \u2018Things Pass By.",
              "\u2019 However, this early idea was not really developed until 1971 when Johannes F Gottwald patented the Liquid Metal Recorder, a continuous inkjet metal material device that could form a removable metal fabrication on a reusable surface.",
              "This was developed further with Hideo Kodama\u2019s invention of 3D printing equipment in 1980, although even then the funding and interest for the technology was limited.",
              "Further patents quickly followed, including for stereolithography process and Bill Masters\u2019 Computer Automated Manufacturing Process and System in 1984.",
              "The oldest fully realised additive manufacturing technique is stereolithography, which was developed in 1987 by 3D Systems. The system works with a lithograph printer that uses UV light and a laser to solidify thin layers of liquid polymer to create three-dimensional objects.",
              "3D printing is a synonym for additive manufacturing, they are two terms for the same process which both mean the same thing.",
              "However, \u2018additive manufacturing\u2019 is generally the term used by industry.",
              "Yes, lots of different companies across a range of industries use additive manufacturing, including the medical industry, aerospace and more.",
              "Additive manufacturing is particularly useful for making complex or bespoke parts \u2013 whether for a new application or to replace an old part that may no longer be available.",
              "Additive manufacturing is different from traditional manufacturing as it allows a part to be built layer-by-layer, whereas traditional manufacturing often requires a part to be made by joining separate components or by machining away unwanted material to produce the part.",
              "Additive manufacturing is unlikely to fully replace conventional manufacturing due to the time taken to manufacture parts.",
              "Conventional manufacturing is still preferable for simple and easy to produce items, but additive manufacturing is becoming the chosen method for manufacturing smaller batches of more complex parts.",
              "AM is important for the creation of lighter, complex designs that may be too difficult or expensive to produce using traditional manufacturing techniques.",
              "Removing the need for moulds, milling or machining, AM offers a range of advantages for both prototyping and production.",
              "It may be something of a stretch to say that AM will \u2018change the world,\u2019 but it is already having a positive impact.",
              "It allows for the creation of complex design with less material wastage when compared to parts that require machining, as well as allowing for the creation of lighter structures.",
              "When these lighter structures are applied to aerospace or automotive applications, for example, they lead to fuel savings and the related environmental (and financial) benefits.",
              "AM also allows for the replacement of parts that may otherwise be impossible to replace, meaning that machines can be repaired rather than scrapped.",
              "In addition to these benefits, AM has also seen a level of democratisation in manufacturing, as more people set up domestic 3D printing stations to produce their own bespoke items. For more information about AM please email: contactus@twi.",

              "\u201d Instead, we had to wait several more years for the birth of 3D printing.",
              "But who invented 3D printing?",
              "Three years later in 1984, three French engineers named Alain Le Me\u0301haute\u0301, Olivier de Witte, and Jean Claude Andre\u0301 filed a patent for the Stereolithography process.",
              "They were to pioneer a new manufacturing process that was to revolutionize manufacturing!",
              "But it wasn\u2019t to be.",

              "His process used ultraviolet light to cure photopolymers.",
              "Since filing and obtaining the patents by 1986, Chuck Hull formed 3D Systems and released the first ever 3D printer, the SLA-1, in 1987.",
              "3D printing was born.",
              "It is therefore arguable that either Chuck Hull or Dr Kodama invented 3D printing, though Chuck Hull is credited far more and rightfully so.",
              "Ideas are easy, executing them is the hard part.",
              "Stereolithography had competition in the 3D printing space however, with rival processes in development.",
              "In 1988, Carl Deckard at the University of Texas filed a patent for Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology.",
              "Instead of using a UV light, SLS used a laser to trace and solidify layers of powder polymers.",
              "This innovative new technology was then leased to DTM Inc to use.",
              "Then it became a three-horse race.",
              "Scott Crump co-founded Stratasys in 1989 and filed the patent for Fused Deposition Modeling, probably the most well-known 3D printing technology today.",
              "3D Systems and Chuck Hull may have had a head start, but competitors were hot on his heels.",
              "This competition was further exacerbated by the founding of EOS in 1989 in Germany by Dr Hans Langer.",

              "I knew there was no other way to increase the speed of 3D printing than increase the layer height, but if you increase layer height then surface quality will suffer.",
              "\u201cSo then I came up with the idea that I call Contour Crafting, in 1994.",

              "Additionally, the following year saw Objet Geometries established in 1998 in Israel, who would introduce their PolyJet 3D printing technology to the world.",
              "Stepping away from the purely commercial side of 3D printing, 1999 saw the first extraordinary achievement by 3D printing in the medical industry.",
              "Scientists at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine managed to 3D bioprint synthetic scaffolds of a human bladder.",
              "They then coated these scaffolds with cells from the patient\u2019s tissue before this newly generated tissue was implanted into the patient.",
              "Since this tissue was made from the patient\u2019s own cells, there was a low-to-zero risk of the body rejecting it, marking an important win for 3D bioprinting.",

              "\u201cThey [3D printers] were fabulously expensive: the cheapest one when I started the RepRap project cost around \u00a340,000, and in fact that was one of the ones we bought at the university.",
              "When I looked at how it worked, it seemed it would be possible to make such a machine at a considerably reduced price, but my primary aim was to produce a machine that could produce most of its parts.",
              "And so, that was the way the project went.",
              "\u201d \u2014 Dr Bowyer, in an interview with 3DSourced.",
              "The movement, named RepRap (short for \u2018replicating rapid prototyper\u2019), started off as an initiative within the University of Bath, but later gained popularity worldwide.",
              "The project was open source and focused on the spreading of low-cost 3D printing worldwide, leading to its democratization.",
              "Interest in these low cost 3D printers skyrocketed as people edited and tinkered with his designs.",
              "ZCorp were intent on making 2005 their year too however, announcing their Spectrum Z510 3D printer.",
              "This wasn\u2019t your average yearly upgrade with marginally improved specs, but a voyage into the unknown which shattered perceived limitations of 3D printing.",
              "The Z510 could not only print in color, but was the first 3D printer that could print in color in HD.",
              "Also in 2005, ExOne was established as a standalone company from the Extrude Hone Corporation.",
              "ExOne would go on to become a leader in Binder Jetting 3D printing, capable of 3D printing objects in metal as well as sandstone.",
              "Binder Jetting can create full-color sandstone objects, as well as metal parts with very complex geometries.",
              "Whilst corporations were breaking records, Dr.",
              "Adrian Bowyer and his RepRap movement were also hard at work with more wholesome goals.",
              "The 2008 release of the \u2018Darwin\u2019 RepRap 3D printer was huge \u2013 the printer could self-replicate, and people could now easily and cheaply 3D print at home if they had moderate technological and technical knowledge.",
              "Dr Bowyer talking about Vik Olliver using the first RepRap to ever print a part of itself: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very reliable then!",

              "Another major event in 2008 was the first 3D printed prosthetic.",
              "This extraordinary achievement was compounded by the fact that this prosthetic leg did not need to be assembled, it was 3D printed to function immediately.",
              "This opened many people\u2019s eyes to how 3D printing could save time and labor, as fully-assembled objects could be printed from scratch.",
              "The one-off nature of 3D printing also suggested that it would be the perfect method to create customized prosthetics and medical implants based on individual patients\u2019 needs.",
              "Instead of the usual several-month lead times for prosthetics, 3D scanners could scan a patients\u2019 arm or leg, and almost immediately begin to create a prosthetic that fit them perfectly.",

              "This wasn\u2019t any material however, but a material that was bio-compatible.",
              "This opened the door for 3D bioprinting to become far more widely available in the near future.",
              "The years up to the start of 2009 were an adolescence for 3D printing.",
              "New technologies became available such as Electron Beam Melting and Binder Jetting, medical advances were made, and the RepRap movement became viable.",

              "The printer does this over and over, building up layers of plastic until it forms a 3D part.",
              "Every object printed on a 3D printer starts with a 3D model.",
              "These are usually made in a CAD program designed for working on real-world 3D models, like TinkerCAD, Fusion360, or Sketchup.",

              "One benefit of a 3D printer is that it can print nearly anything.",
              "Some models are so complex that they're impossible to make with traditional manufacturing techniques like molding or CNC routing, and that's where 3D printers take an obvious lead.",
              "However, they're not just used for making fancy geometric shapes, as it's usually much cheaper for a large factory's R&D department to print a single model in plastic rather than rigging up the whole factory to make the actual part.",
              "This is called prototyping, making a rough draft to help test the final copy without wasting valuable time and materials.",
              "Since a printer doesn't understand how to take a complex 3D mesh and turn it into a printed model, the 3D model must be decoded into information that the printer can understand.",
              "This process is called slicing since it takes scans of each layer of the model and tells the printer how it should move the print head to create each layer in turn.",
              "It's done with the aid of a slicer, a program that handles all of this for you, like CraftWare or Astroprint.",
              "The slicer will handle the \"fill\" of the model, creating a lattice structure inside a solid model to give it extra stability.",
              "This is one area where 3D printers shine---they can print very strong materials with really low densities, by strategically creating pockets of air inside the model and making it much lighter.",
              "Another thing the slicer handles is support columns.",
              "Since the printer can't lay down plastic on thin air, support columns must be created to allow the printer to bridge the gap.",
              "These are removable but are used in the printing process to ensure it doesn't collapse.",
              "Once the slicer is done, it will send the data over to the 3D printer to start the printing process.",
              "Once the printer starts, you'll notice the main problem with 3D printing today: it's horrendously slow.",
              "While a 2D printer can print a whole book in a couple of minutes, most 3D prints will take several hours, if not days, to finish printing.",
              "And if you messed up the settings, misconfigured the slicer, or just bumped into it a bit, you could lose the whole print.",
              "There are some faster technologies making splashes in the industry, like the Carbon M1, which uses lasers shot into a bed of liquid and pulls the print up out of it, speeding the process up significantly.",
              "But these kinds of printers are many times more complicated, much more expensive, and only work with plastic so far.",

              "Unless your print is optimized for supportless 3D printing, you\u2019ll probably be printing with support structures.",
              "These are usually easy to snap off, but even well designed supports will leave behind imperfections where they were once attached.",
              "To smooth these areas, it is recommended to post-process the entire part by any number of methods outlined below.",
              "With dual extrusion you can print soluble support structures that disintegrate in water and leave no trace on your part.",
              "They\u2019re especially useful when post-processing isn\u2019t otherwise necessary.",
              "SUBTRACTIVE The most common post-processing category, subtractive post-processing is the act of removing material from the part surface to make it more uniform and smoother.",
              "ADDITIVE Additive post-processing puts additional material directly onto printed parts.",
              "Additive techniques are highly efficient for smoothing parts while adding strength and other mechanical properties.",
              "PROPERTY CHANGING Neither removing nor adding material, property changing post-processing redistributes molecules of a 3D print.",
              "Smoother and stronger parts are achieved with thermal and chemical treatments.",
              "Probably the most common post-processing category, subtractive post-processing is the act of removing some of your part\u2019s material.",
              "Usually this is in the form of sanding or polishing a part, but there are a variety of other methods that includes tumbling, milling, abrasive blasting, and chemical abrasive dipping.",
              "Both sanding and polishing techniques remove surface layers by rubbing it with an abrasive material.",
              "Sanding requires coarser grit sandpaper and sanding tools, while polishing may use finer sandpaper, steel wool, polishing paste, or cloth.",
              "Sanding removes larger blemishes such as support remnants or print irregularities and reduces the visibility of print layers.",
              "The sanding process will leave a gritty, although more uniform surface texture, and very course sandpaper will leave surface scratches.",
              "Polishing the part after sanding will produce an even smoother surface.",
              "Simplicity and affordability make sanding and polishing the most common methods of post-processing, but both require labor that is time consuming for larger parts and batches.",
              "These methods may not be suited for parts with hard to reach cavities.",
              "A tumbling machine consists of a vibrating vat containing lubricating fluid and abrasive media, which are specialized stones that wear objects down according to their size, shape, and hardness as they tumble together.",
              "A 3D printed part is simply placed into the vat of tumbling abrasive media for a specific length of time.",
              "Some expertise is required to pair parts with the correct abrasive media and processing time, but when done correctly it is very effective at producing uniform finishes.",
              "Tumbling is a largely automated subtractive method that can post-process multiple parts simultaneously, which is useful for smoothing batches of parts.",
              "Tumbling vats come in a range of sizes so larger parts can also be processed.",
              "Since the abrasive media is constantly in contact with the part, larger pieces do not require longer processing time, but only larger machines with the adequate amount of abrasive media.",
              "However, complex shapes may lose detail and sharp edges may become slightly rounded by tumbling.",
              "Abrasive blasting, also known as sand blasting, is subtractive post-processing method where abrasive material is blasted onto 3D printed parts at high pressure.",
              "For large parts this can be done in an open environment, but smaller parts are typically processed in a containment chamber that collects and reuses the abrasive material.",
              "Like other grit-based subtractive methods, there are a range of grits available and grit must be chosen based on part geometry and desired finish.",
              "Sand is a frequently used abrasive material, but other small coarse objects such as plastic beads can be used for different results.",
              "Since the abrasive material is smaller than that of tumbling, abrasive blasting is less effective on very rough parts or high layer heights.",
              "This method only treats surfaces reachable by the stream of blasted material, so complex geometries and cavities may not be feasible.",
              "Additionally, the blasting tool can only treat limited areas at a given time, so this method may be slower and difficult to process multiple parts simultaneously.",
              "CNC milling, also called CNC machining, is the inverse of 3D printing - it uses a computer-programmable drill moving (and sometime rotating) in three axes to carve out geometries.",
              "Like 3D printers, the technology uses a \u201cG-Code\u201d to program tool movements, in this case a milling bit rather than a filament extruder.",
              "While CNC machining is considered highly accurate from 0.",
              "005\u201d to 0.",
              "00005\u201d, it cannot produce certain geometries and wastes material, which is often expensive.",
              "Conversely, large-format 3D printing cannot achieve the same accuracy, but can achieve much more complex geometries and wastes very little material.",
              "It is typically not time or cost effective to mill the entire surface of a 3D print and it may be difficult to calibrate the milling tool to the print position.",
              "But while these two production methods are seemingly at odds, there are some situations where they may be used together.",
              "If a portion of a 3D printed part must be extremely smooth or accurate, that specific area can be milled.",
              "Alternately, manufacturers can save material by 3D printing a part in a rough finish before milling it to perfection.",
              "Chemical dipping, also called aid dipping, is the process of submerging parts in a chemical bath that eats away the surface.",
              "The process involves caustic materials, such as lye, sodium hydroxide, or dichloromethan, and should only be done by experts in facilities with the requisite safety features.",
              "The appropriate chemical choice is entirely dependent on the material of the 3D print, as the chemical must be abrasive to the print material.",
              "Some expertise is required to determine how long parts should remain submerged: too brief and the part will not be sufficiently smooth, too long and it could be ruined entirely.",
              "Some care should be taken to avoid air bubbles trapped inside the 3D print as they will prevent the chemical treatment of the surface.",
              "Typically the submerged part is gently moved to agitate the chemical bath and release any air bubbles.",
              "The process is ideal for complex geometries as the chemical bath treats all surfaces of submerged parts simultaneously.",
              "However, the size of the chemical dipping container determines the limited part dimensions of treatable prints.",
              "Additive post processing puts additional material directly onto printed parts and is highly efficient for smoothing parts while adding strength and other mechanical properties.",
              "There is a wide spectrum of methods from filling to priming, coating, metal plating, and more.",
              "Filling is a surface treatment that uses a thick adhesive compound, typically a paste, to fill in notches like the tiny gaps between layers of a 3D print.",
              "It is commonly used as a first step before sanding or additional additive layers.",
              "A wide range of fillers from pastes to sprays are available in many materials from light spackle to 2K resins.",
              "Paste fillers, like wood fillers or household spackle, are usually the most accessible option.",
              "They are simply spread over the part surface and can be easily smoothed with light sanding.",
              "Spray fillers are easy to apply but provide only a thin surface covering, resulting in a rougher coating.",
              "More robust, but more advanced options are resin fillers that must be cured by one of two methods: mixing with a hardener or UV exposure.",
              "Resins are available with various viscosity, cure speeds, and advanced features like UV and a high heat deflection temperature.",
              "For some UV-cured fillers leaving parts in the sun may be sufficient, but others will require a specialized UV chamber.",
              "When using any kind of resin cover skin, wear gloves, and keep the working space well ventilated.",
              "Ensure you\u2019re familiar with the requirements of your filler or coating before applying it to a part as this may drastically change the time or equipment required for post-processing.",
              "For some UV-cured fillers, leaving parts in the sun may be sufficient but others will require a specialized UV chamber.",
              "Ensure you\u2019re familiar with the requirements of your filler or coating before applying it to a part as this may drastically change the time or equipment required for post-processing.",
              "Primers prepare 3D-printed parts for the addition of subsequent layers by pre-treating the surface for better adhesion.",
              "They are far less viscous than fillers and may only smooth very small surface imperfections, so their main function is adhesive surface preparation.",
              "Primers are available in spray or brush form, but spray primer may produce a more even coating.",
              "To prime a part most effectively, the imperfections and layers notches should first be reduced by other post-processing methods such as sanding or filling.",
              "Ensure that your primer is made for plastic adhesion and is suitable for additional materials you intend to apply later.",
              "Leave the primer to set for 24 hours or as otherwise directed.",
              "Liquid coatings vary widely in material such as paint, varnish, resin, or even plastic.",
              "While there are several application methods, brush coating is the simplest way to smooth unique or small batches of 3D printed parts.",
              "Although the surface smoothness may be inconsistent due to brush strokes, choosing a material with the proper viscosity can avoid these surface irregularities.",
              "For a robust and smooth surface apply a 2K resin, which is a two-component mixture of resin with a hardener.",
              "When combined, the mixture creates an exothermic chemical reaction that cures the resin over a given amount of time.",
              "There is a huge range of resin products for a variety of uses: laminating resins for thin surface applications, casting resins for larger volumes, fast and slow curing resins, and resins with additives (like aluminum, for example) for additional performance enhancement such as temperature, UV, or chemical resistance.",
              "To achieve the smoothest surface when brush coating, use a resin with an appropriate \u201cself-leveling\u201d viscosity that will even out brush strokes without material dripping off the part.",
              "There are resin products specifically formulated for 3D prints that can achieve very smooth surfaces after one coating.",
              "When brushing other materials such as paint or varnish it may be more difficult to avoid brush strokes, but many coatings can be sanded after drying to achieve a smoother surface.",
              "It is also possible to apply an additional coating of another material, 2K resin for example, to achieve a smoother final result.",
              "A wide-ranging and scalable post-processing technique, spray coating a offers a number of viable methods ranging from DIY projects to robotic automation at an industrial scale.",
              "Spray coatings are available in a huge variety of materials such as paint, varnish, resin, plastics, and rubbers, just to name a few.",
              "The simple approach for DIY projects is a spray can of a chosen material applied in a ventilated/outdoor space.",
              "Since this method typically results in minimal surface smoothing, it is recommended to sand the part first and apply several spray coats.",
              "Applying a spray primer may help the spray coating adhere to the part.",
              "Spray paint can be used for aesthetic enhancements and spray varnish can protect the surface against chipping, wear, and UV damage.",
              "For large volume or industrial spray coating applications, a robotic arm fitted with a spraying tool head can apply a wide range of coatings to a 3D printed part.",
              "The application typically takes place in spray booth with an adequate air filter.",
              "This method allows a wider range of materials, including 2K spray coatings, primers, paints, and more, and results in higher application precision and uniformity.",
              "A robotic arm will speed up the processing time and make high-volume post-processing feasible at an industrial level.",
              "Spray coating is most suitable for finishing large parts, rather than other additive methods such as dipping, foiling, or powder coating.",
              "The later methods all require a machine or vat that can contain the entire part, whereas spray coating is only limited by the size of the room in which it is done.",
              "In foiling, or vinyl wrapping, an adhesive foil made of light metals or plastic is wrapped onto an object, often preceded by priming.",
              "Commonly known for wrapping vehicles, vinyl wrapping can also be applied to 3D-printed objects with a suitable material.",
              "Depending on the material, the foil may increase heat and stress resistance but is often applied for aesthetic enhancement like smoothing and surface quality.",
              "The difficulty of this post-processing technique varies with the size and complexity of your part.",
              "A simple geometry, like the gently curved side panel of a vehicle, is relatively easy to foil, but complex shapes are more difficult with some being impossible to foil.",
              "Wrapping is particularly suitable to apply detailed surface designs to 3D-printed parts.",
              "Adhesive foils come in a wide range of colors and patterns, as well as custom-printed designs.",
              "Foil can be applied by hand, stretching the material over objects to ensure no imperfections like air bubbles remain.",
              "Heat guns are often used in the process to make application easier and avoid imperfections.",
              "Vacuum foiling will automate the process for faster, precise results to ensure the material wraps around the part as perfectly as possible.",
              "Foiling is usually not suitable for complex parts as the foil will be extremely difficult to apply uniformly and inside cavities.",
              "The difficulty of vinyl wrapping varies with the size and complexity of your part.",
              "A smooth surface \u2013 like the side paneling of a vehicle \u2013 should be reasonably simple to foil but complex shapes will become exponentially more difficult.",
              "When dip coating, a part is submerged into a vat of material such as paint, resin, rubber, etc.",
              "and removed after a specified time, resulting in an even surface distribution.",
              "The part can be redipped multiple times for a thicker coating and smoother surface.",
              "Dipping can be used for aesthetic finishing and functional enhancement like increased strength and resistance to heat, chemicals, weather, etc.",
              "The typical dipping process is comprised of five stages: Hydro dipping, also known as water transfer printing is a unique method for applying detailed designs onto a 3D print.",
              "The part is submerged in a vat of clean water that has a layer of material floating on its surface, typically a water soluble printed film or an oil based paint.",
              "As the part passes through the floating layer, the film or paint adheres to the part\u2019s surface.",
              "The surface tension of the water ensures that the film curves around any shape.",
              "The best results are achieved with parts containing gently curving geometries.",
              "Dip coating is suitable for complex geometries and requires some expertise in the coating material used.",
              "The size of the vat determines the dimension of treatable parts.",
              "Large prints may not be feasible, although batch processing is possible for smaller parts.",
              "Metal plating is a chemical process where a layer of metal is bonded to a 3D printed part.",
              "It is a highly effective method to create 3D printed objects with high resistance to heat, impact, weather, and chemicals, or to create conductive parts.",
              "The first step in metal coating plastic parts is \"electroless plating\" which metalizes the surface of the print, priming it for proper metal plating.",
              "This process ranges from special metal paints that are simply brushed or sprayed onto the part to industrial processes involving numerous steps of cleaning, etching, neutralizing, activating, etc.",
              "Typically, this first layer is copper or nickel, although silver and gold layers are also possible.",
              "In the second step in metal plating, the metalized 3D print is submerged in a bath for a specific length of time to deposit a wide range of metals like tin, platinum, palladium, rhodium, and even chrome.",
              "In electroplating, the part is placed in a galvanic bath that deposits a thin metal layer from 1 - 50 microns thick.",
              "Anode and cathode ions pass through the liquid and adhere to parts in microscopically fine layers.",
              "Additional metal plating processes can build up the metallic surface thickness or deposit a different metal material.",
              "When using a metal-acid solution, parts are submerged in the liquid solution for a specific duration, depending on the desired plating thickness.",
              "A chemical reaction attracts and adheres the metal ions to the surface of the part.",
              "Once removed from the bath, the part can receive a protective coating to prevent oxidation, corrosion, or tarnishing.",
              "Heat treatments may be used to strengthen the metal layer adhesion and prevent brittleness.",
              "Metal plating typically works well for complex parts and can produce a range of surface qualities, smoothness, and mechanical enhancements.",
              "However, the process requires many stages and expertise.",
              "With powder coating, also known as rotational sintering, a part is heated and rotated within a cloud of powdered plastic.",
              "As the powder compound meets the heated part, it is melted to the surface to produce a fine coating.",
              "Due to surface tension while spinning, the adhered powder produces a homogeneous, non-porous layer about 400-microns thick.",
              "The surface is typically not glossy smooth, but rather has a fine matte texture caused by the plastic cloud particle size, typically 2-50 microns.",
              "Powder coating is a common method for protecting large metal components, but it is difficult to achieve with 3D prints.",
              "In traditional powder coating, the metal parts experience temperatures up to 200 \u00b0C, but the lower temperature resistance of most 3D printed plastics greatly limits the use of a post-processingsing method.",
              "When possible, powder coating is highly efficient for batch production with uniform surfaces, although cavities may be difficult to post-process.",
              "Neither removing nor adding material, property changing post-processing redistributes molecules of a 3D print.",
              "Smoother and stronger parts are achieved with thermal and chemical treatments.",
              "Local melting is an easy way to reduce the appearance of surface scratches from damage, support removal, or abrasive post-processing like sanding.",
              "Rough surfaces are particularly visible on dark-colored 3D prints, which appear to be a white-ish color.",
              "Using a heat gun set to high heat, quickly pass hot air over the area requiring treatment, keeping the heat gun 10-20 cm away from the part.",

              "Using the same method as described above will melt and shrink the strings.",
              "If the strings are large, small remnants may cling to the part but are often easily removed by brushing or clipping them off.",
              "This method is not suitable for deep scratches as it is only effective for light surface roughness.",
              "It also can easily deform the part, so take care to limit the time an area is heated.",
              "The best results are achieved by sweeping hot air across the surface for several seconds.",
              "Local melting is not recommended for overall surface smoothing, but for the easy and effective smoothing of small defects and scratches.",
              "Annealing is the process of heating a print to re-organize its molecular structure, resulting in stronger parts that are less prone to warping.",
              "Untreated 3D prints have an amorphous molecular structure, meaning that the molecules are unorganized and weaker.",
              "Being a poor heat conductor, the extruded plastic cools quickly and unevenly during the printing process causing internal stresses, particularly between print layers.",
              "These stress points are most prone to breakage.",
              "To strengthen the part at its molecular level, it is heated to its glass transition temperature, but below its melting point.",
              "Achieving the glass transition temperature allows the molecules to redistribute into a semi-crystalline structure without melting the part to the point of deforming.",
              "Glass transition and melting temperatures vary between materials and some expertise is required to heat parts to the correct temperature for the proper length of time.",
              "3D prints will shrink during the annealing process, which can be corrected by increasing the original printing dimensions accordingly.",
              "Vapor smoothing is the chemical process of smoothing 3D prints in which parts are exposed to vaporized solvents in an enclosed chamber.",
              "Similarly to chemical dipping, the correct solvent must be used in correspondence with the 3D print material.",
              "The cloud of solvent dissolves the surface of the print, while its surface tension redistributes the dissolved material, resulting in a smoother finish.",
              "Unlike chemical dipping, no material is actually removed from the part.",
              "Solvents can either be heated to a gaseous state or vaporized by ultrasonic misting.",
              "The 3D print is exposed to the vaporized solvents for a specific length of time: too short and the part is not adequately smoothed, too long and the part can deform and become brittle.",
              "Most suitable solvents are caustic and combustible, and therefore require extreme levels of caution, adequate chemical containment, and disposal, and should only be handled by qualified persons.",
              "Many vapor smoothing machines are available for use with a variety of solvents suitable for different print materials.",
              "These machines make the process automated and much safer, but most can only treat smaller parts due to the chamber's limited dimensions.",
              "For real life industrial examples, download our free eBook Post-Processing for FFF Prints and see this webinar about post-processing techniques.",
              "The eBook explores the three types of FFF post-processing techniques: 1) Material Removal, 2) Material Addition and 3) Material Property Change.",
              "Also, learn more about how various techniques like high resolution tumbling, resin coating and aluminum plating are transforming 3D printed parts.",
              "Once the printer has finished printing, there may still be some work to do on the printed piece.",
              "For example, many shapes require supports to print properly.",
              "Removing those is a post-processing task.",
              "Some people might want to sand or put a finish layer onto a piece.",
              "Resin, as opposed to filament, based prints need to have any uncured resin washed off and final curing under UV light.",
              "3D printing post processing is used to enhance the surface properties of prints in many aspects to deliver improved mechanical performance and aesthetic appearance.",
              "By improving these key surface characteristics, post processing widely extents the range of use cases and applications across all industries.",
              "3 types of post-processing techniques can be applied to fused filament fabrication (FFF) prints: Almost every 3D print requires some sort of post-processing after it\u2019s printed.",
              "Usually this involves 3 steps: When post processing your 3d printed part, there are 2 steps that are most critical: In both steps you need to be careful, not to break your 3d printed part.",
              "To lower these risks, you can try using flexible print beds and water-soluble support material.",
              "When producing your FDM part, often the finished look matters just as much as the functionality.",
              "There are 4 ways to complete FDM parts.",
              "When PLA and acetone smoothing works, it's due to other materials added to the PLA.",
              "Most PLAs and similar non-acetone-dissolving 3D printer filaments cannot be smoothed the same way.",
              "That's because PLA in its pure form is not reactive to acetone.",

              "In particular, most of the applications of 3D printing reported in the literature are related to the congenital heart disease [29].",
              "This is due to the fact that children have a smaller chest cavity than adults, and the surgical treatment in paediatric cases may be much more difficult.",

              "It helps the surgeon in the spatial orientation inside the cavities of a small infant heart and in simulating the surgical approach and steps of the operation with high fidelity [79].",
              "This leads to shorter intraoperative time that per se has significant impact on complication rate, blood loss, postoperative length-of-stay, and reduced costs [80].",
              "An example of the application of the 3D printing in the paediatric congenital heart disease treatment is a study reported in the literature based on the development of a 3D heart model of a 15-years-old boy to improve interventional simulation and planning in patient with aortic arch hypoplasia.",
              "The 3D-printed model allowed simulation of the stenting intervention.",
              "The assessment of optimal stent position, size, and length was found to be useful for the actual intervention in the patient.",
              "This represents one of the most technically challenging surgical procedures which opens the door for potential simulation applications of a 3D model in the field of catheterization and cardiovascular interventions [81].",
              "Another study proposed in which the 3D printing had a relevant role consists in a clinical preoperative evaluation on five patients ranged from 7 months to 11 years of age affected by a double outlet right ventricle with two well-developed ventricles and with a remote ventricular septal defect.",
              "The three-dimensional printed model based on the data derived from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MRI) contributed to a more complete appreciation of the intracardic anatomy, leading to a successful surgical repair for three of the five patients.",
              "[82] Lastly, CT and MRI data were used to construct 3D digital and anatomical models to plan a heart transplantation surgical procedure of two patients of 2 and 14 years old affected relatively by hypoplastic left heart syndrome and pulmonary atresia with a hypoplastic right ventricle.",
              "These physical models allowed the surgeon and the paediatric cardiologist to develop the optimal surgical treatment during the heart transplantation anticipating problems that may arise during the procedure.",
              "The specific dimensions and distances can be measured, and heart transplantation can be planned [83].",

              "Thorough preoperative planning enabled faster surgery and decreased anesthesia time in a compromised patient [85].",
              "Another study, based on 13 cases of multiplane spinal or pelvic deformity, was developed in order to demonstrate that the three-dimensional printing may represent a useful tool in the surgical planning of complex paediatric spinal deformities treatment [86].",
              "Changing the final goal of the additive manufacturing, other applications cases are reported in the literature to demonstrate the usefulness in the production of paediatric patient-specific prostheses.",
              "An example in the literature is given by the development of a low-cost three-dimensional printed prosthetic hand for children with upper-limb reductions using a fitting methodology that can be performed at a distance [87].",
              "This specific case demonstrates that the advancements in computer-aided design (CAD) programs, additive manufacturing, and imaging editing software offer the possibility of designing, printing, and fitting prosthetic hands devices overcoming the costs limitation.",
              "As a consequence, the advantages of 3D-printed implants over conventional ones are in terms of customizability and cost as seems to be clear from the previous example.",
              "On the contrary, the major adversity is related to the rapid physical growth that makes the customize prostheses outsized frequently.",
              "This leads to the production of advanced technological implant that, due to their high complexity and weight, increases cost.",
              "The additive manufacturing can be used to fabricate rugged, light-weight, easily replaceable, and very low-cost prostheses for children [88].",

              "With the advent of bioprinting, cellular prostheses could be an interesting area of research, which can lead to integrated prostheses in the brain communication system, and exhibit more biomimicry with tissue and organ functionalities [89].",

          "The first step in the 3D printing process is typically to create a 3D digital model of the object you want to print using CAD modelling software (Catia, Fusion360, Solidworks, Creo, etc.)",
          "Once the digital model is complete, it must be converted into a 3D printer-compatible format, such as an STL file.",
          "The second step in the process is to prepare the model for printing.",
          "This involves the use of a slicing software which helps you control the printing parameters to ensure the print is successful and is printed the way you want.",
          "The slicer converts the design into co-ordinates which the printer understands and the material is deposited as per the co-ordinates.",
          "The printing process is started after the 3D printer has been prepared and the appropriate settings have been configured.",
          "Once the slicer is done, it will send the data over to the 3D printer to start the printing process."
