              "Unlike other animals that change color, such as the squid and octopus, chameleons do not modify their hues by accumulating or dispersing pigments within their skin cells, the researchers found.",
              "Instead, the lizards rely on structural changes that affect how light reflects off their skin, the researchers said.",
              "To investigate how the reptiles change color, researchers studied five adult male, four adult female and four juvenile panther chameleons (Furcifer pardalis), a type of lizard that lives in Madagascar.",
              "The scientists found that the chameleons had two superposed thick layers of iridophore cells \u2014 iridescent cells that have pigment and reflect light.",
              "[See photos of color-changing chameleons] The iridophore cells contain nanocrystalsof different sizes, shapes and organizations, which are key to the chameleons' dramatic color shifts, the researchers said.",
              "The chameleons can change the structural arrangement of the upper cell layer by relaxing or exciting the skin, which leads to a change in color, they found.",
              "For instance, a male chameleon might be in a relaxed state when it's hanging out on a branch, and in an excited state when it sees a rival male.",
              "\"When the skin is in the relaxed state, the nanocrystals in the iridophore cells are very close to each other \u2014 hence, the cells specifically reflect short wavelengths, such as blue,\" said study senior author Michel Milinkovitch, a professor of genetics and evolution at the University of Geneva in Switzerland.",
              "On the other hand, when the skin becomes excited, the distance between neighboring nanocrystals increases, and each iridophore cell (which contains these nanocrystals) selectively reflects longer wavelengths, such as yellow, orange or red, Milinkovitch told Live Science in an email.",
              "But chameleons aren't always blue.",
              "The lizards' skin also contains yellow pigments, and blue mixed with yellow makes green, a \"cryptic\" color that camouflages them among trees and plants, Milinkovitch said.",
              "The \"red skin hue does not change dramatically during excitation, but its brightness increases,\" the researchers wrote in the study.",
              "Furthermore, the researchers found a deeper and thicker layer of skin cells that reflect a large amount of near-infrared sunlight.",
              "While these cells do not appear to change color, it's possible that they help the chameleons reflect heat and stay cool, the researchers said.",
              "The researchers used a number of methods to study the iridophore cells.",
              "They filmed the chameleons' color changes using high-resolution videography and made numerical models that predict how the nanocrystals should reflect light.",
              "\"The results are a perfect match with what we observe [in real life],\" Milinkovitch said.",
              "The researchers also manipulated the cells by subjecting them to solutions of varying concentrations, which caused the cells to swell or shrink.",
              "These modifications changed the distances between the nanocrystals, and altered their visible colors, just as the researchers predicted they would, Milinkovitch said.",
              "However, only adult male chameleons change color, especially when they see a rival male chameleon they want to chase away, or a female to attract, Milinkovitch said.",
              "Females and young chameleons are dull-colored and have a very reduced upper layer of iridophore cells, he said.",
              "The findings may help engineers and physicists replicate the chameleon's color-changing capacities in new technology, such as appliances that eliminate reflection, Milinkovitch said.",

              "It is generally interpreted that these changes are due to dispersion/aggregation of pigment-containing organelles within dermal chromatophores.",
              "Here, combining microscopy, photometric videography and photonic band-gap modelling, we show that chameleons shift colour through active tuning of a lattice of guanine nanocrystals within a superficial thick layer of dermal iridophores.",
              "In addition, we show that a deeper population of iridophores with larger crystals reflects a substantial proportion of sunlight especially in the near-infrared range.",
              "The organization of iridophores into two superposed layers constitutes an evolutionary novelty for chameleons, which allows some species to combine efficient camouflage with spectacular display, while potentially providing passive thermal protection.",
              "Ever since their description by Aristotle, chameleons have populated myths and legends because of a number of features such as a long projectile tongue, independently movable eyes, zygodactylous feet, a very slow pace and the striking capacity of some species to rapidly shift from one vivid colour to another1,2,3.",
              "Many vertebrates can rapidly change colour for camouflage, communication and thermoregulation2,4,5,6,7, but these so-called physiological colour changes are generally mediated by modifications of skin brightness (that is, diffuse and/or specular reflectivity) through dispersion/aggregation of pigment-containing organelles, especially melanosomes, within dermal chromatophores6,7.",
              "On the other hand, rapid active tuning of skin hue has been described in only a handful of species and generally involves structural, rather than pigmentary, components, that is, multilayer nano-reflectors with alternating high and low refractive indices that generate interference of light waves.",
              "For example, some species of squid can rapidly tune skin iridescence through periodical invaginations of plasma membrane deep into specialized cells called iridophores, generating arrays of alternating cytoplasmic protein-rich lamellae and extracellular channels8,9.",
              "In fish, amphibians and reptiles, iridophores containing transparent guanine nanocrystals generate a large variety of structural colours, and modifications of the multilayer reflector geometry has been suggested to generate colour change in a few species10,11,12,13,14.",
              "Finally, it must be emphasized that the colour of a reptile skin patch is often the result of interactions among pigmentary and structural elements14,15.",
              "Combining histology, electron microscopy and photometric videography techniques with numerical band-gap modelling, here we show that chameleons have evolved two superimposed populations of iridophores with different morphologies and functions: the upper multilayer is responsible for rapid structural colour change through active tuning of guanine nanocrystal spacing in a triangular lattice, whereas the deeper population of cells broadly reflects light, especially in the near-infrared range.",
              "This combination of two functionally different layers of iridophores constitutes an evolutionary novelty that allows some species of chameleons to combine efficient camouflage and dramatic display, while potentially moderating the thermal consequences of intense solar radiations.",
              "We study the panther chameleon (Furcifer pardalis), a lizard from Madagascar, capable of dynamic colour change.",
              "Our Raman spectroscopy analyses indicate the presence of two types of dark chromatophores containing respectively melanin16 and an unidentified dark-blue pigment (Supplementary Fig.",
              "1).",
              "Although panther chameleons of both sexes and all ages can strongly modulate the brightness of the skin through dispersion of these pigments (for example, in response to stress), adult males are additionally characterized both by exceptionally large intraspecific colour variation (with various combinations of white, red, green and blue skin) among geographic locales within Madagascar and their ability to rapidly change colour (hue).",
              "Indeed, when encountering a male competitor or a potentially receptive female, a mature male panther chameleon can shift the background colour of its skin (Fig.",
              "1a) from green to yellow or orange, whereas blue patches turn whitish and red becomes brighter with less conspicuous hue modifications.",

              "Advertisement Chameleons have built a pretty solid reputation on two commonly held beliefs: They can stealthily blend into their surroundings, and they are the ideal subjects for iconic '80s anthems. But it turns out one of those supposed facts isn't quite right \u2014 in fact, everything you think you know about chameleons and their color-changing capabilities is probably backward.",
              "\"The color changing properties of chameleons don't really help them blend in, but rather their natural, relaxed state is what helps them blend in,\" says Daniel Flynn, marketing manager for the Conservation Society of California at the Oakland Zoo.",
              "\"The expression, 'blending in like a chameleon' isn't entirely accurate, meaning these lizards don't change their appearance to fit in, but rather to stand out.\"",
              "Advertisement Scientists long believed that chameleons change their coloring similarly to the way octopuses switch shades, but biologists and physicists somewhat recently realized that something else entirely is going on.",
              "\"The color change you are seeing is based on structural changes of crystal-like cells called iridophores underneath the skin that refract light,\" Flynn says.",
              "When anything agitates or exhilarates the chameleon, things start to get interesting.",
              "\"When they get excited, feel threatened, or want to display positively, towards a mate, or negatively, to a rival, the crystals separate or compress and give off the appearance of different colors,\" Flynn says.",
              "Advertisement In a 2015 study published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers with the University of Geneva in Switzerland revealed that iridophores act like tiny mirrors that selectively reflect and absorb different colors.",
              "While a lot of animals have color patterns \u2014 birds and fish for example \u2014 the cells that make their vibrant displays possible typically absorb or reflect certain regions of the visible light spectrum.",
              "Chameleon cells are different \u2014 iridophores can actually absorb or reflect any and all colors of the spectrum.",
              "\"Some species change more colors than others,\" Flynn says.",
              "\"For example, some will change shades lighter to darker, while others will change to more vibrant, bright colors.",
              "There are quite a few species, so there is a lot of variance.",
              "Among all of them, they can change all different types of colors \u2014 even colors that aren't visible to the human eye!\"",
              "The pigments inside the iridophores are typically contained inside tiny sacs, but when a chameleon's mood changes, its nervous system activates the cells to contract or expand.",
              "When the animal is relaxed, the cells stay close together and reflect short wavelengths, like blue.",
              "A rush of excitement pushes those cells farther apart, enabling each iridophore to reflect longer wavelengths, like red, orange and yellow.",
              "But if the naturally relaxed cells reflect blue, why are chilled out chameleons typically green like their surroundings?",
              "\"Basically, when a chameleon is relaxed, they are naturally visible as green to help them camouflage with the green leaves and trees,\" Flynn says.",
              "\"This is due to the natural yellow pigment combined with the relaxed state of the crystal cells which reflect blue light.",
              "Blue plus yellow equals green.\"",
              "It may not be easy being green, but it's necessary for the chameleon, which has no real defenses;",
              "blending in is its best bet against predators.",
              "So, if the color changes are due to special cells under the skin, why are the effects external?",
              "The outermost layer of the chameleon's skin is actually transparent.",
              "Beneath that outer layer lies several more layers containing a variety of specialized skills, including the blue and white light-reflecting iridophores.",
              "What's really wild is if the chameleon needs a dramatic quick-change (like when it's trying to show off for a potential mate), it can quickly shed its outer layers of skin to expose the iridophores to direct sunlight in a hurry.",

              "There's not a ton of research to support it yet, but some scientists believe chameleons' color-changing abilities also allow them to regulate their body temperature.",
              "A 2016 study demonstrated that bearded dragons alter their hue based on their temps, and since chameleons are ectotherms and can't retain body heat (hence their stereotypical sunbathing), it's possible that maintaining a dark color allows them to absorb more light and heat.",

              "Many species of chameleons, including the veiled chameleon and calumma chameleon, have hooded or veiled heads.",
              "This hood is formed by a bony ridge on the back of the chameleon's skull.",
              "A chameleon's hood evolved to serve two main purposes.",
              "First, the hood helps chameleons collect water.",
              "Since chameleons often live in dry climates, and since their diets consist mostly of insects that do not contain much water, they need all the help they can get to stay hydrated.",
              "When dew collects atop of a chameleon's hood, the droplets eventually slide down the sides of the hood into the corners of the waiting chameleon's mouth.",
              "The second function of chameleon hoods has to do with reproduction.",
              "Male chameleons typically have larger, pointier hoods than females.",
              "When it is time to mate, male chameleons must sometimes fight other males to gain access to females.",
              "A male chameleon with a large hood appears bigger than he really is and can intimidate other males into staying away.",
              "Female chameleons also tend to prefer mates with larger hoods.",
              "This sexual selection ensures that the genes of large-hooded chameleons are passed on, and that future generations of chameleons also have hooded skulls.",
              "One of the chameleon's most interesting physical features is its oddly shaped, swiveling eyes.",
              "These eyes move independently of one another, rotating nearly 360 degrees.",
              "Because these eyes are on the sides of a chameleon's head, and because chameleons can switch between monocular vision (where they only see images collected from one eye) and binocular vision (where they see images collected from both) chameleons can see almost everything around them, including directly behind.",
              "This special vision allows chameleons to successfully hunt fast-moving insect prey like flies or beetles as they rush past.",
              "When a chameleon spots its prey with one eye, it swivels both eyes to lock on the target.",
              "It then shoots out its long, sticky tongue to snare the prey.",
              "Because a chameleon's eyes protrude so far from the sides of their heads, they require special protection.",
              "Chameleons have developed special, hooded lids which cover most of each eye, leaving only the pupil exposed.",
              "These lids protect the soft tissue of the eyes.",
              "As with its hooded head, a chameleon's famous, color-changing skin serves several purposes.",
              "First, it helps the reptile to blend into its environment.",
              "A chameleon's natural, unchanged skin color is different, depending on where it lives.",
              "Some chameleons are sandy brown, to blend in with bark and twigs, while others -- living in leafy treetops -- are varying shades of green.",
              "If the color of a chameleon's environment changes when it moves from a light green tree to a dark green one, it changes the color of its skin accordingly, helping it to blend in and avoid detection by predators.",
              "Chameleons also use their skin for temperature control.",
              "Like all reptiles, chameleons are cold-blooded, which means that they rely on the heat of the sun to warm their bodies.",
              "To speed up this process, chameleons sometimes make their skin darker, since darker colors help to absorb heat more quickly.",
              "Certain species of chameleon can turn their skin almost entirely black.",
              "One of the most important functions of a chameleon's color-changing skin is communication.",

              "Forest Wildlife Forest Wildlife April 16, 2022 // No Comments If you\u2019ve ever seen a chameleon up close, you probably recognized it immediately.",
              "Chameleons are highly distinctive lizards with many unique appearances and characteristics they have developed over time.",
              "They live in many different parts of Africa, but they are also kept as pets throughout the world.",
              "So, you may be wondering, how does a chameleon adapt to its environment?",
              "Keep reading!",
              "In this article, we\u2019ll explore the answer to this question.",
              "What You'll Learn Today Chameleons have developed many unique adaptations over time.",
              "These adaptations help them to survive in many different ways.",
              "Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of these adaptations and explore the ways in which they help chameleons survive.",
              "One of the most notable physical features of a chameleon is its ability to change its skin color.",
              "While it is commonly thought that chameleons change color to become \u201cinvisible\u201d against their surroundings, this isn\u2019t entirely true.",
              "Chameleons can blend in with their surroundings, but they don\u2019t necessarily become invisible.",
              "They won\u2019t necessarily take on the exact colors of their surroundings;",
              "in fact, there are times they change colors in order to stand out from their surroundings.",
              "So, how exactly do chameleons change color?",
              "Their skin cells contain pigments of melanin that can produce various colors.",
              "Chameleons can cause these melanin pigments to spread out and gather back together, which causes them to become different colors and shades.",
              "But this is only part of it.",
              "In addition to the melanin pigments, chameleon skin contains unique, microscopic crystals which actually reflect light, causing different colors depending on how close or spread out they are.",
              "A combination of these pigments and crystals, as well as the chameleon\u2019s ability to move them around in the skin, helps the chameleon to change color.",
              "Chameleons have some control over which colors they turn;",
              "when they are feeling excited, threatened, or attempting to attract a mate, they turn bright colors such as red, orange, and yellow;",
              "when they are calm and at rest, they turn calmer colors like green and tan.",
              "Chameleons change colors to blend with their surroundings as well as to stand out;",
              "they will do it to attract mates and scare off other males.",
              "In addition, they will also change colors to reflect sunlight and heat, thereby controlling heat absorption in their bodies.",
              "Check out this video to learn more about how chameleons change color: Chameleon\u2019s eyes move independently of each other and can rotate 360 degrees.",
              "Of course, this is a pretty cool characteristic, but how does it help them adapt to their environment?",
              "It allows them to see two different things at once\u2013one image in the left eye, the other in the right eye.",
              "Since each eye has a 360 degree view, chameleons can basically see what\u2019s going on all around them at all times, without blind spots.",
              "They also have the ability to focus both eyes on a single object, allowing them to see it more clearly and hone in on its location.",
              "This incredible eye movement helps them with hunting, as they can easily track even fast-moving insects anywhere around them, pinpoint their exact location, and catch them with their long, sticky tongues when the insects get close enough.",
              "What\u2019s more, chameleons have extra-protective eyelids that keep their eyes safe.",
              "Using these eyelids, they can cover most of their eyes while leaving the pupils exposed, allowing them to see while keeping most of the eye hidden and protected.",
              "According to Sciencing, some species of chameleon have developed a special hood on their heads.",
              "This hood has allowed them to adapt to their environment in a couple of different ways.",
              "First, the hood acts as a water collection tool.",
              "Chameleons often live in dry environments, so they stay hydrated by drinking the dew which collects in their hood and runs down to their mouth.",
              "What\u2019s more, males with larger hoods appear to be more appealing to females.",
              "Large, impressive hoods also allow them to intimidate and scare off other males competing for the same female.",
              "This is an example of natural selection, as it leads to more young chameleons being born with the genetics for larger hoods, ensuring survival of the fittest and, as a result, the species overall.",
              "Chameleons have a unique foot shape\u2013each of their four feet has two toes sticking out horizontally, in a Y or T shape.",
              "Chameleons are the only animal in the world with this particular foot anatomy.",
              "These horizontal toes allow the chameleon to grip tree and shrub branches with a greatly reduced risk of falling, as the toes can wrap all the way around the branches\u2013much as our thumbs and forefingers might do.",
              "But chameleons have a much stronger grip than we could ever hope to achieve with our thumbs and forefingers.",
              "Their firm grip allows them to hold on even under difficult circumstances\u2013for example, chameleons are not easily carried off even when attacked by birds of prey or other predators.",
              "Chameleons move slowly and deliberately, and they have the ability to sit perfectly still.",
              "Their control over their body movements allows them to avoid prey as well as catch insects by sitting motionless;",
              "it also allows them to communicate certain messages to each other through their body language.",
              "These slow, deliberate movements can also help to disguise them, as they may appear to move like leaves blowing in the wind.",
              "This impressive control over their body movement is an important adaptation that has allowed chameleons to survive by helping them hide from predators and catch insects to eat.",
              "Chameleons are unique-looking creatures with many strange physical features.",
              "Their ability to change color, see everything around them at all times, collect water in their hoods, grip branches with their horizontal toes, and sit perfectly still are just a few of the adaptations they have developed to help them survive in their environments.",

              "Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae) are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World lizards with 200 species described as of June 2015.",
              "[1] The members of this family are best known for their distinct range of colors, being capable of shifting to different hues and degrees of brightness.",
              "The large number of species in the family exhibit considerable variability in their capacity to change color.",
              "For some, it is more of a shift of brightness (shades of brown);",
              "for others, a plethora of color-combinations (reds, yellows, greens, blues) can be seen.",
              "Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet, their prehensile tail, their laterally compressed bodies, their head casques, their projectile tongues used for catching prey, their swaying gait,[2] and in some species crests or horns on their brow and snout.",
              "Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, and because of this the chameleon\u2019s brain is constantly analyzing two separate, individual images of its environment.",
              "When hunting prey, the eyes focus forward in coordination, affording the animal stereoscopic vision.",
              "Chameleons are diurnal and adapted for visual hunting of invertebrates, mostly insects, although the large species also can catch small vertebrates.",
              "Chameleons typically are arboreal, but there are also many species that live on the ground.",
              "The arboreal species use their prehensile tail as an extra anchor point when they are moving or resting in trees or bushes;",
              "because of this, their tail is often referred to as a \"fifth limb\".",
              "Depending on species, they range from rainforest to desert conditions and from lowlands to highlands, with the vast majority occurring in Africa (about half of the species are restricted to Madagascar), but with a single species in southern Europe, and a few across southern Asia as far east as India and Sri Lanka.",
              "They have been introduced to Hawaii, California, and Florida.",
              "[1][3] The English word chameleon (/k\u0259\u02c8mi\u02d0li\u0259n/ kuh-MEEL-ee-un) is a simplified spelling of Latin chamaeleo\u0304n,[4] a borrowing of the Greek \u03c7\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u0301\u03c9\u03bd (khamaile\u0301o\u0304n),[5] a compound of \u03c7\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u0301 (khamai\u0301) \"on the ground\"[6] and \u03bb\u03b5\u0301\u03c9\u03bd (le\u0301o\u0304n) \"lion\".",
              "[7][8][9] In 1986, the family Chamaeleonidae was divided into two subfamilies, Brookesiinae and Chamaeleoninae.",
              "[10] Under this classification, Brookesiinae included the genera Brookesia and Rhampholeon, as well as the genera later split off from them (Palleon and Rieppeleon), while Chamaeleoninae included the genera Bradypodion, Calumma, Chamaeleo, Furcifer and Trioceros, as well as the genera later split off from them (Archaius, Nadzikambia and Kinyongia).",
              "Since that time, however, the validity of this subfamily designation has been the subject of much debate,[11] although most phylogenetic studies support the notion that the pygmy chameleons of the subfamily Brookesiinae are not a monophyletic group.",
              "[12][13][14][15] While some authorities have previously preferred to use this subfamilial classification on the basis of the absence of evidence principle,[11] these authorities later abandoned this subfamilial division, no longer recognizing any subfamilies with the family Chamaeleonidae.",
              "[16] In 2015, however, Glaw reworked the subfamilial division by placing only the genera Brookesia and Palleon within the Brookesiinae subfamily, with all other genera being placed in Chamaeleoninae.",
              "[1] Some chameleon species are able to change their skin coloration.",
              "Different chameleon species are able to vary their coloration and pattern through combinations of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, light blue, yellow, turquoise, and purple.",
              "[17] Chameleon skin has a superficial layer which contains pigments, and under the layer are cells with very small (nanoscale) guanine crystals.",
              "Chameleons change color by \"actively tuning the photonic response of a lattice of small guanine nanocrystals in the s-iridophores\".",
              "[18] This tuning, by an unknown molecular mechanism, changes the wavelength of light reflected off the crystals which changes the color of the skin.",
              "The color change was duplicated ex vivo by modifying the osmolarity of pieces of white skin.",
              "[18] Color change in chameleons has functions in camouflage, but most commonly in social signaling and in reactions to temperature and other conditions.",
              "The relative importance of these functions varies with the circumstances, as well as the species.",
              "Color change signals a chameleon's physiological condition and intentions to other chameleons.",
              "[19][20] Because chameleons are ectothermic, another reason why they change color is to regulate their body temperatures, either to a darker color to absorb light and heat to raise their temperature, or to a lighter color to reflect light and heat, thereby either stabilizing or lowering their body temperature.",
              "[21][22] Chameleons tend to show brighter colors when displaying aggression to other chameleons,[23] and darker colors when they submit or \"give up\".",
              "[24] Most chameleon genera (exceptions are Chamaeleo, Rhampholeon and Rieppeleon) have blue fluorescence in a species specific pattern in their skull tubercles and in Brookesia there is also some in tubercles on the body.",
              "The fluorescence is derived from bones that only are covered in very thin skin and it possibly serves a signaling role, especially in shaded habitats.",
              "[25] Some species, such as Smith's dwarf chameleon and several others in the genus Bradypodion, adjust their colors for camouflage depending on the vision of the specific predator species (for example, bird or snake) by which they are being threatened.",
              "[26][27] In the introduced Hawaiian population of Jackson's chameleon, conspicuous color changes that are used for communication between chameleons have increased whereas anti-predator camouflage color changes have decreased relative to the native source population in Kenya where there are more predators.",
              "[28] Chameleons have two superimposed layers within their skin that control their color and thermoregulation.",
              "The top layer contains a lattice of guanine nanocrystals, and by exciting this lattice the spacing between the nanocrystals can be manipulated, which in turn affects which wavelengths of light are reflected and which are absorbed.",
              "Exciting the lattice increases the distance between the nanocrystals, and the skin reflects longer wavelengths of light.",
              "Thus, in a relaxed state the crystals reflect blue and green, but in an excited state the longer wavelengths such as yellow, orange, green, and red are reflected.",
              "[29] The skin of a chameleon also contains some yellow pigments, which combined with the blue reflected by a relaxed crystal lattice results in the characteristic green color which is common of many chameleons in their relaxed state.",
              "Chameleon color palettes have evolved through evolution and the environment.",
              "Chameleons living in the forest have a more defined and colorful palette compared to those living in the desert or savanna, which have more of a basic, brown, and charred palette.",
              "[30] The oldest described chameleon is Anqingosaurus brevicephalus from the Middle Paleocene (about 58.",
              "7\u201361.",
              "7 mya) of China.",
              "[31] Other chameleon fossils include Chamaeleo caroliquarti from the Lower Miocene (about 13\u201323 mya) of the Czech Republic and Germany, and Chamaeleo intermedius from the Upper Miocene (about 5\u201313 mya) of Kenya.",
              "[31] The chameleons are probably far older than that, perhaps sharing a common ancestor with iguanids and agamids more than 100 mya (agamids being more closely related).",
              "Since fossils have been found in Africa, Europe, and Asia, chameleons were certainly once more widespread than they are today.",
              "Although nearly half of all chameleon species today live in Madagascar, this offers no basis for speculation that chameleons might originate from there.",
              "[32] In fact, it has recently been shown that chameleons most likely originated in mainland Africa.",
              "[15] It appears there were two distinct oceanic migrations from the mainland to Madagascar.",
              "The diverse speciation of chameleons has been theorized to have directly reflected the increase in open habitats (savannah, grassland, and heathland) that accompanied the Oligocene period.",
              "Monophyly of the family is supported by several studies.",
              "[33] Daza et al.",
              "(2016) described a small (10.",
              "6 mm in snout-vent length), probably neonatal lizard preserved in the Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian boundary) amber from Myanmar.",
              "The authors noted that the lizard has \"short and wide skull, large orbits, elongated and robust lingual process, frontal with parallel margins, incipient prefrontal boss, reduced vomers, absent retroarticular process, low presacral vertebral count (between 15 and 17) and extremely short, curled tail\";",
              "the authors considered these traits to be indicative of the lizard's affiliation with Chamaeleonidae.",
              "The phylogenetic analysis conducted by the authors indicated that the lizard was a stem-chamaeleonid.",
              "[34] However, Matsumoto & Evans (2018) reinterpreted this specimen as an albanerpetontid amphibian.",
              "[35] This specimen was given the name Yaksha perettii in 2020, and was noted to have several convergently chameleon-like features, including adaptations for ballistic feeding.",
              "[36] While the exact evolutionary history of color change in chameleons is still unknown, there is one aspect of the evolutionary history of chameleon color change that has already been conclusively studied: the effects of signal efficacy.",
              "Signal efficacy, or how well the signal can be seen against its background, has been shown to correlate directly to the spectral qualities of chameleon displays.",
              "[37] Dwarf chameleons, the chameleon of study, occupy a wide variety of habitats from forests to grasslands to shrubbery.",
              "It was demonstrated that chameleons in brighter areas tended to present brighter signals, but chameleons in darker areas tended to present relatively more contrasting signals to their backgrounds.",
              "This finding suggests that signal efficacy (and thus habitat) has affected the evolution of chameleon signaling.",
              "Stuart-Fox et al.",
              "note that it makes sense that selection for crypsis is not seen to be as important as selection for signal efficacy, because the signals are only shown briefly;",
              "chameleons are almost always muted cryptic colors.",
              "[37] Chameleons vary greatly in size and body structure, with maximum total lengths varying from 22 mm (0.",
              "87 in) in male Brookesia nana (one of the world's smallest reptiles) to 68.",
              "5 cm (27.",
              "0 in) in the male Furcifer oustaleti.",
              "[38][39] Many have head or facial ornamentation, such as nasal protrusions, or horn-like projections in the case of Trioceros jacksonii, or large crests on top of their heads, like Chamaeleo calyptratus.",
              "Many species are sexually dimorphic, and males are typically much more ornamented than the female chameleons.",
              "Typical sizes of species of chameleon commonly kept in captivity or as pets are: The feet of chameleons are highly adapted to arboreal locomotion, and species such as Chamaeleo namaquensis that have secondarily adopted a terrestrial habit have retained the same foot morphology with little modification.",
              "On each foot, the five distinguished toes are grouped into two fascicles.",
              "The toes in each fascicle are bound into a flattened group of either two or three, giving each foot a tongs-like appearance.",
              "On the front feet, the outer, lateral, group contains two toes, whereas the inner, medial, group contains three.",
              "On the rear feet, this arrangement is reversed, the medial group containing two toes, and the lateral group three.",
              "These specialized feet allow chameleons to grip tightly onto narrow or rough branches.",
              "Furthermore, each toe is equipped with a sharp claw to afford a grip on surfaces such as bark when climbing.",
              "It is common to refer to the feet of chameleons as didactyl or zygodactyl, though neither term is fully satisfactory, both being used in describing different feet, such as the zygodactyl feet of parrots or didactyl feet of sloths or ostriches, none of which is significantly like chameleon feet.",
              "Although \"zygodactyl\" is reasonably descriptive of chameleon foot anatomy, their foot structure does not resemble that of parrots, to which the term was first applied.",
              "As for didactyly, chameleons visibly have five toes on each foot, not two.",
              "Some chameleons have a crest of small spikes extending along the spine from the proximal part of the tail to the neck;",
              "both the extent and size of the spikes vary between species and individuals.",
              "These spikes help break up the definitive outline of the chameleon, which aids it when trying to blend into a background.",
              "Chameleons have the most distinctive eyes of any reptile.",
              "The upper and lower eyelids are joined, with only a pinhole large enough for the pupil to see through.",
              "Each eye can pivot and focus independently, allowing the chameleon to observe two different objects simultaneously.",
              "This gives them a full 360-degree arc of vision around their bodies.",
              "Prey is located using monocular depth perception, not stereopsis.",
              "[40] Chameleons have the highest magnification (per size) of any vertebrate,[41] with the highest density of cones in the retina.",
              "[42] Like snakes, chameleons do not have an outer or a middle ear, so there is neither an ear-opening nor an eardrum.",
              "However, chameleons are not deaf: they can detect sound frequencies in the range of 200\u2013600 Hz.",
              "[43] Chameleons can see in both visible and ultraviolet light.",
              "[44] Chameleons exposed to ultraviolet light show increased social behavior and activity levels, are more inclined to bask, feed, and reproduce as it has a positive effect on the pineal gland.",
              "All chameleons are primarily insectivores that feed by ballistically projecting their long tongues from their mouths to capture prey located some distance away.",
              "[45] While the chameleons' tongues are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies (their length excluding the tail), smaller chameleons (both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts.",
              "[46] Thus, smaller chameleons are able to project their tongues greater distances than the larger chameleons that are the subject of most studies and tongue length estimates, and can project their tongues more than twice their body length.",
              "[47] The tongue apparatus consists of highly modified hyoid bones, tongue muscles, and collagenous elements.",
              "[48][49][46][50] The hyoid bone has an elongated, parallel-sided projection, called the entoglossal process, over which a tubular muscle, the accelerator muscle, sits.",
              "[46][50][48][49] The accelerator muscle contracts around the entoglossal process and is responsible for creating the work to power tongue projection, both directly and through the loading of collagenous elements located between the entoglossal process and the accelerator muscle.",
              "[45][46][48][49] The tongue retractor muscle, the hyoglossus, connects the hyoid and accelerator muscle, and is responsible for drawing the tongue back into the mouth following tongue projection.",
              "[45][46][50][48] Tongue projection occurs at extremely high performance, reaching the prey in as little as 0.",
              "07 seconds,[48][49][51] having been launched at accelerations exceeding 41 g.",
              "[51] The power with which the tongue is launched, known to exceed 3000 W kg\u22121, exceeds that which muscle is able to produce, indicating the presence of an elastic power amplifier to power tongue projection.",
              "[49] The recoil of elastic elements in the tongue apparatus is thus responsible for large percentages of the overall tongue projection performance.",
              "One consequence of the incorporation of an elastic recoil mechanism to the tongue projection mechanism is relative thermal insensitivity of tongue projection relative to tongue retraction, which is powered by muscle contraction alone, and is heavily thermally sensitive.",
              "[51][52] While other ectothermic animals become sluggish as their body temperatures decline, due to a reduction in the contractile velocity of their muscles, chameleons are able to project their tongues at high performance even at low body temperatures.",
              "[51][52] The thermal sensitivity of tongue retraction in chameleons, however, is not a problem, as chameleons have a very effective mechanism of holding onto their prey once the tongue has come into contact with it, including surface phenomena, such as wet adhesion and interlocking, and suction.",
              "[53] The thermal insensitivity of tongue projection thus enables chameleons to feed effectively on cold mornings prior to being able to behaviorally elevate their body temperatures through thermoregulation, when other sympatric lizards species are still inactive, likely temporarily expanding their thermal niche as a result.",
              "[51] Tongue structure, with cup-like end Tongue begins strike Capturing prey Bringing prey to the mouth Certain species of chameleons have bones that glow when under ultraviolet light, also known as biogenic fluorescence.",
              "[25] Some 31 different species of Calumma chameleons, all native to Madagascar, displayed this fluorescence in CT scans.",
              "[54] The bones emitted a bright blue glow and could even shine through the chameleon's four layers of skin.",
              "[54] The face was found to have a different glow, appearing as dots otherwise known as tubercles on facial bones.",
              "[25] The glow results from proteins, pigments, chitin, and other materials that make up a chameleon's skeleton,[25] possibly giving chameleons a secondary signaling system that does not interfere with their color-changing ability, and may have evolved from sexual selection.",
              "[25] Chameleons primarily live in the mainland of sub-Saharan Africa and on the island of Madagascar, although a few species live in northern Africa, southern Europe (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta), the Middle East, southeast Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and several smaller islands in the western Indian Ocean.",
              "Introduced, non-native populations are found in California, Hawaii and Florida.",
              "[1] Chameleons are found only in tropical and subtropical regions and inhabit all kinds of lowland and mountain forests, woodlands, shrublands, savannas, and sometimes deserts, but each species tends to be a restricted to only one of a few different habitat types.",
              "The typical chameleons from the subfamily Chamaeleoninae are arboreal, usually living in trees or bushes, although a few (notably the Namaqua chameleon) are partially or largely terrestrial.",
              "The genus Brookesia, which comprises the majority of the species in the subfamily Brookesiinae, live low in vegetation or on the ground among leaf litter.",
              "Many chameleon species have small distributions and are considered threatened.",
              "Declining chameleon numbers are mostly due to habitat loss.",
              "[55] Most chameleons are oviparous, but all Bradypodion species and many Trioceros species are ovoviviparous (although some biologists prefer to avoid the term ovoviviparous because of inconsistencies with its use in some animal groups, instead just using viviparous).",
              "[56] The oviparous species lay eggs three to six weeks after copulation.",
              "The female will dig a hole\u2014from 10\u201330 cm (4\u201312 in), deep depending on the species\u2014and deposit her eggs.",
              "Clutch sizes vary greatly with species.",
              "Small Brookesia species may only lay two to four eggs, while large veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus) have been known to lay clutches of 20\u2013200 (veiled chameleons) and 10\u201340 (panther chameleons) eggs.",
              "Clutch sizes can also vary greatly among the same species.",
              "Eggs generally hatch after four to 12 months, again depending on the species.",
              "The eggs of Parson's chameleon (Calumma parsoni) typically take 400 to 660 days to hatch.",
              "[57] Chameleons lay flexible-shelled eggs which are affected by environmental characteristics during incubation.",
              "The egg mass is the most important in differentiating survivors of Chameleon during incubation.",
              "An increase in egg mass will depend on temperature and water potential.",
              "[58] To understand the dynamics of water potential in Chameleon eggs, the consideration of exerted pressure on eggshells will be essential because the pressure of eggshells play an important role in the water relation of eggs during entire incubation period [59] The ovoviviparous species, such as the Jackson's chameleon (Trioceros jacksonii) have a five- to seven-month gestation period.",
              "Each young chameleon is born within the sticky transparent membrane of its yolk sac.",
              "The mother presses each egg onto a branch, where it sticks.",
              "The membrane bursts and the newly hatched chameleon frees itself and climbs away to hunt for itself and hide from predators.",
              "The female can have up to 30 live young from one gestation.",
