Convergent evolution is the process by which different species evolve similar traits or adaptations in response to similar environmental pressures, even though they are not closely related. There are many fascinating examples of convergent evolution in nature, such as:\n\n- The wings and powered flight of birds, bats and pterosaurs[^3^]. These animals belong to different classes of vertebrates and have very distant common ancestors, but they all evolved the ability to fly by developing wings with different structures and origins.\n- The camera eye of cephalopods (such as octopus), vertebrates (such as mammals) and cnidaria (such as box jellies)[^4^]. These animals have very different evolutionary histories and nervous systems, but they all evolved a complex eye with a lens, iris, pupil and retina that can form sharp images.\n- The saber-toothed anatomy and hunting style of Smilodon (also known as the saber-toothed tiger) and Thylacosmilus[^1^]. These mammals lived in different continents and belonged to different groups (placental and marsupial), but they both evolved giant, downward-curving canines that they used to inflict fatal wounds on their prey.\n- The prickly protrusions of the skin of echidnas, hedgehogs, some tenrecs, Old World porcupines and New World porcupines[^2^]. These mammals are not closely related, but they all evolved spines or quills as a defense mechanism against predators.\n\nThese are just some of the amazing examples of convergent evolution that show how nature can produce similar solutions to similar problems in different ways.",

              "Adaptions may take the form of similar body forms, colors, organs and other adaptions which make up the organism\u2019s phenotype.",
              "Convergent evolution creates analogous structures or \u2019homoplasies\u2019, those which have similar forms or functions between diverged species, but were not present in the common ancestor of the two.",

              "e., a specific organ or bone which appears throughout many different organisms, albeit often in a slightly different form or shape, can indicate a divergence from a common ancestor.",
              "There are several circumstances that can result in convergent evolution.",
              "Often, convergence occurs when organisms are required to adapt to similar environmental conditions, such as in the evolution of thick water-retaining leaves and spines on cacti and Euphorbia species, which are adapted to tolerate conditions of extreme drought but are native to separate continents.",
              "It may also occur when two different organisms occupy a similar niche, for example, the cryptic green coloration of Emerald Tree Boas (Corallus caninus) from South America and Green Tree Pythons (Chondropython viridis) from Australia, both of which live high up in the canopy of similar rainforests and occupy a niche predating upon birds.",
              "Convergence of life cycle and behavioral traits, such as the similar social colony structures between Naked Mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) and many species of social bees and ants, can also take place in order to maximize breeding success of individuals and within colonies.",
              "On a molecular level, the independent evolution of proteins and toxins has also occurred throughout many separate phyla;",
              "for example, sea anemones (Cnidaria), snakes (Vertebrates), scorpions (Arthropods) and cone snails (Molluscs) all produce neurotoxins which act similarly upon the neurotransmitter receptors of their prey.",
              "Convergent evolution can also arise through mimicry complexes, in which organisms evolve to replicate the morphology of other species.",
              "This adaption benefits the mimic either by way of protection when imitating the phenotype of an organism that is toxic or otherwise dangerous (Batesian mimicry), or allowing the mimic to exploit a resource or interaction by being mistaken for the model (Mu\u0308llerian mimicry).",
              "The process of convergent evolution is in contrast to divergent evolution, whereby species which are closely related evolve different traits, and parallel evolution, in which similar traits develop in related, although distinct, species from a common ancestor but from different clades.",
              "A widespread example of convergent evolution is the evolution of wings and powered flight in birds, bats and (now extinct) pterosaurs, each of which belong to a different class of organism and therefore have very distant common ancestors.",
              "Fossil evidence has determined that flight evolved in pterosaurs (flying reptiles of the late Triassic period) around 225mya and in birds around 150mya, while mammalian bats evolved wings around 50-60mya.",
              "The evolution of powered flight has only happened once in each of these lineages, although there are certain organisms, for example, ostrich birds, which have subsequently reverted back to being flightless while retaining their wing structures.",
              "The different wing structures of birds, bats and pterosaurs are each supported by a modified five-fingered limb.",
              "Each limb consists of a humerus a radius and ulna, a thumb and finger bones, and is a homologous structure, containing the same bones that make up the limbs of many animals including humans, whales and crocodiles;",
              "however, the shape of each bone differs greatly between each form.",
              "An elongated fourth finger shapes the pterosaur wing, with the other digits used as claws.",
              "In birds, an elongated radius and ulna, as well as finger bones fused together for strength, support the wing.",
              "Finally, the wings of a bat differ in that they are formed of membrane that is stretched over four elongated fingers.",
              "The reason each of these different bone formations results in the same eventual wing shape is due to the basic physics of flight: wings that were shaped much differently would not allow an animal to fly.",
              "Although birds and pterosaurs share a very distant common ancestor, and birds also share a common ancestor with bats, none of these ancestors had wings or were able to fly.",
              "In each of these lineages, the wing is therefore an analogous structure because the bones have been arranged differently in order to independently achieve a functionally similar structure.",
              "The image above shows the different internal bone structures of wings in: 1) Reptilian pterosaurs (Pterosauria).",
              "2) Mammalian bats (Chiroptera).",
              "3) Birds (Aves).",

              "Separated by the split of continents, mammals evolved to occupy niches in Europe, Africa and America, while marsupials occupied similar niches in Australia and the surrounding islands;",
              "this history has produced many examples of convergent evolution.",
              "Animals from each group developed similar analogous structures depending on factors such as their habitat, feeding habits and locomotion requirements.",

              "The Thylacine (now extinct) filled the same niche as the wolf: an apex predator with sharp teeth, powerful jaws and speed for successful hunting.",
              "Placental Flying Squirrels, and marsupial Sugar Gliders both evolved from the same flightless, common ancestor which split around 65 million years ago.",
              "These two animals are extremely similar in appearance and behavior;",

              "Through convergent evolution, they have also both evolved structures that enable them to glide between the treetops where they live.",
              "The wing-like structures are made of skin, which is stretched between the forelimb and hind limb, and do not enable powered flight.",

              "e., a specific organ or bone which appears throughout many different organisms, albeit often in a slightly different form or shape, can indicate a divergence from a common ancestor.",
              "There are several circumstances that can result in convergent evolution.",
              "Often, convergence occurs when organisms are required to adapt to similar environmental conditions, such as in the evolution of thick water-retaining leaves and spines on cacti and Euphorbia species, which are adapted to tolerate conditions of extreme drought but are native to separate continents.",
              "It may also occur when two different organisms occupy a similar niche, for example, the cryptic green coloration of Emerald Tree Boas (Corallus caninus) from South America and Green Tree Pythons (Chondropython viridis) from Australia, both of which live high up in the canopy of similar rainforests and occupy a niche predating upon birds.",
              "Convergence of life cycle and behavioral traits, such as the similar social colony structures between Naked Mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) and many species of social bees and ants, can also take place in order to maximize breeding success of individuals and within colonies.",
              "On a molecular level, the independent evolution of proteins and toxins has also occurred throughout many separate phyla;",
              "for example, sea anemones (Cnidaria), snakes (Vertebrates), scorpions (Arthropods) and cone snails (Molluscs) all produce neurotoxins which act similarly upon the neurotransmitter receptors of their prey.",
              "Convergent evolution can also arise through mimicry complexes, in which organisms evolve to replicate the morphology of other species.",
              "This adaption benefits the mimic either by way of protection when imitating the phenotype of an organism that is toxic or otherwise dangerous (Batesian mimicry), or allowing the mimic to exploit a resource or interaction by being mistaken for the model (Mu\u0308llerian mimicry).",
              "The process of convergent evolution is in contrast to divergent evolution, whereby species which are closely related evolve different traits, and parallel evolution, in which similar traits develop in related, although distinct, species from a common ancestor but from different clades.",
              "A widespread example of convergent evolution is the evolution of wings and powered flight in birds, bats and (now extinct) pterosaurs, each of which belong to a different class of organism and therefore have very distant common ancestors.",
              "Fossil evidence has determined that flight evolved in pterosaurs (flying reptiles of the late Triassic period) around 225mya and in birds around 150mya, while mammalian bats evolved wings around 50-60mya.",

              "Finally, the wings of a bat differ in that they are formed of membrane that is stretched over four elongated fingers.",
              "The reason each of these different bone formations results in the same eventual wing shape is due to the basic physics of flight: wings that were shaped much differently would not allow an animal to fly.",
              "Although birds and pterosaurs share a very distant common ancestor, and birds also share a common ancestor with bats, none of these ancestors had wings or were able to fly.",

              "The opposite of convergence is divergent evolution, where related species evolve different traits.",
              "Convergent evolution is similar to parallel evolution, which occurs when two independent species evolve in the same direction and thus independently acquire similar characteristics;",
              "for instance, gliding frogs have evolved in parallel from multiple types of tree frog.",
              "Many instances of convergent evolution are known in plants, including the repeated development of C4 photosynthesis, seed dispersal by fleshy fruits adapted to be eaten by animals, and carnivory.",
              "Convergent evolution is also observed in non-biological structures.",
              "In morphology, analogous traits arise when different species live in similar ways and/or a similar environment, and so face the same environmental factors.",
              "When occupying similar ecological niches (that is, a distinctive way of life) similar problems can lead to similar solutions.",

              "[4] In biochemistry, physical and chemical constraints on mechanisms have caused some active site arrangements such as the catalytic triad to evolve independently in separate enzyme superfamilies.",
              "[5] In his 1989 book Wonderful Life, Stephen Jay Gould argued that if one could \"rewind the tape of life [and] the same conditions were encountered again, evolution could take a very different course.\"",
              "[6] Simon Conway Morris disputes this conclusion, arguing that convergence is a dominant force in evolution, and given that the same environmental and physical constraints are at work, life will inevitably evolve toward an \"optimum\" body plan, and at some point, evolution is bound to stumble upon intelligence, a trait presently identified with at least primates, corvids, and cetaceans.",
              "[7] In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait shared by two or more taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry.",
              "Taxa which do share ancestry are part of the same clade;",
              "cladistics seeks to arrange them according to their degree of relatedness to describe their phylogeny.",
              "Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, from the point of view of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.",
              "[8][9][10][11] In some cases, it is difficult to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later.",

              "[b] Some scientists have argued that there is a continuum between parallel and convergent evolution,[13][14] while others maintain that despite some overlap, there are still important distinctions between the two.",
              "[15][16] When the ancestral forms are unspecified or unknown, or the range of traits considered is not clearly specified, the distinction between parallel and convergent evolution becomes more subjective.",
              "For instance, the striking example of similar placental and marsupial forms is described by Richard Dawkins in The Blind Watchmaker as a case of convergent evolution, because mammals on each continent had a long evolutionary history prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs under which to accumulate relevant differences.",
              "[17] The enzymology of proteases provides some of the clearest examples of convergent evolution.",

              "[34] The fusiform bodyshape (a tube tapered at both ends) adopted by many aquatic animals is an adaptation to enable them to travel at high speed in a high drag environment.",
              "[35] Similar body shapes are found in the earless seals and the eared seals: they still have four legs, but these are strongly modified for swimming.",
              "[36] The marsupial fauna of Australia and the placental mammals of the Old World have several strikingly similar forms, developed in two clades, isolated from each other.",

              "[38] The Gymnotiformes of South America and the Mormyridae of Africa independently evolved passive electroreception (around 119 and 110 million years ago, respectively).",
              "Around 20 million years after acquiring that ability, both groups evolved active electrogenesis, producing weak electric fields to help them detect prey.",

              "[41] Their last common ancestor had at most a simple photoreceptive spot, but a range of processes led to the progressive refinement of camera eyes\u2014with one sharp difference: the cephalopod eye is \"wired\" in the opposite direction, with blood and nerve vessels entering from the back of the retina, rather than the front as in vertebrates.",
              "As a result, cephalopods lack a blind spot.",
              "[7] Birds and bats have homologous limbs because they are both ultimately derived from terrestrial tetrapods, but their flight mechanisms are only analogous, so their wings are examples of functional convergence.",
              "The two groups have independently evolved their own means of powered flight.",
              "Their wings differ substantially in construction.",
              "The bat wing is a membrane stretched across four extremely elongated fingers and the legs.",
              "The airfoil of the bird wing is made of feathers, strongly attached to the forearm (the ulna) and the highly fused bones of the wrist and hand (the carpometacarpus), with only tiny remnants of two fingers remaining, each anchoring a single feather.",
              "So, while the wings of bats and birds are functionally convergent, they are not anatomically convergent.",
              "[3][42] Birds and bats also share a high concentration of cerebrosides in the skin of their wings.",
              "This improves skin flexibility, a trait useful for flying animals;",
              "other mammals have a far lower concentration.",
              "[43] The extinct pterosaurs independently evolved wings from their fore- and hindlimbs, while insects have wings that evolved separately from different organs.",
              "[44] Flying squirrels and sugar gliders are much alike in their body plans, with gliding wings stretched between their limbs, but flying squirrels are placental mammals while sugar gliders are marsupials, widely separated within the mammal lineage from the placentals.",
              "[45] Hummingbird hawk-moths and hummingbirds have evolved similar flight and feeding patterns.",
              "[46] Insect mouthparts show many examples of convergent evolution.",
              "The mouthparts of different insect groups consist of a set of homologous organs, specialised for the dietary intake of that insect group.",
              "Convergent evolution of many groups of insects led from original biting-chewing mouthparts to different, more specialised, derived function types.",
              "These include, for example, the proboscis of flower-visiting insects such as bees and flower beetles,[47][48][49] or the biting-sucking mouthparts of blood-sucking insects such as fleas and mosquitos.",
              "Opposable thumbs allowing the grasping of objects are most often associated with primates, like humans, monkeys, apes, and lemurs.",
              "Opposable thumbs also evolved in giant pandas, but these are completely different in structure, having six fingers including the thumb, which develops from a wrist bone entirely separately from other fingers.",
              "[50] Convergent evolution in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour.",
              "[51] When humans migrated out of Africa, they moved to more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight.",
              "[51] It was beneficial to them to reduce their skin pigmentation.",
              "[51] It appears certain that there was some lightening of skin colour before European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups.",
              "[51] However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.",
              "[51] Lemurs and humans are both primates.",
              "Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today.",
              "The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans has been studied in detail and much is known about it.",
              "It is not the case that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue eye colour.",

              "In lemurs, the differences between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.",
              "[52] While convergent evolution is often illustrated with animal examples, it has often occurred in plant evolution.",
              "For instance, C4 photosynthesis, one of the three major carbon-fixing biochemical processes, has arisen independently up to 40 times.",
              "[53][54] About 7,600 plant species of angiosperms use C4 carbon fixation, with many monocots including 46% of grasses such as maize and sugar cane,[55][56] and dicots including several species in the Chenopodiaceae and the Amaranthaceae.",
              "[57][58] A good example of convergence in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples.",
              "These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium.",
              "Other edible fruits include other plant tissues;",
              "[59] for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is the walls of the pericarp.",
              "[60] This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.",
              "[61] Seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory) has evolved independently more than 100 times, and is present in more than 11,000 plant species.",
              "It is one of the most dramatic examples of convergent evolution in biology.",

              "These changes were not at the enzymes' catalytic sites, but rather on the exposed surfaces of the proteins, where they might interact with other components of the cell or the digestive fluid.",
              "The authors also found that homologous genes in the non-carnivorous plant Arabidopsis thaliana tend to have their expression increased when the plant is stressed, leading the authors to suggest that stress-responsive proteins have often been co-opted[c] in the repeated evolution of carnivory.",
              "[63] Phylogenetic reconstruction and ancestral state reconstruction proceed by assuming that evolution has occurred without convergence.",
              "Convergent patterns may, however, appear at higher levels in a phylogenetic reconstruction, and are sometimes explicitly sought by investigators.",
              "The methods applied to infer convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected.",
              "Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits.",
              "Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of natural selection.",
              "[64] Earlier methods for measuring convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny.",
              "[65][66] More recent methods also quantify the strength of convergence.",
              "[67] One drawback to keep in mind is that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities.",
              "Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.",
              "[64] Distance-based measures assess the degree of similarity between lineages over time.",

              "Adaptions may take the form of similar body forms, colors, organs and other adaptions which make up the organism\u2019s phenotype.",
              "Convergent evolution creates analogous structures or \u2019homoplasies\u2019, those which have similar forms or functions between diverged species, but were not present in the common ancestor of the two.",
              "On the other hand, homologous structures, i.",
              "e., a specific organ or bone which appears throughout many different organisms, albeit often in a slightly different form or shape, can indicate a divergence from a common ancestor.",
              "There are several circumstances that can result in convergent evolution.",
              "Often, convergence occurs when organisms are required to adapt to similar environmental conditions, such as in the evolution of thick water-retaining leaves and spines on cacti and Euphorbia species, which are adapted to tolerate conditions of extreme drought but are native to separate continents.",
              "It may also occur when two different organisms occupy a similar niche, for example, the cryptic green coloration of Emerald Tree Boas (Corallus caninus) from South America and Green Tree Pythons (Chondropython viridis) from Australia, both of which live high up in the canopy of similar rainforests and occupy a niche predating upon birds.",
              "Convergence of life cycle and behavioral traits, such as the similar social colony structures between Naked Mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) and many species of social bees and ants, can also take place in order to maximize breeding success of individuals and within colonies.",
              "On a molecular level, the independent evolution of proteins and toxins has also occurred throughout many separate phyla;",
              "for example, sea anemones (Cnidaria), snakes (Vertebrates), scorpions (Arthropods) and cone snails (Molluscs) all produce neurotoxins which act similarly upon the neurotransmitter receptors of their prey.",
              "Convergent evolution can also arise through mimicry complexes, in which organisms evolve to replicate the morphology of other species.",
              "This adaption benefits the mimic either by way of protection when imitating the phenotype of an organism that is toxic or otherwise dangerous (Batesian mimicry), or allowing the mimic to exploit a resource or interaction by being mistaken for the model (Mu\u0308llerian mimicry).",
              "The process of convergent evolution is in contrast to divergent evolution, whereby species which are closely related evolve different traits, and parallel evolution, in which similar traits develop in related, although distinct, species from a common ancestor but from different clades.",
              "A widespread example of convergent evolution is the evolution of wings and powered flight in birds, bats and (now extinct) pterosaurs, each of which belong to a different class of organism and therefore have very distant common ancestors.",
              "Fossil evidence has determined that flight evolved in pterosaurs (flying reptiles of the late Triassic period) around 225mya and in birds around 150mya, while mammalian bats evolved wings around 50-60mya.",
              "The evolution of powered flight has only happened once in each of these lineages, although there are certain organisms, for example, ostrich birds, which have subsequently reverted back to being flightless while retaining their wing structures.",
              "The different wing structures of birds, bats and pterosaurs are each supported by a modified five-fingered limb.",
              "Each limb consists of a humerus a radius and ulna, a thumb and finger bones, and is a homologous structure, containing the same bones that make up the limbs of many animals including humans, whales and crocodiles;",
              "however, the shape of each bone differs greatly between each form.",
              "An elongated fourth finger shapes the pterosaur wing, with the other digits used as claws.",
              "In birds, an elongated radius and ulna, as well as finger bones fused together for strength, support the wing.",
              "Finally, the wings of a bat differ in that they are formed of membrane that is stretched over four elongated fingers.",
              "The reason each of these different bone formations results in the same eventual wing shape is due to the basic physics of flight: wings that were shaped much differently would not allow an animal to fly.",
              "Although birds and pterosaurs share a very distant common ancestor, and birds also share a common ancestor with bats, none of these ancestors had wings or were able to fly.",
              "In each of these lineages, the wing is therefore an analogous structure because the bones have been arranged differently in order to independently achieve a functionally similar structure.",
              "The image above shows the different internal bone structures of wings in: 1) Reptilian pterosaurs (Pterosauria).",
              "2) Mammalian bats (Chiroptera).",

              "Separated by the split of continents, mammals evolved to occupy niches in Europe, Africa and America, while marsupials occupied similar niches in Australia and the surrounding islands;",
              "this history has produced many examples of convergent evolution.",

              "Placental Flying Squirrels, and marsupial Sugar Gliders both evolved from the same flightless, common ancestor which split around 65 million years ago.",

              "they are approximately the same size, they have large eyes for foraging in the dark, they are coated with soft fur, and have light underbellies.",
              "Through convergent evolution, they have also both evolved structures that enable them to glide between the treetops where they live.",
              "The wing-like structures are made of skin, which is stretched between the forelimb and hind limb, and do not enable powered flight.",
              "Nonetheless, it is theorized that these may be analogous structures that appear as a precursor to flight.",

              "Recent methods, like Ercoli and Prevosti's (2011) linear regressions on postcranial elements that directly support the body's weight (such as tibiae, humeri and ulnae), comparing Thylacosmilus to both extinct and modern carnivorans and metatherians, suggest that it weighed between 80 and 120 kilograms (180 and 260 lb),[12][13] with one estimate suggesting up to 150 kg (330 lb),[14] about the same size as a modern jaguar.",

              "In any case, the weight estimations are consistent for terrestrial species that are generalists or have some degree of cursoriality.",
              "[13] A weight in this range would make Thylacosmilus one of the largest known carnivorous metatherians.",
              "Thylacosmilus had large, saber-like canines.",
              "The roots of these canines grew throughout the animal's life, growing in an arc up the maxilla and above the orbits.",
              "[15] Thylacosmilus teeth are in many aspects even more specialized than the teeth of other sabertoothed predators.",
              "In these animals the predatory function of the \"sabres\" gave rise to a specialization of the general dentition, in which some teeth were reduced or lost.",

              "[16] However, evidence in the form of wear facets on the internal sides of the lower canines of Thylacosmilus indicate that the animal did indeed have incisors, though they remain hitherto unknown due to poor fossilization and the fact that no specimen thus far has been preserved with its premaxilla intact.",
              "[17] In Thylacosmilus there is also evidence of the reduction of postcanine teeth, which developed only a tearing cusp, as a continuation of the general trend observed in other sparassodonts, which lost many of the grinding surfaces in the premolars and molars.",
              "The canines were hypsodont and more anchored in the skull, with more than half of the tooth contained within the alveoli, which were extended over the braincase.",

              "The teeth had open roots and grew constantly, which eroded the abrasion marks that are present in the surface of the enamel of other sabertooths, such as Smilodon.",
              "The sharp serrations of the canines were maintained by the action of the wear with the lower canines, a process known as thegosis.",
              "[16] The convex upper portion of the maxilla is ornamented with extensive furrows and pits.",
              "This texturing has been correlated with an extensive network of blood vessels, which may suggest that the upper maxilla was covered by some form of soft tissue[18] which tentatively has been hypothesized as a \"horn covering\" (keratinous structure).",
              "[19] Although the postcranial remains of Thylacosmilus are incomplete, the elements recovered so far allow the examination of characteristics that this animal acquired in convergence with the sabertooth felids.",
              "Its cervical vertebrae were very strong and to some extent resembled the vertebrae of Machairodontinae;",
              "[20] also the cervical vertebrae have neural apophysis well developed, along with ventral apophysis in some cervicals, an element that is characteristic of other borhyaenoids.",
              "The lumbar vertebrae are short and more rigid than in Prothylacynus.",
              "The bones of the limbs, like the humerus and femur, are very robust, since they probably had to deal with larger forces than in the modern felids.",
              "In particular, the features of the humerus suggest a great development of the pectoral and deltoid muscles, not only required to capture its prey, also to absorb the energy of the impact of the collision with such prey.",
              "[21] The features of the hindlimb, with a robust femur equipped with a greater trochanter in the lower part, the short tibia and plantigrade feet shows that this animal was not a runner, and probably stalked its prey animals.",
              "The hindlimbs also allowed a certain mobility of the hip, and possibly the ability to stand up only with its hindlimbs, like Prothylacynus and Borhyaena.",
              "Contrary to felids, barbourofelids and nimravids, the claws of Thylacosmilus were not retractable.",

              "Its skull was similar to that of Smilodon in that it was much better adapted to withstand loads applied by the neck musculature, which, along with evidence for powerful and flexible forelimb musculature and other skeleton adaptations for stability, support the hypothesis that its killing method consisted on immobilization of its prey followed by precisely directed, deep bites into the soft tissue driven by powerful neck muscles.",
              "[22][23][24] It has been suggested that its specialized predatory lifestyle could be linked to more extensive parental care than in modern marsupial predators, due that the killing technique only could be used by adult individuals with a full development of its peculiar dental anatomy and grasping abilities;",
              "it could require some time for young individuals to learn the necessary skills, although there are no clear evidence in the fossils Thylacosmilus, and this kind of cooperative behavior is unknown in modern marsupials.",

              "and MMP[note 1] 1443 (from the Chapadmalalan age in Buenos Aires Province), which is a complete, artificial cast that shows some ventral displacement but with the anterior right part of the brain hemisphere and olfactory bulb.",
              "Quiroga's analysis showed that the somatic nervous system of Thylacosmilus represented 27% of the entire cortex, with the visual area representing 18% and the auditory area 7%.",
              "The paleocortex was more than 8%.",
              "The sulci of the cortex are relatively complex and similar in pattern and number to the modern diprotodont marsupials.",
              "Compared with Macropus and Trichosurus, Thylacosmilus had less development of the maxillar area with respect to the mandibular area, and the rhinal fissure is taller than in Macropus and Thylacinus.",
              "This disproportion between the maxillar and mandibular areas, which are roughly similar in marsupials, seems to be a consequence of the extreme development of the neck and mandibular musculature, used in the functioning of the osteodentary anatomy of this animal.",
              "However, the area dedicated to the oral-mandible region comprises 42% of the somatic area.",
              "The comparison between the endocranial casts of Thylacosmilus and a proterotherid specimen (possibly a species coevolving with Thylacosmilus and a potential prey item) indicates that Thylacosmilus had only half of the encephalization and a quarter of the cortical area, however it has more somatized areas, similar visual areas and less auditory area, which suggests different sensomotoric qualities between both animals.",
              "[25] The analysis published by Christine Argot in 2002 about the evolution of predatory borhyaenoids suggests that Thylacosmilus was a specialized form, which have a limited stereoscopic vision with small eyes, with an overlap of 50-60\u00b0, very low compared with modern predators, but the ossified and great auditory bulla and the muscular body would indicate that it could be an ambush predator in open and relatively dry environments, where the sound absorption is lesser than in more humid areas, and the acute hearing could compensate the limited vision.",
              "Argot suggested that Thylacosmilus maybe was a nocturnal hunter, as modern lions.",
              "[21] Studies published in 2023 by Gaillard et al.",
              "suggest that despite the unique placement and divergences of the eyes, Thylacosmilus was still granted some stereoscopic visual capability as a result of the frontation and verticality of its eye orbits, with this adaptation being a trade-off as a result of the unique morphology of its teeth, which never stopped growing.",
              "This study also suggests that Thylacosmilus was largely unimpeded in predatory capability by the reduction in binocular vision created by its hypertrophied canines.",
              "[26] A 2005 study published by Wroe et al.",
              "analysing bite-forces with the use of regressions on body mass and applying the model of \"dry skull\" in which the jaw is modeled as a lever based in relations between the skull dimensions and the jaw muscles, was employed in some extinct and extant placental and metatherian predatory mammals.",
              "Thylacosmilus atrox reached the lowest value in that analysis, just barely surpassed by Smilodon fatalis.",
              "The authors concluded that both taxa, with low bite forces and peculiar cranial and postcranial anatomies, had a killing technique to dispatch large bodied prey without a true analogue between modern taxa.",
              "[27] An analysis by Goswami et al.",
              "in 2010 tested if the metatherian mode of reproduction has produced any constraint in their cranial morphological evolution.",
              "Using landmarks in the skulls of several eutherian and metatherian meat-eating lineages, they compared the ecomorphological convergences in these groups.",
              "Metatherian lineages, including specialised forms as Thylacoleo and Thylacosmilus, showed values in morphospace more similar to caniniforms than felids, due that even the shortening of the skull and reduction of postcanine teeth are not so drastic as in felids, despite them often being compared to feliform eutherians.",
              "The study shows that in any case, metatherians could be so diverse in cranial diversity as its eutherian counterparts, even with very extreme forms as Thylacosmilus itself and that the metatherian development doesn't have any significative role in cranial evolution.",
              "[28] A 2020 study found several functional disparities between Thylacosmilus's cranial anatomy and that of saber-toothed eutherians that cannot be explained by its metatherian status, such as the lack of a jaw symphysis, subtriangular canines instead of blade-like ones, lack of incisors (that would render feline-like feeding behaviours impossible), weak jaw musculature and unaligned teeth with no evidence of shearing activity, as well as a post-cranial skeleton more akin to that of a bear than a cursorial predator like a cat.",
              "This study very tentatively suggests that Thylacosmilus might have been an intestine specialist that slashed open and sucked up the carcass' entrails.",
              "[18] A 2021 statistical analysis conversely concluded that Thylacosmilus killed in the same manner as other sabre-tooths, because the premaxillary area, the carnassial region, and the nape of Smilodon, Homotherium, Barbourofelis, and Thylacosmilus are all similarly developed, which they presumed was to, respectively, withstand high bite forces, maximise gape, and strengthen neck-driven head pulling.",
              "Thylacosmilus scored closest to Barbourofelis.",
              "[29] An isotope ratio study, using stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen from the tooth enamel of several mammals from the Pampean region from the Late Miocene to Late Pleistocene, was published by Domingo et al.",
              "in 2020 and indicates that the favoured prey of Thylacosmilus were grazers, mainly notoungulates from open areas.",
              "This diet seems to coincide with the expansion of vast grasslands of C4 plants in southern South America and the increasing of aridity and lower temperatures, in the interval between 11 million and 3 million years ago known as Edad de las Planicies Australes (\"Age of the Southern Plains\", in Spanish).",
              "[30] Various studies have been published on the musculature and motion of Thylacosmilus.",
              "The analysis made by William Turnbull published in 1976[31] and 1978[16] included a reconstruction of the masticatory muscles of Thylacosmilus modelling them with plasticine over a cast of the skull and following the muscle scars on the surface of the fossil, then making a rubber model of the musculature and calculating the percentage of weight of these muscles compared with recent mammals, he concluded that the muscles involved in jaw closing in this animal were not unusual in size neither in form, compared with modern carnivore mammals, even indicating that they weren't so reduced as in the machairodont felids.",
              "Turnbull concluded that in Thylacosmilus these masticatory muscles was not involved at all in the use of the sabertooth canines, which depended of the large neck muscles and the flexion of the head to be used killing the prey, combining in a sense the stabbing and slashing techniques from \"dirk-toothed\" and \"scimitar\" sabertooths.",
              "[16] The comparative studies of Argot 2004, indicates that the basicranium had rugose crests that served as attachments for the neck flexor muscles, which are associated to the increase of the bite strength.",
              "The deltopectoral crest is large, with 60% of the length of the humerus, which is correlated with musculature to manipulate heavy prey.",
              "This animal had an absent entepicondylar foramen in the humerus, which is correlated with the reduction of the abduction movement in that bone in cursorial ungulates and carnivores (Borhyaena also show this condition), although it contrasts with its probable powerful adductor muscles.",
              "Although the lumbar vertebrae are not completely known, the two last ones are known and suggest for its vertical neural process that there is not an anticlinal vertebra;",
              "probably the muscles of the back (m.",
              "longissimus dorsi) acted to stabilize the column and contribute to body propulsion, as occurs in Smilodon, which contrast with more flexible backs of the closest relatives of these sabertooth taxa.",
              "[21] Based on studies of its habitat, Thylacosmilus is believed to have hunted in savanna-like or sparsely forested areas, avoiding the more open plains where it would have faced competition with the more successful and aggressive Phorusrhacids and the giant vulture-like Teratornithid Argentavis.",
              "[32] Fossils of Thylacosmilus have been found in the Huayquerian (Late Miocene) Ituzaingo\u0301, Epecue\u0301n, and Cerro Azul Formations and the Montehermosan (Early Pliocene) Brochero and Monte Hermoso Formations in Argentina.",
              "[33] Although older references have often stated that Thylacosmilus became extinct due to competition with the \"more competitive\" saber-toothed cat Smilodon during the Great American Interchange, newer studies have shown this is not the case.",
              "Thylacosmilus died out during the Pliocene (3.",
              "6 to 2.",
              "58 Ma) whereas saber-toothed cats are not known from South America until the Middle Pleistocene (781,000 to 126,000 years ago).",

              "First, it carried its young in a pouch like a kangaroo.",
              "And the canines of Thylacosmilus and Smilodon rested in different places.",
              "Instead of having its teeth fully exposed outside of its mouth like Smilodon, Thylacosmilus had flanges formed from its lower jaw.",
              "These protrusions of bone functioned somewhat like scabbards, protecting the animal\u2019s canines when its mouth was closed.",
              "Beyond these differences, the animals were thought to have filled the same ecological ambush niche.",
              "Yet, upon closer examination, Christine Janis of the University of Bristol in England had doubts.",
              "After more Thylacosmilus fossils were uncovered in South America, it became clear that the marsupial lacked the upper incisors that sit between the sharp canines.",
              "This struck Dr.",
              "Janis as strange, because great cats today like lions and jaguars depend on these teeth to get meat off bones.",
              "She also knew from previous work conducted by other labs that the canines of Thylacosmilus were structurally different from the teeth of Smilodon because of their triangular shape.",
              "\u201cThose big canines had everyone mesmerized, nobody seemed to notice that they were actually shaped like claws rather than blades.",
              "We almost named the paper \u2018Blinded by the Tooth,\u2019\u201d Dr.",
              "Janis said.",
              "These differences raised questions and led her to collaborate with other researchers to conduct a detailed analysis of the ancient marsupial.",
              "After simulations of skull and tooth performance were run with models of skulls generated from computed tomography, the researchers discovered that the marsupial\u2019s skull was considerably weaker than that of Smilodon and was not robust enough to support a saber-tooth-style stabbing bite.",
              "Instead, the simulations suggested that Thylacosmilus was excellent at making the strong pulling actions that are commonly used by scavengers, like hyenas, to rip carcasses apart.",
              "The microscopic wear marks on the marsupial\u2019s other teeth were also odd.",
              "Rather than showing evidence of biting and chewing bones, as is commonly found in large cats today and seen on the teeth of Smilodon, the teeth of Thylacosmilus show wear marks consistent with a diet of very soft meat, but not bones, similar to what cheetahs eat today.",
              "Dr.",
              "Janis reported in the journal PeerJ last month that the findings reveal an animal that was definitely not a marsupial version of Smilodon.",
              "As for what it was actually doing, she proposes that Thylacosmilus was a scavenger that employed its huge canines to rip carcasses apart and then gobbled up organs.",
              "She further suggests that, like walruses and anteaters that lack incisors and have very long tongues, Thylacosmilus slid its tongue into bodies to extract these innards.",
              "In essence, she argues it was a specialist organ feeder unlike anything living today.",
              "Others in the field are not quite ready to embrace all that Dr.",
              "Janis is proposing.",
              "\u201cI am willing to entertain the notion that Thylacosmilus was a scavenger, but calling it a specialist organ feeder may be going a bit far,\u201d said Blaire Van Valkenburgh, a paleontologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
              "\u201d The trouble is with the tongue.",
              "\u201cAs I was reading about the missing incisors in the paper, I too thought that maybe these animals had a spectacular tongue with lots of stiff papillae that allowed them to rapidly clean bones of flesh,\u201d Dr.",
              "Van Valkenburgh said.",
              "Unfortunately, unlike bones, tongues rot away when animals die.",

              "He also found it hard to explain how two sympatric species (related species that lived in the same area at the same time) would be virtually identical in their specializations.",
              "Marshall also suggested Hyaenodonops could be cogeneric, though it was impossible to determine from the available specimens.",
              "[5][6] Though Thylacosmilus is one of several predatory mammal genera typically called \"saber-toothed cats\", it was not a felid placentalian, but a sparassodont, a group closely related to marsupials, and only superficially resembled other saber-toothed mammals due to convergent evolution.",
              "[7][8] The term \"saber-tooth\" refers to an ecomorph consisting of various groups of extinct predatory synapsids (mammals and close relatives), which convergently evolved extremely long maxillary canines, as well as adaptations to the skull and skeleton related to their use.",

              "Recent methods, like Ercoli and Prevosti's (2011) linear regressions on postcranial elements that directly support the body's weight (such as tibiae, humeri and ulnae), comparing Thylacosmilus to both extinct and modern carnivorans and metatherians, suggest that it weighed between 80 and 120 kilograms (180 and 260 lb),[12][13] with one estimate suggesting up to 150 kg (330 lb),[14] about the same size as a modern jaguar.",
              "The differences in weight estimations may be due to the individual size variation of the specimens studied in each analysis, as well as the different samples and methods used.",
              "In any case, the weight estimations are consistent for terrestrial species that are generalists or have some degree of cursoriality.",
              "[13] A weight in this range would make Thylacosmilus one of the largest known carnivorous metatherians.",
              "Thylacosmilus had large, saber-like canines.",
              "The roots of these canines grew throughout the animal's life, growing in an arc up the maxilla and above the orbits.",
              "[15] Thylacosmilus teeth are in many aspects even more specialized than the teeth of other sabertoothed predators.",
              "In these animals the predatory function of the \"sabres\" gave rise to a specialization of the general dentition, in which some teeth were reduced or lost.",
              "In Thylacosmilus the canines are relatively longer and more slender, relatively triangular in cross-section, in contrast with the oval shape of carnivorans' saber-like canines.",
              "The function of these large canines was once thought to have apparently even eliminated the need for functional incisors, while carnivorans like Smilodon and Barbourofelis still have a full set of incisors.",
              "[16] However, evidence in the form of wear facets on the internal sides of the lower canines of Thylacosmilus indicate that the animal did indeed have incisors, though they remain hitherto unknown due to poor fossilization and the fact that no specimen thus far has been preserved with its premaxilla intact.",
              "[17] In Thylacosmilus there is also evidence of the reduction of postcanine teeth, which developed only a tearing cusp, as a continuation of the general trend observed in other sparassodonts, which lost many of the grinding surfaces in the premolars and molars.",
              "The canines were hypsodont and more anchored in the skull, with more than half of the tooth contained within the alveoli, which were extended over the braincase.",
              "They were protected by the large symphyseal flange and they were powered by the highly developed musculature of the neck, which allowed forceful downward and backward movements of the head.",
              "The canines had only a thin layer of enamel, just 0.",
              "25 mm in its maximum depth at the lateral facets, this depth being consistent down the length of the teeth.",
              "The teeth had open roots and grew constantly, which eroded the abrasion marks that are present in the surface of the enamel of other sabertooths, such as Smilodon.",
              "The sharp serrations of the canines were maintained by the action of the wear with the lower canines, a process known as thegosis.",
              "[16] The convex upper portion of the maxilla is ornamented with extensive furrows and pits.",
              "This texturing has been correlated with an extensive network of blood vessels, which may suggest that the upper maxilla was covered by some form of soft tissue[18] which tentatively has been hypothesized as a \"horn covering\" (keratinous structure).",
              "[19] Although the postcranial remains of Thylacosmilus are incomplete, the elements recovered so far allow the examination of characteristics that this animal acquired in convergence with the sabertooth felids.",
              "Its cervical vertebrae were very strong and to some extent resembled the vertebrae of Machairodontinae;",
              "[20] also the cervical vertebrae have neural apophysis well developed, along with ventral apophysis in some cervicals, an element that is characteristic of other borhyaenoids.",
              "The lumbar vertebrae are short and more rigid than in Prothylacynus.",
              "The bones of the limbs, like the humerus and femur, are very robust, since they probably had to deal with larger forces than in the modern felids.",
              "In particular, the features of the humerus suggest a great development of the pectoral and deltoid muscles, not only required to capture its prey, also to absorb the energy of the impact of the collision with such prey.",
              "[21] The features of the hindlimb, with a robust femur equipped with a greater trochanter in the lower part, the short tibia and plantigrade feet shows that this animal was not a runner, and probably stalked its prey animals.",
              "The hindlimbs also allowed a certain mobility of the hip, and possibly the ability to stand up only with its hindlimbs, like Prothylacynus and Borhyaena.",
              "Contrary to felids, barbourofelids and nimravids, the claws of Thylacosmilus were not retractable.",

              "5 lbf), much weaker than that of a leopard, suggesting its jaw muscles had an insignificant role in the dispatch of prey.",
              "Its skull was similar to that of Smilodon in that it was much better adapted to withstand loads applied by the neck musculature, which, along with evidence for powerful and flexible forelimb musculature and other skeleton adaptations for stability, support the hypothesis that its killing method consisted on immobilization of its prey followed by precisely directed, deep bites into the soft tissue driven by powerful neck muscles.",
              "[22][23][24] It has been suggested that its specialized predatory lifestyle could be linked to more extensive parental care than in modern marsupial predators, due that the killing technique only could be used by adult individuals with a full development of its peculiar dental anatomy and grasping abilities;",
              "it could require some time for young individuals to learn the necessary skills, although there are no clear evidence in the fossils Thylacosmilus, and this kind of cooperative behavior is unknown in modern marsupials.",

              "and MMP[note 1] 1443 (from the Chapadmalalan age in Buenos Aires Province), which is a complete, artificial cast that shows some ventral displacement but with the anterior right part of the brain hemisphere and olfactory bulb.",
              "Quiroga's analysis showed that the somatic nervous system of Thylacosmilus represented 27% of the entire cortex, with the visual area representing 18% and the auditory area 7%.",
              "The paleocortex was more than 8%.",
              "The sulci of the cortex are relatively complex and similar in pattern and number to the modern diprotodont marsupials.",
              "Compared with Macropus and Trichosurus, Thylacosmilus had less development of the maxillar area with respect to the mandibular area, and the rhinal fissure is taller than in Macropus and Thylacinus.",
              "This disproportion between the maxillar and mandibular areas, which are roughly similar in marsupials, seems to be a consequence of the extreme development of the neck and mandibular musculature, used in the functioning of the osteodentary anatomy of this animal.",
              "However, the area dedicated to the oral-mandible region comprises 42% of the somatic area.",
              "The comparison between the endocranial casts of Thylacosmilus and a proterotherid specimen (possibly a species coevolving with Thylacosmilus and a potential prey item) indicates that Thylacosmilus had only half of the encephalization and a quarter of the cortical area, however it has more somatized areas, similar visual areas and less auditory area, which suggests different sensomotoric qualities between both animals.",
              "[25] The analysis published by Christine Argot in 2002 about the evolution of predatory borhyaenoids suggests that Thylacosmilus was a specialized form, which have a limited stereoscopic vision with small eyes, with an overlap of 50-60\u00b0, very low compared with modern predators, but the ossified and great auditory bulla and the muscular body would indicate that it could be an ambush predator in open and relatively dry environments, where the sound absorption is lesser than in more humid areas, and the acute hearing could compensate the limited vision.",
              "Argot suggested that Thylacosmilus maybe was a nocturnal hunter, as modern lions.",
              "[21] Studies published in 2023 by Gaillard et al.",
              "suggest that despite the unique placement and divergences of the eyes, Thylacosmilus was still granted some stereoscopic visual capability as a result of the frontation and verticality of its eye orbits, with this adaptation being a trade-off as a result of the unique morphology of its teeth, which never stopped growing.",
              "This study also suggests that Thylacosmilus was largely unimpeded in predatory capability by the reduction in binocular vision created by its hypertrophied canines.",
              "[26] A 2005 study published by Wroe et al.",
              "analysing bite-forces with the use of regressions on body mass and applying the model of \"dry skull\" in which the jaw is modeled as a lever based in relations between the skull dimensions and the jaw muscles, was employed in some extinct and extant placental and metatherian predatory mammals.",
              "Thylacosmilus atrox reached the lowest value in that analysis, just barely surpassed by Smilodon fatalis.",
              "The authors concluded that both taxa, with low bite forces and peculiar cranial and postcranial anatomies, had a killing technique to dispatch large bodied prey without a true analogue between modern taxa.",
              "[27] An analysis by Goswami et al.",
              "in 2010 tested if the metatherian mode of reproduction has produced any constraint in their cranial morphological evolution.",
              "Using landmarks in the skulls of several eutherian and metatherian meat-eating lineages, they compared the ecomorphological convergences in these groups.",
              "Metatherian lineages, including specialised forms as Thylacoleo and Thylacosmilus, showed values in morphospace more similar to caniniforms than felids, due that even the shortening of the skull and reduction of postcanine teeth are not so drastic as in felids, despite them often being compared to feliform eutherians.",
              "The study shows that in any case, metatherians could be so diverse in cranial diversity as its eutherian counterparts, even with very extreme forms as Thylacosmilus itself and that the metatherian development doesn't have any significative role in cranial evolution.",
              "[28] A 2020 study found several functional disparities between Thylacosmilus's cranial anatomy and that of saber-toothed eutherians that cannot be explained by its metatherian status, such as the lack of a jaw symphysis, subtriangular canines instead of blade-like ones, lack of incisors (that would render feline-like feeding behaviours impossible), weak jaw musculature and unaligned teeth with no evidence of shearing activity, as well as a post-cranial skeleton more akin to that of a bear than a cursorial predator like a cat.",
              "This study very tentatively suggests that Thylacosmilus might have been an intestine specialist that slashed open and sucked up the carcass' entrails.",
              "[18] A 2021 statistical analysis conversely concluded that Thylacosmilus killed in the same manner as other sabre-tooths, because the premaxillary area, the carnassial region, and the nape of Smilodon, Homotherium, Barbourofelis, and Thylacosmilus are all similarly developed, which they presumed was to, respectively, withstand high bite forces, maximise gape, and strengthen neck-driven head pulling.",
              "Thylacosmilus scored closest to Barbourofelis.",
              "[29] An isotope ratio study, using stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen from the tooth enamel of several mammals from the Pampean region from the Late Miocene to Late Pleistocene, was published by Domingo et al.",
              "in 2020 and indicates that the favoured prey of Thylacosmilus were grazers, mainly notoungulates from open areas.",
              "This diet seems to coincide with the expansion of vast grasslands of C4 plants in southern South America and the increasing of aridity and lower temperatures, in the interval between 11 million and 3 million years ago known as Edad de las Planicies Australes (\"Age of the Southern Plains\", in Spanish).",
              "[30] Various studies have been published on the musculature and motion of Thylacosmilus.",
              "The analysis made by William Turnbull published in 1976[31] and 1978[16] included a reconstruction of the masticatory muscles of Thylacosmilus modelling them with plasticine over a cast of the skull and following the muscle scars on the surface of the fossil, then making a rubber model of the musculature and calculating the percentage of weight of these muscles compared with recent mammals, he concluded that the muscles involved in jaw closing in this animal were not unusual in size neither in form, compared with modern carnivore mammals, even indicating that they weren't so reduced as in the machairodont felids.",
              "Turnbull concluded that in Thylacosmilus these masticatory muscles was not involved at all in the use of the sabertooth canines, which depended of the large neck muscles and the flexion of the head to be used killing the prey, combining in a sense the stabbing and slashing techniques from \"dirk-toothed\" and \"scimitar\" sabertooths.",
              "[16] The comparative studies of Argot 2004, indicates that the basicranium had rugose crests that served as attachments for the neck flexor muscles, which are associated to the increase of the bite strength.",
              "The deltopectoral crest is large, with 60% of the length of the humerus, which is correlated with musculature to manipulate heavy prey.",
              "This animal had an absent entepicondylar foramen in the humerus, which is correlated with the reduction of the abduction movement in that bone in cursorial ungulates and carnivores (Borhyaena also show this condition), although it contrasts with its probable powerful adductor muscles.",
              "Although the lumbar vertebrae are not completely known, the two last ones are known and suggest for its vertical neural process that there is not an anticlinal vertebra;",
              "probably the muscles of the back (m.",
              "longissimus dorsi) acted to stabilize the column and contribute to body propulsion, as occurs in Smilodon, which contrast with more flexible backs of the closest relatives of these sabertooth taxa.",
              "[21] Based on studies of its habitat, Thylacosmilus is believed to have hunted in savanna-like or sparsely forested areas, avoiding the more open plains where it would have faced competition with the more successful and aggressive Phorusrhacids and the giant vulture-like Teratornithid Argentavis.",
              "[32] Fossils of Thylacosmilus have been found in the Huayquerian (Late Miocene) Ituzaingo\u0301, Epecue\u0301n, and Cerro Azul Formations and the Montehermosan (Early Pliocene) Brochero and Monte Hermoso Formations in Argentina.",
              "[33] Although older references have often stated that Thylacosmilus became extinct due to competition with the \"more competitive\" saber-toothed cat Smilodon during the Great American Interchange, newer studies have shown this is not the case.",
              "Thylacosmilus died out during the Pliocene (3.",
              "6 to 2.",
              "58 Ma) whereas saber-toothed cats are not known from South America until the Middle Pleistocene (781,000 to 126,000 years ago).",
              "[12] As a result, the last appearance of Thylacosmilus is separated from the first appearance of Smilodon by over one and a half million years."

              "New World porcupines are rodents (mammals) belonging to the family Erethizontidae, divided into 5 genera: Echinoprocta, Chaetomys, Erethizon, Coendou, and Sphiggurus.",
              "Old World porcupines are classed under the family Hystricidae.",
              "Part of the family Tachyglossidae, echidnas are egg-laying mammals (monotremes).",
              "Now, we\u2019ll address the difference in appearance between hedgehogs, porcupines, and echidnas.",
              "Most hedgehog species have bodies with a two-toned look.",
              "Typically, hedgehogs show a dark brown shade on their backs, but their underbellies and faces are a cream color.",
              "Their spikes are a mixture of brown and cream.",
              "The snout on a hedgehog is cone-shaped, not elongated like enchiladas or non-protruding like porcupines.",
              "Additionally, hedgehogs have tiny feet with almost no visible nails or claws.",
              "The body of a porcupine tends to be single color throughout its length, except for the highlights in the quills.",
              "It has a small head with a squared face featuring a non-protruding snout, unlike hedgehogs and echidnas.",
              "This slow-moving mammal has small eyes and ears.",
              "It has claws on its feet to help in climbing trees, but they\u2019re as strong or shape-adapted as echidnas\u2019 claws.",
              "The body of an echidna is a solid color all over with only the tips of its quills showing a light cream shade.",
              "This color scheme is similar to porcupines, but is easily distinguishable from the bi-color patterns of hedgehogs.",
              "Echidnas have larger feet than hedgehogs yet are comparable in size to those of porcupines.",
              "Unlike the other two species, however, echidnas possess five flattened claws on each of the front feet to support their lifestyle of digging, tearing, and scraping.",
              "They also have backward-curved claws on their hind legs to push the soil away while burrowing.",
              "One particular aspect that sets echidnas apart is their long and slender snouts that resemble an ant eater\u2019s snout.",
              "Now that you\u2019re familiar with the way each animal looks, we\u2019ll move on to the size.",
              "When we say size, we\u2019re referring to the length and weight of the animals.",
              "These parameters may not seem that big of a deal since most people believe that hedgehogs, porcupines, and echidnas are essentially the same size.",
              "However, you\u2019ll find the size to be a particularly differentiating factor between hedgehogs and the other two mammals\u2014and to a lesser yet still notable extent, between porcupines and echidnas as well.",
              "Here\u2019s a breakdown of the details: The average length of an adult hedgehog\u2019s body and head ranges between a minimum of 4 inches to a maximum of 12 inches.",
              "Their tails measure around 2 to 3 inches of extra length.",
              "As for how heavy hedgehogs are, the total body weight of an adult hedgehog ranges from 2 pounds up to 5 pounds.",
              "This makes them the most lightweight contender in today\u2019s comparison.",
              "The average length of an adult porcupine\u2019s body and head ranges between a minimum of 20 inches to a maximum of 36 inches.",
              "Additionally, their tails measure around 8 to 10 inches long.",
              "The total body weight of an adult porcupine ranges from a minimum of 10 pounds up to 35 pounds.",
              "As you can tell, porcupines can get pretty heavy compared to the other two members of the spiky squad.",
              "The average length of an adult echidna ranges from a minimum of 18 inches to a maximum of 30 inches.",
              "Their tails make for an extra length of around 3 or 4 inches.",
              "As for weight, echidnas range between 6 pounds to 22 pounds.",
              "They aren\u2019t nearly as lightweight as hedgehogs, but they can\u2019t get as heavy as porcupines.",
              "Next, let\u2019s have a closer look and the coat and quills on these pointy animals to see how they differ from one another.",
              "The compact body of a hedgehog has an average of 5,000 quills or spines covering its whole surface, except for the face and underbelly.",
              "This means it has the least number of spikes compared to porcupines or echidnas.",
              "The average length of the hedgehog\u2019s barbless quills (not rooted into the skin like in porcupines) is around 1 inch.",
              "The tips are a light cream creating a frosty look.",
              "Covering their bodies, porcupines have a dark undercoat layer with white or yellow guard hairs and yellow hollow quills on top.",
              "The soft, silky hair of a porcupine is paired with sharp quills, distributed across the back, sides, and tail.",
              "The quills of a porcupine are large in size and number compared to hedgehogs and echidnas.",
              "The average healthy porcupine can possess up to 30,000 quills throughout its body.",
              "Porcupines developed quills as a defense mechanism against predators by modifying hairs to become around 2 to 3 inches of stiff sharpness.",
              "In some species, such as the African Crested porcupine, the quills can grow over 1 foot long!",
              "When threatened, the quills of porcupines lower to a flat position before flaring out.",
              "If the quills make contact with another animal, they\u2019ll easily detach from the porcupine\u2019s body.",
              "Unlike porcupines with their 3-layered coats, echidnas have coats made up of 2 layers;",
              "a fur layer (colored black, honey, or reddish brown) and a spine/hair layer.",
              "Researchers are yet to provide an accurate estimation for the number of spines on an echidna, but they\u2019re no less than a few thousand.",
              "They do know, however, that their spines are barbless modified hairs made out of keratin.",
              "These spines cover the entire back and sides of an echidna\u2019s body, reaching the very top of the head.",
              "Echidnas have more spines than fur, where the latter provides insulation for the animal.",
              "Among the spines, you can find normal soft hairs.",
              "In this section, you\u2019ll discover the difference in location and origin of each of the three animals.",
              "Originally from Europe and the northern regions of Africa, you can now find wild hedgehogs in Asia, Eurasia, and South Africa too.",
              "As such, these animals are more widespread than echidnas, but comparable to porcupines.",
              "When it comes to their habitat preference, hedgehogs like to stay in wet or damp environments, such as coastal forests and moorlands.",
              "Native to North America, porcupines are also spread throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America.",
              "They\u2019re mostly concentrated in the western and northeastern regions of the United States.",
              "Although, they also appear in Canada and Alaska.",
              "Their habitat preference includes deserts, forests, hilltops, and rocky hillocks.",
              "Echidnas are only found in Australia and New Guinea.",
              "Places such as King Island, Flinders Island, Tasmania, and Kangaroo Island feature these animals in significant numbers too.",
              "As for their habitat preference, echidnas like to live in mountainous areas and high-elevation forests.",
              "They often seek shelter from harsh weather elements inside caves, cracks, and dense vegetation.",
              "In this section, we\u2019ll talk about the general temperament and behavior of today\u2019s prickly mammals.",
              "As an exclusively nocturnal species, hedgehogs are active at night.",
              "They don\u2019t borrow or dig into the ground for shelter.",
              "Instead, they build nests.",
              "This spiny creature generally leads a solo lifestyle, only seeking the company of its kind during the breeding season.",
              "These large rodents are slow movers due to their poor vision.",
              "Similar to hedgehogs, porcupines are nocturnal animals, so they\u2019re most active at night.",
              "When it\u2019s hot outside, porcupines will spend their time resting in trees.",
              "Although they aren\u2019t a territorial bunch, the home range of porcupines can stretch over an area of up to 200 acres.",
              "Unlike hedgehogs and echidnas, porcupines aren\u2019t solitary.",
              "They live in complex burrow systems where each family is made up of five to six individuals.",
              "Echidnas aren\u2019t exclusively nocturnal.",
              "Most of their species become nocturnal only during the summer to escape the day\u2019s heat.",
              "As avid burrows, echidnas will burrow into the ground to cool down when the temperatures are rising.",
              "Despite leading a solitary lifestyle, echidnas aren\u2019t territorial.",
              "They have no issues sharing habitats with other members of the same species.",
              "What happens when hedgehogs, porcupines, or echidnas feel threatened?",
              "This section will tell you.",
              "As a defense mechanism, hedgehogs curl their bodies into a ball with spines covering their exterior.",
              "Unlike hedgehogs and echidnas, porcupines don\u2019t roll up into a ball in risky situations.",
              "Instead, they puff up their backs and point their quills at the danger.",
              "They\u2019ll often pair this with tail waving so they can hit the predator with their quills.",
              "It\u2019s a misconception that porcupines shoot quills at threats.",
              "However, the quills will easily separate from their bodies and stick to the predator with the lightest touch.",
              "When they\u2019re faced with a potential predator, echidnas will curl their bodies into a ball of quills to deter unwanted touching.",
              "Do people keep any of these spiky animals as pets?",
              "Let\u2019s find out!",
              "More and more people are becoming interested in hedgehogs as pets.",
              "They\u2019re cute to look at, fun to interact with, and intriguing to observe.",
              "Compared to porcupines or echidnas, the quills on hedgehogs are much shorter and less dangerous.",
              "Additionally, unlike conventional pets, such as dogs and cats, hedgehogs offer a sense of being exotic and unique.",
              "Some folks keep porcupines as pets in states that allow such ownership.",
              "You should be skilled and patient enough to safely handle this spiky rodent before you even think about getting one as a pet.",
              "In countries where echidnas are found in the wild, it\u2019s prohibited for people to keep them as pets.",
              "Finally, let\u2019s see how long hedgehogs, porcupines, and echidnas tend to stick around.",
              "Compared to the other two mammals, hedgehogs have the shortest lifespan.",
              "In the wild, hedgehogs live between 3 to 8 years on average.",
              "In captivity, this range can be extended to reach 10 years.",
              "One of the longest-living species of rodents, porcupines usually live between 5 to 7 years in the wild.",

              "At 32 years old, Cooper the porcupine of the Museum of science is both the oldest recorded porcupine and the oldest recorded rodent.",
              "The average lifespan of an echidna in the wild is around 10 years.",
              "However, sometimes they can grow as old as 15 to 40 years!",
              "Generally speaking, the life expectancy of echidnas is a lot longer compared to that of porcupines.",

              "Hair is a defining feature of mammals: it is only found in mammals, and every mammal has hair at some point in its life.",
              "Over the course of mammalian evolution, hairs have been modified and specialized to perform many functions, including insulation, camouflage, signaling (to potential mates or potential predators), sensing (via whiskers or vibrissae), and defense.",
              "Some mammals have modified hairs that are enlarged, stiffened, and strengthened to form spikes of different shapes and sizes.",
              "These structures, called spines or sometimes quills, always have a thick, hard, outer tube of keratin (the fibrous protein that makes up all hair as well as claws, nails, and horn sheaths) and tapered, pointed tips.",
              "Beyond that basic design, however, the spines of different species are highly variable in size, shape, and function.",
              "Porcupine quills, for example, are different lengths over different parts of the body, fall out relatively easily, and break readily when bent, whereas hedgehog spines are the same length all over the body, are well embedded into the skin (\u201cyou can pick up a hedgehog by a single spine!",

              "Functionally, most spines serve as defense from predators, but spines are also important tools for communication, shock absorption, and rain protection.",
              "Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, \u201cspines\u201d and \u201cquills\u201d have slightly different definitions.",
              "\u201cSpine\u201d is a more general term for any hair that has been modified into a hardened, spiked structure, whereas quills are a specific type of spine.",
              "\u201cTrue\u201d quills have a spongy core and are found in echidnas as well as some rodents.",
              "Spines and quills evolved independently at multiple places and times in the mammal tree of life;",
              "thus, they are an example of convergence.",
              "The oldest mammal known to have enlarged, hardened hairs for defense is Pholidocerus, an extinct ancestor of the hedgehog that lived over 40 million years ago.",
              "However, hairs do not fossilize as readily as other structures like teeth and bones, so spines and quills may have evolved much earlier.",
              "Today, spines or quills are found in four major groups of living mammals: hedgehogs (Erinaceomorpha: Erinaceidae, Erinaceinae), tenrecs (Afrosoricida: Tenrecidae, Tenrecinae), echidnas (Monotremata: Tachyglossidae), and rodents (Rodentia).",
              "The latter group includes Old World and New World porcupines (Hystricidae and Erethizontidae, respectively), the spiny rats (Echimyidae), and the Old World rats and mice (Muridae), all of which have species with spiny pelage.",
              "Of all the spiny mammals, porcupines are perhaps the best known \u2013 and the most intimidating!",
              "There are two families of porcupine, the Old World porcupines (Hystricidae), which live in Europe, Africa, and Asia, and the New World porcupines (Erethizontidae), which live in North and South America.",
              "In both families the backs and sides of the porcupine are covered with true quills, which they erect and flare if predators approach too closely.",
              "Old World porcupines have short, flattened spines or bristles on the head, neck, feet, and belly, while the undersides of New World porcupines are covered in much softer fur.",
              "All baby porcupines (or porcupettes) are born with their quills, but the quills are too small and flexible to be very effective against predators until the porcupine is several months old.",
              "Porcupine quills are loosely rooted, so they detach easily when they are embedded in an attacker or when the porcupine shakes its body (although the popular myth that porcupines shoot quills at their enemies is not true).",

              "The reason that these quills are so dangerous becomes obvious at the microscopic level (Fig 1).",
              "The tips of each quill are incredibly sharp and able to pierce through skin more easily than an 18-gauge hypodermic needle (about the same size of the quill).",
              "Once it has entered the skin, its microscopic backward-facing barbs prevent the quill from being removed without causing significant pain and damage to surrounding tissues.",
              "To make matters worse, the quill tip breaks off easily so that it remains in the attacker, and it can work its way deeper and deeper into the skin over time with each muscle contraction or movement.",

              "Predators often keep their distance, however, because porcupines use a variety of aposematic signals, or warnings to enemies to stay away.",
              "The quills, especially those on the crest and rump, can be erected into an intimidating, spiny display with \u201cwhirring\u201d or fanning motions.",
              "The high-contrast black-and-white coloration of the quills, which is fully developed in New World porcupines at three months of age, may also provide a visual warning sign to their nocturnal, and often colorblind, predators.",
              "Old World porcupines may use acoustic aposematism as well.",
              "The terminal ends of their tails are covered in hollow, capsule-shaped quills 5 to 8 cm in length called \u201crattle quills\u201d which, as the name suggests, produce a rattling noise when vibrated.",
              "Tail rattling alone appears to deter most solitary predators, who have likely learned to match the rattling sound with pain.",
              "Unlike New World porcupines, the quills of Old World porcupines are unbarbed, although they are still quite sharp and capable of penetrating flesh.",
              "But how do porcupines protect themselves from being injured by their own quills?",
              "Indeed, many examples from scientific and anecdotal literature show that New World porcupines fall relatively frequently from trees, presumably forcing their own quills into their skin.",
              "One way that porcupines appear to limit self-injury is through natural antibiotics in their quills.",
              "Roze et al.",
              "(1989) found that the quills of New World porcupines are coated in fatty acids from exocrine secretions that prevent bacterial growth, likely to prevent infection from self-inflicted wounds.",
              "Spines offer a clear advantage to species like porcupines, whose quills are known to deter, and sometimes even kill, predators.",
              "However, the spines from the remaining rodent families (e.",

              "Structurally, the spines of echimyid rodents are not round but flattened and easily bent, and they are rarely aposematically colored.",
              "Many spinous species are preyed upon by snakes, birds, and other mammals, who do not seem to be deterred by the spines.",
              "Still, the spines likely provide some, albeit minimal, protection by serving as a passive suit of armor.",
              "Another hypothesis (Lekagul & McNeely 1977) is that the spines of many rodents function to protect against rain, which keeps insulating and guard hairs dry.",
              "Indeed, the armored rat (Hoplomys gymnurus), which has the largest and best-developed spines among the echimyid rodents, is abundant in very wet lowland forests in the Neotropics.",
              "Thermoregulation is very important for small mammals, which can lose body heat quickly, so spines may be critical for keeping these species dry and warm.",
              "Hedgehogs (Erinaceidae: Erinaceinae;",
              "Fig.",
              "2) are well known throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa for their distinctive coat of spines, which are sometimes called quills or \u201cprickles.",
              "\u201d Compared with New World porcupines, whose quills are barbed and vary in size and shape across the body, the spines of the hedgehog are unbarbed and more or less uniform.",
              "The spine tapers to a sharp point on the distal end, but it is bulbous where it grows out of the skin, which keeps the spine firmly embedded in the skin and not easily removed.",
              "Baby hedgehogs are born with their spines, but they are covered with a fluid-filled membrane to protect the mother during birth.",
              "Within a day, this covering shrinks, dries, and disappears to reveal about 150 white, flexible prickles.",
              "These spines are relatively soft at first, but they harden and darken over the first weeks of life and are eventually replaced with hard, adult spines via \u201cquilling,\u201d a process that occurs within the first six months.",
              "Because their spines are unbarbed and undetachable, hedgehogs do not actively defend themselves from predators like the porcupine does.",
              "The spines \u2013 over 5,000 on average \u2013 instead serve as passive body armor, and the hedgehog\u2019s best defense is to roll into an unappetizing ball.",
              "Rolling causes all of the spines to point outwards, and a powerful muscle called the orbicularis panniculi, located at the margin of the quill-fur interface, acts as a drawstring to keep the head, legs, and belly of the hedgehog tightly hidden within the impenetrable ball of spines and inaccessible to predators.",

              "The following year (1977), Edmund Brodie reported that hedgehogs use toxic secretions from toads to deter predators.",
              "The toxins are taken into the hedgehogs\u2019 mouths and transferred to their spines through licking, likely to increase pain in a would-be predator.",

              "The common names of tenrecs, like hedgehog tenrec, shrew tenrec, and mole tenrec, refer to their superficial resemblances to other mammals (although in reality they are more closely related to elephants and aardvarks than to their namesakes).",

              "While hedgehog tenrec spines are certainly used in defense and are also hypothesized to function both in anointing (Eisenberg & Gould 1970) and shock absorption (Vincent 1986), they may have another function: communication.",
              "During courtship and marking behaviors, Echinops often moves its body muscles rhythmically, causing its dorsolateral quills to rub against each other and produce a low sound.",

              "In adult common tenrecs, even after the stridulating organ disappears, the fur on that area of the back vibrates rapidly when individuals are threatened or scared.",
              "The stridulation sounds produced by tenrecs appear to be used solely for intra-species communication and not for warning predators, but the bright yellow and black stripes of spines in streaked tenrecs and juvenile common tenrecs may be aposematic -- a message to enemies to stay away!",

              "In other words, despite lacking common ancestors, they evolve similar characteristics to fit into a specific ecological niche.",
              "This form of evolution is often discussed with divergent evolution, which occurs when one species diverges into new species by developing variations in traits in response to environment and lifestyle.",
              "Many instances of convergent evolution make us curious about why and how species converge (or join) over time and develop certain abilities.",
              "Here, we take a look at some fascinating examples of this type of evolution.",
              "Homologous structures refer to two or more structures found in different species that originated from a common ancestor.",
              "Analogous structures, on the other hand, refer to structures in different species that are not from the same ancestor.",
              "All bats and birds \"converged\" on the ability of flight in response to environmental stimuli and biological goals.",
              "Rhe arm bones in both birds and bats are structurally the same and considered homologous.",
              "The wing shape, however, is what is convergent.",
              "Bat wings are flaps of skin stretched between bones, whereas birds have layers of feathers extending along their arms. These differences mean they came from different ancestors, but ultimately evolved the same ability to fly.",
              "Given their distinctive gliding capabilities, you would assume that flying lemurs and sugar gliders are closely related.",
              "Sugar gliders are marsupials and more closely related to kangaroos and koalas, whereas flying lemurs are \"placental mammals\" and actually closest to primates.",
              "Their \"wings\", however, are analogous structures that evolved independently of one another.",
              "Both have also evolved key characteristics suitable for treetop (arboreal) living and large eyes for seeing better in the dark (nocturnal)\u2014examples of convergent evolution allowing them to thrive within the same ecological niche.",

              "However, both sharks and dolphins adopted the same characteristics\u2014streamlined bodies, dorsal and pectoral fins, and flippers\u2014in order to swim fast and catch prey.",
              "Fins function much like hands, and while dolphins are distantly related to mammals with hands, sharks are not, thus their fins would have come from a very different genetic source.",

              "The carnivorous pitcher plants Nepenthaceae and Sarraceniaceae both have pitfall traps, which lure insects in either with nectar, bright colors, or both.",
              "They source minerals like nitrogen and phosphorous from the animals they consume.",

              "They have prehensile tails, which allow them to grasp objects and hang from trees.",
              "Marsupial opossums can also do this with their tails, except they're not primates.",
              "They're marsupials, which means their babies are raised in a pouch on the mother's belly, like a kangaroo.",
              "Opossums are also the only non-primate to have opposable big toes, giving it unique agility.",
              "While Astrophytum is a genus of species of cacti, Euphorbia obesa is related to poinsettias more than it is cacti.",
              "Still, both have evolved to be able to conserve water in hot desert climates.",
              "The two often appear together in succulent gardens, with many of their caretakers unaware of the differences because, at first glance, they look so similar.",
              "Both store water in swollen stems, grow spines, and come in a variety of shapes and sizes.",
